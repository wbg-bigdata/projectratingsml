I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The project was developed as Solomon Islands emerged from three years of
serious civil conflict and three years of “emergency recovery? to a medium-term
development program. At the time of appraisal, the Solomon Islands Government (SIG)
was paying increased attention to medium-term strategy and planning at both the national
and sectoral levels. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) had prepared:
(a) its strategy document – The National Health Strategic Plan 2006-2010 (NHSP) with
eight priority areas 1; and subsequently, (b) the Health Sector Support Program (HSSP) 2 a
more detailed program designed to operationalize the NHSP with support of
Development Partners (DPs).

2.      The initial intention for HSSP was to have a pooled funding arrangement under a
sector wide approach (SWAp). Significant staff weeks were committed to shaping this
design with SIG, AusAID and other DPs (refer Annex 4b). However, after two years of
project preparation, agreement could not be reached on fiduciary assessments and related
requirements so HSSP was designed as an over-arching program with complementary
financing of a single sector program led by the Government and in coordination with
several DPs. Challenges for getting the health sector back onto a sustainable medium-
term development path included that DPs financed about 50 percent of both total and
recurrent sector expenditures, and concerns about the technical quality of health services
and capacity of the health system to deliver services effectively and efficiently.

3.       Several aspects of HSSP required further development, specifically, the sector’s
overall resource allocation picture was not clear. The initial partial Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) developed as part of preparation of the HSSP did not
reflect the full sector envelope (government plus donors) and the government had yet to
revise expenditure priorities to allocate health resources in alignment with its strategy. In
addition, the possibilities for efficiency gains, equity concerns and the sustainability of
sector financing had yet to be fully explored. There was an unclear division of
responsibility between provinces and national programs. Finally, the monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) framework needed to identify a core set of key performance indicators
to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and sustainability dimensions of sector
performance.

4.      This context provided the rationale for Bank support through a Technical
Assistance (TA) Grant to improve the capacity of the MHMS in the selected areas of
public expenditure management, de-concentration of services to provincial managers,
sector performance monitoring, and management training. It was agreed that such
capacity development would be critical to the overall success of the HSSP and that

  The Solomon Islands National Health Strategic areas were: (i) people focus; (ii) public health programs; (iii) malaria;
(iv) common childhood diseases; (v) non-communicable diseases; (vi) HIV/AIDS and STIs; (vii) family planning and
reproductive health; and (viii) health systems strengthening.
2
  The HSSP focus areas were: (i) community focus; (ii) priority health programs; and (iii) health system strengthening.

                                                            1
assistance with the development of key building blocks for the medium-term
development of the health sector was critical. Furthermore, the Bank’s sectoral expertise
and experience in sector wide operations and fragile and post-conflict countries were
considered of value by the client and the key DPs.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      The PDO was to improve the institutional capacity of MHMS in the areas of
public expenditure management and sector performance monitoring. This was critical to
the overall success of the HSSP in improving health services delivery and outcomes. The
PDO indicators were: (i) completion of the first rolling MTEF; (ii) increase in the
proportion of health sector budget expended at provincial level and on primary health
care services; (iii) completion of a health facility survey and use of the results to improve
health sector planning; and (iv) quality, participatory annual joint sector reviews
conducted on schedule.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.     No revisions were made to the PDO during the mid-term review. Two
intermediate indicators were added to the results framework to better monitor PDO
achievement.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      The primary target groups were stakeholders at both the national and provincial
level. Key beneficiaries at the national level were to be MHMS executive, finance and
planning staff through enhancing their capacity in public expenditure management and
monitoring of the health sector. Provincial level managers would be better equipped to
plan ahead and to work within a more predictable resource envelope to more effectively
allocate and manage resources to improve provincial level health outcomes.

8.      Secondary beneficiaries, in the form of health service users, were expected to
benefit through the positive impact of the project on the HSSP with its focus on: (i)
communities; (ii) reorientation of public health resources away from the center to the
provinces; and (iii) emphasis on improving the equity of health outcomes.

1.5 Original Components

9.       Component 1: Public Expenditure Management (US$545,000) aimed to: (a)
support strengthening of MHMS (national and provincial) health planning and budgeting
systems and procedures; and (b) build on work done during preparation to ensure
priorities were set within a known resource envelope and linked to expected results. The
focus was on:
(i) completing and updating the health sector MTEF annually;
(ii) strengthening provincial planning and budgeting procedures and monitoring;
(iii) improving understanding of the costs and efficiency of health facilities; and
(iv) increasing community and household engagement in health care.


                                             2
10.      Component 2: Sector Performance Monitoring (US$382,000) aimed to support
the MHMS to develop the M&E framework for the HSSP covering the key dimensions of
sector performance (effectiveness, quality, efficiency, equity, and sustainability) and
integrate M&E into sector management. The component aimed to enable the MHMS to
better track achievement of NHSP objectives, and to provide feedback through the annual
budget planning and review processes so adjustments in resource allocation were linked
to priorities. This would enable improved sector policy and management decisions based
on evidence. This information would facilitate the annual joint sector (HSSP) review
process and meetings of MHMS and DPs.

11.     Component 3: Training and Capacity Building (US$523,000) aimed to
strengthen the management capacity of MHMS, including provincial managers to be
more effective in work program planning and execution.

1.6 Revised Components

12.       There were no formal revisions to the main Project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

13.     Producing the new NHSP 2011-2015 (new NHSP) was a new activity which was
achieved by combining existing elements from the project components. It was fully
consistent with the objective of developing capacity to ensure expenditure priorities
reflect desired efforts to improve health services delivery.

14.     Closing Date Extensions. The closing date was formally extended for nineteen
months in August 2010 from March 31, 2011 to December 31, 2011 primarily due to the
significantly delayed start-up of the project. This enabled key project activities to be
implemented and the PDO to be more fully achieved.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.    The overall quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on the
following assessment:
(i) the soundness of the background analysis - initial project preparation activities
    focused on trying to forge an AusAID-International Development Association (IDA)
    pooled financing model for sector support with all DPs supporting and signing a
    Joint Partnership Agreement with MHMS. The joint donors, particularly the Bank
    and AusAID, supported a strong preparation effort to develop the key building
    blocks for pooled financing under a SWAp 3. While initial analysis had suggested the



3
  Relevant project preparation activities included: (i) a health sector strategy note; (ii) a qualitative study of health care
decision making in the Solomon islands; (iii) an initial but partial health MTEF; (iv) a health expenditure review; (v) a

                                                              3
      key building blocks for a SWAp were present (i.e. sound sector priorities; SIG
      ownership; agreement on desirability of pooled financing; and initial relatively
      positive fiduciary and procurement assessments) experience gained during
      preparation indicated it was not possible to gain consensus within SIG or with DPs
      on how to proceed on all fronts. Specifically, project preparation had taken two
      years; leadership within the MHMS had changed and was less committed to pooled
      funding; the central agencies became concerned about their capacity to manage the
      financial/fiduciary aspects of the project; and there was inadequate DP support for
      procurement and financial management processes acceptable to the Bank. A pooled
      fund SWAp model for the project was finally rejected in favor of a TA Loan/Grant
      (TAL), where SIG and key DPs adopted a model of complementary (parallel)
      financing of a single sector program led by SIG. This was an appropriate decision
      and fully consistent with the lessons learnt from the previous Bank-supported SIG
      Health Sector Development Project and other sector projects throughout the region.
      The main constraints to improving the health sector lay in resource allocation,
      management capacity, and a lack of effective performance monitoring. The project
      was designed to specifically address these gaps in the existing HSSP;
(ii) the suitability of project design - was appropriate to meet sector needs as identified
     during project preparation. The objectives and components of the project were
     clearly identified by MHMS and DPs as strategic building blocks for both health
     sector development and to enable a pooled SWAp to be developed in the future – a
     continuing objective of both SIG and DPs. Importantly, SIG remained committed to
     their leadership of one HSSP program supported by DPs and the project design
     supported this. The focus of the project was on the development of core government
     systems (particularly provincial budgeting, sector expenditure planning and
     budgeting, and an M&E framework) that would assist HSSP implementation, and
     make a full SWAp feasible. A SWAp, all parties agreed, held out the prospects of
     reducing sector transaction costs while still driving for immediate results,
     particularly reallocation of resources towards expressed priorities. The final design
     recognized that DPs needed to learn to work collectively in support of one program
     and MHMS would also need to lead a collective effort in support of the HSSP. The
     final TAL design significantly reduced the range of Bank safeguard policies
     involved compared to the initial approach (e.g. environmental and land
     acquisition/involuntary resettlement policies) and reduced the scale of financial
     expenditure and procurement oversight;
(iii) the adequacy of participatory approaches and government commitment- the
      joint World Bank and AusAID preparation and design missions facilitated extensive
      consultations with ministers, senior SIG officials, national and provincial MHMS
      staff, key health sector stakeholders, and DPs. There was strong participation of
      MHMS program directors jointly with provincial directors and some of their staff.
      Church agencies providing health services and health-related Non-Government
      Organizations (NGOs) also participated in project planning sessions. These
      discussions confirmed ongoing support from SIG and key stakeholders for the HSSP



report on annual planning and budgeting system; (vi) a review of hospital services and their management; and (vii) a
review of pharmaceutical services, procurement and distribution arrangements

                                                          4
    framework. The MHMS increasingly recognized the need to work more closely with
    provinces and NGOs – a positive achievement of the preparation process; and
(iv) the approach to risk and mitigation - the overall project risk was rated as high
     given the country and sector contexts. The assessments were realistic ratings of the
     risks and the identified mitigation measures appropriate.

2.2 Implementation

16.    Overall implementation progress is rated Moderately Satisfactory as SIG was able
to make reasonable progress implementing most activities by the end of the Project (as
outlined in more detail in Annex 2). This was despite major changes in the MHMS
senior management team during the project lifecycle, and the ongoing capacity
challenges of a small workforce in a resource constrained environment.

17.     Project leadership and staffing had a significant impact on implementation.
During the first year of the project senior MHMS management were in a state of
uncertainty about their future and this reduced focus on the project in the initial start-up
phase. In the second quarter of 2009, a new Health Minister, Permanent Secretary, and
an almost completely new MHMS senior management ‘executive’ team were appointed.
The new executive was initially unclear about the project, its objectives, and
implementation arrangements and how this worked with the HSSP and a major new
AusAID funded parallel malaria project. Once the arrangements were clarified the new
MHMS executive endorsed the project and its objectives but also requested support for:
(i) management mentoring; and (ii) developing the new NHSP 2011-2015. The Bank
agreed to support this as it was fully consistent with project objectives. MHMS engaged
a senior health policy advisor to support: (a) a participatory planning approach for the
new NHSP; (b) development of an M&E framework for the sector; and (c) on-demand
management mentoring advice to the executive. This, together with the work of the
MHMS-appointed financial management specialist under the project, proved decisive and
reenergized implementation. This work linked expenditure management and M&E to
revised health sector priorities through a participatory process for strategic planning
involving provincial and program managers, NGO partners and DPs.

18.      Fiduciary capacity was the other major factor influencing project implementation;
this is outlined in more detail in section 2.4.

19.     Beyond immediate project fiduciary concerns, some technical aspects of
provincial budget structures (chart of accounts) and processes, controlled by the central
agencies were outside the control of MHMS, and proved more difficult than anticipated
at appraisal. This made the separation of hospital and primary health care programs at
the provincial level more difficult, adversely affecting some aspects of the desired budget
reporting and provincial planning processes within MHMS. This remains a work in
progress, but capacity developed under the project will enable MHMS to adjust to and
reap the gains of these wider reforms when implemented.

20.     The Mid Term Review reconfirmed the PDO and expanded the results framework
to better monitor on-going activities. The MHMS executive indicated it had come to
understand better the effective use of TA. TORs and Bank dialogue with the executive

                                             5
emphasized the desirability of TA to undertake “process? rather than “task? consulting.
Using this ‘learning by doing’ process approach enabled the staff of MHMS to undertake
the work themselves within strategic frameworks/ government systems. The new NHSP
support (including the M&E design) and financial management assistance used this
approach and it is likely this will improve sustainability of the project post completion.
Key staff sent on training, including degree level training for one officer, will also assist
in this regard, although continued staff mobility within MHMS remains a problem.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design
21.     Project monitoring was designed to be undertaken within the M&E framework of
the overall health sector which was to be developed further under the project. This was
developed in draft only late in the project as part of the new NHSP and is now being
refined after discussion at the September 2011 MHMS/DP sector meeting. Major efforts
are now underway to reinvigorate the health management information system (HMIS) to
supply the desired monitoring data. The MHMS decided not to seek support to design
and implement a balanced score card for provincial and national health programs (a
project activity) but rather to focus on the overall HSSP M&E framework.

22.     Some project indicators relied on qualitative information which were not well
specified and/or easily collected (e.g. increased community participation in planning at
provincial levels, executive making decisions based on M&E reports, percent of
provincial health plans implemented) and others turned out to be more difficult to
measure because of chart of accounts issues (e.g. separation of hospitals from primary
health care) which required considerable reworking of accounts which was achieved
mid-project with considerable effort.

M&E Implementation
23.     The project envisioned that participatory joint annual reviews (with SIG and DPs)
of the HSSP would take place to monitor sector performance. This was an agreed
“building block? for the SWAp. To reduce transaction costs, it was agreed that MHMS
would not prepare separate M&E systems or reports for individual DPs. The Joint
Annual Performance Reviews would discuss the progress of the health system and health
indicators and their quality. Notwithstanding the delays in finalization of the M&E
framework, the existing (partial) framework was used for the ongoing sector monitoring.
The biggest constraint was the availability of data from the HMIS which faced long
standing technical constraints processing health facility data. This is now being fixed as
proposed by the M&E framework and it is expected that real time data will become
available in July 2012. A Demographic and Health Survey 2007 (DHS) and analytical
work undertaken by the Bank on health financing options 4 drawing on the Household
Income and Expenditure Survey provided key sector performance benchmarks and
helped frame dialogue on the new NHSP and M&E framework.

24.     The project results framework did not work as originally planned. The agreed
benchmarks for a number of project indicators were not able to be monitored as intended.
Nevertheless, the MHMS executive did monitor key aspects of the project and MHMS
staff willingly undertook dialogue with the World Bank team and other DPs on the
sector’s progress, including that of the project. A key project M&E process adopted was
by reporting through review missions and documentation within relevant aides memoire.
Bank aides memoire became the “de facto? DP report on sector performance and Bank
project progress, and was used as such by the MHMS executive and DPs.

M&E Utilization
25.     The M&E draft framework developed for the new NHSP was only developed in
late 2011 just prior to project completion. Nevertheless, the MHMS undertook annual
sector reviews based on available data from project inception. Presentations by program
managers and provincial managers at the Joint Annual Performance Reviews indicated
they had at times, significant high quality data not reflected in the formal HMIS data
bases, that: (a) underpinned their decision making on service priorities; and (b) informed
dialogue between MHMS and DPs.

26.     Available HMIS data, the World Bank Health Financing Options Note, the DHS
2007, and a situational analysis prepared by MHMS and DP/MHMS dialogue
underpinned the decision making on the new NHSP and many HSSP decisions. The
voice given to provincial managers through their participation in these processes also led
to demands for change of national program priorities. This process also made decision
making more transparent and contestable. Provincial and national program managers
believe it also positively influenced annual planning and budgeting processes, an
intended outcome of the project. While it is hard to demonstrate the extent of all the
program priority changes as yet, the proportion of expenditures on primary health
services increased from 17 percent to 29 percent (target 22 percent) and the portion of
provincial spending is planned to increase while national programs decrease. The new
NHSP outlines both significant reforms on program priorities and of organizational and
management priorities. Increased commitment by MHMS to evidence-informed policy
making, reinforced and buttressed by a range of project activities and agreements, is a
significant outcome of the project. The MHMS executive fully recognizes this is both a
new approach and that the processes will need to continue to be reinforced by DPs under
the HSSP.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement
27.    This was rated a “high risk? at appraisal and an action program was agreed, most
of which were upfront actions (procurement plan, high levels of prior review, on-going
procurement advisory support, and a procurement manual). Provision was also made for
upfront and on-going procurement training. Nevertheless, significant procurement delays
emerged from the outset of the project and overall procurement performance was rated as
“moderately unsatisfactory?.

28.     Limited experience and capacity in a very small team was the major constraint
within the procurement unit (the two staff involved had changed since the previous Bank


                                             7
project). Management understanding and direction on the procurement processes,
particularly in the early years of implementation, was limited. Continued staff mobility
within the procurement unit and within the executive exacerbated these capacity
constraints. Although MHMS had agreed to recruit an international procurement advisor
for the period of the project (financed by AusAID under HSSP), MHMS was not able to
attract and retain a suitably qualified specialist for the required timeframe. When a
procurement advisor was appointed nine months after effectiveness, there was a
misunderstanding about the advisor’s role in assisting the MHMS with Bank-financed
project procurement. This significantly constrained the ability of MHMS to complete on
a timely basis the initial procurement actions, including for two key advisors. The Bank
subsequently responded to a MHMS request for assistance by initiating more intensive:
(a) implementation support, including for procurement; and (b) joint dialogue with DPs
and MHMS on implementation and performance monitoring. The Bank also reached a
new agreement with MHMS and AusAID on continued procurement advisory support,
and one member of the executive was made responsible for procurement to prevent
continued procurement delays. Nonetheless, procurement delays throughout the project
were significant, resulting in the initial two major TA positions being filled 16 months
after project effectiveness, and the first disbursement occurring 24 months after
effectiveness (although some expenditure had been pre-financed by MHMS).

Financial Management and Auditing
29.     Financial management of project accounts was rated as “moderately
unsatisfactory? or “unsatisfactory? throughout its life, with incomplete or typically
misplaced filing of paperwork on project files. Again, limited capacity in a small team
was the main constraint. Project accounts were audited by the Government’s Auditor
General. The audit for the period ending 31 December 2010 was over nine months late
and was qualified by exception; the qualification did not identify a material misstatement
of the financial statements. The final audit is due in June 2012. Interim Financial Reports
were submitted late and then often needed further work to satisfy World Bank financial
management requirements. Withdrawal applications were often delayed even though
expenditures had been incurred (the government pre-financed project expenditures). A
key staff member took long-term study leave and this further delayed withdrawal
applications at one point. MHMS appointed a part time financial management specialist
to assist with broader sectoral budget and accounting work under the project, and this
also helped to improve the project disbursement process and capacity through training
and technical support. Financial management support from the Bank’s fiduciary
implementation support team was limited, and not well co-ordinated with broader Bank
implementation support missions. During the last quarter of the project, the MHMS hired
a new experienced Finance Controller to buttress the MHMS finance team; this has been
an important step to improving management capacity and oversight in this core area.

30.    The project did not trigger any safeguards policies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.    The Bank, MHMS and AusAID together with other DPs are actively discussing
an ongoing work program to support the health sector. There is a consensus and
commitment to improving the implementation and results focus of the HSSP with an


                                            8
emphasis on how best to implement the strategic directions of the new NHSP. MHMS
has committed to a work program to further improve sector governance and
organizational reform. This includes coordination of technical cooperation, finalization
of a role delineation policy to define the range of services across the country,
improvements to financial and procurement management, including at the provincial
level, and strengthening sector M&E.

32.     In the immediate future the World Bank team plans to support MHMS through a
Bank executed Trust Fund arrangement for the Pacific. Initially, this will finance further
health expenditure analysis and assist with updating the MTEF, including setting out and
tracking provincial funding allocations and expenditure in line with the directions set out
in the new NHSP. Other areas, including health workforce issues, costing and efficiency
analysis of national and provincial hospitals, options for public-private partnerships, and
a health services plan for Honiara are under discussion. There will also be continued
support to improve budget planning, preparation and execution at provincial and national
levels. The Bank is currently recruiting an experienced health economist to be based in
the Bank’s Honiara office. Although the position will have regional responsibilities, this
will be a significant additional commitment by the Bank to sustain its work on the health
sector in the Solomon Islands.

33.     These efforts are fully consistent with the proposed focus on service delivery
under the new Country Partnership Strategy being developed by the WB and SIG. The
Bank and other DPs are also assisting SIG with a financial management reform program.
This will assist with improving the relationship between central agencies and sectors and
potentially set the basis for a health sector focus under a possible next phase of budget
support provided under a SIG/WB Development Policy Grant. There may also be scope
with these reforms, to explore a future health specific grant using the WB ‘Programming
for Results’ instrument focused on improving service delivery at the provincial level.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34.      The PDO: to improve the institutional capacity of MHMS in the areas of public
expenditure management and sector performance monitoring continue to be relevant to
both current sector and country priorities and remain consistent with the Bank’s Interim
Strategy Note FY 2010-2012 (ISN) for Solomon Islands – a strategic pillar of which
includes: “supporting improved public administration and management.? The new NHSP
2011-2015, developed with project support, reaffirms the need to focus on: (a) health
priorities based on evidence; (b) further de-concentration of health program expenditures
and management, including provincial planning and budgeting, to get resources to where
they are needed most; (c) overall financial management; (d) M&E; and (e) continued
updates of the MTEF to underpin improved focus on expenditure priorities and
efficiencies. The MHMS Corporate Plan 2011-2015 reiterates these points. This policy
focus is fully consistent with the PDO. Project components remained relevant to the
needs of the MHMS and targeted clearly identified priorities in the overarching HSSP.
Sector stakeholders supported HSSP objectives, particularly as refined and included in
the new NHSP.


                                             9
35.     The project design, including its framing within the context of joint efforts to
establish a health sector SWAp, remained consistent with Bank priorities through both
the World Bank’s Regional Engagement Framework FY 2006-2009 (which highlighted
the importance of improving the effectiveness of public expenditure in the social sectors
through strategic partnerships with key DPs); and in the ISN, which recognizes that
changes in administrative arrangements and management of public resources are essential
to improved service delivery. DPs, as outlined in section 7b, also strongly supported the
focus and continued relevance of the key objectives and activities of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
ICR Rating: Achievement of PDO is Moderately Satisfactory.

36.     Project Outcome Indicator 1: Completion of Medium Term Expenditure
Framework. A substantial draft was completed in 2010 and a final initial MTEF was
produced by MHMS in 2011. Although the MTEF was significantly delayed it is now
completed and informing dialogue on: (i) strategic resource allocation priorities; and (ii)
incremental recurrent costs of sector investments and hence the fiscal sustainability of the
program. The first annual update is planned for third quarter 2012.The MHMS
recognizes this is the only source of detailed “whole of sector? health expenditure and its
financing as the development budget processes are weak and do not provide complete
pictures of sector expenditures. Thus the MTEF also greatly assists policy dialogue and
dramatically improves the transparency of health expenditures and their financing. The
central agencies are now beginning to develop a “whole of government? MTEF process
so there is increased reason to believe the MTEF process will become institutionalized.

37.    Project Outcome Indicator 2: Increase from 17%, the proportion of health
sector expenditure on primary health services and provincial health programs. The
proportion of health sector expenditure on primary health services and provincial health
programs has increased from 17% (estimated base at appraisal) to 29% for FY11 (target
22%). (Source: Final MTEF 2011)

38.      Project Outcome Indicator 3: Completion of Health Facility Survey. This
survey was not undertaken as planned (see Annex 2). The MHMS delayed its initiation
due to: (i) concerns about sequencing of other work and their capacity constraints; (ii)
overlap with another AusAID study of infrastructure needs; and (iii) proposals from
UNICEF to undertake a costing study using the tool Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks
(later rejected by MHMS). Finally, MHMS decided, as a result of policy dialogue, to
proceed with hospital and facility costing/survey work in the last year of the project.
However, delayed procurement actions meant this work was not commissioned on a
timely basis. Confirming the on-going relevance of this activity the MHMS is pursing
options with DPs to finance a similar survey(s) now (see 2.5 above).

39.    Project Outcome Indicator 4: Joint Annual Performance Reviews. Joint
Annual Sector Performance Reviews are now held annually with the participation of
Provincial Health Directors, program managers, DPs, NGOs, and faith-based
organizations. Although the quality of the review processes and data availability varied
considerably over the project period, the trend was in the right direction with the


                                            10
2011review enabling MHMS and DPs to jointly reflect on the gains of the health sector
and to identify specific areas for improvement (also supported by the first MTEF). The
operationalization of the HMIS will also greatly improve the quality of this process in the
future.

40.      Component 1: Public Expenditure Management. This component focused on
improving sector resource allocation planning and expenditure management and efforts to
de-concentrate to the provincial level consistent with sector priorities. The aim was for:
(i) the percentage of planned activities completed increased from 60% to 75% - this
indicator was inadequately specified and not monitored quantitatively. However
provincial health staff have indicated improved satisfaction with planning within budget
constraints and recognized some difficulties in fully implementing planned activities; (ii)
increased community participation in provincial health services planning - the level of
beneficiary/stakeholder participation in the development of both the new NHSP and of
provincial operational plans has been significant. Efforts intended to extend this down to
facility level has been problematic and remain a challenge – constrained by over
stretched provincial managers. Nevertheless, the achievements on stakeholder
participation should not be underestimated, including getting Provincial Premiers and
community groups involved in planning and monitoring discussions; (iii) the health
facility survey to be completed and analyzed - this did not proceed as discussed in
paragraph 38 although alternative data sources (including the health financing note)
provided some important insights; and (iv) (added at mid-term review) budget planning,
development and accounting processes enhanced and institutionalized - annual provincial
and national operational plans with SIG and DP budgets are now developed routinely,
and accounting of expenditures on MYOB now allows separation of hospital and primary
health care at the provincial level.

41.     Component 2: Sector Performance Monitoring. This component focused on
improving the sector performance monitoring system. To this end the component
envisaged: (i) development of a comprehensive M&E framework - this was developed as
part of the new NHSP and identifies agreed priority indicators for key programs and for
organizational and management reforms and details the baseline, target, source and
frequency of data to be collected. Financial management, macroeconomic and
microeconomic indicators are detailed in operational plans and the MTEF; (ii) MHMS
executive would make decisions based on M&E reports - the MHMS executive has been
increasingly making informed evidence-based decisions based on a range of assessments
including the MTEF and monitoring data generated from program and provincial
operational plans. The new NHSP was based on quantitative and qualitative data
generated from a situational assessment and from available M&E data. The evidence
based process will be improved when the HMIS and the M&E framework is fully
operational in 2012. Evaluative work, including the MTEF and the Bank generated
Health Financing Options Paper, also informed decision making. The NHSP Planning
and Evaluation Advisor provided strategic mentoring advice and guidance to the MHMS
executive team on the critical importance of M&E; (iii) the use of balanced scorecards
for provinces and national programs - these were not progressed as it was not deemed a
priority under the new leadership of the MHMS; and (iv) (added at mid-term review)
provincial planning process including medium term plan and operational planning
system adopted with strong M&E framework - provincial health plans with clear targets


                                            11
and indicators have been developed with support from the planning team but the medium
term plan process still remains fragile.

42.     Component 3: Training and Capacity Building. This component focused on
improving the human capacity in the health sector. It was envisaged that this would be
monitored by: (i) self-assessment by trained provincial health directors 3 months after
completion of management training - formal training was limited due to high workloads,
frequent overseas travel, and the availability of a significant number of alternate
sponsorships. No formal self-assessments were made although those attending the Bank
sponsored Health Systems Flagship course indicated it underpinned their sense of the
usefulness of the MTEF (because it set out total expenditures and how they were
financed), setting priorities, M&E and the importance of planning within a budget
constraint; and (ii) the increased share of provincial health plans implemented -
significant progress has been made in developing provincial plans and budgets, however
quantitative monitoring was inadequate. Some provinces have reported difficulties with
implementing all planned activities particularly when they were developed without
reference to budget constraints. Progress reports to be submitted in second quarter of
2012 will better identify the challenges faced by the provincial teams.

43.      While performance is mixed, outputs under these components have contributed
towards achieving the PDO. The budgeting system, particularly at provincial level, is
now more firmly established and disaggregated to show separate primary health care and
hospital expenditures. Managers now plan within a relatively stable and known resource
envelope and budget execution is monitored on a regular basis. On a number of
occasions, project outputs helped MHMS to argue with some success an evidence-based
case when SIG proposed budget reductions due to broader fiscal issues. MHMS has
noted that it could not have made these achievements without the project.

3.3 Efficiency

44.     The project appraisal did not undertake a cost-benefit or other formal analysis of
cost-effectiveness. On this basis, the ICR has not undertaken a cost benefit analysis.
Nevertheless, the appraisal did assert that the project would: (a) assist to improve
allocative efficiency of health expenditure by aligning allocations to priority needs; (b)
improve the technical efficiency of health expenditures by providing the tools and
improved information; and (c) improve equity in resource use by providing information
to form the basis of reallocating resources to improve regional equality.

45.     The project has been partially successful in this (increased resources were
allocated to primary health care and to provinces) and the new NHSP strongly commits
the MHMS to improved allocative efficiency. The MTEF has demonstrated the scale of
the challenge to redirect both domestic and DP sector financing towards agreed priorities.
The MTEF, for the first time documents the “whole of sector? expenditure program and
how it is financed. Sector analytical work undertaken by the Bank has shown that access
to health is remarkably equal in Solomon Islands compared to most countries with a
similar income. However, work at the provincial level shows that on a per capita basis,
health resources are unequally distributed. Analytical work generated by the project was



                                            12
used by MHMS to reallocate provincial grants on a more equitable basis. The challenge
will be to reallocate staffing according to need.

46.     The health facility work to estimate unit costs and service indicators would have
added to the richness of the information available to inform decision making. However,
this activity was not progressed as the new NHSP was given precedence by MHMS. It is
clear that MHMS and all DPs now see the benefit of this costing information and some of
this will be included under future support.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

47.     The overall rating is based on the continued relevance of the objectives and the
extent to which they were achieved. Project objectives remain highly relevant to the
current strategic priorities of Solomon Islands and the World Bank. MHMS used the
project to set a sound foundation for ongoing sector development through (a) the new
NHSP which defines MHMS’ overall aims and M&E arrangements for the next five
years; (b) completion of the first MTEF; and (c) strengthening of the provincial planning
and budgeting. These elements have helped identify and improve allocative efficiency of
health expenditures (in a situation where details of total “whole of sector? expenditures
were not known) and increased the overall policy dialogue between SIG and DPs on core
sector priority issues.

48.      The specific outcomes and outputs of the project are documented in Annex 2.
Despite delays the MTEF was finally completed and will be continued on a rolling basis.
It will continue to support planning within realistic resource envelops at national and
provincial level. The new NHSP with its strategic priorities and M&E framework has
very strong ownership within MHMS and with SIG more generally. Provincial planning
and budgeting capacity has been developed considerably – including finding a way to
meaningfully disaggregate expenditures between primary health and hospital care at the
provincial level. Provincial primary health care expenditures have reached 29 percent of
expenditures up from 17 percent and over the target of 22 percent. Formal joint
MHMS/DP annual performance reviews are now conducted routinely. The MHMS and
DPs will, in the future be able to use the M&E framework, supported by the improved
HMIS data, about to come on line. Considerable training, including planning workshops
with a “learning by doing? approach as with the new NHSP and the development of
budget and accounting systems were very successful. Planning and budget execution
have been strengthened – albeit from a very low base.

49.     Given the thin capacity in this small post conflict country these achievements are
considerable. Nonetheless, it is recognized that more could have been done to prevent
and manage delays. MHMS recognizes they need additional support moving forward and
this will be provided through new World Bank and other DPs assistance.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

50.     Bank analytical work showed access to health services by the poor was quite
equitable compared to other low income country. Work under the project led to
important adjustments on provincial equity grounds in the distribution of national grants
to provinces as a result of work undertaken under the project. The new NHSP has a
reasonably strong gender focus with its increased focus on mother and child health and
family planning. Disaggregated data by sex is a key feature of the M&E framework and
MHMS actively supports training opportunities for women. The process of producing
the new NHSP involved provincial premiers, community and NGO stakeholders which
was a noted improvement on previous efforts. Annual provincial planning is increasingly
involving communities although this needs further strengthening – including additional
support to overstretched provincial directors.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

51.     Strengthening the capacity of the MHMS to effectively manage and monitor
health expenditure and outcomes is the main aspect of the PDO. Important progress has
been made on this but all parties recognize that the institutional development and
strengthening has been moderately satisfactory as it takes a long time in fragile states
with weak systems to develop capacity. It has to be recognized that the existing
inadequate development budget processes mean sectors (and SIG) do not have an
accurate picture of resources planned to be spent and how they are financed. The MTEF
documented this for the first time. Using a “process? consultancy approach for the
development of the new NHSP and with the financial management work in the second
phase of this work program clearly helped build capacity through its “learning by doing?
approach. As a result ownership of MHMS has clearly improved as a consequence. The
new NHSP sets out a significant organizational and management reform agenda which is
forming the basis for ongoing dialogue and support from DPs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

53.    Not Applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

54.     The risk that development outcomes will not be sustained and deepened in the
future is assessed as moderate. There are real countervailing considerations in this
assessment. On the negative side there are risks that: (a) leadership of the MHMS will
change resulting in a reduced commitment to the project (particularly decentralization)
objectives; (b) the strength of the national program directors to resist de-concentration of


                                             14
health programs to provincial managers will prevail; and (c) that the broader government
does not continue with its financial management reform agenda or does not maintain a
focus on financial and planning reforms.

55.     On the positive side there is considerable evidence that most of the reforms will
be adequately sustained. First, the core of the reforms supported by the project was
clearly identified in the new NHSP. Second, as discussed in section 2.5, the MHMS has
requested ongoing support from the Bank (in cooperation/partnership with AusAID) to
support the ongoing implementation and deepening of these reforms. MHMS and other
DPs (including AusAID) are in the process of agreeing new financing support for the
health sector and while these are not yet finalized the ongoing dialogue is premised on
the basis that the key building blocks for further development of the HSSP will require
on-going work in these areas, including decentralization of health programs (provincial
planning, budgeting and accounting of funds for service delivery at the provincial level).
Third, decentralization is a strong theme of the current government and in many ways
health is showing the way forward for other sectors. Finally, the central agencies have
recently decided: (a) to formally create and implement a chart of accounts which will
allow for significant decentralization of the financial management of service delivery
including health; and (b) to introduce a “whole of government? MTEF process. For these
reasons, notwithstanding the challenges that remain, the risks to development outcomes
in the future are assessed as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56.      The preparation was supported by a strong well qualified Bank team. A
situational assessment of the health sector was prepared and this was supported by initial
information from a health module in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey
undertaken by SIG with support of the preparation team. The final project design, as
appraised, was focused on developing strategic building blocks necessary to: (a)
increasingly devolve management of health services delivery to provincial managers
within the MHMS; and (b) implement a results focused program of support for the HSSP
jointly with DPs and government/MHMS in the future. This was a sound approach with
continued strategic and policy relevance. The final project outcomes suggest the
institutional development targets set for the project were ambitious but focused on the
right issues, and as discussed, require continued support. The alternate approach of going
immediately to a pooled funding SWAp (considered during preparation) without
adequate building blocks in place, and a strong consensus with DPs on the approach,
clearly would not have worked. However the work done under the project now makes
this more feasible. In this regard DPs are now working with MHMS to work through the
compacts needed to enable increased flexibility in the manner DP funding and TA is used
to support service delivery programs. The government’s continued constrained fiscal
position makes the focus of financial management reform and the MTEF appropriate.
The MTEF focus on: (i) highlighting the misalignment of expenditures between HSSP


                                           15
objectives; (ii) gaps in support for priority programs (by DPs and government); and (iii)
the incremental recurrent costs arising from policy and investment decisions, underline
that the project focus was relevant technically, financially and economically.

57.     The risk assessments for the project at appraisal were accurate and reflected the
considerable issues expected to be faced during implementation. Weak fiduciary
arrangements were identified up front and a wide range of risk mitigations measures were
adopted, including upfront actions. Nevertheless, reliance on another DP to maintain a
suitable procurement advisor to support the MHMS procurement unit which was assessed
as weak proved problematic. Financial management capacity, particularly maintaining
project accounts was also weak and the mitigation measures also underestimated the
problems to be faced by the project. This, while very important, relates to project
accounts only and should not be interpreted to mean that the strengthening of the
financial management of the MHMS and of provincial divisions overall were not well
designed and prepared. The M&E system for the project was reasonably designed but
was seen as a small part of the overall efforts until its relevance was highlighted as part of
the development of the new NHSP.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.     The quantity and quality of Bank supervision increased over the life of the project.
During the first year, the Bank did not provide the level of implementation support that is
needed in a limited capacity environment such as the Solomon Islands. Infrequent initial
supervision (both technical and fiduciary) meant that the full extent of capacity and
implementation constraints, particularly of procurement, was only fully realized one or
more years into project implementation. This was exacerbated by turn-over of almost the
entire senior management team of MHMS responsible for Project activities. From early
2010 supervision intensity increased and additional consultant support was added to the
team to work with MHMS management and the TA engaged under the project,
particularly for the initial provincial budgeting and planning support and the MTEF work.
Increased Bank presence in the Solomon Islands and ongoing communication with the
MHMS executive and DPs has meant the Bank managed to stay more fully engaged and
increasingly responsive to implementation constraints over the final two years of project
implementation. By participating in all main sector meetings with MHMS and DPs(at
least three missions per year), the Bank has been able to engage effectively in a more
coordinated support to the sector assisted by a period of strong leadership of the MHMS.
It should be noted here that Bank supervision had to judiciously mix focus on the overall
HSSP (working with MHMS and other DPs on the building blocks of the HSSP- an
intended outcome of the project) and the specific fiduciary issues and institutional
developments which were needed to manage the more narrow implementation aspects of
the Bank project. Bank aides memoire were seen as very important monitoring
documents for the overall HSSP by both MHMS and DPs.

59.    It is evident that, in the final analysis, there was inadequate FM and Procurement
support by Bank staff. Regional procurement and FM staff saw this project as relatively
small and it was only on rare occasions that their supervision missions were coordinated
with the main implementation support missions. This was seen as less important for


                                             16
procurement because there was a very high level of prior review. There were only two
formal and one informal FM reviews, all from March 2011. Thus very little was done to
establish the basic system for project accounts at the outset, and as there was little or no
expenditure (in part caused by implementation delays and subsequently limited capacity
to prepare withdrawal applications), FM did not give the project a high priority. The first
withdrawal was only made in mid 2010. In the final analysis the delays were primarily
due to capacity constraints. The core problems associated with procurement and FM
derived from these capacity constraints not from any desire to avoid the fiduciary
protocols of the Bank. The technical task team provided considerable implementation
support during missions and through email/phone to help compensate for this constraint.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.     The overall rating of Bank performance is moderately satisfactory reflecting the
two dimensions: quality at entry, and supervision/implementation support. While initial
technical and fiduciary implementation support was inadequate for the limited capacity
environment, the Bank task team increased its engagement as implementation issues
emerged. From late 2009 this involved at least three missions per year as part of broader
sectoral meetings, plus substantial email, phone and video conference communications.
Implementation support arrangements facilitated the transfer of global knowledge
through policy dialogue on the HSSP, the development of the new NHSP, and the
establishment of core building blocks for development of the HSSP. Overall, this made a
significant contribution to the health sector policy and management focus.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Government/Implementing Agency Performance (on basis that government and
implementation agency are inseparable for practical purposes).
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     At the time of writing the final ISR (March 2012) the 2010 audit was overdue by
nine months, the resubmission of a number of IFRs were outstanding, and only 66
percent of the grant had been disbursed. For this reason the rating for Implementation
Progress in the final ISR was Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, by the end of the
disbursement period (April 2012) final project expenditure was 82 percent. The
outstanding IFRs have now been submitted and accepted, and the audit completed
qualification by exception; the qualification did not identify a material misstatement of
the financial statements. While compliance with these project specific fiduciary
requirements was inadequate, it is recognized that the small fiduciary team within
MHMS was stretched managing their own Government budget and other much larger DP
funding arrangements. The World Bank reporting and management requirements were an
additional layer of work for a comparatively small funding allocation. However, when
looking at project performance more broadly, the MHMS maintained a significant
commitment to the objectives of the Project and the HSSP, and made good overall
progress with its key project outcomes: the new NHSP with its M&E framework, the
MTEF, and the achievements on provincial planning and budgeting. The MHMS has
also delivered on many of its agreements including holding regular HSSP meetings that
have supported high level policy dialogue for improved management of the sector.


                                            17
MHMS staff have always made themselves available to meet with Bank Staff and other

Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

62.     The MHMS at the time of project preparation, was trying to build consensus on a
medium term health program, having relatively successfully stabilized service provision
following the “troubles.? There were many DP projects financing different programs and
one large AUSAID project managed by a contractor. Virtually all DP projects were
managed outside of the SIG budget framework and there was no standard system (budget
framework) for MHMS (or SIG) documenting planned expenditures and their outcomes.
MHMS recognized they had no system for oversight and that the executive had no system
to manage and monitor implementation of the overall health programs. DPs agreed and
also recognized that the transactions costs for DPs and SIG were very high under the
current arrangements. Governments and DPs had a growing commitment in the Pacific,
consistent with global trends, to the development of SWAps as a way to reduce sector
transaction costs, improve focus on outcomes and to support one agreed national strategy
for the health sector. At face value, it seemed a SWAp, could address the key issues
facing Solomon Islands. To this end, a significant part of preparation activities for the
project focused on establishing the building blocks for a health SWAp. A key lesson
learned is that the transaction costs to establish the preconditions for a pooled SWAp are
very difficult in a fragile and low capacity environment. It requires a strong commitment
of DPs to work together with a collective understanding of what this means as a way of
doing business, including government execution of programs, use of government systems,
and appropriate fiduciary oversight. There was significant conflict between DPs on these
issues during preparation. The MHMS, understandably, was unable to exercise strong
leadership on these issues as it was unsure how to proceed. There were also weak
relationships with the central agencies of Government and they did not fully appreciate
the issues either. Thus, many preconditions to establish a SWAp were absent. An
agreement on upfront criteria to assess readiness of government systems for pooled
financing would have been helpful.

63.     The project team took the right decision to shift to a TAL focused on the core
building blocks for the HSSP – support for one sector program; enhanced DP
coordination; and joint monitoring and strengthening of MHMS budget and planning
systems. This perhaps took too long because of the collective regional commitment to a
SWAp without being clear on what the up-front readiness conditions should be.

64.     A key question is whether a small project with high transaction costs is worth it?
The transaction costs to both SIG and the Bank were significant. The view of this ICR is
that the project was high risk with potentially high benefits and the Bank team took the
right decision to prepare a TAL. The Bank was able to add value across the core domains
of the project– a view expressed by the client and DPs (see annexes 7 and 8). This
impacted positively on the wider HSSP – thus the small Bank TA grant leveraged the
whole of the health program through its work on planning and budgeting systems, the
MTEF, and most importantly the new NHSP and M&E. DPs indicated that the project



                                           18
and Bank team greatly assisted MHMS and DPs to stay focused on the “big picture? i.e.
how resources were being deployed, key gaps, and how outcomes were evolving.

65.     Another lesson is that enhanced supervision and implementation support is
needed, particularly in fiduciary management for projects, in countries such as the
Solomon Islands, no matter what the scale of the project. Procurement and particularly
financial management support from specialized staff in the Bank was inadequate and
typically not coordinated with review missions. The separation of team responsibilities
within the Bank for different parts of the supervision process in the recent past has
reduced the effectiveness of the Bank in supervision of projects. A key lesson is that the
Bank needs to develop a better business model for undertaking fiduciary supervision in
small countries where it cannot justify locating fiduciary specialists in-country.

66.     Another lesson is that persistence on the need for core Bank requirements
sometimes pays off. The executing agency often complained strongly about the Bank’s
insistence, under the project, to develop a procurement plan and follow it. The MHMS
now openly recognize that this is precisely what they need for their own government
development budget and are now planning one for their 2013 development budget
because of significant delays in 2012 (and earlier) due to a lack of planning.

67.     Finally, a core lesson of this project has been that the focus on the development of
systems is “in and of itself? a capacity development strategy. In the latter part of the
project TORs for TA, support was defined as “process? consulting i.e., providing tools
and decision making frameworks for MHMS staff to make strategic decisions
collectively. For the development of the new NHSP and for the finance advisor the TA
support was specified as process support. This meant that outcomes were controlled by
MHMS staff with the consequence that ownership of decisions and positions taken were
clearly owned – a situation that is not always evident with a “task? consulting approach.
It also means that much larger numbers of MHMS staff are involved and understand
objectives and processes – a significant achievement.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

68.      The MHMS believe the development objectives remained relevant and focused on
key aspects of the health systems development. The new executive grew to better
understand the benefits of the project as it was implemented. While small, the project
was an integral part of the overall support to the HSSP. The MHMS had lost all
institutional memory of the past project and the design, without a project management
unit, was thus left to the executive to manage. This led to an implementation hiatus when
the executive was changed. As an inexperienced executive there was limited
understanding of the Bank’s focus on the procurement plan. This is now much better
understood by the MHMS (other DPs undertook most major procurements) and it plans
to use such an approach for the development budget.

69.   The MHMS believe the project outcomes were significant. Highlighted is the
new NHSP with its key programmatic priorities and organizational and management


                                            19
reforms required to achieve the programmatic objectives. The M&E framework is also
now well owned and its benefits better understood. The focus on budget systems
development has been beneficial in developing capacity and allowing better
understanding of how resources are being used. The support to the provincial planning
process has been very significant and will enable further de-concentration of service
delivery. The MTEF for the first time brought together “whole of sector? analysis of
expenditures and how they are financed. The new executive was initially not sure of its
benefits but now see the importance of completing it annually. The new NHSP and the
budget and planning processes have involved extensive stakeholder and provincial
involvement in health planning, budgeting and policy dialogue. This is an important
development.

70.     The MHMS recognizes that staff turnover and limited initial understanding of the
project by the new executive led to project delays. Project delays were the core issue due
to capacity constraints - not intent. Limited experience with recipient execution meant
that implementation capacity needed to be developed. The overall rating of
implementation agency performance is understood.

71.     The Bank was very supportive on implementation issues during support missions
and contributed to policy dialogue. This kept the focus on the strategic issues –
particularly those related to overall expenditures and expenditure priorities. Its sector
work provided timely strategic advice not otherwise available. Banks aides memoires
were important mechanisms for the overall monitoring of the HSSP and the project. The
MHMS also believes the support on financial management of the project from the Bank
was inadequate.

72.    With respect to the future the MHMS believes the MTEF, provincial planning and
budget system reforms and the M&E framework are now well established and will be
continued as a result of project support. It is recognized that additional and continued
support will be needed for public financial management to deepen the reforms already in
place. The MHMS is also keen to explore efforts to build on project achievements and
consider results based financing at the provincial level.

(b) Co-financiers

73.     The DPs have all recognized the positive contribution of the project to the HSSP
and of the Bank’s strong contribution through implementation support missions to the
overall policy dialogue on health sector issues. It is clear that the DP commitment to a
HSSP has grown and that trust between all parties, including of MHMS with DPs, has
grown significantly over the past 2-3 years – trust that was not always there previously
(see Annex 8).

the TTLs during the supervision phase were paid directly out of a trust fund, and the fiduciary team did not charge to

Subject:        RE: Follow up on World Bank Health Project Implementation Report


Dear Susan,
I write to endorse the ICR on behalf of the MHMS. Thank you for your assistance and support towards
its completion. We certainly look forward to an ongoing partnership with the World Bank.
Look forward to your visit.
Kind regards,
Lester.



Development Objectives and Project Design. The MHMS believes the project
development objective was relevant and remains relevant through the completion of the
Project and beyond. The Project design was focused on key aspects of system
development required to establish the capacity to implement the HSSP/SWAp the
MHMS was very keen to operationalize. It is fair to indicate that the MHMS more fully
appreciated the relevance of the design one we had produced the new NHSP and could
see how the pillars of the Project were assisting to put in place systems that would make a
SWAp more feasible to manage. We increasingly realized that the Project, while a small
stand-alone Technical Assistance Program, was in fact an integral part of and supported
implementation of the HSSP.

Implementation Arrangements. It has to be acknowledged that the MHMS had lost most
of its institutional memory, in part because of the “troubles? which led to significant staff
turnover throughout the Ministry, about how a World Bank project needed to be
organized and managed within MHMS. Presumably, because the project was relatively
small, a decision was taken not to establish a Project Management Unit but rather to work
through existing units of MHMS (the Planning Unit for policy issues supporting
provincial planning and related issues; the Finance Section for financial record keeping,
and financial management reform support; and the Procurement Unit to undertake all
procurement activities). The consequence was that no one in the MHMS was directly
responsible for the Project’s implementation except for the Health Executive. This meant
that there was a hiatus in project implementation in the early years as a consequence of
the appointment in 2009 of both a new Minister and almost totally new executive within
MHMS. Frankly, it also took some time for the new executive to fully realize what the
project was about and its strategic objectives. Initially, we were focused on the on-going
HSSP financing by AusAID and then the new very large malaria project which took up
much of our management focus.

The Project did not take off and get the due management attention it fully deserved until
one member of the MHMS Executive took ownership of the Project. Even, then


                                                33
implementation was slow because of limited knowledge of Bank procedures. One
important constraint was clearly the capacity of the procurement unit. AusAID was
financing a full time internal procurement advisor as part of their program of support for
the HSSP but it proved difficult to keep the position filled. There were a number of
turnovers of advisors with significant gaps. Additionally, there was also a period when
AusAID decided that the Procurement Advisor should only work on AusAID
procurement activities. This proved difficult to work through and as the new Executive
was not party to the agreements it was more difficult. When this was resolved things
worked more smoothly.

It does however need to be observed that the MHMS were not clear on the procurement
arrangements and did not understand the continual focus of Bank mission on the
procurement plan and its associated steps for each procurement action. We grew to
appreciate that the procurement plan was a very valuable tool and we are now working to
develop a procurement plan for major procurement actions we have throughout the entire
Ministry. This has been an important lesson for the Ministry. It is only recently that we
have had to undertake significant procurement actions – under the initial support to the
MHMS from AusAID a managing contractor arranged for most procurement and it is
only recently that the SIG financed development budget has grown to any significant size.
In the end, procurement planning has gone from an imposed tool by the Bank to one
which we now recognize needs to be and will be used within the Ministry.

Assessment of Outcomes. The view of MHMS is that outcomes supported by the Project
were significant. Specifically the following were achieved:

•   the most important outcome was the support for the development of the new NHSP
    which was developed with strong stakeholder ownership (both within MHMS, SIG
    and non-government health related organizations). This was developed in a
    participatory manner and was a sound example of “process? consulting which
    enabled participants to make the strategic decisions thus establishing strong
    ownership of the key outcomes which included: (a) agreement on the core
    programmatic outcomes being sought by the MHMS programs; and (b) agreement on
    key organizational and management reforms needed to better implement the agreed
    priorities. An important aspect of the new NHSP was that it did not just focus on part
    of the programs that have priority (e.g., the MDGs) but also on how management of
    MHMS have to manage all health services and try to ensure they all use resources
    cost-effectively;

•   establishment of a draft monitoring and evaluation framework for the health sector as
    part of the new NHSP. This draft framework is being finanalized and significant
    effort, as agreed under the new NHSP, is focused on operationalization of the Health
    Management Information System so that it is expected we will be able to review key
    health information systematically from July/August this year;

•   re-enforcement of the central and provincial capacity through enhancement of
    government systems to budget and managed expenditures was central to the efforts to


                                            34
    improve health services delivery and is a strategic achievement. This included
    separation of primary health care programs from hospital services at the provincial
    level so that MHMS could for the first time monitor SIG financed expenditures at the
    provincial level by program. The importance of this should not be underestimated;

•   re-enforcement of provincial and national program planning through the process of
    annual operational plans – increasingly linked to the budget process. These are
    important tools for Provincial managers and have the potential to better assist as the
    processes are bedded down and improved over time;

•   the production of both the draft and final MTEF, while late due to a need to recruit
    new consultant support to complete the exercise, is also a major mile stone. One
    theme of the new HNSP was that there was a clear need to achieve significant
    efficiencies from within existing budget allocations. The MTEF, for the first time,
    generate a “whole of ministry? picture of the allocation of all resources available to
    health (SIG financed recurrent and development and development partner financed
    resources) for the first time in a consistent format (with meaningful identification of
    input and program allocations). This is the first time this had been done for several
    years in any agency in the Solomon Islands. It required significant work to collect the
    data (particularly from development partners) which in Solomon Islands has not been
    systematically collected. This work highlighted a number of important issues with
    respect to resource allocation in the health sector relative to the decisions on health
    priorities taken under the new NHSP: (a) revealed expenditure priorities, including of
    development partner financing do not always accord with national priorities in that
    many programs are over financed relative to others; (b) there are significant gaps in
    funding of important programs; (c) there are significant quality enhancing recurrent
    budget funding from development partners (including of pharmaceuticals and key
    medical supplies) which will eventually have to be financed by SIG signally that the
    sector faces significant sustainability risks; and (d) there are a number of areas where
    there is a need to document future costs/sector needs to redress the identified gaps in
    the current expenditure program including: (i) rural health facility refurbishments and
    up-grades; (ii) primary health care equipment needs to bring facilities up to agreed
    standards; (iii) strategic hospital refurbishment and upgrading and associated medical
    equipment needs; (iv) future staffing needs – including ensuring adequate numbers
    and mix of cadres are produced and provision made for their employment within
    forward estimates for the sector. The MHMS sees the need to regularly update the
    health sector MTEF to inform policy dialogue with both SIG and health sector
    stakeholders including development partners. We are also encouraged that the MOFT
    is now planning to introduce a national MTEF to support the budget processes of
    government.

•   one aspect of the objectives of the Project that has recorded considerable progress is
    increased community and stakeholder involvement in the planning of health services.
    Production of the new NHSP was very participatory and was a real milestone in the
    involvement of stakeholders in health planning. In fact, the really strong participation
    of provincial managers in the plan was very significant. Previous planning –


                                             35
   including for the NHSP which was in place when this project started --was almost
   completely a top down exercise with little participation of provincial level staff.
   There is no doubt this has created strong ownership of the new NHSP within the
   Ministry and it will be very difficult to reverse this trend if a future Executive tried to
   operate in the old ways. It is interesting to observe that there is now increased
   community participation at the provincial level in health services planning. This will
   require sustained encouragement and we have to recognize provincial managers are
   not well resourced with staff or money to allocate time to this. More generally, we
   note that SIG has started opening up the whole budget process to a community
   consultation process – so we are proud to be in the vanguard of these types of efforts.

Evaluation of MHMS Performance and Lessons Learned. The MHMS recognizes the
senior staff turn-over and an inadequately staffed planning unit within the organization
contributed delays in implementation – particularly in the first 18 months of the Project.
An almost completely new management team was appointed to MHMS and it took time
for the team to both get on top of the HSSP/SWAp process being established and even
longer to appreciate the contribution the Project could make to this effort. For the new
management team, working with development partners, and particularly with the Bank,
which insisted on recipient execution of all aspects of Project implementation, there was
a very steep learning curve. Further, at about this point, key staff left the planning unit
and new staff had to be recruited. It was not until we had a new and very good head of
the planning unit and had reached agreement within the Ministry Executive that one
member of the Executive would be responsible for the Project that implementation picked
up.

The current Executive is unable to really assess the performance of MHMS in preparation
of the Project as none participated in it. As discussed, the current Executive grew to more
fully understand the rationale of the Project and recognize its importance in supporting
the establishment of a SWAp and of building capacity at the provincial level and in PFM
more generally. The fact that the Project was relatively flexible and the Bank team was
able to respond to MHMS needs was very appreciated – particularly to generate support
for the new NHSP was extremely valuable.

Implementation was mixed –outlined above – but in truth we feel the core issue were
delays. We had planned to undertake the MTEF on a more regular basis under the
project and make it part of the rolling budget planning process. The relatively poor
performance of the initial consultant undertaking the MTEF work is however part of this
story. We are planning to repeat that this year as noted. We had planned to undertake
more survey work and use of the training parts of the TA were perhaps less than optimal.
On the other hand we did request training support for the new management team (on how
to be managers and how to work as a team) which was not approved by the Bank team at
the time.

The Performance of the World Bank. The Bank has been very active during review
missions raising the need to focus on systemic issues and processes and in making
positive suggestions on how they may be addressed. Examples include: (i) the focus on



                                             36
financial management issues and practical suggestion on how the Ministry could de-
concentrate service delivery to managers; and (ii) support to the provincial planning
processes. This work was particularly clearly recognized as critical by MHMS upon
completion of the new NHSP which had built a consensus with the Ministry on the need
to de-concentrate service planning, resourcing and delivery.

We also need to acknowledge that World Bank aides memoire were very important
documents for the MHMS Executive. They consistently documented the issues discussed
during joint development partner missions with all partners and agreements reach with
respect to both the HSSP and on the Project specifically. These were very important
monitoring tools for both MHMS and other development partners. We often used them
to confirm the history of evolving issues and agreements. They also focus MHMS on the
next strategic steps and analysis required for management decision making.
The MHMS recognizes the responsiveness of the Bank to policy and most
implementation issues we were dealing with, particularly over the last three years, was
very important to us. The support given to the MHMS with the MTEF and the Finance
Advisor who also under took the revamped MTEF work was valued. This work was an
important underpinning to the last major meeting of the health sector with development
partners.

The MHMS also recognizes the support given to it by the Bank through its analytical
work – some included in aides memoires and most importantly the sector report on
Health Financing Options. This report has been influential in giving both strategic
direction and options to the Ministry. It has also helped in our policy dialogue with
Cabinet.

We do note however that the support on the financial management front was somewhat
inadequate. Specifically, there was limited technical support through supervision, to the
finance team on accounting procedures and how to make withdrawals. The fiancé staff
had to go to the World Bank office to gain access to the Project Portal – a less than
satisfactory situation. We do however acknowledge that Project filing was not always as
complete or systematic as desired. We also acknowledge the lateness of the 2011 audits
but these are now complete and the final audits for the close of the Proejct are under
preparation.

On Sustaining Project Activities. The core elements of the Project – the MTEF,
provincial budgeting and planning, improvement to PFM within MHMS more generally
and the monitoring and evaluation framework – are now well institutionalized within the
Ministry. It is recognized that each aspect needs improvement and nurturing but these
are lasting legacies – processes – which will support us into the future. They are all core
to the implementation of the on-going SWAp and of significant importance to
implementation of the HSSP.

The MHMS recognizes it needs continued support in the PFM area and with each odd
these elements of the Project activities as there are always opportunities to improve. But
in our view the Project has helped establish sound practices and systems. In recognition



                                            37
of this the MHMS is sending three senior staff on a PFM course shortly – focused on the
health sector -- organized by the Bank for the region. Colleagues from the MOFT will
also attend so this will assist in establishing a joint understanding of the issues we face as
a sector.

Finally, we sincerely hope we can continue our productive relationship with the Bank
into the future. We have initiated discussions about continued support to PFM and
provincial planning and options to explore results based financing of provincial services.
This latter option would not have been remotely feasible without the core system
developments assisted by the Project.



Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Introductory Note: The Project was a TAL and while it was in that sense a stand-alone
project it was nevertheless implemented within the framework of an emerging SWAp
where major DPs had agreed with MHMS through the signing of a Partnership
Framework agreement to work cooperatively on health system issues and to increasingly
move toward “pooled? or at least more flexible funding of the health sector by DPs.
Further, as discussed, these objectives underpinned much of the objectives of the TAL in
that they were focused on developing some key building blocks that were both necessary
for MHMS to better focus on improved management of resources to achieve improved
service delivery and to give DPs increased confidence that appropriate structures were in
place to enable increased “pooled? or more flexible funding. In this context the major
DPs involved in this – AusAID, WHO and SPC/Global Fund – were interviewed by the
ICR author at their suggestion in lieu of requesting formal written submissions. In this
sense they are strategic partners/stakeholders jointly funding the overall HSSP without
formal co-financing agreements. AusAID through its agreement with MHMS to
continuously support the procurement unit was more directly linked to project
implementation.

Comments by AusAID.

•   The Project helped put a number of key building blocks in place for the health sector
    and for DPs ability to forge ahead with a SWAP with increased programmatic and
    more flexible financial support. Specifically the Project: (a) strategically supported
    the development of new NHSP and its associated M&E framework; (b) significantly
    improved provincial planning, budgeting and budget execution capability within
    MHMS particularly at the provincial level; and (c) ensured the completion of the
    initial MTEF which highlighted key mismatches between resource allocations and
    stated health priorities and the scale of unplanned for incremental recurrent costs
    arising from DP investments and MHMS policy decisions.

•   The Bank focused and cared about the use of all health resources and through the
    policy dialogue on the Project and the HSSP kept both MHMS and DPs focused on


                                              38
    these issues (the work on provincial planning and budgeting; new NHSP; and the
    MTEF were particularly important for this as was the work of the Bank
    supervisions/implementation support teams). The Bank contribution to the policy also
    helped keep the focus consistently on development outcomes. The Financial
    Management Road Map for the future development of systems with MHMS was a
    significant success on which we can all now build.

•   DPs have an obligation to bring international experience and best practice to the
    Policy Table -- in this regard the focus on joint reviews by DPs of the HSSP were
    very important and the Bank has tried to do this consistently and quite well. The
    Bank has been an honest broker with DPs and MHMS and consistently supported
    enabling processes to resolve issues and ensure ownership within MHMS.AusAID
    saw the Bank and WHO as key advisors to MHMS on content (cfAusAID) in their
    areas of competence and recognized that much has been learnt about how DPs can
    work together to support MHMS – the increased ownership and leadership of MHMS
    has also helped in this respect.

•   The Project clearly helped MHMS and AusAID maximize the benefits on AusAID
    support to the sector (the major financier of the HSSP).

•   Institutional development requires a long term effort and it is important to remember
    MHMS and SIG were coming out of a difficult period of conflict. AusAID believes
    the processes set up for the HSSP will make it more likely that the key building
    blocks – many key ones of which were supported by the Project -- will become
    sustainable. The new support from AusAID is building on the efforts achieved
    through the project and the wider HSSP.

•   We all acknowledge capacity building is key. The processes the project has
    supported, and the process of preparation of the new NHSP 2011-2015 in
    particular,have, in and of themselves helped build both capacity and ownership within
    MHMS.

•   The Bank’s regular Project implementation support aides memoire(together with
    mission Statement of Objectives) became a very important monitoring tool for DPs
    and MHMS and added significant rigor to HSSP review processes – although some
    times its need to focus on details of the Project in addition to the focus on the overall
    HSSP meant they sometimes dealt with details not always seen as relevant to the
    strategic requirements of the HSSP. Sometimes there was a perception that a parallel
    agenda emerged (see comments in section 7). Nevertheless, the aides memoire
    provided a key record of deliberations, they were open to comment before finalization
    and no other DP consistently shared all documentation with other DPs and MHMS.

•   AusAID felt that a lack of in-country support for the health sector was a constraint on
    the effectiveness of the project. This put additional pressure on AusAID in country.

Comments by WHO

•   The partnership forged under HSSP between DPs and MHMS changed the way WHO
    works with sector – it is now much more collaborative and some funds, because of
    the agreements and work done under the Bank project, are now pooled and more will
    be in the future.

•   It is hard to change collective behavior around program financing and support for
    joint dialogue and but the Project assisted this. Specifically the partnership of DPs
    with MHMS and working with provinces has created a new structure to give voice to
    provinces and their needs which would not have been achieved without the project.
    There was significant work done with the establishment of the accounting package
    (MYOB) at the provincial level but, as we all know, this needs sustained follow-up to
    make it fully institutionalized. It would be good if the Bank could continue to support
    this effort.

•   The new NHSP, was a significant achievement – both for its clear statements of
    health sector priorities and the identified organizational and management changes
    required to better implement the agreed health strategy but there remains a need to put
    new structures in place in MHMS to allow effective management – particularly at the
    provincial level and below to the facility level.

•   Challenges remain on the M&E front – the new NHSP incorporated a sound
    framework for M&E – but management information systems still need to be
    effectively operationalized. While this is now being worked on the reality is that a
    lack of data has constrained the effectiveness of M&E.

•   It was recognized that the Bank did some qualitative work on the demand side for
    health services as part of preparation and did plan under the project to do more. This
    did not happen largely because MHMS did not see this as an immediate priority but
    WHO feels this remains an important area for future work. The Project was
    successful in giving increased voice to provinces and their stakeholders in the
    planning and budgeting processes but more needs to be done to move down to the
    facility level and understand the dynamics at the coal face.

•   Key lessons learned include that staff turnover – both of MHMS and DPs – in a
    situation where there are not strong management structures means that transaction
    costs can be high and ownership waxes and wanes. Another is that DPs need to work
    with the management team and not just key individuals – often small health systems
    particularly with fragile country systems become person dependent rather that system
    dependent.

•   The development of the new NHSP, with support of the Project, by MHMS was a
    major achievement. Project support drove the process and the framework within


                                            40
    which MHMS staff and health stakeholders (including development partners) made
    the strategic decisions on the new plan. The great benefit of the process was the level
    of ownership within the MHMS of the new strategy.

•   The Project also drove important financial management and planning reforms within
    MHMS – particularly at the provincial level. The acid test will be the determination
    of the MHMS to continue to devolve decision making and support down to provincial
    managers – a key recommendation of the new strategic plan.

•   The MTEF, while late, is a major milestone for MHMS on expenditure monitoring
    and evaluation, and provided strategic information on current expenditure allocations
    not previously available. It clearly showed that current expenditure allocations were
    not always in accord with expenditure priorities expressed in the new NHSP. It is
    very good that MHMS is keen to continue to up-date the MTEF.

•   While the Project has really helped develop key building blocks for the HSSP/SWAp
    the MHMS will continue to need strategic support to sustain and enhance the gains
    made.

•   The aides memoire of the Bank were very important monitoring tools of overall
    developments in the health sector for both development partners and the MHMS.

•   The Bank played a crucial role in continually providing strategic leadership on both
    process and priorities for reform. This was recognized by other development partners
    and by MHMS.
