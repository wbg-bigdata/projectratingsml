REPUBLIC OF BURKINA FASO
POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Burkina Faso
Implementing        Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Plan, Ministry of Health, and
Agendes:            Ministry of Social Action and Family
Beneficiaries:      Men and women at risk in reproductive age groups, and their dependents
Credit Amount:      SDR 19.0 million (US$26.3 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard, with 40 years maturity, including 10 years of grace
Project Description:  The overall objectives of the project are to (a) enhance the onset of fertility
decline by increasing the prevalence of modem methods of contraception,
and (b) slow the spread of HIV infections by promoting behavioral change
and treating Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). To this end, the project
would support policies and investments designed to:
1. SuRnort the Implementation of the Government's Population Policy by:
(i) improving quality of, and access to, family planning (FP) and maternal
and child health care (MCH) services nationwide; (ii) promoting information,
education, and communication (IEC) programs in the areas of population,
FP, and women's rights; and (iii) strengthening institutions in charge of
implementing the national population policy and of planning, managing and
evaluating FP programs;
2. Strengthen the National Capacity to Contain the Spread ot
HIV/AIDS/STDs by: (i) strengthening the institution in charge of
implementing the national AIDS program and the health system's capacity to
deal with AIDS needs; (ii) promoting safer health practices and behavioral
change through information, education, and communications campaigns; (iii)
promoting the use of condoms; (iv) treating STDs; and (v) strengthening
clinical management and community care; and
3. Encourage Private Sector and NGO Participation in Population. FP and
HIV/AIDS/STD Programs by establishing a Fund to provide grant financing
for projects in those areas.
Benefits and Risks:  The project's interventions would bplp increase by 1999 the prevalence of
modern methods of contraception in rural areas from 1.5% to 9% and in
urban areas from 17% to 32%. The number of FP users would grow from
an estimated 80,000 to about 350,000 in 1999. The wider practice of FP
would have a particularly beneficial impact on the health of women and
children. The project would help slow the spread of the HIV infection and
alleviate the burden of HIV/AIDS on individuals, families and the nation.



ii
The project would have significant returns in terms of years of healthy life
saved and would hold down the indirect economic cost of AIDS - the losses
of productivity and human capital, which threaten the long term economic
development of Burkina Faso. Most importantly, the cost of dealing with the
disease now would be small in comparison to the cost if the disease were
allowed to become more widespread. The project would help combat STDs,
which is one of the most effective strategies to inhibiting the spread of HIV.
By 1999, reliable supplies of condoms would provide protection from
HIV/AIDS/STD, to about 570,000 sexually active adult males (about 20%
of the estimated sexually active male population) who are expected to be
persuaded by the public information campaigns to use condoms. Distribution
of condoms targeted to high-risk populations, supported by an intensive EEC
effort, is expected to cover a much higher percentage of these populations.
Protective supplies would safeguard an estimated 4,500 health personnel. By
integrating HIV/AIDS/STD prevention in FP/MCH activities, the project
would contribute to alleviating the number of infections transmitted to
women. Neonatal infection would be reduced.
The proiect faces two major risks. Firs, attainment of project goals may be
hampered by the fact that changing reproductive and health behavior is a
difficult and time-consuming undertaking. To mitigate this risk, the project
would provide heavy support to IEC activities and would use NGOs and
other private sector organizations to reach those at risk. To mobilize
continued, strong support for FP as well as for HIV/AIDS/STD prevention
and control among political, traditional and religious leaders, the project
would support (i) actions to increase the awareness of these leaders to the
urgency of addressing these issues, and (ii) extensive information campaigns
to which national leaders are expected to contribute actively. Second,
Government's weak capacity may result in poor project implementation. This
risk would be addressed through the strengthening of the institutions involved
in the implementation of the project, and through heavy reliance on the
private sector and NGOs. Activities in this area would complement those
undertaken under other Bank Group operations to strengthen the health
services delivery system.
Environmental Risks: No environmental risks are foreseen.

REPUBLIC OF BURKINA FASO
POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1          The Government of Burkina Faso has requested IDA's assistance in financing a project
to assist in the implementation of its population program and in the development and implementation of
an aggressive program to slow the spread of HIV infection. Total project cost has been estimated at
about US$34.5 million equivalent, net of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of
US$24.2 million. IDA would finance US$26.3 million of project costs. The Government of Burkina
Faso would contribute about US$2.2 million equivalent. The Governments of Norway and Denmark have
expressed interest in cofinancing the project and may jointly contribute US$6 million.
1.2          The proposed project would be the fourth World Bank operation in Burkina Faso in the
health and population sectors. The first involvement in the sector was through the successful regional
Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP), launched in 1974, of which Burkina Faso is one of the principal
beneficiaries. This operation was followed in 1985 by the Health Services Development Project (Cr. 1607-
BUR), expected to be completed by July 31, 1994. This project focuses on maximizing access and quality
of health services and has helped implement important policy reforms in the areas of essential drugs,
decentralization of the health system, and cost recovery. Achievements in the health sector would be
consolidated and expanded under the new Health and Nutrition Project (approved by the Board in March
1994), which would also improve the poor nutritional status of women and children and enhance national
capacity for sustained control of selected endemic parasitic diseases. Although the issues addressed by
that project and the present operation are closely interlinked, separating them has helped keep each project
simple and tightly focused. It has also reduced the risk of overloading the Ministry of Health's limited
institutional capacity. Preparation of the two operations has been closely coordinated. The successive
preparation of two IDA projects in the health and population sectors reflects the priority given by the
Bank to human resources development in Burkina Faso.
H. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. Background
2.1          With a gross domestic product per capita of US$304 in 1992, Burkina Faso is among the
world's poorest nations. Agricultural production accounts for 44% of GDP, generates over 60% of
export earnings, and employs almost 90% of the economically active population. The agro-climatic
conditions are poor, with over 50% of the country covered with poor soils and low and irregular rainfall.
2.2          In 1990, an estimated 18% of adults were literate--27% of men and 9% of women--
compared with the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) of about 60% for men and 40% for women.
In primary education, only 45% of school age boys and 28% of girls are enrolled (corresponding SSA
averages are 82% for boys and 72% for girls). A deprived economic situation, combined with low
literacy, is largely responsible for the country's high morbidity and mortality rates, which, in turn,
hamper productivity and growth. Leading causes of morbidity and mortality are malaria, diarrhea,
tuberculosis, measles, and acute respiratory infections. AIDS is rapidly becoming a major threat to the
population's health status and places previous and ongoing investments in jeopardy.
2.3          Despite the fairly rapid growth in food production (about 6% per year over the past ten
years), the overall nutritional situation in the country is grim. Farm households sell most of their crop
for cash (in part to repay their debts) and keep insufficient stocks for family consumption. At the start
of the rainy (hungry) season household food stores are mostly depleted. The situation is aggravated by



2
the existing restrictions in the interregional movement of food. The AGSECAL and the Food Security
and Nutrition Project, both approved in 1992, are supporting a number of reforms aimed at improving
the country's food and nutrition situation at the national and household levels. It is estimated that 30%
to 50% of pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition, with about 5% of them affected by severe
malnutrition. About 40% of pregnant and lactating mothers are estimated to be malnourished, and
maternal malnutrition accounts for 18% of children with birth weight of less than 2.5 kg, as well as for
delayed child development, and high child mortality. The deficiency is not merely one of calories and
proteins, but also of specific nutrients such as iron, iodine and vitamin A, leading to serious disabilities.
2.4           The infant and child mortality rates are 134 and 199, respectively per 1,000 live births.
These rates frustrate efforts to reduce fertility: parents may want many children to ensure that some
survive, inter alia to provide support in old age.
2.5           The low health status of women is especially concerning. A 1991 UNFPA study shows
that, over the past 20 years, female mortality has been consistently higher than male mortality in the 0
to 5 and 20 to 49 age groups. The official maternal mortality rate of 810 per 100,000 live births is in
all likelihood underestimated, because it is based on deaths which have occurred in public health facilities
and does not take into account the many women in rural areas who never make it to a health facility.
Major causes of maternal mortality are hemorrhage, eclampsia, toxemia, infections and induced abortion.
Women's higher mortality rates and lower literacy level provide an indication of the unfavorable situation
of women which remains a key element in the demographic and health situation of Burkina Faso
(Burkina's main social indicators are listed in Annex 1).
B. The Population Sector
2.6           Population Dynamics. During the 10-year period between the first (1975) and the second
(1985) population censuses, total population increased from 5.6 million to 8 million, an increase of 43%.
With 48% of the population below age 15 there is built-in momentum for high growth rates for several
decades as larger cohorts of women enter childbearing age. The population growth rate, until recently
estimated at 2.7%, is believed to have accelerated to 3% in recent years. At this rate, Burkina's
population will double in 23 years. Bank projections based on recent fertility trends and assumption about
future changes suggest that the population may stabilize at 50 million in 2045. In the past, the high rate
of natural increase was in part offset by an important migration to neighboring countries (in particular
the CMte d'Ivoire, where there were, until recently, about 2 million Burkinabe) and Europe. Migration
appears to have decreased lately due to the economic difficulties faced by most of Burkina's neighbors.
In 1992 the population was estimated at about 10 million, 86% of which is rural. With about one hectare
of arable land per capita, Burkina Faso already has one of the highest population densities in the Sahel,
resulting in degradation of its fragile soil, biomass and water resources. Recently published findings of
a 1992 UNFPA-funded demographic survey show that migration to urban areas has increased at a rate
of 9% annually since 1985. The crude mortality rate has decreased from 26 per 1,000 in 1960 to 18 per
1,000 in 1990 (SSA average of 16), while the crude birth rate has remained practically stable, moving
only slightly from 48 per 1,000 in 1960 to 47 per 1,000 in 1990 (SSA 46). The fertility rate dropped
slightly from 7.2 in 1985 to 6.9 in 1993, according to the 1993 Demographic and Health Survey-DHS
(SSA 6.5). Infant mortality decreased from the 1960 level (190 per 1,000) but remains very high (134
per 1,000) (SSA 107). Life expectancy is estimated at 48 years (SSA 51).
2.7           The above figures demonstrate the importance for Burkina to lower its fertility rates and
bring about the needed demographic transition. The rapid population growth seriously undermines efforts
to bring about poverty reduction, improvements in health, education, employment, and environmental
protection.

2.8          Family Planning (FP). FP services were introduced in Burkina Faso in 1979 by the
Association burlknab6 de bien-etre familial (ABBEF), an affiliate of IPPF, through a network of
volunteers. In 1985, the Government integrated FP services into general Maternal and Child Health
(MCH) Care and Primary Health Care (PHC) services and gave primary responsibility for all FP
activities in the country to the Family Health Directorate (DSF) of the Ministry of Health (MS). FP
services are currently available only in 250 out of 650 health centers (Centres de sant6 et de promotion
sociale-CSPS), in all the 70 medical centers (CM), 9 regional hospitals and 2 national hospitals.
Preliminary results of the 1993 DHS show a considerable gap between contraceptive prevalence (CP) in
urban areas (17%) and in rural areas (1.5%). The total number of users is estimated to be about 80,000.
The pill is the predominant method of contraception (50% of women surveyed), followed by condoms
(19%) and IUD (17%). Condom use appears to have increased considerably in 1992, largely as a result
of an effective social marketing program launched in the context of AIDS-control activities, supported
by USAID.
2.9          Many donors have been active in the population/FP sector, with USAID, UNFPA, and
IDA providing the largest support. IPPF supports the activities of its affiliate, ABBEF. Donors which
have, at one time or another, assisted Burkina Faso's population and FP program include: the
Netherlands, the Republic of Germany, the Population Council, the Center for Development and
Population Activities, FP International Assistance, and Columbia University. Since 1986, USAID has
provided about US$13 million to Burkina Faso to help develop a strong public foundation from which
to expand nationwide and integrated MCH/FP information and service delivery. Its assistance covers
about 82 health facilities in 14 provinces. In addition, USAID has started a few FP pilot operations in
the private sector. Activities include: a community-based distribution (CBD) project carried out by the
Association burAlnabg des sages femmes (ABSF), and promotion of FP services at private clinics. USAID
is expected to drastically reduce its support to Burkina's FP program, following its decision to close the
Burkina Faso's office.
2.10         UNFPA supports FP activities in 10 provinces, promotes family life education in rural
areas and population education in urban secondary schools. In addition, it financed Burkina's first (1975)
and second (1985) population censuses and, since 1980, it has supported the preparation and
implementation of a comprehensive population program, which includes demographic research, population
policy formulation and implementation, Information, Education and Communication (IEC), and women's
issues. UNFPA's total assistance has amounted to US$25 million. Present commitments are expected
to continue until 1995. IDA's support to FP has been provided in the context of the ongoing health
project. Started in 1989, IDA-financed FP activities cover the remaining 6 provinces not covered by the
other two major donors. Activities are similar to the ones conducted by USAID and UNFPA, focusing
on rehabilitation of health facilities, training, provision of MCH/FP equipment and IEC. Total outlay for
the FP component is about US$1.2 million. Contraceptive needs have so far been covered exclusively
by UNFPA, IPPF and USAID on a grant basis.
2.11         Institutional Arrangements. Responsibilities for population-related activities is shared
between the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Plan (MEFP) and the MS. The MEFP analyzes the
effects of demographic factors on development, while the MS promotes family planning mainly as a
health intervention, with a goal to lower maternal and infant mortality and malnutrition. The MFFP
chairs the interministerial population committee (CONAPO), which in 1991 prepared the national
population policy, and is responsible for overseeing its execution through the Permanent Secretariat of
CONAPO, placed directly under the Delegate Minister of Plan. Also under MEFP is the National
Institute of Statistics and Demographic Studies (INSD), which is responsible for studying the interaction
between demographic variables and economic development. Under the MEFP directives, other
Ministries, such as the Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy, the Ministry of Secondary Education



4
and Scientific Research, the Ministry of Communications and Culture, are also involved in population
IEC activities. The MS has primary responsibility for FP policy-making and programming, and for
coordinating, supervising and evaluating all FP activities. It conducts these activities through the DSF.
The Directorate of Family Promotion (DPF) of the Ministry of Social Action and Family (MASF)
collaborates with the DSF in carrying out FP IEC activities.
Population Sector Development Issues
2.12          Need to Mobilize Stronger Political Support. Government support to population and FP
programs has been growing in recent years. The national population policy, adopted in 1991, sets specific
targets and describes the strategies to achieve them. In December 1993, the Government passed legislation
defining CONAPO's and it Permanent Secretariat's role and functions in the context of the
implementation of the new population policy. It also adopted a National Family Planning Strategy for the
1993-1998 period, which introduces a number of reforms essential for the expansion of the FP program.
2.13          The targets set in the 1991 Population Policy Statement are very ambitious, calling for
an increase in the contraceptive prevalence (CP) from 4% (nationwide) to 60% in 2005; and a 10%
decrease in the fertility rate every 5 years starting in 2005. Achieving these targets would require a
radical change in behavior that can only occur over time and with a considerable effort on the part of the
Government to increase public awareness of the issues at stake, build a consensus on objectives and
strategies, implement well-designed action programs, and provide universal coverage of MCH services.
While the Government would need considerable donor support in its effort to disseminate and
operationalize the population policy, the success of the latter will ultimately depend on the continued
presence of a strong political commitment, and on Government's ability to provide the leadership required
to mobilize all the country's forces (political, religious and traditional) in support of the required reforms.
2.14          Limited Availability of FP Services. As indicated earlier, FP services are currently
provided by DSF in less than half of the existing public health facilities. While in the urban areas, NGO-
run FP clinics and the FP operations of other private sector organizations provide an additional important
source of contraceptives, in rural areas there is no outreach program and the public sector is virtually the
only provider of FP services. Factors that have contributed to the limited availability of contraceptives,
particularly in rural areas, include: regulations (lifted in December 1993), allowing doctors, nurses and
midwives, but not obstetrical assistants to prescribe contraceptives (the last group is considerably more
numerous than midwives in rural areas); and preventing itinerant health workers (IHW), traditional birth
attendants (TBA) and village health workers (VHW) to resupply contraceptives on the basis of a
prescription provided by a public health officer; the narrow range of methods provided, focusing on the
pill and, to a lesser degree, on the condom and IUD; the limited quantity of contraceptives provided to
the users in the course of a visit to a health facility, making repeated visits to the facility necessary (an
important reason for the high drop-out rate); and, finally, the practice of requesting the husband's consent
before prescribing contraceptives. Because of the above constraints on the availability of FP services,
the number of women who resort to abortion is estimated to be quite high. Since abortion is illegal, it
is often performed under hazardous conditions, with considerable risks for the life of the pregnant
woman.
2.15          The limited availability of FP services is one important reason for the current low CP,
particularly in rural areas. Preliminary data of the 1992 DHS reveal the existence of a considerable unmet
demand for FP: about 19% of interviewed women nationwide stated that they do not want more children,
and about 50% would like to space childbirth for periods longer than two years. In light of the DHS
results, providing good access to FP services and to appropriate contraceptive methods, using a variety
of delivery systems, becomes an important priority. The private sector (NGOs, private clinics and



5
pharmacies) which currently covers about 20% of FP users in Burkina (1992 DHS), has the potential for
reaching a considerably larger share of the population, particularly in urban areas. In rural areas,
however, without the back up provided by a good public health care system, it will be difficult to develop
an outreach program. Thus, the public health system will remain, for the near future, the major provider
of FP services in rural areas.
2.16         Limited FP Promotion. In addition to limited availability of FP services, the Burkinabe
FP program has been hampered by rather low key promotional activities which have mostly focused on
raising public awareness of FP services, particularly in terms of birth spacing, leaving, however, the
public with limited knowledge about the different methods available and where to obtain contraceptives.
Major responsibility for planning and implementing FP IEC activities rests with the EEC Unit of the DSF,
which started this activity in 1987 with the assistance of the Population Communication Services (PCS)
of Johns Hopkins University under a USAID-financed project. Activities supported by PCS included:
training, research, print and media-related output. The project trained eight social workers in FP
communication and conducted six IEC workshops for 140 health and social workers. It also: (i) helped
develop a trainers' handbook in FP communication and designed a FP/IEC curriculum for the National
School of Social Services (ENFS); (ii) instituted a monitoring system for FP/IEC activities of the Ministry
of Health's extension agents; and (iii) carried out EEC campaigns and FP awareness programs for opinion
leaders. PCS conducted in 1992 an evaluation of its program which revealed the above mentioned
limitations. The DHS provided similar findings: while over 60% of those interviewed knew of at least
one modern method of contraception, only 28.4% knew where to obtain it.
2.17         Burkina's FP/IEC program has so far placed insufficient emphasis on interpersonal
communication. To date, only about 50% of FP providers have received training in IEC, and those that
have received this training spend very little time promoting FP activities. Because of a lack of
transportation, the majority of social workers trained in FP/IEC has not had the opportunity to conduct
extensive outreach activities.
2.18         Successful FP programs in other countries have relied on a mix of mass media and
interpersonal communication. These two channels are complementary: mass media provides information
quickly and repeatedly to a very large audience, while interpersonal communication leads to a more in-
depth understanding, addresses individual concerns, and gives immediate feedback. Interpersonal
communication plays a particularly important role in FP acceptance and continuation.
2.19         An immediate priority for an FPIIEC campaign in Burkina Faso is to design aggressive
promotion campaigns that direct people to FP delivery points and provide specific, reassuring information
about different modern contraceptive methods. The 1994-1998 FP/IEC program which PCS has designed
for the DSF, places considerable emphasis on mass media and would need to be complemented with a
face-to-face outreach and counseling program. Although past programs have made a good start on
covering the training needs of health and social workers, much work remains to be done in the area of
interpersonal communication in the public and private sectors. Another important issue in FP/IEC is the
lack of coordination among the various agencies carrying out FP/IEC population activities (DSF, DPF,
ABBEF, ABSF, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, etc.). Concerned that this
lack of coordination could create duplication of efforts and inconsistency in the messages delivered, the
Government organized, in November 1992, an interagency workshop to discuss this and other issues
related to IEC activities for population. The workshop recommended the establishment within CONAPO
of an EEC commission to coordinate all IEC/population activities undertaken in the country. DPF was
given a leadership role in the commission.

2.20         Weak Institutional Capacity. The DSF is currently affected by a number of organizational
problems. These include: poor supervision of staff, an information system that does not allow for proper
monitoring of the results of FP activities and feedback; and an unreliable supply system for
contraceptives. Supervision of staff is poor both in quality and in frequency, affecting field workers
motivation and performance. Regarding FP monitoring, evaluation and research, infrastructure for these
activities consists of the Management Information System (MIS) of the Planning and Studies Directorate
(DEP) of the MS, set up in 1985 with USAID assistance, and the INSD. A situation analysis conducted
in 1992 revealed serious problems in the quality of record collection and keeping, making it practically
impossible to draw any conclusions about the performance of provincial health facilities and progress in
the FP/health program. Flow of data is affected by logistic and geographic constraints, limited resources,
insufficient supervision visits, providers workload or lack of competency, and the multiplicity of channels.
At the central level, the DSF receives field reports directly from the CMs and the CSPS, thus bypassing
the DEP and has established its own system for analyzing the data. A number of donors recently
expressed interest in helping improve Burkina's health information system.
2.21         Considerable effort has been made in the past eight years to provide the necessary skills
in FP to health personnel. Between 1987 and 1989, with the assistance of INTRAH (University of North
Carolina), Johns Hopkins University, and the Free University of Brussels, the DSF has trained about 487
agents: 367 health agents and 120 social workers. About 127 social and health agents have also received
training in supervisory techniques. Since 1990, FP training is included in the basic preparation of all
paramedical personnel, provided at the School of Public Health (ENSP) and, since 1991, it has been
introduced at the faculty of medicine. About 24 health personnel have received training in Tunisia,
Zimbabwe and Mauritius, countries which have implemented successful FP programs. Under the FP
component of the ongoing project, 295 health agents received training and refresher courses in FP
between 1989 and 1992. These efforts notwithstanding, training of new staff and continual training and
motivation of existing staff remains a major task, particularly in view of the expansion of FP services
called for under the project.
2.22         The DSF is responsible for the procurement, storage and distribution of contraceptives
and other FP supplies in the country. The system is affected by a number of deficiencies, including poor
forecasting, and transportation; and the weak information system. Supply break downs contribute to
contraception discontinuation and user dissatisfaction, damage morale among staff, and contribute to poor
program image.
2.23         Weak Collaboration with NGOs and Other Private Sector Organizations. NGOs have
played an important role in introducing and expanding FP services in Burkina Faso. ABBEF, in
particular, has been a pioneer in the area. This NGO currently operates through a network of 2,600
volunteers, mostly engaged in FP/IEC, and 6 FP clinics-two in Ouagadougou, two in Bobo-Dioulasso,
one in Koupea and one in Koudougou/Yako. Other NGOs involved in the provision of FP services are:
the ABSF, which has two FP clinics in Ouagadougou; the Association of Widows and Orphans (AVOB),
which recently opened a FP clinic in Ouagadougou; and the APAF, a Catholic association, which
promotes natural FP methods. The Workers' Health Office (OST), which provides health services to
formal sector employees, introduced FP services in 1992 and supplies contraceptives in about half of its
50 health facilities, located in major urban areas. An increasing number of NGOs have included FP
promotion and service delivery in their activities.
2.24         An important issue in Burkina Faso is the weak Government/NGO collaboration in the
health sector in general, and FP in particular. As indicated in para. 2.15, with a 20% share of the
contraceptive market, NGOs still play a modest role in Burkina's FP program. This role could be
expanded particularly in urban areas where NGOs have helped achieve current encouraging CP prevalence



7
rates. NGOs have, in particular, demonstrated a comparative advantage in the area of FP promotion, as
they are more effective than the public sector in reaching target groups, largely due to their flexibility
and community presence. NGOs and other private sector organizations have a limited capacity to expand,
mostly due to lack of capital and expertise. The Government can help NGOs overcome these limitations,
through financial and technical support, provision of clinic and office space, loaned personnel, and goods.
2.25         Private practitioners (doctors, pharmacists, village health workers, traditional
practitioners) could considerably extend the public contraceptive distribution network. The Government
could encourage these providers by making contraceptives available at a subsidized price, promoting their
sales through mass media, training traditional practitioners, and allowing them to refill contraceptive
prescriptions and make referrals to public health facilities.
C. The HIV/AIDS Situation
2.26         Following recognition of the first 10 cases of AIDS in 1986, surveillance activities have
expanded in Burkina Faso to include a variety of population groups. Studies on HIV prevalence have
been conducted all over the country. Although they are based on small samples of a mostly urban
population, the data they provide clearly indicate that the HIV infection is rapidly expanding. Table 1
below shows HIV prevalence resulting from these studies.
2.27         The highest seropositive rates are reported among people age 20 to 39 (over 50% of the
reported cases), men (over 60%), migrant workers (36%) and prostitutes. There are no data for HIV
prevalence among the gold miners, another important risk groups, and data collected on seroprevalence
among the military is not being released. Increases in the infection rates among pregnant women are of
particular concern as this is supposedly a low-risk group. These women are considered the sample group
most representative of the general adult population. The MS recently revised its estimates of the
seroprevalence in the country, from 4% of the adult population to 7%. Taking into account infected
newborns, it is estimated that about 450,000 persons are currently HIV positive. This prevalence rate
places Burkina third, after C8te d'Ivoire and Ghana, among the Western Africa countries most affected
by the infection. Reported AIDS cases increased from 10 in 1986 to 776 in 1989. As of December 31,
1992, a total of 2,886 AIDS cases had been reported, of which 1073 were reported in 1992 alone.
2.28         It is, however, estimated that underreporting is considerable and that actual cases are 3
to 4 times larger than the reported ones. The most common symptoms of HIV/AIDS patients presenting
to hospitals are similar to those of other endemic diseases in Burkina Faso (chronic diarrhea, tuberculosis
and other pulmonary infections). This, together with limited availability of diagnostic tests, has lead to
misdiagnosis of AIDS. A rapid assessment conducted during appraisal suggests that nearly 50% of
hospital beds in the gastro-intestinal and pneumophysiology wards of the national hospitals are occupied
by HIV patients. Similar patterns are evident at the regional level. The mission also found that in one
private clinic in Ouagadougou, 26% of first-time visits, within a two-week period, tested positive for
HIV. Heterosexual transmission is predominant (85% of the cases), followed by blood transfusion and
perinatal transmission. A high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), particularly among
prostitutes and their clients, considerably increases the risk of transmission of HIV. While the probability
of being infected with HIV during sexual intercourse with a seropositive person is between 1 and 5 per
thousand, this probability increases to 50 per thousand in the presence of an STD.
2.29         Public recognition of the importance of the AIDS epidemic in the country is recent and
so are programs to control the spread of the disease. Surveillance and IEC activities were started in 1987
with WHO and other donors' support. In 1989, the first Medium Term Program (MTP) for AIDS
control was launched; and in 1990 the Government established, within the MS, the National AIDS

Committee (CNLS) with the mandate of 'preparing, executing, coordinating and evaluating all strategies
aimed at controlling the spread of AIDS in the country." The CNLS is a multisectoral body co-chaired
by the Ministers of Health and Communications and comprises about 60 members. Day-to-day
implementation of AIDS activities is entrusted to a Permanent Secretariat headed by the Secretary General
(SG) of the MS and comprising a Deputy Secretary General, two administrators (one representing WHO)
and a Permanent Secretary, with mere administrative functions. The CNLS also includes five technical
sub-committees (IEC, laboratory, epidemiological surveillance, research, and case management) and
program monitoring sub-committee. Members of the sub-committees include representatives of various
agencies (ministerial units and NGOs).
2.30           HIV/AIDS programs have received considerable assistance from  the international
community. The first MTP, 1989-1992, received US$3.6 million equivalent, contributed mainly by
WHO, USAID, the EC, and the Republic of Germany. This support focused mostly on improving blood
screening capabilities. It helped rehabilitate two blood banks in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, train
and retrain a number of laboratory technicians, and improve the supply of medical equipment and
materials. It also launched a number of sensitization campaigns. However, other important activities in
the area of prevention and control such as the provision of essential drugs for the treatment of STDs and
opportunistic infections, HIV/AIDS training of doctors and paramedical personnel, preparation of
diagnostic and treatment protocols for STDs and launching of counseling and community care activities,
have been either neglected or insufficiently carried out. The Second Medium-Term Program 1993-1995
addresses the above constraints. It is also heavily weighted towards prevention activities (75% of the



9
proposed budget of US$7.1 million). For the 1993 activities the Government requested US$2.5 million.
IDA provided US$750,000 under the ongoing First Health Project, while the Republic of Germany,
WHO, CIDA, UNICEF, and the EC agreed to provide the balance.
Issues Affecting HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Activities
2.31         Need to Mobilize Stronger Political Support. Strong support from political, religious and
traditional leaders is critical for the success of the HIV/AIDS prevention program. As the number of
AIDS cases mounts dramatically in the country, the Government has moved from a stage of reluctant
acceptance to one of more constructive engagement and the MS, in particular, recently started responding
publicly to the crisis, declaring the fight against AIDS one of its top priority. Political authorities at all
levels, including the President, should be encouraged to actively intervene to increase the population's
awareness about the threat of AIDS and ensure that every sector of the society is mobilized to combat
the infection. Political support would need to be backed by adequate budgetary allocations.
2.32         Insufficient Awareness of Risk Behavior. Data of the DSH survey show that awareness
of HIV/AIDS is relatively high in Burkina (over 90% of surveyed persons), but that people's knowledge
has yet to be translated into use of safer health practices (only 7% of men said they were using condoms
at the time of the interview and only 17% declared that they had used them in the past). Focus group
discussions organized during project appraisal in rural areas confirmed a high awareness of AIDS (in all
the villages the mission visited there was at least one known case of AIDS), but also considerable
ignorance of modes of transmission and preventive measures. People interviewed appeared frightened and
asked for guidance. Adolescents, who represent about 50% of Burkina's population, are particularly at
risk, as they become sexually active very early but lack the information needed to prevent HIV/AIDS.
Information and prevention activities targeted to the youth thus become very urgent.
2.33         The current program of IEC activities addressing HIV/AIDS and STDs in many ways
echoes that of EEC for family planning, both in achievements to date and challenges that remain. While
the Government and NGO participating agencies have made a good start in implementing the IEC
strategies called for in the MTP, much more emphasis would need to be given to: (a) training in
interpersonal communication and other IEC techniques; (b) provision of materials for specific target
groups; (c) rural community outreach programs; (d) mass media; and (e) promotion of condoms.
Implementing these activities would require allocating a much higher level of funding for IEC than has
been the case so far. All health units offering FP and MCH services are now charged with integrating
information and services pertaining to AIDS and other STDs in their activities; programs and materials
to reach high-risk groups (youth, truck drivers, migrants and prostitutes) are being developed and some
have been implemented. However, as with FP/IEC, too few health workers have been trained in IEC and
there is almost no time for additional IEC activities due to the pressure of other tasks. Funding for IEC
activities is currently being provided by a number of donors, mostly for interventions in limited
geographical areas.
2.34         Responsibility for coordinating IEC HIV/AIDS activities and refining communication
strategies rests with the IEC sub-committee of the CNLS, composed of about 30 people representing
twenty governmental and nou-governmental agencies involved in HIV/AIDSISTD communication
activities. Implementation of IEC activities at the public sector level was, until recently, the responsibility
of the Directorate of Education in Health and Hygiene (DESA). This task was, however, not very
efficiently undertaken and a few units in MS, such as the DSF and the Preventive Medicine Directorate
(DMP) initiated their own IEC program. When the MS was reorganized in December 1992, the
Government decided to dismantle the DESA and decentralize IEC activities at the regional level. It
established ten regional Health and Hygiene Education Centers (CRESA), which are not yet fully



10
operational. In January 1994, the Government established under the MS a new Center for IEC activities
(CNIEC/Sante) with the role of coordinating and supervising all health IEC activities, including those of
the CRESAs. The DPF of the MASF, charged with coordinating IEC population activities, has also
begun to incorporate AIDS prevention activities in its social action programs for women and families and
anticipates a much larger role in HIV/AIDS IEC activities in the future. To reach the public at large,
DESA utilized mass media (radio and television), and organized a few seminars for opinion leaders and
workshops for radio and television broadcasters and journalists.
2.35         Limited Condom Promotion. Condoms are the key component of HIV and other STD
control strategies as they are the only proven reliable means of preventing the transmission of STDs and
HIV during sexual intercourse. In Burkina, condoms are mostly sold through a social marketing program
started in September 1991 by PROMACO (Projet marketing social des condoms), a USAID-funded
project, receiving technical assistance from the US-based NGO Population Services International (PSI).
Although the program appears to be successful, with current yearly sales estimated at 3 million condoms,
current use of condoms, estimated at about 2.5% of the sexually active adult male population (para.
3.59), is too low to have any impact on the growth in new HIV cases (the discrepancy between the 2.5%
rate quoted here and the 7% quoted in para. 2.32 is due to the fact that condom users in the DHS do not
represent continuous users). PROMACO's sales, which are mostly concentrated in urban areas, seem to
have tapered off in the last year of operation. The organization appears to have reached a stage where
it has to review its various operational strategies, strengthen planning, programming and supervision
capabilities, expand its sales force and invest much more intensively than it has done so far in promotion
activities. With financing of US$7 million equivalent to be provided by the German KFW for the period
1994-1997 (USAID financing is expected to end in April 1994), PROMACO intends to consolidate as
well as expand its operations and plans to increase sales by one million a year, reaching a yearly sale of
7 million condoms by 1997. This is quite a conservative target, below what is possible to achieve through
social marketing of condoms, as demonstrated by the experience of other countries. In addition to
PROMACO, condoms are distributed by public health facilities whose distribution has been declining and
is currently estimated at about 180,000 condoms a year. Private pharmacists also sell condoms. Major
constraints to an expansion of condom sales in Burkina include: low demand, because of cultural barriers
and dislike for the device; inadequate promotion of condom use; limited availability and accessibility of
condoms; and their price, which in 1993 ranged from US cents 4.36 (PROMACO) to US cents 69-95
(private pharmacists) for a single condom.
2.36         Limited Information on the Development of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic. As in most
developing countries, epidemiological surveillance is very limited in Burkina Faso, thus preventing a full
appreciation of the gravity of the HIV/AIDS epidemics. The surveillance subcommittee of the CNLS is
responsible for HIV/AIDS surveillance. In reality, one member of the sub-committee is in charge of all
epidemiological surveillance in the country. The epidemiological surveillance system is poorly organized,
AIDS cases are not regularly notified, nor has the Ministry provided a standard definition of AIDS to be
used for the notification of AIDS cases and given clear instruction concerning notification. As a result,
the HIV/AIDS situation is considerably underreported. Most of the information on AIDS in the country
derives from active surveillance activities conducted by the Preventive Medicine Directorate (DMP)
through its network of ten regional epidemiological centers (CSE), established in the context of the
Canada-supported PASE project (projet d'appui I la surveillance epidemiologique). Sentinel surveillance,
started in about 8 sites of the country, could not be continued for lack of medical and laboratory supplies,
HIV tests, and limited skills among health staff. Of the eight sites, only three (Gaoua, Bobo Dioulasso,
and Ouagadougou) are currently functioning.
2.37.        High Level of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). STDs are associated with the same
risk behavior that put a person at risk for HIV infection. In addition to posing a serious public health



11
threat, because STDs are responsible for considerable morbidity, such as genital ulcer diseases (GUDs),
pelvic inflammatory diseases, ectopic pregnancies with consequent surgical emergencies, as well as long-
term complications such as infertility, and neonatal infections (e.g., congenital syphilis and blinding eye
infection), STDs accelerate the acquisition and transmission of HIV. Burkina Faso does not have a STD
control program and data on the prevalence and incidence of these diseases are rather scanty. Most
information available on STD prevalence comes from two surveys conducted in Ouagadougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso among commercial sex workers in 1987 and 1991, showing a STD prevalence of 23% and
18.2%, respectively. Lack of diagnostic equipment, drugs and appropriate training of health workers are
important constraints to proper STD treatment. Yet, the experience of other countries shows that with
modest investment in the identification and treatment of STDs those most at risk for HIV could be
effectively protected. Treated cases of STD can cost as little as one dollar, especially if the intervention
is targeted at a high prevalence group. With financial and technical assistance from IDA, the Government
is preparing a STD/HIV rapid risk assessment to identify the more important STD infections in the
country and determine their prevalence.
2.38         Weak Institutional Capacity. The CNLS, which has the task to lead Burkina Faso's
campaign against AIDS, lacks at present the strength needed to provide the required leadership and
support to the different agencies involved in the implementation of AIDS control activities, both in the
public and private sector. The present organizational structure of the CNLS is an important constraint
to the effectiveness of its operations. As indicated earlier (para. 2.29), the Permanent Secretary of the
CNLS (the only permanent staff of the Secretariat) has limited authority and resources. The heads of the
five technical sub-committees are all directors of different MS's units, reporting directly to the General
Secretary of the MS (who is the effective head of both the Permanent Secretariat and the monitoring
subcommittee) and bypassing the Permanent Secretary, a physician and a middle ranking civil servant.
The legislation which established the CNLS in 1990 does not specify the roles and relationships of the
three main structures of the CNLS, i.e., the interministerial committee, the technical subcommittees and
the Permanent Secretariat, in the elaboration and approval of AIDS policies and strategies. The situation
resulting from this lack of clarity and from the weakness of the Permanent Secretary's position is one of
confusion, dispersion of efforts and relative paralysis. The General Secretary and the heads of the
technical subcommittees are overburdened with other tasks and have a very limited time to dedicate to
the activities of the CNLS. In fact, most sub-committees have had infrequent meetings since their
establishment in 1990.
2.39         A draft decree reorganizing the Permanent Secretariat was recently submitted to the
Minister of Health for his approval. While giving the Permanent Secretary more authority and
responsibility in the conduct of his activities (the Secretary would become the effective head of the
Secretariat), the proposed new legislation does not mention staffing of the Secretariat and it fails to clarify
the role of the technical sub-committees and their relationship vis-a-vis the Permanent Secretary.
Mobilization of other sectors' agencies (NGOs, sector ministries, other private groups) to reach larger
segments of the population with information about the epidemics is still limited to date.
2.40         HIV/AIDS/STD prevention and care activities are integrated into the existing public health
infrastructure. The system is affected by numerous constraints including understaffing and lack of basic
drugs, supplies and equipment. This situation contributes to the low quality of services and to their
underutilization (it is estimated that less than 30% of the population uses public health services). Burkina
Faso has a health personnel of 5,850. This number includes: 409 doctors (1 per 22,700 inhabitants),
1,927 nurses (1 per 4,826 inhabitants), 241 midwives (1 per 38,000 inhabitants), and 394 obstetrical
assistants (1 per 23,600 inhabitants). With exception of the number of people per doctor which is close
to the SSA ratio (24,600), other ratios are low even by SSA standard (one nurse/midwife for 2200
people). In the 1980s, the Government launched a campaign to encourage the establishment of village



12
health posts, staffed with traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and village health workers (VHWs), both
volunteers. Out of about 6,000 village health posts established during this time, a little over 2,000 are
currently functional. The problem of poor staffing in health facilities is worsened by the fact that over
50% of health personnel is concentrated in urban areas which account for only 20% of the population
according to most recent data. For example, only 38% of Burkina's midwives provide service in rural
health facilities.
2.41         The HIV/AIDS epidemic exacerbates existing constraints of the health sector. The
technical and operational capacity of MS's personnel to deal with HIV control is extremely weak. A
survey undertaken in 1991 among health personnel and social workers in 10 of Burkina's 30 provinces
provided following disturbing results:
- only 10% had received any formal HIV/AIDS training;
- about 60% said that AIDS had never been discussed in any meeting;
- 13% was unable to explain the meaning of the AIDS acronym;
- 21 % was unaware of the mother/child transmission;
- 20% was unaware that traditional practices such as circumcision and scarring could
contribute to the spread of HIV;
- over 30% did not know the etiology of AIDS and its clinical characteristics.
2.42         The poorest information about the infection was found among social workers, with more
than 50% either not knowing the infection or being unable to explain its etiology, mode of transmission,
and risks for contamination. The survey also revealed that only one third of health personnel took
precautionary measures in his/her daily work and that protective supplies were generally lacking. Doctors
had a considerable better knowledge about HIV/AIDS than paramedical staff. However, their lack of
expertise on how to deal with the infection, leads them to prescribe very costly therapies.
2.43         While strengthening of the health system is the focus of the ongoing health operation and
the proposed follow up project in health and nutrition (para. 1.2), the present project addresses the
formidable challenge of improving the capacity of the health system to deal with the spread of the HIV
epidemics. Improvement in the public health sector will, however, take time to materialize and there are
many risks involved given the weakness of the system. It is, therefore, essential to encourage a greater
involvement of NGOs, which have more effective access to the community.
2.44         Insufficient Focus on the Implications for Women of HIV. In Burkina Faso, 85% of HIV
infections are due to heterosexual transmission. This means that women are increasingly being infected,
and soon the infection rate among women will be equal to that of men. Women with HIV infection are
younger than men at the time they develop AIDS, reflecting the typical age-gender distribution of sexually
transmitted infections. And, as with STDs, the risk per exposure for a women acquiring the infection
from her infected male partner is greater than the risk for a man acquiring it from an infected partner.
In addition to biological factors, traditional harmful health practices such as circumcision (still widely
practiced in Burkina Faso) make women more vulnerable to HIV. Women's low socio-economic status,
higher illiteracy, more limited mobility which constrains their access to information, are additional
contributing factors to their vulnerability to AIDS. With more women being infected with HIV, perinatal
transmission of the infection will also increase. It is estimated that one in every four children born to an
infected mother is itself infected. The presence of STDs is known to increase several-fold the
susceptibility to acquiring HIV (para. 2.28). This has important implications for women, since in the
initial stages of these diseases up to 60% of infected women are asymptomatic. Women and children are
also more likely to be exposed to HIV transmission through blood products than men, as they receive a
high proportion of blood transfusions administered in the country. All the above issues show that



13
providing women with information about the connection between HIV/AIDSISTD and reproduction is
an urgent priority. HIV/STD prevention need to be integrated into MCH/FP services. Women's groups
would need to be mobilized to help address AIDS and other STD issues among women. Finally, research
should not only target women as transmitters of the disease but also as recipients and address the social
and gender dimension of HIV and STD.
2.45         Legal and Ethical Issues. A number of social, legal and ethical issues are connected with
HIV infection and control. These include: patient notification of the results of the HIV test; notification
to the authorities; confidentiality of results to protect the rights of infected individuals; the right of society
to be protected against the spread of the disease; job protection for those declared seropositive; protection
of medical personnel exposed to HIV/AIDS-infected persons; and the care of persons with AIDS. Partner
notification is an issue particularly relevant to women.
2.46         The evaluation report of the first MTP showed that in Burkina Faso HIV tests were being
undertaken on patients without their knowledge and the results were often not communicated to the
interested party. The report proposed the establishment of an ethical and legal committee, composed of
representatives of different groups in society: private associations, NGOs, the Government, the judicial
system, the medical profession, and religious organizations. Funds have been provided under the ongoing
health project to help establish such a committee and develop legislation setting forth Burkina's policy
on AIDS. The proposed project would continue providing support in this area.
2.47         Impact on Health and Social Services. At the rate HIV prevalence is increasing, Burkina
Faso could have a million HIV-infected people by the year 2000. With the disease spreading to
communities, a major burden will be placed on an already weak health system. The number of AIDS
patients in the gastro-intestinal and pneumophysiology wards of the national and regional hospitals have
dramatically increased in the past few years (about 50% of the beds are occupied by AIDS patients)
placing a considerable strain on services that are underfunded and lack basic resources. In addition, there
is the longer-term problem of children who lose one and, eventually perhaps, both parents because of
AIDS. The number of orphans will increase in the coming years. Public sector social services are too
weak and have too few resources to be able to adequately deal with the social problems created by AIDS.
There is a need to encourage other, more community-based types of support. NGOs can also help provide
affordable and effective coping mechanisms.
2.48         Economic Impact of AIDS. AIDS has more severe economic implications than other
prevalent diseases, because it is fatal, it strikes the adult population at the peak of its productivity, it
affects both the wealthy and the poor, and it is widespread. A rapid assessment was conducted during
appraisal to quantify the direct and indirect costs of the disease. The assessment, the first attempt of this
kind in the Sahel, showed that the cost of treating the disease is significant. Direct economic costs (or
the value of all resources used in patient care) per episode of hospitalization ranged from US$127 to
US$352 (at the pre-devaluation exchange rate of US$1 = CFA 275), with an average economic cost per
hospitalization of US$238 for diarrheal disease and of US$317 for tuberculosis patients. The most
important cost category was that of medications, which represented approximately 54% of the total
economic cost for diarrheal disease patients, and 21% of the total cost for tuberculosis patients. Personnel
costs accounted for between 11% and 279% of total hospitalization costs, with the remainder representing
overhead costs of the health facility. Total average lifetime cost of treating AIDS (ambulatory treatment
and hospitalization) was estimated at US$416. Multiplying this cost by the number of new cases reported
in 1992 (1,073), total direct costs of HIV/AIDS is estimated to be US$446,000, or 5.2% of the MS
recurrent expenditures in 1992. Although a Government decree exempts AIDS and tuberculosis patients
from paying for their hospital stay, it is estimated that patients bear a large share of the cost (60% in the



14
case of diarrheal diseases). Financial outlays per patient/hospital day averaged US$18 in the sample.
These figures compare with those found in other African countries.
2.49         Financial outlays for AIDS by the patients and their families is, however, much higher.
It was evident from patient interviews that multiple sources of health care had been utilized prior to
hospitalization. Total expenses ranged from US$79 to US$2,315 for the disease, an average of US$564
(removing high and low values). This figure is almost twice that of the 1993 per capita GNP of US$ 290,
suggesting that treatment and management of AIDS is expensive and the burden is spread over the entire
extended family. Traditional healers, used by some patients almost exclusively, were quite an expensive
source of care.
2.50         The average age of the interviewed patients was 33. The average income was US$290
equivalent (same as the 1993 GNP per capita), although patients in Ouagadougou had higher income
(US$476). The number of days lost from work ranged from 22 to 183 days, with an average of 79 days
for the sample. Multiplying this figure by an estimate of daily income (US$1.10) the value of lost work
ranged between US$24 and US$201.
2.51         The indirect costs of AIDS are a measure of the product lost to the economy which the
AIDS victims would have otherwise contributed. To estimate the present value of the indirect cost of
AIDS, a loss per AIDS death of 43 years was assumed per man and of 49 years per woman. This results
in a total of 48,283 healthy life years lost in the population distributed among men and women (assuming
an incidence rate of 0.173 per 1,000 population). Using a discount rate of 3%, approximately 17,900
healthy life years are lost to men and 9,635 to women in 1992, for a total of 27,535 discounted healthy
life years lost. Assuming that everyone has the same annual income (US$290), the value of the number
of healthy life years lost is US$7.9 million, or about 18 times the direct cost of AIDS, which is similar
to the ratio found in countries such as Tanzania and Zaire.
2.52         Using the simplified version of indirect cost estimates (same annual income of US$290),
the total economic impact per year (the sum of direct and indirect costs) of AIDS is estimated to be
US$8.4 million. However, if GNP per capita is adjusted to take into account that 70% of AIDS cases are
found in urban areas and that 599% of the urban population earns US$416 a year, 11 % about US$1664
a year, and the remainder 30% is between these two categories (while the rural population has an income
of about US$150 a year), the total economic impact of AIDS doubles to US$16 million. These figures
are substantial and are expected to rise dramatically, as the number of AIDS cases increases.
D. Government Strategy
2.53         Family Planning. In 1991, the DSF prepared the Politique et standards de SMI/PF, a
document establishing guidelines for all FP and MCH practitioners in public and private health facilities.
The document was approved by the Government in July 1993. In November 1992, a multisectorial task
force, chaired by the DSF, prepared a National Family Planning Strategy for the period 1993-1998. A
preliminary CP target set by the task force for 1998 (15%) has been revised (para. 3.5) in light of the
results of the DHS, which showed that the actual CP was much lower than the Government had estimated
and that a wide gap existed between rural and urban CP (para. 2.8). The FP strategy, adopted by the
Government in December 1993, revises a number of regulations inhibiting the expansion of the FP
programs such as the interdiction to obstetrical assistants to prescribe hormonal contraceptives. Allowing
these health workers to prescribe and provide contraceptives will considerably increase contraceptive
accessibility as they are more numerous than midwives in rural areas. The strategy also recognizes that
in order to achieve a meaningful increase in the CP it will be necessary to go beyond the constraints of
the public health system by developing an outreach program and intensifying the collaboration with the



15
private sector, in particular with NGOs. Finally, it allows IHW, TBA and VHW to refill contraceptive
prescriptions.
2.54         The Government estimated the cost of implementing the strategy to be about US$15.5
million for the 1993-1998 period. Given the financial constraints it currently faces, the Government will
be able to cover only a fraction of these costs, and is requesting the donor community to help finance the
remaining costs. With UNFPA facing financial difficulties and USAID planning to substantially reduce
its financing of FP activities in Burkina, IDA is expected to become the major supporter of the
Government FP strategy.
2.55         Health Services. The key objectives of the Government's current health services strategy
are: (a) strengthening the health care pyramid by promoting decentralization, integrating vertical
programs, and improving capacity at the central and regional levels to enhance management of human,
material and financial resources; (b) improving the supply and minimizing the cost of essential drugs; and
(c) encouraging increased accountability and cost recovery mechanisms throughout the health system in
line with the UNICEF/WHO-sponsored Bamako Initiative which has been endorsed by the Government.
A key element of the Government's health services strategy is the strengthening of health services at the
peripheral level through creating "Health Districts" centered around medical centers with surgical
facilities (CMAs). District health authorities will supervise and control primary health care activities,
through the CSPS at the community level and through CMAs at the district level.
2.56         Control of endemic diseases is an important aspect of the Government health strategy.
Epidemiological services are essential to maintain this control. Responsibility for these services at the
central level rests with the Service of Epidemiology of the Directorate of Preventive Medicine (DMP).
The resurgence of various endemic diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis and, foremost, the
emergence of AIDS, have highlighted the need for a much stronger epidemiological surveillance and
control than has been the case so far. The government strategy in this area is based on its Devolution Plan
for onchocerciasis, trypanosomiasis, and dracunculiasis first prepared in 1988. It consists of (a) active
epidemiological surveillance of these diseases by four trained mobile teams, and (ii) passive surveillance,
treatment of cases, and increasing awareness of the characteristics of these diseases among populations
by CSPS health workers who will be trained by district medical officers. Strengthening of DMP's Service
of Epidemiology to be carried out under the health and nutrition project will be complemented by the
strengthening of AIDS and STDs epidemiological surveillance proposed under this project at five sentinel
surveillance sites and at the district level.
2.57         STDIHIV/AIDS. The Government's comprehensive strategy for AIDS control is set out
in the second MTP (1993-1995) discussed in para. 2.30. The National STD program has been
incorporated into this program. The MTP describes in detail major objectives and sub-objectives of the
program, strategies and activities to attain stated objectives, the estimated costs (US$7.1 million) and a
timetable of activities until 1997. The MTP has also elaborated process and program indicators. The plan
is expected to be revised annually.
E. The Bank Group's Role
2.58         Lessons From Project Experience in Burkina Faso. The proposed project would be the
Bank's second intervention in the population sector in Burkina Faso and the first in the area of
HIV/AIDS/STD control. In population, IDA's first health project (para. 1.2) has helped expand FP
services in six selected provinces. The lessons from that project suggest that greater attention needs to
be paid to: (i) ensuring that the necessary policy reforms are in place prior to start up of project
investments; (ii) decentralization of activities, coupled with training and supervision through district



16
management teams; (iii) improving the quality of existing health care facilities; and (iv) active demand
creation and government support for FP activities are essential to increasing acceptance rates.
2.59         The Bank's role in Burkina's PHN sector has grown considerably in the past few years.
Through the policy reforms it has supported under the ongoing project, and through the preparation of
the Health and Nutrition Project, as well as through its macro-economic policy dialogue, IDA has been
able to make a significant impact in areas where other donors had not succeeded (e.g., essential, generic
drugs; financial autonomy of peripheral health facilities; redeployment of staff to rural areas; and
reorganization of the health system). The Government, which in the past preferred to use grant funds
for expenditures in the social sector and, during the implementation of the First MTP for AIDS, had not
solicited IDA's support, has come to rely on IDA for support to carry out its human resources
development efforts.
2.60         Lessons from Project Experience Elsewhere. Lessons from Bank Group population
projects implemented worldwide and summarized in OED reports suggest that: a) in countries with very
scarce resources and just beginning to address population issues a focused approach has better chances
of success; b) institutional reforms essential for successful project implementation should be pre-condition
for Bank Group lending; c) there is a need to strengthen and maintain a commitment to population and
FP on the part of all officials responsible for implementation of the program; d) there should be a firm
agreement between the Bank and the Borrower on the objectives to be attained and the need to have a
firm organizational base for the FP program; and e) efforts in FP need to be integrated with efforts to
directly reduce the demand for children, such as female education, and programs aimed at increasing
women's income earning capacity and reduce child mortality. To date, the Bank Group has financed
three free-standing AIDs projects (Zaire, India and Brazil), two free-standing Sexually Transmitted
Infection (51) Project in Zimbabwe and Uganda, and AIDS components in several projects. The main
lessons provided by those experiences and others gained internationally, both in developing and developed
countries, are as follows: (a) interventions in the early stages of the epidemic have a greater impact and
a higher benefit-cost ratio than interventions at a later stage; (b) large-scale condom promotion has
resulted in large observed changes in sexual behavior and significant increases in condom use; (c) efforts
to control STDs should be integrated with AIDS prevention efforts; and (d) NGOs can play an important
role in reaching high risk groups. To the extent feasible, all these lessons have guided the development
of the proposed project.
2.61         Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's country strategy for Burkina Faso is presented
to the Board in a free-standing document together with this operation. The strategy rests on the following
three elements: (i) assisting the Government in creating a policy and regulatory environment more
supportive of the private sector; (ii) helping the Government manage public resources more efficiently:
and (iii) supporting critical actions needed to alleviate long-term constraints on economic growth and
social development, with a focus on population, health and education. The proposed project is a central
part of this assistance strategy. The programs required to implement this strategy need considerable
external financial support and a strong Government commitment. IDA has played a catalytic role in a
number of important policy reforms recently adopted by the Government in the health sector (para. 2.59)
and is best situated to mobilize the needed assistance from the donors' community and to influence the
Government's strategies. The proposed project is also consistent with IDA's human resources
development and poverty alleviation objectives in the Sahel, as well as with the AF5 AIDS prevention
strategy. Finally, the project would provide a framework for enhanced donor coordination in the areas
of population and HIV/AIDS prevention.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Scope
3.1            The overall objectives of the project are to enhance the onset of fertility decline by
increasing the use of modern methods of contraception, and slow the spread of HIV infection by
promoting behavioral change and treating STDs. To attain these objectives, the project would support
policies and investments designed to: (a) support the implementation of the Government's population
policy, and (b) strengthen the national capacity to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs.
3.2            The project finances the bulk of the Government population/FP and HIV/AIDS/STD
control programs for the 1995-1999 period. Because a number of traditionally important donors in the
health and population sectors, such as USAID and the Canadian CIDA, are phasing out their support to
Burkina, while other donors, such as UNFPA and WHO, have had to reduce their participation due to
financial difficulties, the Government has increasingly come to rely on IDA for the provision of funds
needed to implement the two programs.
B. Project Description
3.3            The activities the project would support are summarized below.
PROJECT COMPONENTS
1. Support the Implementation of Government's Population Policy (US$15.6 milBon):
(a) Improving the quality of, and access to, MCH/FP services:
(i)    expanding FP services through the Public Health System
(ii)   establishing an outreach program
(b) Promoting information, education, and communications programs:
(i)   increasing support for population issues among opinion leaders
(ii)   increasing public knowledge of, and demand for, contraceptive services
(iii)   enhancing public understanding of women's rights and problems
(c) Institutional strengthening:
(i)   strengthening CONAPO's Pernanent Secretariat
(ii)   strengthening the Family Health Directorate (DSF)
(iii)  strengthening the Family Promotion Directorate (DPF)
2. Strengthen the National Capacity to Contain the Spread of HIVlAIDSISTDs (US$14.9 millon)
(a) Strengthening the national AIDS committee and the health system's capacity to deal with AIDS needs
(b) Promoting safer health practices and behavioral changes through information, education, and
communications campaigns
(c) Promoting the use of condoms
(d) Treating STDs
(e) Strengthening clinical management and community care
3. Encourage Private Sector and NGO Participation in Population, FP, and HIVtAIDS/STD Proguams
(US$4.0 milLion)
(a) Establishing a Fund



18
3.4          Project health and FP activities would be integrated into the existing health infrastructure.
They would, however, to the extent possible, make use of the existing network of NGOs and of the
private sector. The Government's strategy for population and AIDS control is stated in two letters of
Sector Development Policies, which include time-bound indicators (Annex 2).
1. Support for the Implementation of the Government's Population Policy (US$15.6 million)
a. Improving the Quality of, and Access to, MCH/FP Services (US$6.2 million)
3.5          This component would support the implementation of the National FP Strategy. A
complement to ongoing activities financed by IDA, USAID and UNFPA, it aims at increasing the
contraceptive prevalence from 17% to 32% in urban areas and from 1.5% to 9% in rural areas by 1999,
thus increasing the number of FP users from 80,000 to about 350,000. To improve the quality of FP
services considerable emphasis would be given under the project to upgrading the skills of health workers
through training and providing them with the needed supplies. Access to FP services would be improved
by (a) expanding services provided by the public health system; and (b) establishing an outreach program.
3.6          Expanding FP Services through the Public Health System. With donors' support, the
DSF has established FP services, integrated into MCH services, at the level of national and regional
hospitals (CHN and CHR), of medical centers (CM), and in 250 of about 650 existing health centers
(CSPS) (para. 2.8). The proposed project would help extend coverage of FP services to the remaining
400 CSPS. To help achieve this objective the project would finance the following activities: (i) FP
training of 700 nurses and 400 obstetrical assistants; (ii) training of 60 regional trainers, 50 doctors and
100 nurses in NORPLANT insertion; (iii) provision of contraceptives to meet 80% of national needs;
and (iv) support for MCH activities. To develop a standard approach to FP/MCH services, the DSF has
elaborated performance norms for each level of service and has established mandatory qualifications for
the personnel providing FP/MCH services. Norms and qualifications are summarized in the document
Politique et standards de SMI/PF (para. 2.53).
3.7          Training will focus on developing the technical competence as well as counselling skills
of health personnel and will be reinforced through close supervision. DSF's team of trainers would
organize 20 three-week FP workshops to provide FP training to nurses and obstetrical assistants. This
training would take place in DSF's five regional training centers. The health districts being established
under the ongoing health operation and the new health and nutrition project would gradually take over
this training. In addition, 6 two-week workshops would be organized to train regional FP trainers,
physicians and nurses in NORPLANT insertion.
3.8          The MS has transferred two physicians to DSF to strengthen its supervisory function.
Both training and supervision should improve and become more sustainable as the MS decentralizes its
activities and training will become the responsibility of the district medical officer. Staff at DSF's regional
training centers would provide support to the districts for FP training. A detailed training program for
the project was discussed and agreed upon at negotiations. Approval by the Government of the agreed
training program would a condition of credit effectiveness. The training to be supported under the project
is summarized in Annex 3.
3.9          The DSF has estimated contraceptive needs for the 1995-1999 period, based on the target
CP rates set for 1999 and the mix of contraceptive methods envisaged (Table 2).
3.10         While in the past, UNFPA, USAID and IPPF covered all the country's contraceptive
needs, due to reduced support from these donors, in the future, 80% of these needs (about



19
US$4.4 million) would be met by IDA. The
list of contraceptives to be imported in the    Table 2: Contraceptive Needs for the 199S-99 Period
country has been integrated into the official
list of essential drugs. NORPLANT, a                          Users         Costs

3.11          Contraceptives and condoms
for both the FP and AIDS prevention
programs would be procured through the new buying agency for essential, generic drugs (CAMEG),
established with the assistance of IDA and other donors. However, in view of MS's inexperience in
directly procuring these items (their procurement has so far been handled by donors) and the need to base
these purchases on detailed procurement tables which take into account current usage patterns and usage
projections (oral contraceptives and condoms have a short shelf life), MS would receive assistance from
WHO for the procurement of condoms and that of UNFPA for the procurement of contraceptives. These
agencies would assist the MS in the preparation of detailed procurement tables and ensure that
procurement is made from reliable sources only. WHO has considerable experience in procuring high-
quality, low-cost condoms. Government signing of technical assistance agreements with WHO, for the
procurement of condoms, and with UNFPA, for the procurement of contraceptives, would be a condition
of credit effectiveness. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that (a) it will review with
IDA the above technical assistance arrangements at the end of the second year of project implementation
to decide whether to further extend them, and (b) following the first shipment of contraceptives and
condoms, it will monitor their distribution and take corrective actions if logistics or stock management
are not found satisfactory. Monitoring would include the undertaking of bi-annual contraceptive
prevalence (CP) surveys using rapid assessment procedures.
3.12          Successful promotion of FP activities would also depend on the credibility of MCH
services being offered in health facilities and their ability to attract potential clients for FP. Preliminary
results of an evaluation of the Government's MCH program for the 1988-1992 period point to several
shortcomings in the program: (1) lack of essential drugs, supplies and equipment in health facilities; (2)
lack of emergency care in rural areas; (3) failure to provide proper information to mothers about their
health conditions and that of their children; (4) absence of health education; and (5) poor health
provider/client relationships. This last constraint was also identified in the course of a beneficiary
assessment conducted in 1992 in three provinces of Burkina Faso as part of the preparation of this and
the Health and Nutrition Project, and appears to be an important factor in the low utilization of public
health services. Based on the findings of the evaluation, DSF has elaborated a new MCH strategy for
1994-1998, establishing the following priority areas for action: (i) improving the quality of MCH services
through training of staff and provision of drugs, supplies and equipment; (ii) ensuring regular supervision;
(iii) improving communications skills of health personnel; and (iv) improving data collection and analysis.
3.13          MCH activities at the district level would receive support from the recently approved
Health and Nutrition Project, which would finance training, equipment, materials and drugs, and nutrition
activities. The proposed project would integrate this support by addressing some of the barriers to prompt
and adequate treatment of complications of pregnancy such as the availability of transportation and



20
encouraging programs within communities (carried out by NGOs and other private organizations with
financing provided under the Fund) that would be directed toward educating community members,
especially women and TBAs, to recognize the symptoms of serious complications of pregnancy or
delivery and educate them about the danger of delays. To address the lack of transportation at the village
level for the evacuation of emergency cases, the project would finance the construction of animal-drawn
village ambulances for 400 selected villages, which would be responsible for their upkeep. The animals
(donkeys) would be provided by the villagers. The DSF would also test, under the project, carts to be
drawn by motorcycle. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will (a) construct
animal-drawn village ambulances for about 50 selected villages; (b) evaluate the effectiveness of the
ambulances after one year; (c) report the result of the evaluation to IDA; and (iv) expand, if found
satisfactory and recommended by IDA, such construction to an additional 350 villages.
3.14         PrTject Sup hgrt. 'Me project would finance: FP training equipment; the design and
construction of 400 carts for the emergency evacuation program; contraceptives; specialist services for
the evaluation of the village ambulances pilot operation and for studies and research; training of 400
obstetrical assistants, 800 nurses, 50 doctors and 60 regional trainers (para. 3.6); operating costs for field
supervision (the Implementation Manual to be finalized before the project launch seminar will contain
detailed terms of reference for field supervision); and the maintenance of training equipment.
3.15         Establishing an Outreach Program. The recently approved national FP strategy (2.53)
authorizes itinerant health workers (IHW), traditional birth attendants (TBA), and village health workers
(VHW) to refill contraceptive prescriptions (pills) for women who have already been screened by a health
facility. This outreach program would be introduced in 400 villages where TBAs have already received
some FP/MCH training under a UNFPA-financed project. 400 TBAs would receive one-week training
and an initial free supply of pills. They would be able to restock their supply at a public health facility
with the proceeds of their sales. The program would be supervised by the DSF. A cost-recovery program
for essential drugs (including contraceptives and preservatives) soon to be implemented in the context of
the Health and Nutrition Project will establish the benefit margins at each level of the distribution chain
down to the TBAs.
3.16         The project would support community-based FP distribution programs to be carried out
by NGOs with financing provided under a Fund (para. 3.71). Pilot operations similar to the one carried
out by ABSF with USAID financing (para. 2.9) would be given priority in the criteria for Fund
allocations.
3.17         The sub-component would include institutional and operational support for the IPPF-
affiliated ABBEF. This support would include: (a) the extension of the existing model clinic in
Ouagadougou; (b) a pilot project for a community-based distribution (CBD) of contraceptives in the
provinces of Houet, Kouritenga and Kadiogo; and FP and AIDS/STD counselling services targeted to the
youth in the town of Koudougou. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will
support ABBEF through (a) the construction of an extension to the model clinic in Ouagadougou; (b) the
implementation of a pilot project of a community-based distribution of contraceptives in three selected
provinces; and (c) FP and HIV/STDs prevention counselling to youth in Koudougou.
3.18         Project Suppor. The project would finance: civil works for the extension of ABBEF's
clinic in Ouagadougou; furniture and equipment for the clinic; audio-visual equipment and material for
ABBEF's IEC activities; 53 motorcycles for the midwives' supervisory activities (to be placed at the
district level); the training of TBA's and ABBEF's staff and volunteers carried out by the DSF; operating
cost for field supervision, the details of which will be described in the Implementation Manual.



21
b. Promoting Information, Education and Communications (IEC) Programns (US$4.0 million)
3.19         There will be three elements to this sub-component. The first will be designed to increase
public support for population issues among opinion leaders and will be managed by the Permanent
Secretariat of CONAPO in the Ministry of Finance and Plan. The second will focus on increasing public
knowledge of, and demand for, modem contraceptive methods, with the DSF having lead responsibility.
The third will center on enhancing public understanding of women's rights and problems, with the DPF
playing the pivotal role. While two of these elements are not directly focussed on building demand for
contraception, they play crucial supporting roles in creating a positive climate for contraceptive use. To
ensure that the work of the entities participating in this three-pronged approach is well coordinated, the
Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO will convene monthly meetings of the key IEC staff. These meetings
will also include the National AIDS Committee's IEC specialist, much of whose work parallels that in
population IEC.
3.20         Given the pivotal importance of IEC to the project's success, as well as the need to
strengthen the IEC capabilities of the different agencies, the Government will engage an international
agency to provide 36 person-months of non-resident technical assistance. This will consist of one lead
adviser, supported by other consultants to help with specific tasks, who would periodically visit the
country. This IEC assistance will cover both the population and AIDS/STD sub-components of the
project. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that (a) it will recruit an IEC firm for a
three-year period for the provision of non-resident specialist services and a national counterpart in
CONAPO with qualifications agreeable to IDA, and (b) it will maintain the counterpart in post for the
duration of the project. The recruitment of two national IEC specialists by the CNLS is part of the
condition of effectiveness concerning the restructuring of the CNLS (para. 3.44).
3.21         A knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) survey to be conducted before project start
with financing provided under the ongoing health operation, will provide baseline data needed to establish
quantified objectives and measure the impact at the end of the project when the KAP survey will be
repeated. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will undertake a KAP survey in
year 5 of the project.
3.22         Since the project will make extensive use of mass media, both for FP and AIDS
prevention, the Government will obtain the collaboration of the Ministry of Communications. Funds are
provided either to pay for broadcast time or to purchase equipment or materials needed by Burkina's
radio and television. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the Ministry of Finance
and Plan will enter into agreement with the Ministry of Communications for the undertaking of EEC mass
media activities under the project.
3.23         Increasing Support for Population Issues Among Opinion Leaders. The Permanent
Secretariat of CONAPO will seek to improve the national leaders' understanding of the relationship
between population trends and development and to mobilize them on population matters. The main focus
will be on political, traditional and religious leaders at the national and regional levels. A national
communication specialist will be re-assigned by the Government to the Secretariat to strengthen its
capacity to disseminate information and research in a manner most likely to maximize the utilization of
information by the agencies and organizations with which it will interact.
3.24         The Secretariat will synthesize policy-relevant information and research findings into a
total of 20 short, attractive, user-friendly publications and audio-visual presentations. The kinds of topics
to be addressed will be the 1991 population policy, the Demographic and Health Survey, census results,
etc. It will also conduct about 30 seminars for a total of 1,500 opinion leaders, working in conjunction



22
with the regional offices of the Ministry of Finance and Plan on the organization of seminars in the
regions. A quarterly bulletin covering topics relevant to all the participants in the project will be
produced and disseminated and contact will be maintained with the media to assure coverage of
population matters. During negotiations the Government gave assurances that at each year's annual review
meeting with IDA, it will agree on the seminars to be undertaken, the content of which to be satisfactory
to IDA.
3.25         Increasing Public Knowledge of. and Demand for. Contraceptive Services. The IEC Unit
of the DSF has accomplished a considerable amount of work in recent years, with support and technical
assistance from Population Communications Services of the Johns Hopkins University. However, with
that support expected to end as this project begins, the directorate believes the time is right to rethink its
IEC strategy. The challenge will be to take relatively high awareness of contraception in the urban areas
and translate it into broader use of modern methods, while beginning to reach out into rural zones. Both
quantitative and qualitative IEC research will be used throughout the project to identify target audiences,
effective messages and channels of communication, as well as to assess the impact of IEC activities,
materials and messages. Such research will serve to refine the DSF's MEC strategy on a continuing basis
and will play a particularly crucial role in the development of mass media activities. Ongoing work to
integrate family planning messages into popular radio programs will be continued and expanded to
television. In addition, the directorate will test the use of short, frequently repeated spots to communicate
simple family planning messages. Both for IEC research and for mass media production, the DSF will
contract with local research institutions and advertising agencies to undertake much of the work.
3.26         Interpersonal communications play a crucial role in conveying complex messages and
strengthening motivation to use family planning. To dramatically expand the level of interpersonal
commnunication, the project will fund decentralized IEC activities through the 10 CRESAs (para. 2.34).
The CRESAs will work with the health districts to develop IEC proposals that will be submitted to the
central level for funding. In the field, the same people are often responsible for IEC both on family
planning and AIDS/STDs; so the decentralized program will focus on both topics. The program will be
administered by the CNIEC/Sante in collaboration with the DSF and the CNLS. These agencies will
collaborate in phasing in 2-3 CRESAs a year, providing training and technical assistance to ensure the
development of solid and accountable programs. Decentralized activities will reach out to women's
associations, agricultural cooperatives, traditional healers, schools, large enterprises and other groups
beyond the health system, with men, youth and opinion leaders being priority target audiences. The
program will provide the means to touch rural areas, to use traditional forms of communication, such as
songs and folk theater, and to encourage innovation. Backing up these local efforts, the Family Health
Directorate will also conduct four seminars a year for opinion leaders. These will differ from those
conducted by CONAPO inasmuch as they will focus on family planning and health issues, as opposed
to population and development.
3.27         While decentralized activities will seek to build up demand for contraception outside the
health system, the interpersonal communications skills of health workers will also be upgraded through
training. The 700 nurses and 400 auxiliary midwives to be trained in the provision of contraceptive care
(para. 3.6) will receive more extensive IEC training than in the past. And a new strategy of providing
"information packages" to women when they come to a health center will be explored and tested. The
"information package" would link family planning with other health interventions such as prenatal care,
delivery, vaccination and well-baby check-ups. If it proves successful, 750 health workers around the
country will be trained to provide these "packages". The project would also expand the Population
Education Project in the Ministry of Secondary Education and Scientific Research initiated with funding
provided by UNFPA. Specifically, the project would train 1,000 secondary school teachers to integrate
population topics--including faniily planning, AIDS prevention, information on the status of women and



23
other topics-into the school curriculum. Support will also be provided for the production of teaching
aids and the purchase of slide projectors.
3.28         Enhancing Public Understanding of Women's Rights and Problems. A new Family Code
establishing many ground-breaking rights for women was adopted in Burkina in 1991.  Since
dissemination of information about these rights can be expected to improve the status of women and thus
create a climate more conducive to family planning, the project will promote this dissemination. Jointly
with the Netherlands Government, the project will support a pilot operation aimed at disseminating the
Family Code in four provinces of the country. Legal information centers will be established and a range
of information about women's rights will be provided, including information about family planning and
AIDS.
3.29         Although outlawed, the practice of excision is still widespread in Burkina, with deleterious
health consequences for young women and girls. The National Committee Against Excision is a
volunteer body that has established 10 provincial and hundreds of local committees to educate the public
about this harmful practice. The project will help support the national committee's plan of action,
enabling it to increase the number of provincial and local committees against excision, develop
educational materials for use by the committees, reproduce a film and work with the mass media to
educate the public about the deleterious effects of excision.
3.30         For several years the DSF has trained social workers in FP communication with the
cooperation of the DPF. Under the project, the latter will assume responsibility for this training. The
directorate will use the curriculum and training team already in place and will continue to work closely
with the Famnily Health Directorate. Approximately 180 social workers will be trained over the life of
the project in FP and AIDS/STD communication. A detailed description of the IEC activities to be
carried out under the project is in Annex 4.
3.31         Project Suppor. The project will finance the production and purchase of educational and
promotional materials, 36 person-months of non-resident international specialist services (para. 3.20),
local specialist services (artists, theater groups, song writers, researchers, printers, advertising agencies),
in-country training and seminars (for health and social work staff, teachers, opinion leaders and others),
decentralized IEC activities through the CRESAs, and the establishment of legal information centers for
women. IEC equipment and supplies, training abroad, study tours, maintenance and operation of
equipment, and costs for supervision are financed under the institutional strengthening sub-components.
c. Strengthening Institutions in Charge of Implementing the Population Policy
and of Planning, Managing and Evaluating the National FP Programs
(US$5.4 million)
3.32         This sub-component would strengthen three institutions: (a) the Permanent Secretariat of
the Interministerial Population Committee (CONAPO) in the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Plan,
in charge of disseminating and operationalizing the Government's population policy; (b) the Family
Health Directorate (DSF) of the Ministry of Health (MS), responsible for designing and implementing
the Government FP program; and (c) and the Directorate of Family Promotion (DPF) of the MASF,
which has the mandate to promote social programs.
3.33         Strengthening the Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO. CONAPO is charged with
coordinating all activities related to population, including promulgation and implementation of the official
population policy, representation of the government's position at international population fora (such as
the UN World Population Conference in Cairo in 1994), and the dissemination of population related



24
research findings to be applied to government planning, policy making, and program implementation or
improvement. In December 1993, the Government signed legislation defining the role and function of
CONAPO, its Secretariat and four commissions, in the implementation of the Government population
policy. The objective of this sub-component is to enable CONAPO's Permanent Secretariat to effectively
assume a leadership role in the implementation of the above tasks. The project would build on efforts
begun under a UNFPA-supported project (closing at the end of 1994) to strengthen the capacity of the
Secretariat. These efforts have been constrained by understaffing (only recently the staff of the
Secretariat, originally composed of two demographers, has been expanded with the addition of two
economists) and lack of equipment, material and basic office supplies.
3.34         In addition to its communications and coordination activities, the Secretariat would
promote, coordinate and carry out demographic research. The bulk of it would, however, be contracted
out to local individuals or agencies. CONAPO would hire the services of local specialists to review
existing demographic research and the service of an international consultant to prepare a research
program for the project period agreeable to IDA. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it will (i) submit to IDA by June 30, 1995, a research program acceptable to the Association, and
(ii) complete this program by June 30, 1998. The project would also provide technical assistance (local
and international specialist services) to strengthen the Secretariat's capacity to manage its various tasks.
A detailed description of CONAPO's strengthening program is in Annex 5.
3.35         The Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO  would be also responsible for project
coordination. The Permanent Secretary would, however, delegate day-to-day coordination and monitoring
responsibilities to a national Coordinator. The Coordinator would be assisted by an administrator, who
would be responsible for managing the Fund (para. 3.71) and for procurement; a monitoring and
evaluation specialist, an accountant, a junior accountant, and two secretaries. These positions would be
financed under the project. The tasks of the coordinating team would be to: a) administer the Fund; b)
coordinate the preparation of annual work programs and budgets for all components; c) maintain and
consolidate projects accounts, including the Special Account; d) make arrangements for audit of project
accounts; e) prepare semi-annual progress reports for IDA, the Government and the cofinanciers; f)
monitor project activities, and g) coordinate procurement, as well as carry out procurement of items that
would not be procured by the CAMEG. With funds from the ongoing health project, CONAPO will
recruit a qualified accounting firm, experienced in working according to the International Accounting
Standards and acceptable to IDA, to establish a computerized accounting system and train the project
accountants. Prior to negotiations, the MFP appointed a Coordinator, whose qualifications were reviewed
and approved during appraisal. Establishment of (a) the Coordinating team within CONAPO with
personnel in numbers and qualifications agreeable to IDA, and (b) the accounting system, satisfactory to
IDA, would be conditions of credit effectiveness.
3.36         Project Support. The project would finance: computers and other office equipment; office
furniture and supplies; audio-visual equipment; three vehicles, of which two 4x4; 12 man-months of local
specialist services; salaries of the coordinating unit staff; training of CONAPO's staff (training abroad
for the IEC specialist and local training for 8 staff, including staff of the project coordination team); 11
man-months of international specialist services (to strengthen CONAPO's various activities); and
operating expenses.
3.37         Strengthening the Family Health Directorate (DSF). The objective of this sub-component
is to enhance DSF's capacity to play a leadership role in FP/MCH, nutrition, and vaccination, where
numerous national and international players intervene and coordination is weak. The DSF recently
completed the preparation of national MCH, FP, and nutrition strategies but has still to finalize a
vaccination strategy. The project would help the DSF: (a) establish effective procedures for the



25
preparation and periodic revisions of its national vaccination, nutrition, and FP/MCH programs, and their
integration into a coherent national family health program (although nutrition and vaccination activities
are supported under the Health and Nutrition project, strengthening of DSF's capacity to manage these
programs has been included under this project); (b) implement a more rational distribution of tasks and
personnel inside the organization; and (c) strengthen coordinating and supervisory functions, as well as
the capacity to provide effective support to the provinces and districts on family health matters.
3.38         DSF would review the objectives of its sectoral programs with concerned staff, and reach
a consensus on activities that would need to be carried out to achieve those objectives. Sectoral programs
would be integrated into a comprehensive national family health program. Training in program
management would be provided to four of DSF's senior staff to strengthen their competence in this field.
Short-term international technical assistance would be recruited to assist DSF's management in the process
that would lead to the preparation of the integrated program. The DSF would also obtain professional
advice to carry out its internal reorganization aimed at creating a more functional and streamlined
structure, and strengthening coordinating and supervisory functions. The project would finance the
rehabilitation and expansion of DSF's headquarters. It would also refurbish its five regional training
centers. A local consultant would be hired to help the DSF organize its documentation and filing system.
Details of the sub-component are provided in Annex 6.
3.39         Project Suppr The project would finance: civil works for the expansion of the DSF and
the rehabilitation of regional training centers; furniture and equipment for the new offices and the regional
training centers; two 4x4 vehicles for supervision activities; local and foreign training (in-service training
for 15 trainers, while 6 senior staff would receive advanced training abroad in FP/IEC program
management and IEC techniques, and 12 in health management); 6 man-months of a local specialist
services, and a total of 9 man-months of international specialist services to help prepare an integrated
family health program, and carry out DSF's reorganization; workshops to integrate the national program;
O&M of vehicles and equipment; office, audio-visual supplies; subscription to specialized magazines and
purchase of books; operating expenses for supervision.
3.40         Stren_thening the Directorate for the Promotion of the Family (DPF). In March 1994
the Government re-established the Ministry of Social Action and Family (MASF), which in 1987 had
been merged with the Ministry of Health. Within the MASF, the DPF has the mandate to promote
women's rights, sensitizing and educating the population about the new family code, and raising
awareness among the population about the hazards of certain traditional health practices, such as
circumcision. In November 1992, DPF had been selected by a multisectoral group to chair an
interagency IEC commission established within (and coordinated by) CONAPO. Under the project, the
DPF will play a pivotal role in promoting women's rights and training social workers. It will also develop
the AIDS/STD content of the curriculum of the National School of Social Service (ENFS), train teachers
in that subject matter, and chair meetings of CONAPO's IEC commission. The project would provide
IEC training and equipment to strengthen DPF's capacity to carry out the activities foreseen under the
project. This support would complement that envisaged by the Dutch Government and UNFPA in the
context of forthcoming operations. DPF's current weakness has raised the concern of a number of donors
who might otherwise be interested in supporting the Directorate's activities. The MASF recently agreed
with the Netherlands Government that it will (a) undertake, by May 1994, a management review of the
different Social Action Directorates, and (b) implement the recommendations that would result from this
review.
3.41         project Support. The project would finance: equipment, including three computers, one
printer and one photocopier; audio-visual equipment; office furniture and supplies; one month IEC



26
training in an African country for two staff; audio-visual supplies; O&M of office equipment; subscription
to specialized magazines and purchase of books.
2. Strengthen the National Capacity to Contain the Spread of HlFV/AIDS/STDs
(US$14.9 million)
3.42         This component aims to radically strengthen Burkina's capacity to respond to the HIV
epidemic by preventing HIV transmission through a massive effort to promote behavioral change and
reduce the prevalence of STDs and mitigate the impact of AIDS on individuals, families and the
community. There are five sub-components: (a) strengthening various institutions and building capacity
to deal with AIDS needs; (b) promoting safer health practices and behavioral change through information,
education and communications campaigns; (c) promoting the use of condoms; (d) treating STDs; and (e)
strengthening clinical management and community care.
a. Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$4.2 million)
3.43         This sub-component would include: (i) strengthening the capacity of the Permanent
Secretariat of the National AIDS Committee (CNLS) to manage and coordinate the AIDS control
program; (ii) improving the capacity of the health system to provide basic information on the development
of the HIV epidemic, linked with information on STDs; (iii) ensuring blood safety; and (iv) undertaking
operational research to improve interventions supported by the project.
3.44         Strengthening CNLS's Capacity to Manage and Coordinate the AIDS Control Program.
The limited capacity to manage and coordinate HIV/AIDS control activities is a major constraint to their
effective implementation (para. 2.38). While overall policy regarding AIDS control is coordinated by the
interministerial CNLS, day-to-day implementation of AIDS activities is the responsibility of CNLS's
Permanent Secretariat. The project would strengthen this unit's management capacity. The Permanent
Secretary of the CNLS would be given main responsibility for the implementation of AIDS activities. He
would be assisted on a full-time basis by three technical officers, two responsible for implementing IEC
activities and one responsible for coordinating activities in the areas of epidemiological surveillance,
laboratory, and research. While the latter expert is already in post, the two IEC specialists would be
recruted by the project from the private sector. During negotiations, the Burkinabd delegation also agreed
that the Minister of Health would assign to the CNLS three additional experts on a part-time basis. This
arrangement, which takes into account the human resource constraints currently faced by the Ministry
of Health, will be reviewed during the project mid-term evaluation. Jointly with this technical staff, the
Permanent Secretary would be responsible for planning, coordinating, managing and monitoring all AIDS
activities carried out under the project, as described in paras. 3.47-3.70. He would collaborate with the
public health system, as well as with NGOs and other private sector organizations. In addition to the
technical staff, the Secretariat would have an accountant, an administrative officer and an officer in
charge of donor coordination. The MS is currently building an office facility that would house the
Permanent Secretariat. The reorganization of the Permanent Secretariat and its staffing with adequate
personnel in numbers and qualifications described above, as well as the enactment of a new ministerial
decree clarifying the roles and functions of the Permanent Secretary and of the technical subcommittees
would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
3.45         CNLS's technical sub-committees (para. 2.38) would constitute an advisory body. They
would develop national policies and strategies in AIDS control, assist the Secretariat in developing
operational guidelines, and periodically review the HIV/AIDS/STD situation in the country.



27
3.46         To help build up its capacity to implement and monitor the activities envisaged under the
project, the Permanent Secretariat would enter into a twinning arrangement with a specialized institution
which would provide non-resident consultant services for a total of about 36 man-months to be used
during the project implementation period. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the
Permanent Secretariat of the CNLS will enter into such an arrangement by March 31, 1995. Funds for
this assistance are provided under the Credit.
3.47         Improving Epidemiological Surveillance. As indicated in para. 2.36, underreporting is
hampering the Government's ability to control the spread of HIV/AIDS/STD. The project would
strengthen the institutional capacity to provide basic information needed to monitor the development of
the HIV epidemics and related diseases, as well as that of the STDs. Surveillance may be either active
(active search of cases) or passive (using existing data from health centers or hospital records). Active
surveillance would be established in five strategically located sentinel sites: Ouagadougou, Bobo-
Dioulasso, Gaoua, Fada Ngourma, et Ouahigouya. In all these sites tests would be conducted once a year,
over a three-month period, among a given number of low-risk (pregnant women) and high-risk
populations (STD clients and commercial sex workers). Surveillance among low-risk cases can help assess
the prevalence of HIV in the general population. The size of the populations to be studied would depend
on the existing HIV prevalence. Data collected would be analyzed locally with the assistance of the
regional epidemniological surveillance centers (CSEs) (para. 2.36), and the results would be sent to the
epidemiological surveillance unit at the Preventive Medicine Directorate (DMP). The latter would conduct
periodic supervisory visits to the sites to ensure that activities being performed are consistent with
required procedures.
3.48         All other health facilities at the district, regional, and national levels, (53, 9, and 2,
respectively) that have a laboratory equipped to undertake HIV tests would be required to send every two
months data on identified infections to the epidemiological surveillance unit at the DPM, using standard
notification forms which would be developed under the project. The regional CSEs and the Provincial
Health Directorates would be requested to periodically remind the health facilities to fill and send the
notification forms. For this passive surveillance, cases will be reported using WHO (Bangui) AIDS case
definition. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the above reporting system will be
in place by June 30, 1995.
3.49         HIV surveillance training and refresher courses on HIV surveillance would be provided
to the staff at the sentinel sites as well as to health workers in health facilities involved in passive
surveillance. Since HIV surveillance would be closely linked to STD surveillance, training would cover
both STD and HIV surveillance. Details on the epidemiological surveillance are in Annex 7.
3.50         Improving Blood Security Capacity. At the hospital level (national and regional hospitals)
the project would finance the provision of medical supplies to ensure the sustainability of existing blood
screening facilities. The hospitals handle the country's blood banks, while blood transfusion is carried
out by the CMs. The two CHNs, two CHRs (Ouahigouya and Tenkodogo) and the military hospital in
Ouagadougou are equipped with ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immuno-sorbent Assay, an in-vitrio test) Chains
(three financed by IDA under the ongoing project). The remaining CHRs and a number of CMs were
provided with rapid HIV tests under the first Medium-Term Plan (MTP). Continuous break downs in the
supply of tests and medical and laboratory supplies, have considerably constrained blood screening
activities of the above facilities. The project would ensure that the five facilities equipped with ELISA
Chains would receive a regular supply of ELISA and Hepatitis B tests, as well as medical and MIS
supplies. It would also provide medical supplies for the National Reference Laboratory (LNR) at the CHN
of Ouagadougou, thus improving its effectiveness. The laboratory performs Western Blot confirmatory
HIV tests and is linked to the country blood screening facilities for quality control. Provisions would be



28
made for safe disposal of HIV-positive blood and serum samples and instruments by incineration and
disinfection and for protective supplies (protective clothing, gloves, and infection control supplies). In
addition, the project would assist the Government in strengthening blood collection systems in
collaboration with the Burkinabe Red Cross.
3.51          Operational Research. The project would fund research aimed at improving interventions
supported by the project, in particular in the following areas: HIV/STD prevalence among gold miners,
prisoners, migrants and tuberculosis patients; mother/child transmission of HIV; validation of the
syndromic diagnosis of STDs; periodic assessment of the STD surveillance system; and in-depth study
of the economic impact of AIDS. During negotiations the Government agreed that the CNLS will conduct
in 1995 two researches (mother/child transmission of HIV and HIV/STD prevalence among gold miners).
The timetable for other research work would be agreed during the annual joint Government/IDA review
meetings. The Government also gave assurances that a) the research program will be undertaken in
accordance with the agreed timetable and on the basis of terms of reference for the consultants agreeable
to IDA; and b) it will review with IDA the research carried out and implement the agreed follow-up
action plan.
3.52         Project Suport. The project would finance: the rehabilitation of a cold storage room at
the National Hospital in Ouagadougou, where tests to be imported would be stored; audio-visual
equipment for the CNLS; four vehicles; 25 motorcycles for the CSEs' staff; two computers and a printer
for the CNLS; material and equipment for the CSEs; MIS and lab material; medical and protective
supplies; HIV tests; training of sentinel sites personnel (six per site); training in epidemiological
surveillance for 76 doctors and 16 nurses; 2 man-months training in maintenance of equipment at the
national hospitals; IEC training for two staff at the CNLS; 2.5 person-months of international specialist
services and 2.5 person-months of local specialist services to help strengthen CNLS's organization,
review the 1993-1995 MTP and prepare the next medium-term AIDS program; local specialist services
(6 man-months) for operational research and 39 man-months of international specialist services (3 man-
months for a study on the economic impact of AIDS, and 36 man-months for the twinning arrangement
between the CNLS and a foreign institution); study tours to other African countries; coordination
activities with neighboring countries, subscription to journals and magazines dealing with AIDS; O&M
of materials and vehicles; and operating costs for supervision.
b. Promoting Safer Health Practices and Behavioral Change through Information,
Education and Communications Campaigns (US$2.6 million)
3.53         Although awareness of AIDS is increasing rapidly in Burkina as a result of the dramatic
increase of AIDS cases, efforts to educate the population on the causes of AIDS needs to be strengthened.
In particular, there is an urgent need to ensure that the increased awareness is translated into behavioral
change. This sub-component will aim at improving knowledge of risk behaviors, providing information
about prevention, and dispelling misconceptions related to HIV/AIDS. The youth would be an important
target of IEC interventions. The pre-project KAP survey (para. 3.21) will provide baseline data permitting
to establish quantitative targets and a repetition of the survey in Year 5 of the project will allow the
impact of the IEC sub-component to be measured. Mass media will be used intensively to convince the
public as a whole that AIDS is a reality and prevention should be a priority for each individual.
Interpersonal communications through a variety of channels will reinforce this message and will provide
more detailed information about condom use, particularly to groups at high risk. Considerable efforts
will also be devoted to STDs which have received little attention to date. IEC campaigns will provide
information on the symptoms and consequences of STDs, the relationship between STD and HIV, the
importance of spousal communication regarding STDs, and how to access services for diagnosis and
treatment. While all methods of transmission and prevention will be covered, the major emphasis will



29
be on sexual transmission, as it is the most significant route of infection, and on condom use and sexual
behavior change as the primary means of prevention.
3.54         The Permanent Secretariat of the CNLS will undertake both quantitative and qualitative
research to guide the development of its IEC program on a continuing basis. While the Secretariat will
play a major role in the design of the research and the interpretation of results, the technical aspects of
the work will be undertaken by outside researchers whenever possible. Once the results of the pre-project
KAP survey are available, there will be a national seminar to define an HIV/AIDS/STD strategy.
3.55         IEC research will also serve as the foundation for intensive mass media campaigns. There
will be extensive use of short spots, particularly on radio. This activity will be reinforced by the
integration of information about HIV/AIDS and its prevention into ongoing radio and television programs
such as those on health, those for women, popular theater, etc. Mass media material will be developed
with a local advertising agency, carefully tested before going into production, and assessed after
broadcast. Since mass media is costly, however, there will be an outside evaluation after two years of
the role of the mass media in advancing the project's AIDS/STD IEC objectives. During negotiations,
the Govermment gave assurances that (a) the national seminar to establish the IEC strategy for
HIV/AIDS/STDs will be held no later than June 30, 1995 and that the strategy will be discussed with
IDA and finalized no later than September 30, 1995; and (b) at the end of the second year of project
implementation, it will undertake the evaluation of the mass-media impact, discuss its recommendations
with IDA, and implement an agreed-upon action plan.
3.56         Mass media needs to go hand in hand with interpersonal communications. As described
in para. 3.26, the CNIEC/Sante will administer, in collaboration with the CNLS and the DSF, a program
of decentralized IEC activities, with particular emphasis on interpersonal communications, through the
CRESAs. These activities will have a special focus on groups at high risk of AIDS/STDS. The kinds
of activities to be supported will also include peer education; AIDS prevention dances for young people;
dissemination of educational materials in hotels, bars, gas stations and elsewhere; workplace
presentations; and video presentations-accompanied whenever possible by free condom distribution. The
CNLS will pave the way for such initiatives by contacting national leaders and coordinating efforts in
Burkina with those in neighboring countries, where appropriate. It will also provide specialized
information, training and technical assistance to the CRESAs. AIDS/STD training would also be included
in the training curriculum of the DPF (para. 3.40). Anex4 provides details of the AIDS EEC program.
3.57          Uroject support. The project would finance: the production and purchase of EEC materials,
in-country training for social workers, training for the teachers of the School of Social Services and for
CRESAs' staff; seminars for opinion leaders; surveys and studies (including KAP surveys); the salaries
of the two senior IEC specialists for the CNLS hired from the private sector; decentralized TEC activities
through the CRESAs (hiring of local artists, advertising agencies, theater groups, song-writers,
researchers, etc.); mass-media activities to be contracted out by the CNLS, and audio-visual supplies.
c. Promoting Condom Use (US$3.3 million)
3.58         Under the project, condom use for both FP and HIV/AIDS/STD prevention would be
vigorously promoted. While condom needs for contraceptive purposes (para. 3.9) have been calculated
using the standard assumption that 150 condoms would be needed to provide a couple with one year's
protection, condom needs for HIV prevention have been estimated on the basis of a different assumption:
i.e., the need for a sexually active adult male to protect himself from "non-regular" sex (adolescent and
extra-marital sex). Estimates of the number of condoms needed to provide HIV protection have varied
under the various condom social marketing programs, which have so far been implemented worldwide.



30
Some programs have based their calculation of condom needs on the assumption that a sexually active
male would need 52 condoms a year to protect himself from HIV, other programs assume that couples
would need to use an average of 100 condoms a year. Population Services International (PSI), a
Washington-based NGO, which has been implementing condom social marketing programs in a number
of developing countries in Africa and elsewhere and is providing technical assistance to Burkina's
PROMACO (para. 2.35), bases its estimates of condom needs on the assumption that an average of 20
condoms a year are needed to protect a sexually active urban male from non-regular sex. The figure is
based on a study PSI has undertaken of the sexual behavior of adult urban males in Cameroon. Under
this assumption, PSI's social marketing programs reach maturity when condom distribution equals one
condom per capita. In the case of Burkina, this would correspond to a distribution of about 11.4 million
condoms by year 1998. The provision of condoms under the present project has been estimated under the
assumption that 52 condoms a year are needed to protect an adult sexually active male from 'non-regular
sex" for the 1995-1999 period.
3.59         Current sales of condoms provide HIV protection to about 2.5% of the sexually active
adult males, assuming that 52 condoms provide one-year protection from non-regular sex. Burkina Faso
health officials aim at increasing condom use to cover at least 20% of the adult male population by 1999.
It has, in fact, been suggested by a recent model of HIV transmission that a minimum of 20% use rate
may be needed to slow down the growth of new HIV cases. To attain this target, about 30 million
condoms would have to be sold yearly by 1999. PROMACO plans to increase its yearly sales of
condoms from the current level of 3 million a year to 7 million a year by 1997 (para. 2.35). The project
will assist the Government in increasing condom distribution beyond this target to reach about 15 million
condoms in 1997 and 30 million in 1999. These seemingly ambitious targets (they represent an increase
of about 400% and 900%, respectively, over the 1992 level of about 3 million condoms) are achievable,
as shown by the experience of other countries. For example, in Zimbabwe (a country with a population
size comparable to Burkina), sales of condoms grew from 3 million a year in 1985 to 35 million in 1992
as a result of a very intensive EEC effort and is estimated to have reached 50 million in 1993.
3.60         Table 3 provides estimates of condom needs for    Table 3: Condom Needs for
the 1995-1999 period to reach the above targets, taking into     the 199S-9 Period
account population growth rates. Condoms needs under the
project would be reviewed yearly and adjusted to take into                   (million)
account actual results.                                          1995           7.0
1996          10.0
3.61         The massive condom distribution and promotion       1997          15.0
described above would be achieved through the use of different   1998          22.0
distribution channels. Specifically, condoms would be provided:    Tt9 2l8Q
a) through public health facilities (mainly MCH/FP services); b)   Total       84.0
through NGOs to high risk population; and c) in conjunction with
IEC campaigns. A particular effort would be made under the
project to reach such risk groups as the military, the police, prisoners, truck drivers, miners, and
commercial sex workers. Distribution of condoms to these groups would be done either through peer
groups or through NGOs. The latter are expected to play an important role in condom promotion. A
number of them (Plan de Parrainage International, the ABBEF, Save the Children Fund, Femmes
Africaines Face au SIDA) are already quite active in AIDS prevention and the Government is increasingly
appreciating their valuable contribution and the complementarity of their efforts in this area. Condoms
would be sold at a highly subsidized price (as is currently the practice) through a variety of programs
carried out by NGOs and the the public sector. Free distribution of condoms would also be envisaged
in the course of IEC campaign and in programs targeted to high-risk groups. Under the project the
Government would also encourage private pharmacists to step up promotion and sale of condoms by
supplying theses items to them at a subsidized prices. For the distribution of condoms to the public
health facilities the essential generic drugs logistics system would be used. Promotion of condoms



31
through the public MCH/FP program is very important in the light of the high prevalence of HIV among
women attending antenatal clinics.
3.62         The project would provide 73% of the 84 million condoms expected to be purchased
during the 1995-99 period for HIV protection, with PROMACO providing the remaining 27% through
its social marketing program. In addition, the project would finance condoms needs for contraceptive
purposes (para. 3.9). Condoms for both the FP program and for AIDS prevention would be procured by
the CAMEG with the technical assistance of WHO (para. 3.10). Condom costs for both the FP and AIDS
prevention program are estimated at US$5 million over the life of the project.
d. Treating STDs (US$3.8 million)
3.63         Treatment of STDs would be a key intervention in the prevention of HIVlAIDS, since
STDs are an important risk factor for HIV infection (para. 2.37). This intervention involves prevention
as well as prompt diagnosis and effective treatment. As indicated in para. 3.53, IEC activities would
target those at risk of acquiring STDs and would encourage safer health practices (including the use of
condoms), and care seeking behavior, such as early diagnosis and treatment. STD services would be
integrated into the primary health care system. Diagnosis and treatment of STDs in pregnant women
would be included in the MCH services. To ensure more accurate diagnosis in the absence of lab tests
and allow treatment during one single visit, diagnosis and treatment would be based on the WHO-
developed syndromic approach, which bases diagnosis on a group of symptoms and treats for all diseases
that could cause that syndrome. This approach would be coupled with regular drug and condom supply.
An intensive effort would be made to reach risk groups mostly through NGOs, with financing provided
under the Fund. NGOs would also help in enlisting the support of traditional practitioners, who would
be trained to diagnose STDs and encouraged to refer the patients to health facilities for treatment.
3.64         The project would train 54 doctors and 16 nurses currently heading CM or CMA (para.
3.6), who would, in turn, train the personnel in their health facilities who would be in charge of treating
STD patients. Training would be extended to health providers in the more peripheral CSPS, after the
evaluation of the doctors' training. A system of continuous refresher training would also be envisaged
under the project. A workshop to elaborate STD treatment protocols would be organized by the end of
1994 when the results of the rapid STD assessment (para. 2.37) are expected to be available. Financing
for the rapid STD assessment and the workshop to finalize treatment protocols is provided under the
ongoing health project.
3.65         The project has estimated a total need for STD drugs of US$6. 1 million for the 1995-1999
(including contingencies). These are mostly basic antibiotics to treat the ulcer diseases and genital
discharges (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia) that facilitate HIV transmission. The recommended drugs
are already included in Burkina's list of essential drugs. The project would finance about 61% of these
needs; the balance is expected to be financed by other donors outside the framework of this project.
Given the interest shown by a number of bilateral donors to finance essential drug purchases, the
appraisal mission does not foresee problems for the Government to obtain the funds required to cover its
total needs of STD drugs. Distribution of these drugs to health facilities would be through the essential
drug logistics system being put in place under the ongoing and new health projects (para. 2.59).
3.66         The proposed project would complement a three-year project approved in November 1993
by the European Community (EC) for the strengthening of STD treatment and control in health facilities
in the Kadiogo and Houet provinces. The bulk of the proposed activities would be carried out in the cities
of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. In particular, the EC project (with a total cost of about ECU 1
million) would finance: (a) the upgrading of a number of health centers and dispensaries;
training/refresher courses for health personnel; provision of drugs, medical, and laboratory materials; and
operating costs.



32
3.67         Proiject Suppor. The project would finance: STD drugs (US$3.7 million) and training
(US$100,000).
e. Strengthening Clinical Management and Community Care (US$1.0 million)
3.68         The objective of this component is to assist the Government in a) establishing an
integrated system for HIV/AIDS that would include testing, health care, counselling, psychological and
social support; b) rationalizing the cost of care by i) developing standard treatment protocols for each type
of AIDS-related opportunistic infection and disease symptoms; ii) experimenting with alternative delivery
mechanisms such as outpatient care; and iii) providing a balance between hospital care and home care,
through the establishment of linkages with NGOs and other community support; and c) counseling for
affected individuals and the family. A number of activities in these areas are being supported under the
ongoing health operation. These include: a) workshops to sensitize the medical, religious and village
communities about HIV-related infections and the importance of counselling; b) guidelines for psycho-
social counselling; and c) preparation of an AIDS legislation. The proposed project would strengthen the
skills of paramedical staff (700), social workers (162), and community members (240) in the provision
of counselling and community care. Furthermore, the project would assist MSASF in acquiring scientific
documentation on HIV/AIDS/STD and distributing it to concerned personnel. It would help maintain an
adequate supply of drugs to treat the different infections. Funds have been provided under the project
for trips to other African countries to learn from their experience in the preparation of treatment protocols
for HIV related diseases. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that these trips will be
undertaken in the first six months of project implementation and that treatment protocols would be
finalized by December 31, 1995. Any change in these protocols that would affect the use of drugs to be
financed under the project would be submitted to IDA for information.
3.69         To reduce the direct cost of AIDS and the workload of health facilities, the project would
support social interventions to help households cope with the impact of AIDS. Training would be
provided to NGOs to strengthen their capabilities to intervene in this area. NGO activities in support of
individuals and families affected by AIDS and other HIV-related diseases would be financed under the
Fund. The project would also support the designing of survivors programs, with particular emphasis on
programs for orphans, widows and elderly dependents.
3.70         Prject Support. The project would finance: drugs for opportunistic infections (US$
860,000); training for health and social workers, and community and religious leaders (training would
include study tours to other African countries and participation in international conferences on clinical
management); training for NGOs; 1 man-month of international specialist services to help the preparation
of a seminar on the problem of orphans; AIDS-related documentation; and funds for supervision.
3. Encourage Private Sector and NGO Participation in Population, FP and IMV/AIDS/SJDs
Prograns (US$4.0 million)
3.71         The project would establish a Fund, in the amount of US$4.0 million equivalent, to
provide grant-financing for activities and programs in the areas of population, FP, and prevention and
control of HIV infections and STDs. Beneficiaries of the Fund would be NGOs, associations, private
organizations and individuals. Activities to be financed include: (a) in the area of population/FP: activities
aimed at expanding MCH/FP services, beyond those provided by the public sector, such as social
marketing and community based distribution projects; and IEC activities utilizing both formal (e.g. radio)
and informal channels of communications such as "griots" and folk groups (40% of the funds); (b) in_th
area of HIV/AIDS/STD: projects proposing counseling, education, and condom distribution; community
and home care of patients with AIDS or HIV related illnesses; and IEC activities using formal and
informal methods of communication (60% of the funds). Within the limits of US$100,000 per beneficiary,
the project would finance up to 85% of project cost for the following types of expenditures: local



33
consultants, equipment and supplies, training, mass media and traditional forms of communications, and
essential operating expenses. The remaining 15% would be covered by counterpart financing from
participating NGOs and private agencies. The project coordination team in CONAPO would be
responsible for the administration of the Fund (para. 3.35). An independent multisectoral project selection
committee would be established to review and approve financing proposals. A procedural manual for the
Fund, setting out criteria for the establishment of the project selection committee, as well as NGOs
eligibility criteria and rules for the use of the funds, and including a standard contract between the
Government and eligible NGOs was discussed and agreed upon at negotiations.
3.72         Government/NGO collaboration was the highlight of a two-day seminar organized in
Ouagadougou during project appraisal with the participation of government officials and representatives
of major NGOs operating in the concerned sectors. The seminar strongly endorsed the establishment of
the Fund and agreed on the criteria and regulations set for its operation. The Governments of Norway
and Denmark have indicated their interest in principle to participate in the financing of the Fund. The
establishment of an independent committee for the selection of NGOs' proposals (para. 3.71), satisfactory
to IDA, and Government's approval of the procedural manual and the standard contract, agreeable to
IDA, would be conditions of credit effectiveness.
3.73         During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that: (a) it will make available to
participating NGOs the amounts allocated to the Fund under agreement to be entered between the
Government and NGOs satisfactory to IDA and based on the terms and conditions detailed in the
procedural manual; and (b) it will submit to IDA for review and approval (i) the first three proposals
regardless of the amount, and (ii) any proposal in excess of US$75,000 equivalent.
C. Project Cost and Financing Plan
3.74         Summa  of Costs. The total cost of the project, net of taxes, has been estimated at
US$34.5 million, with a base cost of US$29.7 million, and a foreign exchange component of US$24.2
million. Price contingencies, estimated at US$3.9 million, assume an annual domestic inflation rates of
9.1 %, 6.8%, 4.2%, 4.2%, 2.5% for years 1995-1999, respectively, and a foreign inflation rate of 2.9%,
3.0%, 2.7%, 2.7%, 2.5% for the same periods. Physical contingencies are estimated at US$0.9 million
of base costs. IDA would finance about 76% of total project costs (US$26.3 million). The Government
would contribute 6.4% of total project costs (US$2.2 million). The Governments of Norway and
Denmark would contribute about US$3 million each for the financing of the Fund and drugs for STDs.
The effectiveness of grant agreements between the Government and the Governments of Norway and
Denmark to assist in the financing of the project would be conditions of effectiveness. Details of project
costs are given in Annex 8.
3.75         Basis of Cost Estimates. All costs are estimated and are subject to change. The costs of
contraceptives and condoms are US CIF Ouagadougou. Cost of drugs, medical equipment, supplies, and
materials, and protective supplies are provided in the 1993-1995 MTP for AIDS Control prepared by the
CNLS with WHO assistance. Prices of furniture and vehicles are based on World Bank staff information
about current international tender prices. The exchange rate used is FCFA 590 for US$1.
3.76         Incremental Recurrent Costs and Project Sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs
directly generated by project investments are small. Building construction is very limited and most staff
involved in project implementation are already on the MS, MASF and MFP payroll. Operation and
maintenance cost of equipment and vehicles purchased under the project (estimated at about 20% of
purchase price) would be borne by IDA on a declining basis during the project period, as follows: first
year, 100%; second and third years, 65%; and fourth and fifth years, 35%. Government's contribution
would compensate for the difference.



34
3.77         The project contributes essential inputs to two government programs, the FP and the
HIV/AIDS control programs and these have important recurrent cost implications. In addition to the
financing of an increased number of drugs, contraceptives, condoms, medical materials and protective
supplies to be used in the country, there are important distribution costs that the Government would also
have to take over at the end of the project. The annual cost at the end of the project of supplying the
above material has been estimated at about US$3.4 million equivalent. These costs are expected to
remain substantial for a number of years and donor funding for the above commodities will be necessary
for the foreseeable future. As cost recovery is being gradually introduced in Burkina's health system
jointly with decentralization, charges will be made for drugs, with the proceeds of these charges being
retained within the district health budget. Contraceptives and condoms are currently being sold by the
public health system at a highly subsidized price, and this practice will continue under the project.
However, given the urgency to dramatically increase the demand of condoms, free distribution of these
items would be envisaged in the course of IEC campaigns and in some programs targetted to high-risk
groups.
3.78         Recurrent Cost Savings. The recurrent costs generated by the activities supported under
this project would need to be compared with the long-term costs of not launching an aggressive FP and
AIDS prevention program.  Without the inputs provided by the project, a much more serious
sustainability problem would arise in terms of factors such as: (a) costs for increases in social services
to cater to a rapidly growing population; (b) costs for caring for AIDS and STD patients if the HIV
infection and the STD were left unchecked; and (c) costs of caring for the children of AIDS victims. The
rapid assessment of the economic impact of AIDS carried out during project appraisal (paras. 2.48-2.52)
estimated the average direct lifetime treatment costs for an AIDS case to be about US$416 (pre-
devaluation cost). The total indirect cost of one case of AIDS has been estimated 18 times greater
(US$7,488). The direct cost of one year supply of condoms for one sexually active male was estimated
at appraisal to be about US$2.
3.79         Drugs for STDs- and AIDS-related opportunistic infections and protective supplies for
health workers would help restore health or prevent illnesses. Every STD or TB patient treated, or every
HIV infection averted reduces the number of future potential patients seeking health care. Drugs and
other medical supplies provided by the project would help ensure the sustainability of existing and
forthcoming large investments in health care infrastructure. Without detailed epidemiological data, it is
difficult to ascertain the total number of AIDS cases prevented by the project. By the year 1999, an
estimated 570,000 sexually active males will be using condoms, thereby protecting a total of 513,000
couples (90% efficacy). In the extreme case of all these couples becoming HIV-positive without condom
protection, then a total of US$211 million is saved by the project in that year, based on a US$416
HIV/AIDS treatment cost per person.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Status of Project Preparation and Readiness
4.1          Throughout project preparation, discussions were regularly held with the technical staff
of the MS, the MASF and the MEFP to agree on the priorities within the population and AIDS control
strategies. The national FP strategy which the project would help implement was prepared by a
multisectoral national working group with technical assistance financed under a Japanese Grant Fund.
Working papers for the project components have been prepared. A beneficiary assessment was carried
out during preparation, using rapid appraisal procedures to determine beneficiaries' perception of public
health services and its recommendations have been incorporated in the design of the project. Training
needs have been identified and the content, scope and time-schedule of the training programs would be
discussed in detail during negotiations. Lists of equipment, medical and laboratory supplies was reviewed



35
at appraisal. The Government has prepared an implementation manual for the NGOs Fund and a list of
monitorable project activity and program impact indicators, which was reviewed at negotiations. Both the
implementation manual for the NGOs Fund and the indicators will be incorporated into a project
supervision and implementation manual to be finalized for the project launch seminar (expected to take
place prior to credit effectiveness).
B. Project Organization and Management
4.2          All project activities would be implemented by existing units or directorates located in
the MEFP, the MS, and the MASF. More specifically, the Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO would
be responsible for (i) implementing IEC population activities and coordinating population activities
undertaken by other government agencies and NGOs; (ii) undertaking demographic research, and (iii)
overall project coordination. The D_SE would be responsible for implementing and monitoring the
Government's FP program, integrated into its MCH program. The DPF would be responsible for
supporting population and AIDS/STD IEC activities, and enhancing public understanding of women's
rights and problems. The Permanent Secretariat of the CNLS would be responsible for implementing all
HIV/AIDS/STD activities. NGOs' and other private sector's interventions (either financed under the
Fund or contracted out by the Government) would be implemented under the supervision of the concerned
Government agencies or directorates.  Mechanisms for periodic consultation among the different
implementing units would be laid out in the project supervision and implementation manual.
4.3          CONAPO would be strengthened to enable it to coordinate project implementation in the
manner described in para. 3.35. The Project Coordinator and his team will work in close coordination
with the heads of the executing agencies.  The Coordinator's role would be to facilitate project
implementation, including administrative and financial matters. Training in accounting and procurement
would be provided to the coordinating unit staff to strengthen their capacity in these areas.
C. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.4          Each agency involved in the implementation of the project would report semi-annually
on progress of specific components and sub-components. The reports would be consolidated by the
coordinating team and sent to IDA every six months. It would also organize, no later than March 31 of
each year, starting in 1995, a joint Government/IDA review of project implementation, based on the
progress reports, annual work programs, and budgets for the following years. IDA and the Government
would conduct a mid-term project review in March 1997. Terms of reference for the mid-term review
would be agreed-upon between IDA and the Government six months prior to the review. Government
would also prepare a project completion report within four months of the project's closing date, prepared
in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that (a) a mid-term evaluation of the project will be held in March 1997 in accordance with
the agreed-upon terms of reference, and (b) a project completion report will be prepared within four
months of the project closing date. The establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system, satisfactory
to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness.
4.5          The ZOPP (objective-oriented project planning system) methodology would be used as
a tool of project monitoring and evaluation. A workshop was organized in early February 1994 - with
financing provided under the ongoing health project and the assistance of a consultant very familiar with
the ZOPP methodology - to develop a monitoring and evaluation system based upon a logical framework,
which will be updated and reviewed as project implementation is carried on. Preliminary monitorable
project activity and program impact indicators developed during the workshop were discussed at
negotiations. They will be finalized prior to the project launch seminar. Operational research will be
conducted to determine the effectiveness of selected intervention.

D. Procurement
4.6          Table 4 summarizes the project costs by disbursement category and proposed
arrangements. Burkina's procurement laws and regulations conform to IDA procurement guidelines. No
special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in Credit documents for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) as Burkina's procurement regulations allow IDA procedures to take
precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.
4.7          Civil Works. The civil works program financed by IDA (US$0.6 million) concerns an
extension of ABBEF's clinic, construction of offices for the Family Health Directorate, rehabilitation of
five regional training centers and a cold storage room.  Contracts for construction works and
rehabilitation of the cold storage room would be awarded through LCB. Due to their small size,
geographic spread, and high transportation costs, these civil works are unlikely to attract foreign or large
firms that use modern construction equipment. However, foreign bidders would not be precluded from
submitting bids. Contracts would be grouped, to the extent practical, into packages estimated to cost less
than US$0.2 million each. In the event that any contract exceeds this amount, ICB procedures would
apply. No preferential margin would be given to domestic contractors when LCB is used. Contracts for
the rehabilitation of the regional training centers would be awarded through price quotations, provided
that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$100,000. The LCB award would
be made in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits
(May 1992).
4.8          Goods. Goods financed under the Credit include medical and laboratory materials and
supplies, office equipment and supplies, vehicles, IEC materials, furniture. Goods would be grouped into
packages of at least US$150,000 each and procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (May 1992). A preferential margin of
15%, or the applicable custom duties whichever is less, over the CIF prices of competing goods for all
ICB procurement would be given to domestic firms, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Goods
that cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$150,000 each would be procured through local
competitive bidding. Equipment, material, furniture, and carts with contract values of less than
US$150,000 would be awarded through LCB, provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement
does not exceed US$1,500,000 equivalent. Office supplies, spare parts for operation and maintenance
of equipment and vehicles, small IEC items, consumable materials needed for training, and items for
operating the project coordination team, which are available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into bid
packages of at least US$50,000, may be procured through prudent local shopping, based on price
quotation obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount of such
procurement does not exceed US$1,000,000 equivalent. All bids under ICB will be submitted on a
Carriage and Insurance Paid to Ouagadougou basis for imported goods and on an ex-factory basis for
locally manufactured goods.
4.9          Drues. Condoms and Contraceptives. Drugs would be procured by the CAMEG through
International Competitive Bidding on the basis of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the
Procurement of Pharmaceuticals (September 1993). Condoms would be procured by the CAMEG with
technical assistance from WHO for at least the first two years of the project. Contraceptives would also
be procured by the CAMEG with technical assistance from UNFPA for at least the first two years of the
project. Both goods would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD loans and IDA credits (May 1992).

4.10         Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold of
US$200,000 equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review process would
cover 83% of the total value of the amount contracted for goods and 80% of the amount contracted for
civil works. Selective post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold level would apply to about
one of four contracts.
4.11          Consultant and Other Services. Specialist consultant services financed by IDA (US$3.2
million) would be contracted with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). There
is no long-term resident technical assistance under the project (the 36-months contract with a foreign EEC
firm and the twinning arrangement between the CNLS and a specialized institution are for the provision
of non-resident consultants, periodically visiting the project). Services to be contracted out include local
and international consultancy services, training services, IEC specialist services, studies and surveys, pilot
projects, capacity-building, and procurement and financial auditing services. Total cost of local
consultants is estimated at US$1.9 million, while the cost of foreign consultants is US$1.3 million. Prior
Association review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation,
proposals, evaluation reports and contracts would not apply to (a) contracts for the employment of
consulting firms estimated to cost less than US$75,000 equivalent each, or (b) contracts for the
employment of individuals estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent each. However, said
exceptions to prior Bank review would not apply to (a) the terms of reference for such contracts, (b)
single-source selection of consulting firms, (c) assignments of critical nature, as reasonably determined
by the Bank, (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the contracts
value to US$75,000 equivalent or above, or (e) amendments to contracts for the employments of
individuals consulting raising the contract value to US$30,000 equivalent or above.
4.12         Procurement Status of Ongoing Projects and Proposed Arrangements. Disbursements
under the ongoing project (Cr. 1607-BUR) were on schedule. The coordinating team and the CAMEG
would be responsible for all other procurement with support from consultants when necessary. The
coordinating team would promptly report bid evaluation and contract award information and review
procurement progress in bi-annual reports.

* 100% through December 31, 1995; 65% through December 31, 1997; 35% thereafter.
4.14         The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period, with the IDA Credit
disbursed in six years, according to the categories shown in the table above. The estimated disbursement
profile is shown in Annex 9.  Burkina's standard disbursement profile for all sector is 8 years.
Disbursement of the Credit would be fully documented except for expenditures (contracts, training, and
incremental operating costs) valued less than US$20,000 equivalent which would be made against
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at
CONAPO for review by IDA supervision missions and for semiannual audits. Disbursements for
contracts for the Fund that meet the eligibility criteria established for the Fund and valued to a maximum
of US$10,000 equivalent will be made on the basis of SOEs, with relevant documentation also retained
by the Coordinating Unit for review by IDA supervision missions and external auditors. To facilitate
disbursement, the Government would open a Special Account (SA) in a commercial bank to cover IDA's
share of eligible expenditures managed by CONAPO. The authorized allocation for the Special Project
Account would be US$500,000, and would be only for making payments against contracts estimated less
than US$250,000. At the request of the Borrower, IDA would replenish the SA upon receipt of
satisfactory proof of incurred eligible expenditures. Replenishment requests would be accompanied by
up-to-date bank statements and reconciliations of the SA. Given the availability of the Special Account,
the minimum application for direct payments, reimbursement or requests for special commitments would
normally be for the equivalent of US$20,000 equivalent.
F. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
4.15         CONAPO would be responsible for the financial management of the project and would
maintain, with the assistance of a private accountant, consolidated project accounts in accordance with
International Accounting Standards (IASs). Project accounts, including the SA, would be audited
annually in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) by auditors acceptable to IDA.



40
The project accounting system should be capable of producing, on a timely basis, information used by
management to plan, evaluate and control within the project use of, and accountability for, its resources.
This should include the regular production of financing situations for all loans and credits, showing funds
utilized, committed and available by category of expenditure and project component, in the currency of
the respective agreement. It should also include information to enable management to compare and control
costs with appraisal estimates. SOEs would be accepted as basis of disbursements only if the internal
control and accounting system and auditing arrangements are satisfactory. If the absence of auditors
absolutely precludes this practice, then disbursements under SOEs would be audited semiannually. The
annual audit report would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year; the semi-
annual audit reports would be submitted to IDA within three months of each period; the Government
would submit a short-list of independent auditors, including the related draft contract and terms of
reference. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will submit to IDA audit reports
of reasonable scope and details within: (a) six months of the end of each fiscal year in the case of the
annual audit report; (b) and three months of the end of each semester in the case of the SOEs. The
appointment of an independent auditor under a multi-year contract acceptable to IDA would be a
condition of credit effectiveness. The auditor should be appointed under an "open" contract and his
mandate reconfirmed each year. Project management should be encouraged to prepare the financial
statements for audit as early as possible so as to advance the date of the audit and permit early
reconfirmation of the auditor in time for him to carry out the interim audit of the current year. If the
project is properly equipped with an appropriate accounting and financial management system by the time
it is effective, there is no reason why financial statements cannot be available for audit within one month
of the year end and the audit completed within three months of the year end; these would be acceptable
"targets".
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
5.1          The project's interventions would help increase by 1999 the prevalence of modern
methods of contraception in rural areas from 1.5% to 9% and in urban areas from 17% to 32%. The
number of FP users would grow from an estimated 80,000 to about 350,000 in 1999. The wider practice
of FP would have a particularly beneficial impact on the health of women and children. The project
would help slow the spread of the HIV infection and alleviate the burden of HIV/AIDS on individuals,
families and the nation. The project would have significant returns in terms of years of healthy life saved
and would hold down the indirect economic cost of AIDS - the losses of productivity and human capital,
which threaten the long term economic development of Burkina Faso. Most importantly, the cost of
dealing with the disease now would be small in comparison to the cost if the disease were allowed to
become more widespread. The project would help combat STDs, which is one of the most effective
strategies to inhibiting the spread of HIV. By 1999, reliable supplies of condoms would provide
protection from HIV/AIDS/STD, to about 570,000 sexually active adult males (about 20% of the
estimated sexually active male population) who are expected to be persuaded by the public information
campaigns to use condoms, to do so. Distribution of condoms to high-risk populations supported by
intensive IEC effort, is expected to cover a much higher percentage of these populations. Protective
supplies would safeguard an estimated 4,500 health personnel. By integrating HIV/AIDS/STD prevention
in FP/MCH activities, the project would contribute to alleviating the number of infections transmitted to
women. Neonatal infection would be reduced.
B. Risks
5.2          The project faces two major risks. Eij, attainment of project goals may be hampered
by the fact that changing reproductive and health behavior is a difficult and time-consuming undertaking.
To mitigate this risk, the project would provide heavy support to IEC activities and would use NGOs and



41
other private sector organizations to reach those at risk. To mobilize continued, strong support for FP
as well as for HIV/AIDS/STD prevention and control among political, traditional and religious leaders,
the project would support (i) actions to increase the awareness of these leaders to the urgency of
addressing these issues, and (ii) extensive information campaigns to which national leaders are expected
to contribute actively. Second, Government's weak capacity may result in poor project implementation.
This risk would be addressed through the strengthening of the institutions involved in the implementation
of the project, and through heavy reliance on the private sector and NGOs. Activities in this area would
complement those undertaken under other Bank Group operations to strengthen the health services
delivery system.
VI. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1          During Negotiations, the Government gave assurances that:
(a)   (i) it will review with IDA the technical assistance arrangements with WHO for the
procurement of condoms, and with UNFPA for the procurement of contraceptives at the
end of the second year of project implementation to decide whether to further extend
them; and (ii) following the first shipment of contraceptives and condoms, it will monitor
their distribution and take corrective action if logistics or stock management are not found

42
(e)    a reporting system for epidemiological surveillance would be put in place by June 30,
1995 (para. 3.48);
(j)    HIV/AIDS/STD research will be implemented in accordance with an agreed timetable and
the studies will be reviewed with IDA and agreed follow-up actions will be carried out
(para. 3.51);
(k)   it will (a) organize a seminar to define the AIDS/STD IEC strategy by June 30, 1995,
and discuss with IDA and finalize said strategy by September 30, 1995; and (b) carry out

program, discuss its recommendations with IDA, and implement agreed upon action plan
(para. 3.55);
(I)    (i) it will undertake in the first six months of project implementation trips to other
African countries to learn from their experience in the preparation of treatment protocols
for HIV-related diseases, (ii) it will finalize such protocols by December 31, 1995, and
(iii) will submit to IDA any proposed change in the treatment protocols for both HIV
related diseases and STDs that affect the use of the drugs to be procured under the
project (para. 3.68);
(m)   it will (i) make available to participating NGOs portions of the amounts allocated to the
Fund under agreements to be entered into between the Government and NGOs on terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and (ii) submit to IDA for review and approval the
first three proposals of NGOs, regardless of the amount involved, and any proposal in
excess of US$75,000 equivalent (para. 3.73);
(n)   it will (i) review with IDA each year by March 31 the progress of project implementation
over the previous 12 months, starting in 1995; (ii) by March 1997 carry out with IDA

and audit of the SOEs would be available within three months of the end of each semester
(para. 4.15).
6.2          Prior to Board Presentation, the Government submitted two Letters of Population Sector
Development and AIDS Prevention Policies, both including time-bound indicators (para. 3.4).
6.3          As Conditions of effectiveness, the Government would:
(a)    approve a training program satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.8);
(b)    sign technical assistance agreements with WHO for the procurement of condoms and with
UNFPA for the procurement of contraceptives (3.11). Such agreements would be
reviewed two years after their implementation to determine the need to further extend
them (para. 3.11);



43
(c)    establish (i) the project coordination team within CONAPO's Permanent Secretariat in
numbers and qualifications satisfactory to IDA, and (b) an accounting system satisfactory
to IDA (para. 3.35);
(d)    (i) reorganize the Permanent Secretariat and staff it with adequate full-time personnel in

The effectiveness of grant agreements between the Government and the Governments of Norway
and Denmark to assist in the financing of the project would be an additional condition of effectiveness
(para. 3.74).
6.4          Recommendation. Subject to the above terms and conditions the proposed project would
be suitable for an IDA credit of US$26.3 million equivalent to the Republic of Burkina Faso on standard
IDA terms, with 40 years maturity.

In Burkina Faso, two different Ministries - Economy, Finance and Plan, and Health - play a leadership
role in, respectively, population and AIDS control issues. Each of them has prepared a separate letter
of sector development policy, the translation of which is here provided.
TRANSLATION OF THE ORIGINAL LETTER IN FRENCH
MINISTRY OF THE ECONOMY, FINANCE AND PLAN
Ouagadougou, May 4, 1994
TO
The President of the
International Development Association
1818 H Street, NW
Washington, DC 20433
Subject: Letter of Population Sector Policy
Dear Mr. President,
With reference to the proposed Population and AIDS Control Project (PPLS), I am pleased to
transmit to you the following letter of population sector policy.
Burkina Faso is a landlocked Sahelian country of 272,527 km2, with a population of 9.2 million,
according to a demographic survey conducted in 1992/93. At that time, the annual population growth rate
was estimated to be 2.68%, with about 87% of the population living in rural areas. The rapid population
growth rate endangers any effort to bring about improvements in health and nutrition; the literacy rate;
training; under- and unemployment. This rate of growth also has negative effects in terms of
deforestation, soil erosion, and desertification. From an economic and financial point of view, growing
deficits in public finances have caused the Government of Burkina Faso to adopt a structural adjustment
program in order to eliminate macro-economic disequilibria. Fully aware of the possible negative social
repercussions of the adjustment measures, the Government has chosen to adopt a socio-economic
development policy which also includes population issues. It is in this context that it prepared in 1991
a population policy statement, with the ultimate objective of improving the living conditions of the
population. The Government has also integrated in its population policy the problems related to the spread
of the Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and of the acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The Government population policy is multisectoral and its main objective is to improve the quality
of life of the population. Within this overall objective, a number of spe- cific objectives have been set,
of which the most important are:
1. Increasing contraceptive prevalence (CP) from 4.4% to 60% by year 2005;
2. By the year 2005, providing to all people, but in particular to the youth, extensive
information on population issues to encourage them to become responsible parents;
3. Reducing the fertility rate by 10%, every five years, starting in year 2005.
The Govermment has also defined the strategies and the actions that should allow the above
objectives to be attained. Its main strategies concern the following areas:
Maternal and Child Health (MCH)
Family Planning
Adult Morbidity and Mortality

Demographic Studies and Research
The Government has also created the political conditions and the institutional framework needed
for a successful implementation of its population policy. Steps taken include: (a) the adoption in June
1992 of a Program of Priority Actions for the 1991-95 period; (b) the establishment of the National
Population Council (CONAPO), responsible for the implementation of the population policy and for the
coordination of all activities related to the population sector; (c) the establishment of the Permanent
Secretariat of CONAPO and its four specialized commissions: i) demographic research, ii) population and
development; iii) family well being; and iv) information, education and communication ([EC) in the area
of population; and (d) the adoption of the National Family Planning Strategy for the 1993-1998 period.
The adoption of a number of action programs such as the program of priority actions in the area
of population, the family planning action program, the action program to address women's issues, provide
further evidence of the Government's commitment to addressing the country's population problem.
The Government also intends to collaborate with other public and private sector organizations for
the implementation of its population and AIDS control program . To this end, it organized in May 1992
a meeting of all agencies active in the area of population, both in the private and public sector, with the
view to establishing a coordination mechanism.
The Government hopes that through the implementation of its first population program it will be
able to provide a better understanding of the country's demographic dynamics and of the social and
economic implications of rapid population growth. The expected outcome is a change in people's attitude
vis-k-vis human reproduction as well as a more responsible attitude towards parenting. Equally, the
implementation of this first program of priority actions in the area of population should bring about a
decline in the fertility rate through the implementation of the family planning program and a halt in the
spread of AIDS.
To ensure a more successful implementation of its population policy, the Government requests
the technical and financial support of the International Development Association for the implementation
of the Population and AIDS project, and will ensure its full integration into the existing population
program.
The project will thus assist the Government in the implementation of its population policy. More
specifically, it will help reduce the rate of population growth and slow the spread of AIDS.
These are the Government's broad directions and strategies regulating the implementation of its
population policy in which context I request the financial support of the International Development
Association for the Population and AIDS Control Project.
I am also including a list of quantified monitorable indicators of results to be achieved by the end
of 1999.
Truly yours
The Minister of Economy, Finance and Plan
Zephirin Diabre

Subjet: Letter of AIDS Sector Policy
Dear Mr. President,
Burkina Faso is currently one of the countries in West Africa more severely affected by HIV.
Seroprevalence among the general population is estimated at 7%, while it reaches 13.1 % among truck
drivers, 8.5% among pregnant women, 29% among persons infected with tuberculosis, and 23% among
STD-infected persons. In urban areas where prostitution is widespread, the seroprevalence rate among
persons with multiple partners is quite high. About 64% of commercial sex workers in Ouagadougou and
43% of those in Bobo Dioulasso are estimated to be seroprevalent. Because of limited epidemiological
surveillance, it is not possible to determine what the real situation is in rural areas. However, widespread
traditional practices such as the levirate, female circumcision, scarring etc., considerably increase the risk
of HIV transmission.
The youth is particularly affected by the infection and the number of AIDS cases among young
people has increased from 3% in 1987 to 7% in 1992. Women are also being increasingly infected and
while in 1988 women represented 25% of AIDS cases, their proportion has now increased to 38%.
Reported AIDS cases have increased dramatically, from 10 in 1986 to 2,886 as of December
1992. This situation places Burkina Faso third, after CMte d'Ivoire and Ghana, among the West African
countries most affected by the disease.
Currently, a new AIDS case is recorded every day at the National Hospital in Ouagadougou.
Particularly affected is the sexually active and economically productive population. In fact, 75% of those
hospitalized for AIDS are of age 15 to 40.
Clinically, the most common symptoms of HIV/AIDS patients presenting to hospitals are chronic
diarrhea, and respiratory and skin infections. These diseases progressively destroy the capacity of an
individual to function and the cost of the treatment of AIDS victims becomes more and more expensive
as the disease progresses.
To fight this deadly disease, the Government established in 1986 a National AIDS Committee,
with the mandate of preparing, executing, coordinating, and evaluating the national AIDS policy, in

collaboration with numerous national and international partners. This policy has been translated into short-
and medium-term programs.
The objective of the first short-term plan prepared in 1986 was to a) measure the evolution of the
disease in the country, determine the national capacity to respond, and identify possible partners, who
could support the Government actions, and b) develop a national Information, Education and
Communication policy focusing on providing information.
The short term plan achieved its objectives, making it possible for the Government to prepare a
first medium term plan (MTP I 1988) for the 1988-1992 period and expand CNLS's activities.
Specifically, the objectives of the MTP I were to:
-     control the sexual transmission of AIDS through mass information, sensitization
campaigns, education programs targeted at risk groups (the youth, commercial sex
workers, the military, traders, etc.) and through the social marketing of condoms;
-     improve blood security by training health personnel and providing funds to finance the
operating expenses of laboratories:
-     reduce mother-child HIV transmission;
-     improve the management of AIDS cases through training of social and health workers,
provision of drugs and protective supplies:
-     promote and coordinate AIDS research:
-     improve AIDS surveillance by strengthening sentinel sites.
The First Medium-Term Plan received about US$ 3.5 million, provided by the Burkinabe
Government and its partners (WHO/UNDP, USAID, the German Government, the EC, Canada and
UNICEF).
The Health and Demographic Survey (DHS) carried out in 1992/93 by the National Institute of
Statistics (INSD), showed that AIDS awareness was high among men (94%) and women (83%). This is
an important outcome of the first MTP. The DHS also showed that AIDS awareness was equally high
in rural areas (92%).
The financing provided under the plan allowed to undertake the rehabilitation of the country's
blood banks and improved the supply of rapid tests. It also contributed to the training of about 1500
social and health workers. Through the implementation of a social marketing program, condoms were
made available to the population in all of Burkina's 30 provinces. A number of socio-behavioral studies
were conducted between 1989 and 1992 to improve the IEC program. Hospitals were also provided with
medical and protective materials.
In 1992, the Government realized that its efforts notwithstanding, the number of AIDS victims
continued to grow, reaching 2,886 (recorded) cases, and that the seroprevalence among the general
population was touching levels between 5% and 7% of the population. A number of surveys also showed
that AIDS awareness had not contributed to a change in behavior, and that there were still considerable
misconceptions related to the disease and prejudices towards AIDS victims.

To improve its capacity to control the disease, the Government prepared a MTP II for the 1993-
95 period, largely focusing on prevention. The strategy laid out in this plan emphasizes the need to
mobilize all of the countries' forces (public institutions, NGOs, religious and traditional leaders) in a
massive information, education and communication campaign to bring about a change in sexual behavior
and the elimination of professional and traditional practices that put a person at risk of contracting AIDS.
The budget for the MTP II covering the 1993-1995 period was estimated at US $ 7.1 million.
During a donors' meeting organized in December 1992, a number of institutions including the World
Bank, pledged to support the plan.
The main objectives of the new MTP are:
- improve people's knowledge of risk behavior;
- bring about a change in behavior,
- slow the spread of HIV;
- support social interventions to help victims to cope with the impact of AIDS.
To achieve above objectives it will be necessary to mobilize considerable human and financial
resources, and I am convinced that your institution, with the support provided in the context of the
Population and AIDS project, will be extremely useful.
I am also attaching to this letter a list of annual monitorable indicators of results to achieve in the
context of the project by the end of 1999.
Yours truly,
Christophe Dabire
Minister of Health

BURKINA FASO
POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
Information, Education and Communications (IEC)
51.          Both the population and the AIDS/STD components of the project contain information,
education and communications (IEC) subcomponents. These subcomponents are designed to achieve two
broad objectives:
The Populatio4  IEC subcomponent is designed to increase public knowledge of, and demand
for, modem contraceptive methods
-     The AIDS/STD IEC subcomponent is designed to increase public understanding of AIDS and
STDs and to promote preventive practices.
2.           A variety of communications techniques and channels will be used, including mass media,
traditional communications and interpersonal communications through health workers, social workers and
other organized channels. IEC activities will be carried out by a number of governmental and
nongovernmental entities. The main governmental entities participating in achieving the population EEC
objective will be: the Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO in the Ministry of Finance and Plan, which
will promote understanding of population issues; the Family Health Directorate in the Ministry of Health
and the Directorate for Family Promotion in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Family, which will
educate the public about women's rights as well as participate in family planning promotion. Other
governmental entities will play supporting roles and nongovernmental organizations will participate
through the project Fund. The National AIDS Committee will assume the lead role with respect to the
AIDS/STD IEC objective, with support from NGOs through the project Fund.
3.           The IEC activities of the key entities will be coordinated through monthly meetings
convened by CONAPO's Permanent Secretariat.  These meetings will ensure that activities are
complementary, rather than duplicative, that activities (such as research or training) are undertaken jointly
when appropriate, that resources such as equipment and materials are shared among the partners in the
project and that the messages going out into the field and to the public are coordinated and coherent.
CONAPO will also convene meetings of its IEC commission, in consultation with the commission's chair,
the Directorate for Family Promotion, at least once a year. (Funds for the latter activity will come from
the institutional development subcomponent.)
4.           Among the governmental entities participating in IEC activities, only the Family Health
Directorate has staff specializing in the management of a broad IEC program. Under both EEC
subcomponents of the project, there will be a significantly greater level of effort. To help achieve the
population objective, the Government will re-assign an IEC specialist to work full-time with the
Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO. The Family Health Directorate's staff may also soon grow from four
to five. In order to quickly create momentum for IEC activities aimed at AIDS prevention in the face
of an extremely serious HIV/AIDS situation, the project will finance a full-time senior communications
specialist from the private sector to manage the National AIDS Committee's IEC program. This staff
will be assisted by another IEC specialist, also recruited by the project.



54
ANNEX4
Page 2 of 9
In order to enhance the impact of this staff, both in population and AIDS, a number of important tasks
under the project wIll be contracted out. For example, advertising agencies will undertake most of the
creative and technical work of developing radio and television spots and research institutions will conduct
most of the IEC research.
5.           To support the staff of all the main entities participating in IEC, the project wIll finance
36 person-months of short-term technical assistance during the first three years from an international
agency specializing in IEC. The project coordinating unit will be responsible for identifying and hiring
the IEC agency, in consultation with the Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO, the Family Health
Directorate, the Directorate for Famfly Promotion and the National AIDS Committee's National
Coordinator; it will also coordinate technical assistance visits by the agency. The IEC agency will
provide a minimum of 12 months of one person's time to visit Burkina at least twice each year; once to
assist in the development of annual work-plans and once to ensure that plans are progressing smoothly.
This person will spend at least four months in Burkina as the project is starting up to help with the
organization of EEC activities and, later, he/she will participate in the design of IEC research, and the
development of EEC strategies and mass media. The remaining 24 person-months will be available to
meet specific technical assistance needs as they arise, such as training, analysis of IEC research,
evaluation of materials or mass media, support of decentralization of IEC, etc.
6.           In addition, under the project's institutional development subcomponent, key national EEC
staff will receive training abroad appropriate to their needs: training in IEC program management for
the National AIDS Committee's IEC coordinator and the Family Health Directorate's new staff member
(if he/she is assigned to the directorate and has sufficient seniority); advanced IEC training for the
CONAPO IEC coordinator and one person at the Family Health Directorate; and basic EEC training for
the two EEC staff at the National AIDS Committee and two at the Directorate of Family Promotion.
Funds will also be available under that subcomponent for two study tours abroad-one to observe a family
planning IEC program and one for an AIDS IEC program--for four people each. The institutional
development subcomponent will also finance basic audio-visual equipment needed for the key entities
involved in IEC activities, where such equipment is lacking and will provide funds to purchase books and
subscriptions.
7.           In order to measure the impact of the project's IEC subcomponents, a brief national KAP
survey will be undertaken before project start-up to assess public knowledge and attitudes on family
planning, AIDS and STDs, and will be repeated at the end of the project. The Family Health Directorate
and the National AIDS Committee together will be responsible for this survey.
I. Population IEC
8.           The specific objectives of this subcomponent will be to double the proportion of young
people (age 15-25) who knows of a modern method of contraception and double the proportion of the
general adult population who knows where contraceptive services are available. Once data from the pre-
project KAP survey are available, these "doubling' objectives will be quantified. IEC activities will be
targeted primarily to young people-both because of the size of this population group and also because
they are more apt to change their behavior-and will begin to touch rural areas where most of the
population resides. A multi-media approach will be adopted, using modern mass media as well as
interpersonal communications. The latter will reach out well beyond the health system, using social
workers and the newly established regional health education centers (CRESAs) to work with organized
groups in the population. Extensive use will be made of traditional communications techniques and
channels, such as folk theater, story telling and traditional healers.



55
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 9
9.           There will be three elements to this subcomponent: (a) increasing public support for
population issues among opinion leaders; (b) increasing public knowledge of, and demand for, modern
contraceptive methods' (c) and enhancing public understanding of women's rights and problems. While
two of these elements are not directly focussed on building demand for contraception, they play crucial
supporting roles in creating a positive climate for contraceptive use.
A. Increasing Support for Population Issues among Opinion Leaders
10.          The Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO will be responsible for educating opinion leaders
about population issues, with a view to improving their understanding of the relationship between
population trends and development and mobilizing their support on population matters. The main focus
will be on governmental leaders at the national and regional levels and all activities will be undertaken
in close consultation with the Family Health Directorate and the National AIDS Committee to ensure that
there is no duplication of effort.
11.          Materials DeveloDment. The Secretariat will develop and distribute educational materials
such as booklets, brochures, posters and audio-visual presentations on issues related to population and
development. It will synthesize policy-relevant information and research findings into short, attractive,
user-friendly publications and audio-visual presentations. The kinds of topics to be addressed will be the
1991 population policy, the Demographic and Health Survey, census results, the relationship between
population and agriculture, etc. It is anticipated that 10 publications and 10 audio-visual presentations
will be prepared over the life of the project for dissemination and use at seminars and distribution to
decision-makers in government and outside.
12.          Information Bulletin. CONAPO plans to prepare a quarterly bulletin with news about
population and development, reports on the meetings of its commissions as well as on government and
private sector activities in the field. A distribution of 3,000 - 5,000 is anticipated, comprising decision-
makers in government and outside.
13.          Seminars for Opinion Leaders. Thirty national and regional seminars for a total of
approximately 1,500 people will be held on a variety of topics related to population and development.
The primary target groups for these seminars will be government decision-makers at the national,
regional, provincial and department levels. A small seminar will be held early in the project to finalize
a population IEC strategy. Over the life of the project, it is anticipated that the regional offices of the
Ministry of Finance and Plan will become increasingly involved in organizing seminars for decision-
makers in their regions, with the staff of the Permanent Secretariat participating primarily to provide a
national perspective.
14.          Mass Media. The Permanent Secretariat will maintain close contact with the media in
order to ensure coverage of population topics. While most of this contact will be informal, the Secretariat
anticipates occasional meetings of the cadre of journalists specializing in population matters to update their
information or to develop a strategy for covering a matter of special importance.
B. Increasing Public Knowledge of, and Demnand for, Contraceptive Services
15.          The Family Health Directorate's IEC bureau has accomplished a considerable amount of
work in recent years, with support and technical assistance from Population Communications Services.
However, with that support expected to end as this project begins, the directorate believes the time is



56
ANNEX4
Page 4 of 9
right to rethink its EEC strategy. The challenge will be to take relatively high awareness of contraception
in the urban areas and translate it into broader use of modem methods, while beginning to reach out into
rural zones.
16.          Training of Health Workers in IEC. There has been a considerable amount of training
of health workers in IEC but the Family Health Directorate is not satisfied with the results of that training
and wishes to consider new strategies. It is also interested in better integration of the maternal and child
health services under its jurisdiction and wants to explore the possibility of providing "information
packages' to women when they have contact with the health system. For example, at childbirth, they
would be informed about the importance of a postpartum check-up, family planning and vaccination. The
strategy of asking mothers at the time of delivery to return on the 40th day for postpartum care,
vaccinations and family planning has proven very successful in Tunisia and elsewhere. The directorate
plans to explore the possibility of implementing this approach in Burkina, conducting pilot projects in
Years 1 and 2. When a new strategy for IEC in health centers is adopted, training and re-training of
health workers will begin. It is anticipated that 750 nurses, midwives and other medical personnel will
be trained in Yrs 3-5. In the meantime, however, plans will proceed to train 700 nurses and 400
auxiliary midwives in the provision of contraceptive care. This training will include an expanded and
strengthened IEC component.
17.          Decentralized IEC Activities.  To dramatically expand public education on family
planning, the project will fund decentralized IEC activities conducted through the 10 CRESAs and the
health districts. Since the same people are often expected to conduct IEC activities on family planning
and AIDS/STDs, the decentralized IEC program will focus on both topics and will be administered jointly
by the Family Health Directorate and the National AIDS Commnittee's Permanent Secretariat. The
decentralized IEC program will reach out to women's associations, agricultural cooperatives, traditional
healers, schools, large enterprises and other groups beyond the health system with key messages on
family planning and AIDS. It will be the project's chief vehicle to reach audiences other than those who
are already users of the organized health system. Men, youth and opinion leaders will be priority target
audiences. The program will also reach out into rural areas, will provide the means to mobilize
traditional forms of communication, such as story-telling, songs and folk theater, around family planning
and AIDS and will encourage innovation. The methods used will be based on active community
participation at all levels: in developing messages and activities and in their execution.
18.          The CRESAs, in conjunction with the health districts in their regions, will develop
proposals for a specific program of family planning and AIDS/STD IEC activities and will submit them
to the central level for funding. The newly established National Center for IEC activities in the Ministry
of Health (CNIEC/Sante) will be responsible for approving and disapproving the proposals, jointly with
the Family Health Directorate and the Permanent Secretariat of the National AIDS Committee. The latter
two will also be responsible for monitoring the CRESAs' activities and ensuring that funds are properly
accounted for. Criteria for funding proposals will be developed at the central level by December 31,
1994, in consultation with the CRESAs and the districts, taking the criteria developed for the project
Fund as a model. Decentralized activities will emphasize interpersonal communications rather than mass
media, although the CRESAs could work to integrate family planning and AIDS information into
ongoinglocal radio programming. (It is not anticipated that the CRESAs will develop radio or television
spots, since this task calls for a considerable amount of research and experience in
message development. As discussed in the section on mass media, however, the CRESAs will be called
upon to participate in the development of radio spots for their regions.)



57
ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 9
19.          The CRESAs have only recently been established and most of them will need a
considerable amount of assistance to develop strong and accountable programs. The Family Health
Directorate and the National AIDS Committee's Permanent Secretariat together will undertake to provide
this assistance, along with ABBEF (where it is present). Before any regional activities are begun, a
month-long training program will be conducted to provide the CRESAs with basic information on family
planning, AIDS and STDs as well as to strengthen their interpersonal communication and program
management skills. Each year, there will be a further week of training to advance their communication
and management skills and to provide an opportunity for the group to exchange experiences. In between,
central staff will work closely with the CRESAs and the districts and ABBEF will provide on-site
technical support in those areas where it is represented. Decentralized IEC activities will be phased in
slowly, starting with two CRESAs each in Years 2 and 3 and adding three each in Years 4 and 5.
20.          IEC Research. The Family Health Directorate has a considerable amount of experience
in IEC research and its application in developing IEC activities. It appreciates the importance of such
research and plans to continue conducting both quantitative and qualitative studies and surveys, to identify
target audiences, effective messages and channels of communication. In addition, in order to improve
the effectiveness of its program activities, it plans to begin conducting studies to assess the impact of its
activities, materials and messages. The research will serve to refine the directorate's IEC strategy on a
continuing basis. Whenever possible, the technical aspects of the work will be contracted out to research
specialists and/or institutions.
21.          Mass Media. The Family Health Directorate has undertaken a number of public education
activities using the mass media. Generally, these have involved the integration of family planning
messages into popular ongoing radio programs. The rationale for this approach is, on the one hand, that
it is more consistent with the local tradition of oral communications and, on the other hand, that the
messages involved in helping the Burkinabe understand the benefits of family planning and adopt a
contraceptive method are too complex to be conveyed in a few seconds. The directorate plans to pursue
this approach and to extend it to television. It is also ready, however, to test the use of short, frequently
repeated spots to communicate simple messages. Three radio spots in two languages are planned for the
first year, with a higher level of activity--and an expansion to television--in subsequent years, if the early
experience is positive. All messages will be based on the findings of the IEC research and will be
carefully tested before being produced and their impact assessed after broadcast. The directorate expects
to avail itself of the services of a local advertising agency to develop spots.
22.          It is often costly for entities of the government--not to mention nongovernmental entities-
to gain access to broadcast time, print and cinema advertising and billboards. Thus, early during project
implementation, the Ministry of Finance and Plan and MOH will seek the collaboration of the Ministry
of Communications in reaching the public with crucial messages about AIDS and family planning.
Specifically, they will seek to obtain free broadcast time and space for the project's messages in return
for financing some equipment or supplies needed by Burkinabe radio and television. A written agreement
will be developed between the parties early in the project making it possible for AIDS and family
planning topics to receive the intense mass media attention they merit.
23.          Production of Materials. A number of materials have been developed to help the public
understand why family planning is beneficial and how to use the different methods of contraception.
However, the Family Health Directorate recognizes that there are problems with distribution of these
materials around the country, that they are often not used by health workers and that they are not as
effective as they might be in conveying the desired message to the public. Accordingly, a study is
planned to better understand these problems and to propose solutions. Once the study is completed, the



58
ANNEX 4
Page 6 of 9
production of further materials is anticipated as well as the re-printing of existing ones. The kinds of
materials envisioned are updated versions of the booklets on the various contraceptive methods,
contraceptive sample kits, a new series of posters and production of a flip chart and flannellograph. It
is anticipated that at least four different items per year will be produced and disseminated, once the study
done. At least three videos will be produced in conjunction with a local advertising agency. All
materials will be tested before going into production. Funds will be available not only to produce
materials locally but also to purchase films, videos, bulk orders of publications, etc. from abroad.
24.          Seminars for Orinion Leaders. Family planning is still not well understood by opinion
leaders around the country and it will be enormously important to continue activities to inform this crucial
target population about family planning, its benefits and availability. These seminars will differ from
those conducted by CONAPO inasmuch as they will focus on family planning and health, rather than on
population and development, and will touch decision-makers in the nongovernmental as well as
governmental sectors. Four seminars per year are planned and will be coordinated closely with CONAPO
and the National AIDS Committee. One of the early seminars will focus on the development of a new
IEC strategy, setting out specific measurable objectives, along with priority target audiences, key
messages and the media to be used. Workshops for the media can also be conducted under this rubric.
25.          Resource Ce . The directorate already has a significant collection of literature on
topics related to family planning and maternal and child health. Funds are provided under the
institutional development subcomponent to subscribe to specialized publications and purchase books and
materials for this center.
26.          Population Education in the Schools. The Population Education Project in the Ministry
of Education integrates topics related to population dynamics, sexuality, family planning and the status
of women into the formal school curriculum and provides training for teachers in this subject matter.
T-he project has been financed primarily by UNFPA which is curtailing its support. Thus, funds will be
available under this project to conduct five training courses a year, beginning in 1995, for 200 teachers
a year. It will also provide some support for the production of teaching aids, which are in short supply,
and for the purchase of four slide projectors so that each region of the country is equipped with one.
C. Enhancing Public Understanding of Women's Rights and Problems
27.          The Directorate for Family Promotion will be the lead agency for this element of the
project. However, it could benefit from a management review and the appraisal mission recommends
that such a review-already proposed by the Dutch--be undertaken and that steps be taken to implement
the recommendations of that review before project activities are undertaken.
28.          Promoting the Family Code. In 1991, Burkina Faso adopted a new Family Code which
includes ground-breaking provisions advancing the status of women. Since dissemination of information
about these rights can be expected to improve the status of women and thus create a climate more
conducive to family planning, the project will work in this area. Plans are under way to educate the
public about the code, starting with a four-year pilot program in four provinces financed by the
Netherlands and other donors. This project will help support these activities. The Directorate for Family
Promotion will work closely with the General Directorate of Social Affairs and the Family as well as the
Dutch in planning and executing its activities. The emphasis will be on the identification of specific
problems facing women in different areas of the four provinces, followed by educational activities
targeted on the specific reforms contained in the Family Code that address those problems. Legal



59
ANNEX 4
Page 7 of 9
information centers will also be established and a range of information about women's rights will be
provided, including information about family planning and AIDS.
29.          National Committee Against Excision. The practice of excision is still widespread in
Burkina, with deleterious health consequences for young women and girls. The National Committee
Against Excision is a volunteer body that has accomplished some important work in educating traditional
leaders and the public about the harmful consequences of excision. It is attached to the office of the
Minister of Social Affairs and the Family and has established 10 provincial committees and hundreds of
local committees that seek to educate the public about the harmful effects of excision. The national
committee has developed a four-year plan to enable it to expand and intensify its educational activities,
while still preserving its volunteer character. Specifically, it will seek to increase the number of
provincial and local committees against excision, develop educational materials for use by the committees,
work with the mass media and reproduce a film on excision. These activities will be supported under
the project.
30.          Training Social Workers. A family planning IEC curriculum has been used to train a
substantial number of social workers in Burkina in recent years. The Directorate for Family Promotion
has participated actively in developing and teaching the curriculum, but training has been organized by
the Family Health Directorate which had funding for this activity. Under this project, the Directorate
for Family Promotion will take over the training. The current curriculum and training team will continue
to be used and the directorate will continue to work closely with the Family Health Directorate.
Approximately 180 social workers will be trained over the life of the project.
31.          Nongovernmental Organizations. The chief vehicle for NGO participation in population
IEC activities will be through the Fund. Since NGOs contribute in an important way to IEC, however,
they will be represented in the monthly IEC meetings convened by CONAPO and an NGO representative
will be involved in the decision-making group responsible for decentralized IEC activities.
II. AJIDS/STDs IEC
32.          This subcomponent of the project aims to increase public knowledge of AIDS and STDs
and to increase the practice of preventive practices. Since awareness of AIDS is already high in Burkina,
the objective will not be simply to increase knowledge. Rather, the objectives will be to double the
proportion of young people (aged 15-25) in the population who believe they personally are at risk of
AIDS, while also doubling awareness of condoms as a means of AIDS prevention among the general adult
population. The pre-project KAP survey already mentioned (para. 7) will provide baseline data
permitting the "doubling" objectives to be quantified and a repetition of the survey in Year 5 will allow
the impact of the IEC subcomponent to be measured.
33.          Mass media, including not only radio and television but also billboards, cinema
promotions and videos, will be used intensively to convince the public as a whole that AIDS is a reality
and prevention should be a priority for each individual. Interpersonal communications through a variety
of channels will reinforce this message and will provide more detailed information about condom use,
particularly to groups at high risk, such as women with multiple partners, truckers, miners, the military
and others. Considerable effort will also be devoted to STDs which have not received the attention they
deserve to date. While all methods of transmission and prevention will be covered, the major emphasis
will be on sexual transmission, as it is the most significant route of infection, and on condom use and
sexual behavior change as the primary means of prevention.

34.          This subcomponent will be managed by the Permanent Secretariat of the National AIDS
Committee which will, for the first time, have a staff devoted to IEC (para. 4). The specific activities
to be financed are the following:
35.           IEC Research. There has been little action-oriented research on AIDS and STDs thus far
in Burkina and a number of qualitative and quantitative studies will be undertaken throughout the life of
the project to assist in identifying target audiences, communications channels and effective messages as
well as to assess the impact of ongoing IEC activities. Such research will be crucial to the success of the
AIDS/STD IEC program, and especially its mass media activities. While the National AIDS Committee's
IEC staff will play a major role in the design of the research and the interpretation of results, the
technical aspects of the work will be undertaken by outside research institutions whenever possible. As
a prelude to the project's IEC research activities, the findings of past research will be synthesized into
a single document.
36.           Mass Media. To date, there has not been extensive use of the mass media to convey
AIDS or STD messages and it is anticipated that several different types of mass media will be used,
including radio and television, press, billboards and cinema promotions. Because of the impact of short,
repeated messages, there will be extensive use of short spots, particularly on radio which reaches a larger
audience than television. A total of six radio spots a year, each in four languages, are planned, as well
as four television spots, each in three languages. (In the first year, the number of spots will be halved,
because of the need to start up program activities and to conduct the basic research.) The radio spots will
be broadcast not only on national radio but also on the private stations and regional radio that attract large
audiences. Over the life of the project, the spots will seek to move the Burkinabe public along the
spectrum of behavior change, from awareness of AIDS, to concern about their personal risk,
understanding the means of prevention and where to obtain them and, finally, the use of preventive
measures, particularly condoms. The development of spots in local languages will be done in
collaboration with the CRESA for the region and will involve the population in testing messages and
images. Cinema promotion will also be used as well as billboards in the five largest cities. The
development of the mass media activities will be undertaken through one of the local advertising agencies,
under the supervision of the National AIDS Committee. As with famnily planning, AIDS/STD messages,
too, will be based on the results of IEC research and will be carefully tested before going into production.
37.          This intense promotion will be reinforced by the integration of information about
AIDS/STDs and their prevention into ongoing radio and television programs such as those on health,
those for women, popular theater, etc. Since mass media activities are costly, it is crucial that they have
an impact. Thus, after two years, there will be an outside evaluation of the role they have played in
advancing the project's AIDS IEC objectives. The evaluation will recommend whether to continue the
mass media program as planned, to modify it or discontinue it.
38.           Decentralized IEC Activities. These activities will be the backbone of the subcomponent's
interpersonal communications activities. As described in paras. 17-19, they will be a joint undertaking
of the CNIEC/Sante and the National AIDS Committee and the Family Health Directorate. Decentralized
AIDS/STD education activities will have as one of their major goals to reach groups at high risk of
AIDS/STDs, such as commercial sex workers, migrants, truckers, the military, miners and others. The
kinds of activities to be supported will likely include peer education; AIDS prevention dances for young
people; dissemination of educational materials in hotels, bars, gas stations and elsewhere; workplace
presentations; and video presentations-accompanied whenever possible by condom distribution. The
National AIDS Committee will pave the way for such initiatives by contacting national leaders and
coordinating efforts in Burkina with those in neighboring countries, where appropriate. Funds are
provided under the institutional development subcomponent for two trips abroad to ensure that activities



61
ANEX 4
Page 9 of 9
in Burkina are properly coordinated with those in neighboring countries where the incidence of
HIV/AIDS is high. The National AIDS Committee will provide specialized information, training and
technical assistance to the CRESAs to ensure the development of solid, accountable programs.
39.          Materials Development. All of the AIDS/STD IEC activities will require the development
of supporting educational and promotional materials. Among the materials to be produced will be a flip
chart, bumper stickers, posters, models to demonstrate condom use and at least three videos (the latter
to be produced in collaboration with an advertising agency). It is anticipated that at least four items per
year will be developed and distributed. Funds will be available not only to produce materials locally but
also to purchase films, videos, bulk orders of publications, etc., from abroad.
40.          Seminars for Opinion Leaders. The National AIDS Committee will convene four to six
seminars each year, with an average of 50 participants each, to ensure that key opinion leaders are kept
up to date on the AIDS crisis in Burkina and its implications for the country. One of the early seminars
to be held, once the first results of IEC research are in, will develop an AIDS IEC strategy to guide the
first phase of the program. It will set out specific measurable objectives, along with priority target
audiences, key messages, the media to be used and a theme for the campaign. Workshops for the media
can also be held under this rubric.
41.          Resource Center. The National AIDS Committee should be a resource for information
about AIDS and STDs.  Accordingly, funds are provided under the institutional development
subcomponent to subscribe to specialized publications and purchase books and materials to start a
resource center.
42.          Training Social Workers. Social workers are important IEC agents and the project will
provide for the training of approximately 180 social workers on AIDS and STDs, their prevention and
effective communications techniques. This training will be conducted by the Directorate for Family
Promotion, in close collaboration with the National AIDS Committee, and combined with family planning
training whenever possible. This training will focus on local level social workers, as opposed to medical
and social work staff higher up in the system who will be caring for persons found to be HIV positive.
43.          In order to ensure that future generations of social workers receive pre-service training
on AIDS and STDs, the Directorate for Family Promotion will be responsible for working with the
National School of Social Service and the National AIDS Committee to update the school's curriculum
to include AIDS and STDs and then to train appropriate faculty to teach the curriculum.
44.          Non-governmental Organizations. The chief vehicle for NGO participation in EEC
activities on AIDS and STDs will be through the Fund. Since NGOs contribute in an important way to
IEC, however, they will be represented in the monthly IEC meetings convened by CONAPO and an NGO
representative will be involved in the decision-making group responsible for decentralized IEC activities.

POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
Renforcement Institutionnel du CONAPO
I. Presentation du CONAPO
1.           Le Conseil National de la Population (CONAPO) a et6 cree en 1983 essentiellement avec
I'appui du Fonds des Nations Unies pour les Activites de Population (FNUAP). II comprend quatre
commissions et un secretariat permanent. Le CONAPO est un organe consultatif interministeriel preside
par le Ministre charge du Plan. Le Secretariat Permanent est directement rattache au cabinet du Ministre
chqrge du Plan. DMs le debut le Secretariat a regu l'appui du projet Unite de Population finance par le
FNUAP dont la phase presente est prevue jusqu'a la fin 1995.
2.           Le Secretariat Permanent du CONAPO - assiste de l'Unite de Population - est l'organe
essentiel dans le fonctionnement du CONAPO et de ses commissions sp6cialis6es et donc dans
I'elaboration et la mise en oeuvre des politiques de population au Burkina Faso. Ses responsabilites sont
considerables. Le Secretariat Permanent est responsable de la prparation des propositions de 2olitigue
a soumettre au Conseil et aux commissions specialisees: a cet effet il entreprend des recherches qu'il
estime necessaires pour la preparation des propositions. Les propositions de modification de la Politique
de la Population qui ne concement pas l'ensemble du document mais seulement des domaines particuliers
peuvent etre directement soumises a la commission specialisee pertinente ou meme I d'autres agences
telles que, par exemple, les Directions Provinciales du Plan et ere finalement adoptees sans qu'il soit
necessaire de convoquer le Conseil National.
3.           Le Secretariat est egalement en charge de veiller au bon fonctionnement du systeme de
coordination des activites en mati4re de population en organisant des reunions de concertation des
intervenants I tous les niveaux. Il s'agit en principe d'une coordination horizontale des activites conduites
dans l'ensemble du secteur public et prive qui ont une composante Population ou dont la realisation a une
incidence sur la Population. Les domaines o6 cette coordination horizontale s'exerce sont nombreux: (i)
les recherches en matiere de population; (ii) l'integration de la variable Population dans les plans et
programmes; (iii) l'IEC; et (iv) le bien-tre familial. Ces domaines correspondent aux attributions des
commissions specialisees.
4.           Le Secretariat Permanent joue aussi un rOle d'apWi vis-a-vis des administations et agences
publiques qui veulent monter des projets avec une composante population (i) en realisant des recherches
ou etudes opeationnelles relatives a ces progammes, et (ii) en cherchant des financements. Le Secretariat
Permanent est en position de jouer ce rOle d'appui du fait que tous les projets avec une composante
population lui sont soumis au CONAPO pour avis par le Ministre du Plan.
5.           Enfin le Secretariat est responsable du suivi et de l'evaluation des programmes et
strategies en matiere de population. II a mis au point a cet effet un document technique destine I
standardiser les indicateurs d'evaluation et les methodes et approches d'evaluation des projets.

RWalisations a ce jour
6.           Les activites du CONAPO ont vraiment debute en 1989. Le CONAPO a tenu ses
premieres assises en avril 1990, assises au cours desquelles a ete finalise un avant projet de Politique de
Population qui avait ete prepar6 par le Secretariat Permanent avec l'assistance du projet Unite de
Population du FNUAP. La politigue de noRulation a ete officiellement adoptee en juin 1991. Du 16 au
20 decembre 1991 s'est tenu I Bobo-Dioulasso un seminaire national sur la finalisation du Programme
d'Actions Prioritaires en matiere de population avant de la soumettre pour adoption au Gouvernement.
En mai 1992 le Secretariat Permanent a organise un seminaire national sur la coordination des activites
en matiere de 2oDulation au cours duquel le role des ONG a ete pleinement reconnu.
7.           La commission specialis6e sur la Recherche Demographique se reunit regulierement sur
convocation du SP afin de faire le point sur les lacunes dans les recherches en matiere de population en
vue de proposer des etudes prioritaires en reponse a des problemes particuliers tels que par exemple les
r6ticences de la population a l'utilisation de telle ou telle methode de contraception. Le Secretariat
Permanent a lui meme execute de petites Etudes (telles que des enquetes CAP) mais en g6n6ral il procede
en diffusant vers les projets et bureaux de recherche les resultats de ses investigations.
8.           Le Secretariat a 6tabli des projections de population avec le Direction de la Demographie
du l'Institut National de Statistiques et de D6mographie (INSD), il assiste rEgulibrementles Dirtections
des Etudes et de la Planification (DEP) dans la prise en compte des variables demographiques lors de
la pr6paration des plans sectoriels et a tenu deux seminaires sur l'integration de la variable demographigue
avec les DEP des differents ministeres. Aucune Etude de suivi sur les effets de ces actions n'a encore ete
realisee cad sur l'integration effective de la variable population dans la pr6paration des plans de
developpement. Au debut 1993 le Secr6tariat Permanent a entrepris 1'6laboration de trente monographies
provinciales en collaboration avec les Directions Regionales du PLAN (DRP) et d'autres competences
des diff6rents ministeres et de l'Universite. Le but des monographie est triple: (i) rassembler une masse
de donnees socio-economiques et d6mographiques dans un document unique (et donc valoriser les donn6es
collectees lors des recensements et enquetes d6mographiques); (ii) fournir de la matiere premiere aux
DRP pour la preparation du prochain Plan, et (iii) faciliter l'int6gration des variables d6mographiques
dans les plans et et programmes provinciaux. Enfin - et toujours pour renforcer l'activit6 d'int6gration
des variables d6mographiques dans la planification du developpement - le SecrEtariat Permanent a
entrepris d'organiser d'ateliers de modelisation demo-economique: un tel atelirr s'est tenu du 22
novembre au 3 d6cembre 1993 a Ouagadougou regroupant toutes les DEP autour d'un modele appel6
"INTGRA".
9.           Un forum sur la definition d'une strategie en matiere d'IEC/Population s'est tenu fin
novembre 1992 avec l'ensemble des services et agences ayant des activites de IEC. Aucune activite de
coordination importante n'a encore 6t6 enregistree dans le domaine du Bien-etre familial.
Ressources du CONAPO
10.          Le CONAPO et son Secr6tariat Permanent ont travaille jusqu'ici avec des ressources
limitEes. Mis a part le salaire des deux fonctionnaires du Ministere du Plan d6tach6s au CONAPO - et
dont l'un cumule les fonctions de Directeur National du Projet Unite de Population et de Secr6taire
Permanent du CONAPO - toutes les activites ont 6t6 financ6es par le biais du projet "UnitE de
Population' du FNUAP.

11.          En plus du Secretaire Permanent du CONAPO, I'equipe actuelle comprend un
Demographe G6ographe en provenance du Plan et un expert du FNUAP qui remplit les fonctions de
Conseiller Technique Principal (CTP) au Projet. Ces trois specialistes sont responsables pour l'ensemble
des realisations du CONAPO a ce jour avec les contributions ponctuelles de consultants nationaux ou des
membres des commissions specialisees. Deux autres fonctionnaires sont sur le point d'ere affecteea au
Secretariat en d6tachement d'autres ministeres. C'est le desir du Secretaire Permanent actuel que les
administrations qui font partie du Conseil National contribuent au fonctionnement du Secretariat en lui
detachant des fonctionnaires.
12.          Le Secr6tariat Permanent et le Projet sont loges dans un petit batiment comprenant 3
bureaux exigus, est 6quipe de deux vehicules dont un seulement en etat de marche, deux micro
ordinateurs et d'une imprimante: D ne dispose pas d'un telephone. Le CONAPO a recu une aide
substantielle du FNUAP sans lequel il n'aurait pas vu le jour. II devrait devenir le partenaire privilegie
de cette organisme et assumer le rBle de coordinateur national de l'execution du Programme de Population
du FNUAP.
Status Administratif du Secretariat Permanent
13.          Un projet de decret modifie portant r6organisation du CONAPO recemment et6 adopte
par le Conseil des Ministres d6crit dans leurs grandes lignes les modes de fonctionnement de ses
differents organes ainsi que les rBles respectifs du CONAPO, de ses Commissions Specialisees et de son
SECRETARIAT PERMANENT. Ce dernier est attache administrativement au Cabinet du Ministere du
Plan mais ses attributions premieres sont celle de secretariat du Conseil National de la Population. Ses
missions consistent a conduire des activit6s qui contribuent directement I l'elaboration et a la r6vision
de la politiques de population; a sa diffusion et a sa dissemination; a la coordination des activites en
matiere de population, et au suivi des diffeents programmes sectoriels dans la mesure obi ces programmes
ont une composante population. II n'a toutefois pas de responsabilite directe dans la preparation et
l'ex6cution d'un programme national de population.
14.          On peut donc distinguer dans les responsabilites du Secretariat celles qui sont orientees
vers la definition et les revisions de la politique de population et celles qui sont tournees vers le suivi de
l'execution de ces politiques. Dans la premiere catdgorie on trouvera la recherche demographique y
compris la mesure de l'impact des programmes sectoriels ayant une composante population, et dans la
deuxieme toutes les activit6s de sensibilisation et de coordination des programmes. La ob il a des
responsibiite de conduire des activites directes le Secretariat aura souvent recours, dans la mesure ob ses
ressouces le lui permettent, aux agences, services publics et privds du pays disposant des competences
specialisees, notamment dans le domaine de la recherche demographique et de la production et conduite
de campagnes mediatiques ou d'IEC.
II. Actions pour le Renforcement Institutionnel du CONAPO
15.          L'objectif des actions proposees ci-apres est le renforcement du leadership du Secretariat
du CONAPO dans la mise en place, la coordination, le suivi et l'evaluation de la politique de population
du Burkina Faso. Dans ce but le PPLS prevoit d'apporter son assistance dans trois domaines:
(1)    Assistance dans le domaine de la coordination des activites en matiere de population



65
ANNEXS
Page 4 of 6
(2)    Assistance dans le domaine de la recherche demographique
(3)    Assistance pour le developpement de la capacite de gestion du Secretariat Permanent
population.
16.          L'execution de ces activites est toutefois soumise a une conditionalite a savoir la
promulgation du decret portant reorganisation du CONAPO et definissant clairement les attributions du
Secretariat Permanent du CONAPO.
A. Assistance dans le domaine de la coordination des activites en mati&re de population
17.          Une des fonctions principales du CONAPO et de son Secretariat Permanent est la
coordination pour l'execution de la politique de population et notamment l'integration des variables
demographiques dans les progammes et plans sectoriels. Le PPLS assistera dans ce domaine en finangant
20 r6unions de concertation dont 15 pour des secteurs determines et cinq (soit une par an) pour
l'ensemble des ministeres, organismes public ou parapublic et organisations privees dont les programmes
et interventions ont une incidence sur la population. Ces reunions pourront coYncider avec celles des
Commissions Specialisees.
18.          Le but de ces reunions sera d'engendrer la coordination en creant des consensus entre les
responsables de programmes au moyen de l'information pertinente et du dialogue. Les objectifs
specifiques de ces reunions seront: (i) d'evaluer ensemble l'impact des differents programmes ou activites
sur la population - notamment en diffusant les resultats des recherches recentes -, (ii) d'identifier les
domaines oi l'absence de programme ou d'intervention est dommageable, (iii) de verifier la coh6rence
des actions des differents intervenants en matiere de population dans chaque secteur ou dans l'ensemble
des secteurs, et (iv) d'harmoniser les strategies d'intervention dans chaque secteur, et (v) de recommander
des mesures appropri6es.
19.          Le Secretariat Permanent du CONAPO sera responsable de la programmation de ces
reunions dont l'execution pourra toutefois etre confiee au travers d'un contrat de service a des ONG ou
associations privees selon les secteurs. La contribution du PPLS a l'organisation de la concertation entre
les differents intervenants dans les activites de population represente un investissement dans la
credibilite/legitimit6 du CONAPO en tant qu'agence ayant le leadership dans la preparation des politiques
de population et dans la coordination des actions en vue de l'ex6cution de ces politiques.
20.          Le PPLS fournira 10 PM d'expertise locale pour la programmation des reunions de
concertation et financera 10 contrats d'organisation des reunions de concertation entre le CONAPO et des
ONG d'un montant de 10.000 USD chacun.
B. Assistance dans le domaine de la recherche demographique
21.          La recherche sur l'impact des differents facteurs influengant la demographie au Burkina
Faso est necessaire a la fois (i) pour la la revision et la mise a jour des politiques de population et (ii)
pour contribuer a augmenter la pertinence des programmes d'actions sectoriels ayant une composante
population ou ayant un impact sur la demographie du pays. La definition et l'execution d'un programme
actif de recherches en matiere de population est une priorite pour le CONAPO et constitue d'ailleurs une
de ses attributions principales aii travers de la Commission Specialisee sur la Recherche Demographique



66
ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 6
22.          Les activites qui seront realisees sous ce chapttre sont les suivantes:
(a)    Une revue des recherches en population deja entreprises comprenant une presentation
synoptique de leurs resultats ainsi que les reactions qu'ils ont suscites et la dissemination
de ces resultats et reactions aupres des patenaires et des clients du CONAPO.
(b)    Un inventaire de tous les organismes executant ou financant des recherches en matiere
de population au Burkina Faso ou dans la region et relatives au Burkina Faso ainsi que
si possible une identification de leur programme de recherches dans les annees 1995 -
1998 et une 6valuation de leurs performances et de leurs ressources en chercheurs.
(c)    Definition d'un agenda de recherche en matiere de population I executer dans les 3
prochaines annees (1995 -1997) qui comprendra les elements suivants (i) la definition des
axes de recherche prioritaires; (ii) l'identification des domaines deficitaires; (iii)
l'identification des domaines ou l'intervention complementaire du CONAPO est requise
sera complementaire; et enfin (iv) la mise au point d'un programme d'ensemble de
recherche avec des composantes qui seront financees par le CONAPO.
(d)    Financement de contrats de recherche entre le CONAPO et des centres et organismes de
recherche competents du Burkina Faso.
23.          Le PPLS contribuera 3 PM d'expertise internationale et 6 PM d'expertise nationale pour
mettre le programmes de recherches au point et financera 10 contrats de recherche en matiere de
population, d'un montant de 50.000 USD chacun, a executer durant la preriode du projet par un bureau
ou centre de recherche local.
C. Development de la capadt6 en gestion du Secretariat Permanent
24.          Une serie d'interventions legeres sont prevues afin de renforcer les capacites gestionnaires
du Secretariat Permanent dans les domaines d'intervention de la Composante Population du PPLS, visant
les resultats suivants:
(1)    mettre en place une distribution des responsabilites correspondant aux fonctions du
Secretariat Permanent du CONAPO et examiner le mode de fonctionnement du systeme
de coordination;
(2)    mettre en place une capacite amelioree dans la preparation, la negociation et la gestion
de contrats de services, notamment en recherches demographiques et en production de
materiel IEC et execution de campagnes;
(3)    mettre en place une capacite amelioree dans le montage et la gestion d'actions d'appui
(programmation, execution, suivi et evaluation)
25.          Ces interventions consisteront essentiellement en ateliers tenus avec des specialistes et au
cours desquels des instruments de gestion appropries seront presentes, examines et adaptes aux necessites
des activites et du contexte dans lequel travaille le staff du Secretariat.

26.           Organisation du travail sein du systeme de coordination du CONAPO et au sein du
SECRETARIAT DU CONAPO. - Les experts sous la supervision du Secretaire Permanent procederont
a l'inventaire de toutes les fonctions des differents comites du CONAPO et a l'examen des relations entre
eux et avec le Comite National et le Secretariat Permanent: ils feront des propositions sur les modes les
plus rentables de fonctionnement de ces differents organes et une estimation des ressources annuelles
n6cessaires pour atteindre un niveau de performance suffisant. Ils passeront egalement en revue les tAches
du SECRETARIAT PERMANENT et procederont a leur regroupement par poste en fonction des
attributions du Secretariat, ainsi qu'a la redaction - si necessaire - de protocoles et de procedures
operationnelles. Puisque le staff est peu nombreux et que les attributions et tAches du SP sont diverses
il est suggere qu'on ne procede pas a une repartition rigide des tAches entre les differents postes mais
qu'au contraire on laisse la latitude au SECRETAIRE PERMANENT d'attribuer les tAches en fonction
des disponibilites de personnel dans le cadre d'operations ponctuelles.
27.           Le projet financera six PM d'expertise locale et trois PM d'expertise internationale pour
le developpement des instruments de programmation, de negociation et d'adjudication de contrats de
service et pour l'organisation des taches au sein du Secretariat.
II financera egalement l'acquisition de (i) deux vehicules de service, (ii) trois micro ordinateurs avec
peripherique, et (iii) des fournitures et materiel de bureau pour trois unites.

BURKINA FASO
POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
Renforcement Institutionnel de la DSF
I. Objectif de la sous-composante
I.            L'objectif general de la sous-composante est de faire de la DSF une organisation capable
d'imposer une ligne directrice aux operations des nombreux intervenants dans les programmes de
SMI/PF, Nutrition et Vaccinations et de transformer en appui efficace aux structures de distribution de
soins et services les ressources humaines, materielles, techniques et financieres mises a la disposition de
ces programmes pa le Gouvernement et les doneurs internationaux.
2.            Cet objectif general sera accompli a travers la realisation des objectifs specifiques
suivants:
ObjectifAUN:          Mettre au point une procedure efficace d'elaboration et de revision
periodique d'un Programme Integre de Sante de la Famille (PISF) et des sous-programmes
nationaux en SMIIPF, en Nutrition et en Vaccinations preventives
Obiectif DEUX:       Executer une rationalisation (une repartition fonctionnelle) des taches de
programmation, de supervision et suivi et d'appui a la DSF en vue de 1'execution effective du
Programme par l'ensemble des formations sanitaires du pays
Objectif TROIS:       Mettre au point un mecanisme de coordination rdgulier des activites des
divers intervenants et des systemes de supervision et d'appui aux equipes cadre de district
hautement performants.
Justification de l'Intervention
3.            La DSF doit remplir son mandat dans un environnement complique caracterise par (i) un
volume d'assistance internationale technique et materielle representant des contributions financieres
importantes (ii) par la presence de nombreux intervenants dans des domaines specifiques, disposant de
leurs propres approches dans ces domaines mais ne fournissant souvent qu'une couverture partielle des
besoins, (iii) par la multiplication d'initiatives en provenance d'agences internationales et d'organisations
privees diverses, (iv) par des services de sante en pleine reorganisation et (v) par une infrastructure de
distribution des soins encore fragile.
4.            Le r6le de la DSF dans l'integration des activit6s dans les divers domaines de la Sante
de la Famille et dans la coordination des differents acteurs est crucial pour que les efforts et les
investissements consentis aboutissent aux resultats recherches tant d'un point de vue des politiques de
population que du point de vue de la sante de la famille. Le renforcement des capacites organisationnelles
de la Direction est une necessite.

II. Organisation Actuelle
Les Fonctions de la DSF
5.           Le decret presidentiel du 24 aotlt 1992 portant organisation du Ministere de la Sante, de
l'Action Sociale et de la Famille stipule en son article 40 que "La Direction de la Sante de la Famille est
chargee d'organiser, de coordonner et de contr6ler les programmes d'action relatifs a la protection de la
sante de la mere et de l'enfant, a la planification familiale, a la nutrition et a la prevention par les
vaccinations". La DSF est une des quatre directions composant la Direction Generale de la Sante
Publique (DGSP). II est a noter que ce decret stipule egalement que la DGSP est chargee de traduire en
programme d'actions la politique de developpement sanitaire definie par le Gouvernement.
6.           La DSF est mandatee pour assister le Directeur General de la Sante Publique (DGSP) dans
la programmation, I'appui, la supervision et le suivi des prestations des services en SMI/PF, en Nutrition
et en Vaccination Preventive. La DSF a une relation fonctionnelle avec les responsables SMI/PF des
Directions Provinciales qu'elle peut superviser regulierement. En plus de ces fonctions la DSF a la
responsabilite de la coordination des activites du programme de PF avec l'ensemble des partenaires
nationaux et internationaux.
Organigramme et Ressources de la DSF
7.           Le service en SMI/PF de la DSF comprend 11 personnes a savoir un chef de service, un
bureau de Gestion des Prestations de Service Clinique en PF comprenant deux agents, un Bureau IEC/PF
comprenant 4 agents, et un Bureau SMI de 4 agents. Un releve des tAches accomplies par ce personnel
indique que cette equipe remplit rien que pour les activites de PF plus de 40 tAches differentes. Parmi
ces tAches la cogestion, la coordination et le suivi des projets de PF finances par l'aide internationale (b
1'exception des activites finarcees par l'IDA/Banque Mondiale qui le sont I partir du Projet de
D)veloppement des Services de Sante (PDSS) installe comme une Direction aupres du Secretaire General.
Le service de Nutrition comprend un chef de service et regroupe 8 nutritionnistes repartis dans deux
bureaux de 4 unites chacun: un bureau de surveillance et un bureau de dietetique. Chacun des 8
nutrionnistes est coordinateur d'un projet different, tous financeds par l'aide exterieure. Le Service de
Vaccination Preventive, recemment encore une Direction, a ete rattache a la DSF dans le cadre du decret
d'ao0t 1992.

8.           La DSF est structuree comme suit:
| Directeur |IS*cr6tariat
Secr6tariat
Service ConptabLe
e             estion        Programmes]  Approvisionnem.
Surveillance    Di6t6tique
Education       Hygiane
NutritionneLLe   ALimentaire
9.            La DSF est egalement a la tete d'un systeme d'approvisionnement en produits de PF
(commande, stockage et distribution des fournitures en PF) distinct du systeme classique de la Direction
des Services Pharmaceutiques (DSPH). L'achat des contraceptifs distribues par la DSF est finance par
les bailleurs de fonds essentiellement par l'USAID et par le FNUAP. Les contraceptifs distribues par
I'ABBEF sont achetes par International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). L'USAID est en train de
modifier la formule de financement des contraceptifs mais sa contribution est garantie jusqu'en 1996.
10.          Le service SMI/PF (11 personnes) est loge dans un bAtiment de 7 bureaux organises
autour d'une cours interieure. Le service de la nutrition y compris le laboratoire (9 agents et deux
volontaires intyernationales) est egalement abrite dans un batiment de 7 locaux. Ces deux blocs jouxtent
un batiment identique abritant les bureaux de la Direction une salle d'informatique et une salle de
conference. Un quatrieme bltiment sert de magasin pour le stockage des produits contraceptifs, et autres
materiels de consommation courante. Enfin, la section PEV est logee de fagon separee dans un complexe
moderne de bureaux eloigne de la Direction d'environ 0.8 Km.
11.          La DSF ne dispose pas d'un budget de fonctionnement propre. Son personnel est paye
directement par le Ministere des Finances sur base du budget de fonctionnement du MSASF. II dispose
d'une somme annuelle de 132.000 CFA par an et par vehicule pour l'entretien des vehicules et de bons
d'essence pour un montant de 1.214.000 CFA/trimestre.
III.   Faiblesses danm le Fonctionnement Actuel
12.          Les deficiences organisationnelles dans le fonctionnement de la DSF ont ete identifies dans
le document sur la Strategie Nationale en matiere de PF (Novembre 1992) et bien que ce diagnostic ait
ete etabli a partir d'une analyse sur le fonctionnement de la section SMI/PF on s'accorde en general pour
reconnattre qu'on retrouve ces memes deficiences dans le fonctionnement des autres sections.



71
ANNEX6
Page 4 of 10
13.           Au niveau de central on peut identifier les faiblesses institutionnelles suivantes: (i)
I'absence de documents de programme pour l'exdcution des strategies et politiques nationales en matiere
de population et de sante familiale;(ii) la faiblesse des mecanismes en place pour assurer l'adoption par
les responsables des provinces et des districts des objectifs du programme national de sant6 familiale dans
leurs plans d'action annuels; (iii) l'insuffisance des mecanismes de coordination entre la DSF et ses
partenaires du programme de PF; (iv) I'absence d'organigramme detaille et de description des taches et
le sous-equipement des services a la DSF par rapport a leurs responsabilites; et (v) le faible rendement
I ce jour des systemes d'information. Tous ces problemes constituent autant d'obstacles I l'expansion des
services.
14.           La preparation des Plans d'Action Annuels par les districts sanitaires (ou les DPSASF)
dans lesquels sont prevues les affectations de personnel et ressources materielles aux differentes FS de
la province, represente evidemment une etape essentielle pour l'execution des programmes dont la DSF
est responsable au niveau central. Les mecanismes actuellement en place ne permettent pas a la DSF de
s'assurer que chacune des 30 Directions Provinciales (et les equipes cadre de district qui vont
progressivement les remplacer) integrent les objectifs des programmes adoptes au niveau national dans
leurs plans d'action annuels. D'autant plus que les budgets provinciaux ne sont pas elabores sur base des
programmes ou des projets et n'expriment donc pas les intentions des DPSASF ou des districts sanitaires
pour la realisation des differents programmes. L'integration des objectifs d'un programme national de
Sante Familiale au niveau des provinces ou des districts sanitaires ne peut donc eue verifiee qu'a
posteriori, soit lors de l'ouverture de nouvelles unites de prestations, soit par l'observation des activites
lors de visites de supervision.
15.           Dans ces conditions il est crucial que la DSF poursuive un programme de visites de
supervision intense autour de l'execution d'un programme clairement defini. On observe toutefois que
les visites de supervision ne sont pas systenatiques. La cause de cette situation ne reside pas
necessairement dans l'absence de systemes et protocoles de supervision ou dans l'absence de competence
du personnel puisque dans la plupart des cas ces systemes et leurs divers protocoles existent et qu'un
nombre consequent de personnel a ete forme a leur utilisation. Mais les activites prevues par ces systemes
ne sont pas executees ou le sont avec retard. (II en est ainsi egalement de la collecte, de l'exp6dition et
de la compilation des donn6es de base du systenme d'information ou des requisitions d'approvisionnement).
L'absence de documents de programme en Sante Faniiliale PF et en Nutrition rend plus aleatoire
encore l'adoption des objectifs des programmes au niveau provincial.
16.           L'absence d'un organigramme d6taille specifiant les fonctions des differentes unites
operationnelles et l'absence d'une description des tAches des differents postes rend evidemment le contr6le
et l'organisation du travail difficile.De plus les Services sont d6munis en personnel et en moyens et ils
n'exercent qu'un controle limite sur les ressources et sur les activit6s de agents. D'une part les
ressources proviennent presque uniquement de l'aide exterieure et sont souvent affectees a l'execution des
activites d'un des projets g6res par la DSF et, d'autre part, une bonne partie du temps d'activites du
personnel ayant la responsabilite de coordination d'un projet est consacre a des taches directement
commandees par la mise en oeuvre de ces projets.
Enfin, le systeme central d'informations sanitaires connalt des insuffisances manifestes
et chaque service tente de doubler le systeme central en cr6ant le sien propre.

Restructuration des Services de Sante en Cours
17.           Une restructuration du MSASF est en cours dans le cadre du PDSS et du PDSN. Un
element important des reformes en cours concerne la restructuration des services de sante sur le terrain.
Les Directions Provinciales sont maintenues mais on procedera a la creation de districts medicaux autour
des CMs existants, et I la mise en place dans chaque district d'une antenne chirurgicale et d'une equipe
cadre compos6e d'au moins cinq personnes dont deux medecins. Un des aspects de cette restructuration
est que desormais ce seront les deux medecins de l'equipe cadre qui seront en charge de la supervision
de toutes les activites de service y compris de celles des programmes dits verticaux a I'echelon des CSPS.
Les equipes de district seront progressivement mises en place. On compte que 12 equipes cadre de
districts seront operationnels d'ici la fin 1993.
IV. Acitivtes de la Composante Renforcement Institutionnel de la DSF
18.           La strategie de renforcement institutionnel de la DSF retenue par le PPLS est centree sur
le pr6paration par chaque section - au cours d'ateliers animes par des experts - du sous-programme des
activites de leur ressort. Les sous-programmes sont ensuite regroupds en un Programme Integre de Sante
de la Famille (PISF). Le PISF et les sous-programmes de section seront elabores de fagon a (i) en faire
des instruments de travail performants pour la preparation et l'execution des plans d'action annuels
nationaux et le suivi de leur execution, (ii) fournir une reference incontournable pour la coordination des
partenaires et augmenter ainsi la rentabilite des apports exterieurs, et (iii) servir de tremplin a une
distribution plus fonctionnelle des taches A l'intdrieur de la DSF. Les activites de renforcement
institutionnel proprement dites seront les suivantes:
1)     Ateliers de preparation d'un premier Programme Integre de Sante de la Famille
2)     Introduction progressive d'une distribution plus fonctionnelle des taches et responsabilites
* l'interieur des sections y compris une description detaillee des postes et des tlches
3)     Fournitures d'intrants pour le renforcement des fonctions de supervision, de coordination,
de secretariat, et diverse fonctions d'appui de la DSF telles que la formation.
4)     Construction d'un batiment pour la DSF
1)    Elaboration du Progamme Integre de Sante de la Famille
19.           L'elaboration et la revision periodique du Programme Integre de Sante de la Famille
(PISF) devrait constituer desormais I'activite pivot de la Direction: ce programme integr6 sera prepar6
a partir des programmes des sections SMI/PF, de Nutrition et de Vaccination Preventive. II sera congu
pour une periode de 5 ans au minimum selon les principes de la planification glissante et donc revu et
revise periodiquement. II devra toujours 6tre d'actualite.
20.           Les programmes seront rediges en termes operationnels, cad identifieront les contraintes
pour l'execution des politiques et strategies nationales retenues, fixeront des objectifs specifiques ainsi
que des echeances pour leur realisation, et des listes d'activites devant conduire a leur accomplissement.
Chaque sous-programme comprendra une section etablissant les strategies en IEC retenues pour assurer
la promotion des services offerts aupres des populations cibles et des clients potentiels. II devra 6tablir
clairement les relations avec les activites et operations des projets en cours d'execution. Une annexe sera
consacree I la liste des projets et des intervenants (donneurs, bureaux d'etudes et ONG) impliques dans



73
ANNEX6
Page 6 of 10
1'execution du programme et constituant des ressources potentielles pour des actions d'appui. Chaque
programme devra egalement inclure les coOts estimes d'execution. Afin de faciliter l'integration des
services aux niveaux operationnels les responsables des programmes connexes seront invites I participer
a la preparation et a la revision du programme.
21.           L'execution du programme integre de sante de la famille commence avec la preparation
des plans annuels d'action nationaux et provinciaux ou de district sanitaire. Au niveau national le plan
d'action annuel est elabore par la DSF: il sera prepare par sous-programme et les actions retenues
figueront par sous-programme dans le document de plan sur base du PISF. It en sera de meme pour le
budget du Plan d'action qui devra etre compose par sous-programme. La budgetisation des plans d'action
nationaux pour les differents sous-programmes se fera en etroite concertation avec la DAAF laquelle
participe au projet de modernisation de l'administration qui inclut l'instauration de nouvelles
nomenclatures budgdtaires tenant compte des depenses par programme.
22.           La redaction des plans annuels d'action provinciaux releve des Districts Sanitaires ou
des Directions Provinciales. II est utopique d'attendre dans l'immediat que la preparation des plans
d'action aux niveaux provincial et central soit synchronisee: ils seront pratiquement prepares
simultanement. La DSF peut toutefois influer sur la preparation des plans annuels d'actions provinciaux
en diffusant et faisant la promotion active du Programme Integre de Sante Familiale et en suggerant des
objectifs et des listes d'activites et de ressources a affecter dans chaque province. Cette diffusion et
promotion du PISF est une des roles de la Supervision (voir Supervision).
2) Coordination des efforts des differents acteurs
23.           Il faudra proceder a la mise en place effective d'un mecanisme de concertation et de
coordination entre la DSF d'une part et les donneurs et les organisations privees responsables de projets
dans les domaines de la SMI/PF, de la Nutrition d'autre part, ainsi qu'avec les commissions du CONAPO
et la DPF pour ce qui concerne les activites d'IEC correspondantes. Cette concertation aura comme but
d'assurer une meilleure realisation du PISF de la DSF en rationalisant les contributions des differents
partenaires a leur realisation.
24.           Plus speciquement la concertation devra assurer (i) que les objectifs de projets ou
operations envisages soient alignes sur les objectifs du PISF, (ii) que les approches retenues par les
differents partenaires soient compatibles avec les strategies nationales, (iii) qu'il y ait complementarite
(eviter les duplications) des ressources offertes et des zones couvertes par les partenaires. La concertation
sera assuree essentiellement en utilisant les moyens suivants: (i) la diffusion par la DSF d'une
information homogene a destination de tous les partenaires, particulierement la diffusion des differents
Programmes et (ii) des reunions regulieres permettant des echange d'information entre les partenaires et
centrees, soit sur les objectifs et strategies futures du programme, soit sur les evaluations et rapports
d'execution et de suivi des differents projets, soit enfin sur les problemes rencontres par les differents
intervenants dans l'execution presente du programme.
3) Redistribution des taches du personnel de la DSF
25.           Les ateliers d'elaboration des programmes de section et du PISF seront congus et conduits
de facon a sensibiliser les responsables aux deficiences des modes de gestion actuels et a la necessite de



74
ANNEX6
Page 7 of 10
les modifier. Le PISF sera ensuite utilise pour faciliter l'introduction progressive d'une redistribution plus
fonctionnelle des tlches a l'interieur des sections, redistribution centree sur 1'execution des programmes.
Cette reorganisation progressive s'accompagnera d'une operation de description detaillee des postes et
des tAches dans les sections et d'une revue du mecanisme de contrBle de la performance des agents.
4) Supervision des eguipes cadre et des provinces
26.           Les activites de supervision seront renforvcees et poursuivront les objectifs op6rationnels
suivants: (i) insertion des objectifs des programmes nationaux dans les plans d'action annuels provinciaux
ou des districts, et (ii) suivi de l'execution des programmes avec releve des problemes par district,
notamment dans le fonctionnement des systemes d'information et de distribution des produits, (iii) appui
sur place aux equipes cadre et DP, et (iv) identification d'actions d'appui soit directement par la DSF soit
avec le concours de la DSF dans chaque province ou district: ces actions d'appui sont destin6es en
premier lieu aux equipes provinciales ou de districts mais avec leur accord elles pourront etre dirigees
directement vers des niveaux operationnels (CSPS).
27.           Ces objectifs en matiere de supervision impliquent les activites suivantes sur une base
regulRire
- releve periodique des ressources (type, volume et qualitd) de chaque province ou district
disponibles pour la realisation des programmes
- revue critique des rapports d'execution des Plans d'Action des provinces ou districts avec les
responsables locaux des programmes supervises par la DSF
- suivi du fonctionnement des systemes d'information (collecte et traitement des donn6es au niveau
du district ou de la province) ainsi que de la distribution de materiels divers et revue periodiques
des problemes et contraintes existant dans ces domaines
- mise au point en concertation avec chaque DP et chaque equipe cadres de district des methodes
(approche integree, frequences, protocoles) de supervision utilises entre le niveau district et les
formations sanitaire : cette activite sera conduite en consultation avec le noyau de
formateurs/superviseurs charges de la mise en place des equipes cadres de district et basee I 1'
ENSP.
- identification avec les DP et equipes cadre de district des contraintes rencontrees pour la
realisation des programmes et des actions d'appui a fournir par la DSF (ou avec le concours de
la DSF) pour les surmonter (formations, changement dans les allocations de ressources, dans les
approches et les procedures)
V. Activites et Intrants de la Composante Renforcement Institutionnel de la DSF
Activite UN   Elaboration du programme national de Sante de la Famille

30.          Les intrants suivants seront necessaires pour la realisation de l'activite:
- 2 PM d'expertise internationale pour assistance lors des phases UN, DEUX et QUATRE
- 3 PM d'expertise internationale pour la preparation et l'animation de 3 ateliers (PHASE
TROIS)
Activitd DEUX       Introduction progressive - et en association avec le personnel - d'une distribution
des tlches I la DSF centree sur la preparation et 1'execution du programme
integre de sante familiale.
31.          Cette activite se deroulera en plusieurs phases
Phase UN: preparation par un expert en organisation et methodes de plusieurs propositions de
rationalisation de l'organisation des taches au sein de la DSF et des section sur la base du
programme integre de sante familial.
Phase DEUX: discussion de ces propositions par le Directeur et Chefs de Service et adoption
finale d'un mode de redistribution des postes et des taches

ANNEX 6
Page 9 of 10
Phase TROIS: descriptions des taches des differents postes - avec la participation du personnel -
et adoption d'un calendrier d'introduction progressive de nouveau mode d'organisation . Cette
phase comprendra si necessaire le developpement de procedures opeationnelles pour le Bureau
IEC de la Section SMI/PF
Phase QUATRE: execution du calendrier
32.           Les intrants suivants seront necessaires pour 1'execution de cette activite:
- 3 PM d'expertise internationale et 3 PM d'expertise nationale pour I'laboration des differentes
propositions, les analyses et descriptions des tAches, les proc6dures operationnelles en gestion de
programmes d'IEC, et l'elaboration du plan/calendrier de mise en place
- 4 Bourses d'un an de formation en gestion des programmes de sante et santd de la famille
- 12 Bourses de trois mois de formation sur place ou dans des pays voisins en gestion en sante
Activit6 TROIS       Developpement de la capacite operationnelle de de la DSF dans le domaine de la
coordination, de la su2ervision. de I'appui aux districts et du secretariat
33.           Cette activite consiste essentiellement dans la fourniture d'intrants pour le renforcement
de diverses fonctions de la DSF. II n'est pas necessaire d'attendre les r6sultats de la rationalisation des
tAches a la DSF pour proceder a ces fournitures d'intrants.
34.           La DSF preparera une directive sur I'organisation de la coordination des intervenants
dans la perspective des activites de renforcement institutionnel: (i) buts de la coordination pour
l'execution du programme integre de sante familiale, (ii) responsabilites respectives de la DSF et des
partenaires (donneurs et intervenants divers) dans 1'execution du programme, (iii) reunions de
coordination (participants, fr6quence). Une Personne Mois d'expertise locale sera requise.
35.           La fourniture d'intrants pour le renforcement de la supervision est soumise I la
condition de I'affectation par le Secretaire Gen6ral de la Sante de deux m6decins pour les activites de
supervision a la DSF: les intrants suivants seront fournis a la DSF
(a)    trois vehicules tout terrain dont deux a livrer en I'annee 2 du projet et le troisibme k
I'ann6e 3
(b)    Bons d'essence pour 300 litres/trimestre pour la supervision et 50.000 CFA/an pour
l'entretien de chaque vehicule a justifier tant pour Iq DSF que pour chaque equipe
provinciale de supervision.
36.           Les services de formation offerts par le DSF aux districts et aux formation sanitaires
necessitent la restauration ou la construire d'un centre de formation dans 5 provinces pour y accueillir
des formations organisees au niveau regional. Cette formule permet d'eviter de mobiliser tous les
travailleurs de sante d'une mtme province au meme moment. L'equipement des cinq centres comprendra

Flip charts avec support
Materiel de soutien a la formation (une photocopieuse et une roneo par centre)
Formatheque INTRAH (minibibliotheque de soutien aux formateurs)
Recyclage a l'annee 2 du projet des formateurs provinciaux formes en 91 et 92 par
INTRAH en technique de PF
indemnites pour les sorties de suivi des personnes formees
37.          Le renforcement du Secr6tariat de la DSF requiert la fourniture des intrants suivants:
- 2 PM d'expertise locale pour l'etablissement d'un systeme de classement et de
localisation facile de l'information a la DSF, de mise en ordre des archives et
d'organisation de la bibliotheque
-Materiel de classement (armoires, cartons, archives)
-Formation de courte duree du personnel de secr6tariat au classement et I la
programmation
- Formation d'un bibliothecaire au niveau local
- Formation complementaire en informatique du personnel du secretariat
Activite OUATRE    Construction et equipement d'un b&timent I usage de bureaux plus une salle de
conference I la DSF
38.          Pour assurer le rendement de tous les autres efforts de renforcement instituionnel il est
urgent que le DSF puisse abriter ses services et son personnel dans des locaux ad6quats. I s'agira de
proceuer a la construction d'un petit edifice de 400 M2 pour compl6ter les infrastructures existantes dans
le cadre de la reorganisation des services et du renforcement institutionnel. Cet 6difice abriterq au moins
dix bureaux et une salle de conference pour une cinquantaine de personnes et une salle de reproduction
en annexe. Un premier plan a ete dessine et se trouve I la DSF. L'equipement de ce bAtiment
comprendra les intrants suivants:
Pour chacun des 10 bureaux:
un bureau, un fauteuil et deux chaises, un classeur de grande taille et une armoire, une tablette
pour telephone ainsi que la climatisation
Pour la salle de conference:
Tables et chaises pour 50 personnes, deux armoires, une phocopieuse et periph6riques, une table
deux chaises et une armoire
Pour l'ensemble prevoir 12 appareils de telephone

POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
Composante VIHSIEDA/MST
Surveillance Epideniologique
A. DMfinition et Generalite
1.    La surveillance epidemiologique peut Wre le plus simnplement ddfinie comme un processus
dynamique incluant la collecte, I'analyse et la dissemination des donnees imnportantes pour les activites
de contrdle et Prevention d'un problbme de sante publique bien determine.  La surveillance
epidemiologique peut etre active ou passive. Dans la surveillance active on effectue une recherche active
des cas se rapportant au probleme de sante auquel on est intdresse, contrairement a la surveillance passive
dans laquelle on met en place un systeme passif de notification des cas. Chacune de ces 2 formes de
surveillance a ses avantages et desavantages. L'avantage majeur de la forme active sur la methode passive
est qu'elle fourni des donnees plus completes mais par contre elle est associee une mobilisation des
ressources tant humaines que materiels tres importante, ce qui est un avantage pour la surveillance passive
qui est en general moins cofteuse.
B. Surveillance dans le cadre de l'epidemie de SIDA
2.    De maniere generale les mdthodes de surveillance pour le VIH/SIDA sont les memes que celles
pour les autres pathologies, mis I part quelques aspects particuliers lies I l'impact du SIDA sur l'individu
et la societe, ainsi qu'aux capacites de diagnostic existantes dont il faut tenir compte dans cette
surveillance particuliere. Dans le cadre de l'epidemie du SIDA, il est important de faire la difference
entre la surveillance de l'infection au virus de l'immuno-deficience humaine (VIH) et la surveillance du
syndrome d'immuno-ddficience acquise (SIDA). Pour la premiere l'element d'interet et l'agent etiologique
(VIH), alors que la seconde s'occupe des manifestations cliniques du SIDA maladie.
a. Surveillance VIH
3.    Comme dit plus haut la surveillance du VIH s'interesse I suivre l'evolution de l'epidemie en se
basant sur les cas des infections I VIH avec ou sans signes cliniques. Ceci est rendu possible par
l'existence des tests de laboratoire permettant la detection du VIH. Bien qu'associee avec des problemes
ethiques lies I au fait que la mise en evidence de l'infection chez un individu (l'informer de son resultat
ou non? demander son consentement ou non pour etre tester? etc...), les donnees fournies par la
surveillance du VIH sont plus importantes que les doanees sur le SIDA pour les activites du programme
de contr6le et prevention car elles sont plus proches de la realite en ce qui concerne le nombre des
nouveaux cas et l'ampleur du probltme, le SIDA survenant seulement plusieurs annees aprbs l'infection.
En plus le diagnostic du VIH est plus precis que celui du SIDA; ceci est surtout vrai pour les pays en
developpement oti les tests de laboratoire ne sont toujours pas disponibles pour confirmer une
presomption clinique. Comme toute surveillance, la surveillance du VIH peut etre active ou passive.

(i) La surveillance active du VIH
4.     Surveillance des sites sentinelles. Elle se fait suivant une periodicite determinee, dans des sites
choisis et parmi des sous groupes definis de la population. L'activite consiste I effectuer r6gulierement
suivant la periodicite choisie, des tests pour le VIH chez un certain nombre des personnes venant des sites
ou groupes (femmes enceintes, prostituees, patients presentant une MST, nouveaux nes etc...) retenus.
De maniere generale, le type de population I inclure dans ce type de surveillance depend de la prevalence
estime de chaque pays ou region. Pour les pays ou regions a tres faible prevalence, la surveillance doit
cibler les groupes definis comme "a haut risque" et dans ceux (pays ou regions) I prevalence elevee la
surveillance doit inclure en meme temps des groupes 'I faible risque" et des groupes 'I haut risque". Le
nombre de personnes a tester depend essentiellement de la prevalence estim6e du VIH dans la population
d'o4 vient I'echantillon et de la precision escomptee. Toutefois on doit aussi tenir compte des autres
facteurs tels que les ressources existantes, I'accessibilite de la population I etudier etc... Pour maximiser
la pr6cision des resultats obtenus et minimiser le biais lie a l'auto-selection des sujets au cours de cette
surveillance, il est preferable d'effectuer des tests anonymes et non correles qui n'offrent pas la possibiite
aux sujets de decider de leur participation et ne necessitent pas un systeme de counseling pour l'annonce
des resultats serologiques. A cet effet, on utilise des 6chantillons de sang collectes pour d'autres raisons
( ex: sang preleve pour le ddpistage au cours de la grossesse) sur lesquels tous les elements
d'identification d'une personne ont ete enleves.
5.     Surveillance active Dar echantillon de la population generale. Ia population I l'etude est la
population generale, un echantillon choisi au hasard par methode statistique appropriee est teste pour le
VIH. Si il etait possible de conduire ce type de surveillance dans les conditions ideales, elle donnerait des
estimations de prevalence plus proches de la realite et plus d'informations sur la population que la
surveillance sentinelle. Malheureusement, etant donn6 que le sang lors de cette activit6 est collect6e
specifiquement pour le test du VIH, il devient obligatoire que les sujets donnent leur consentement ce qui
rend difficile l'interpretation des resultats ne connaissant pas les caracteristiques des personnes refusant
de participer (biais de participation); en plus cette activit6 necessite des depenses considerables surtout
dans les pays qui sont vastes et elle est tres difficile a repliquer.
CiH) Surveillance passive du VIH
6.    La surveillance passive du VIH se fait essentiellement par l'utilisation des resultats des tests
effectues au niveaux des differentes institutions sanitaires oti les tests sont effectues. Elle demande la
participation des ces institutions qui doivent notifier les resultats I la structure charg6e de la surveillance
epidemiologique. Ses avantages sont qu'elle est peu coOteuse et peut fournir des informations sur
differents sous groupes de la population. Elle a neanmoins des limitations telles que: difference de
strategie de testing suivant les laboratoires; les zones urbaines etant les plus souvent mieux equipees en
laboratoires, on aura tendance a avoir seulement les donnees sur les populations urbaines; elle depend
fortement de la volonte des institutions participantes k notifier les cas ce qui n'est pas toujours facile.
b. Surveillance du SIDA
7.    La surveillance du SIDA suit la distribution des cas declares de SIDA maladie et necessite de ce
fait pour sa conduite une definition de cas k utiliser pour la notification. Actuellement, cette definition
est variable suivant les pays. Dans certains pays comme les USA, la definition de cas de SIDA inclus une
longue serie de manifestions pathologiques, les tests d'identification de VIH et le nombre de lymphocytes
T4, dans d'autres la definition se limite aux manifestations cliniques et aux tests d'identification de VIH,
et dans les pays (essentiellement l'Afrique) oti les tests de laboratoire pour l'identification de VIH ne sont



80
ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 5
pas toujours disponibles, seuls les manifestations cliniques sont utilisees pour definir le cas de SIDA. La
notification des cas de SIDA n'est pas complOte au meme degre pour tous les pays. Si la majorite des cas
diagnostiques dans la plus part des pays developpes est notifiee, il est estime qu'en Afrique, de manibre
generale seulement 10 a 20% des cas de SIDA sont notifies. Les donnees sur la surveillance du SIDA
sont importantes pour les autorites dans la planification sanitaire (besoins en capacite clinique, traitement
et prise en charge des personnes malades de SIDA), mais elles ont moindre valeur dans le suivi de
l'epidemie du fait que le SIDA survient plusieurs annees aprbs l'infection.
c. Surveillance des MST traditionnelles
8.    Dans un passe encore recent le Controle et la Prevention des MST etait un domaine neglige,
surtout dans les pays en developpement. Ceci a comme une des consequences une infrastructure trbs
insuffisante pour le diagnostic et traitement des MST dans ces pays. Depuis l'avbnement du SIDA voici
plus d'une decennie, il est de plus en plus demontre une inter-relation entre les maladies sexuellement
transmissibles et le SIDA. Ces 2 entites partagent la voie sexuelle comme mode predominant de
transmission, les MST traditionnelles faciliteraient la transmission et l'acquisition du virus responsable
du SIDA, et l'infection a VIH modifieraient la presentation clinique et la reponse th6rapeutique des
certaines MST traditionnelles. Ces faits ont dicte la necessite de developper une bonne surveillance des
MST integree dans la surveillance du VIH/SIDA, dans le but d'ameliorer le controle et la Pr6vention des
ces affections. Quelques arguments soutiennent cette necessite: 1) La majorite des cas de SIDA etant
acquis par voie sexuelle, les actions visant la Prevention des MST traditionnelles, previendraient aussi
le SIDA; 2) Le diagnostic des MST traditionnelles peut ttre assez facilement discuter avec les patients,
permettant ainsi une action de Prevention effective vis a vis des personnes concernees; et 3) Les MST
traditionnelles ayant une periode d'incubation assez courte compar6e I celle du SIDA, il est plus facile
d'evaluer l'impact des activites de Prevention pouvant se traduire en une reduction de l'incidence des
MST, reduction qui est impossible a observer I court terme pour le SIDA.
C. Situation actuelle de la surveillance au Burkina
9.    Comme dans la quasi-totalite des pays en developpement, la surveillance epidemiologique
VIH/SIDA/MST est tres faible I l'heure actuelle au Burkina Faso. Le sous-comite de la surveillance du
comite national de lutte contre le SIDA a la responsabilite theorique de cette surveillance. Dans la realite,
un seul membre de ce sous-comite qui travaille I la direction de medecine preventive est en charge des
toutes les activites de surveillance tant pour le SIDA/MST que pour les autres pathologies dans l'ensemble
du pays. Le systeme de surveillance n'est pas bien defini, les personnes et les formations medicales
devant participer I la notification des cas ne sont pas identifiees clairement et responsabilisees pour cette
activite. La definition de cas de SIDA a utiliser pour la notification n'est pas vulgarisee au niveau du
personnel medical suppose participer I la notification des cas. II n'y a pas un notification reguliere des
cas, la plupart des cas repertories les sont I l'occasion de recherches actives periodiques des cas
effectuees par la DMP dans les formations sanitaires facilement accessibles. La serosurveillance par sites
sentinelles qui avait ete initiee dans 8 sites n'a pu se faire par manque de materiel et reactifs, manque de
supervision et manque de formation du personnel des sites retenus. Le seul des 8 sites qui a pu fonctionne
l'a ete par le soutien de la GTZ, et les resultats disponibles de ce site datent de 1991.
Les seules MST traditionnelles reprises dans la fiche de notification de la DMP sont la gonococcie et la
syphilis. Alors que la grande majorite des formations sanitaires n'ont pas la possibilite de faire le
diagnostic etiologique, il n'existe pas encore un systbme etabli de notification par definition syndromique.
II y a donc necessite urgente d'intervenir pour ameliorer cette situation qui peut constituer un frein au
programmes de controle et prevention du VIH/SIDA/MST, car si seulement un nombre infime des cas



81
ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 5
qui existent reellement sont repertories, cela peut faire croire que l'ampleur de l'epidemie est moindre
et detourner par consequent I'attention des autorites sanitaires et surtout celles des leaders politiques.
D. Renforcement de la surveillance dans le cadre du present Projet
10.   Le systeme sanitaire burkinabe etant en pleine mutation, les recommandations faites ici pourront
etre readaptees en fonction de la reorganisation prochaine du systeme sanitaire. Dans le cadre du present
Projet, en vue d'ameliorer la surveillance epidemiologique, nous recommandons qu'elle se fasse de la
maniere suivante:
Surveillance de l'infection a VIH/MST
a. Surveillance active par sites sentinelles
11.   Pfriodicitd: une fois par an, pendant un maximum de trois mois au niveau de chaque site
s6lectionn6, 1'equipe chargee de la serosurveillance proc6dera a la collecte des echantillons de sang pour
les serologies VIH et syphilitique. Site: tenant compte des difficultes de faire marcher 8 sites
anterieurement prevus, dans le cadre du present Projet nous retenons 5 sites en tenant compte de la
prevalence estim6e, de l'accessibilite des ces sites aux equipes de supervision, de la capacite de conduire
les activites de surveillance et dans une certaine mesure de leur situation geographique. Ces sites sont:
Ouagadougou, Bobo Dioulasso, Gaoua, Fada Ngourma, et Ouahigouya. Populations: pour tous les sites,
les femmes enceintes se presentant pour leur premiere consultation prenatale dans les SMI selectionnees
seront incluses dans l'etude par ordre d'arrivee a la clinique jusqu'a ce que le nombre prevu soit atteint.
Pour les sites de Ouagadougou et de Bob Dioulasso ou les prostituees sont accessibles, elles seront
invitees a participer aux activites de la surveillance. Methodologie: la methodologie de la sero-
surveillance est decrite en detail dans le protocole de la surveillance au Burkina revise dans le cadre du
present projet. De maniere generale, les echantillons de sang seront testes de fagon anonyme et non
correlee pour eviter d'eclore le statut serologique des sujets etant donne que la composante counseling
et prise en charge n'est pas prevue pour cette activite. Tous les dchantillons seront identifies seulement
par un numero et transmis a Ouagadougou, Hopital Yalgado ot toutes les serologies se feront.
12.   Les autres MST: gonorrhee, chlamydiose, trichomoniase, et candidose vaginale seront aussi
recherchees pour les sites ayant la capacite de laboratoire de le faire et les patientes seront soignees
gratuitement. Analyses des donnees et dissemination des resultats: Les donnees de chaque site seront
analysees localement avec l'assistance de l'equipe de CSE, les resultats seront rendus disponibles pour
les responsables locaux et un rapport sera envoye au niveau central a la Direction de medecine preventive,
sous-comite surveillance du SIDA qui fera les analyses d'ensemble pour transmettre les resultats aux
utilisateurs (CNLS, DEP, et niveaux peripheriques ayant participe au travail).
13.   Responsabilites: 6quipe locale de serosurveillance, equipes des Centre de Surveillance
Epidemiologique (CSE) du reseau PASE , equipe centrale de supervision a la DMP (sous-comite
surveillance).
b. Surveillance passive de l'infection a VIH
14.   Les dispositions pratiques sont prises pour que les differents laboratoires offrant les tests pour le
VIH transmettent les donnees sur les infections diagnostiquees a l'equipe de la surveillance epiddmiologie
tous les deux mois. Le sous comite laboratoire doit mettre en place une fiche standard de demande
d'analyse VIH comprenant les donnees essentielles pour la surveillance. Dans la ville de Ouagadougou



82
ANNEX 7
Page 5 of 5
et dans les provinces ob il existe deja des CSE du reseau PASE, un membre du CSE s'occupera de
rappeler aux differents laboratoires de sa circonscription l'activite de notification. Pour les provinces obi
les CSE ne sont pas encore en place, le sous-comite surveillance epidemiologie doit sollicite l'appui de
la direction regionale de la sante (DSP) pour designer une personne qui devra s'assurer que la notification
est regulierement faite.
15.   Surveillance du SIDA/MST. Au 31 decembre 1992, 2886 cas de SIDA au Burkina ont ete notifies
I l'OMS. Si l'on tient compte de la sous-estimation importante, ce nombre peut We multiplie par
5 ou 10 pour avoir une image plus proche de la realite. II est donc important de renforcer le systbme
actuel. Le personnel medical auquel on demande de faire la notification des cas doit etre forme en
consequence pour etre en mesure de remplir cette tache. La notification des cas de SIDA devra We faite
sur base de la definition de l'OMS (definition de Bangui) pour toutes les formations sanitaires de
l'ensemble du pays participant I la notification. Les formations ayant les moyens techniques de
laboratoire leur permettant de confirmer le diagnostic clinique peuvent le faire, mais l'absence des tests
ne doit pas We une raison de non notification des cas. Toutes les formations sanitaires qui delivrent des
soins aux malades de SIDA et ayant une capacite minimale de diagnostic clinique doivent participer I la
notification des cas. Une fiche (une page) de notification, simple et facile a remplir doit 8te mise a la
disposition permanente des formations sanitaires impliquecs dans la surveillance. Elles devront transmettre
mensuellement leurs fiches de notification a leur direction provinciale de la sante (section surveillance
epidemiologie). Les CSE veilleront I la regularite de la notification par les formations sanitaires de leur
ressort et seront responsables de l'analyse des donnees pour les mettre I la disposition de la direction
regionale de la sante et ils enverront les donnees au CSE central qui se chargera de I'analyse des toutes
les donnees venant des provinces pour les mettre I la disposition du sous-comite surveillance
Epidemiologique. A chaque niveau, un feed-back regulier sera organise vers les structures peripheriques.
16.   Le processus de base sera le meme pour les MST. Etant donnd que la disponibilit6 des tests de
laboratoire pour la mise en evidence etiologique des autres MST est tres limitde, la notification des cas
de MST doit Wtre basee sur les syndromes (ecoulement uretral, ulceration gEnitale, ecoulement vaginal
etc...) pour les formations medicales qui ne disposent pas des tests de laboratoire.

POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
Supervision Plan
1.    Borrower's Contribution to Supervision
(a)    The project coordinating team in the Permanent Secretariat (PS) of CONAPO will submit
semi-annual reports of project monitoring data to IDA in March and September each
year.
(b)    The project coordinating team will maintain up-to date project accounts and present
summary accounts to IDA every six months.
(c)    The audits of project accounts by indipendent auditors acceptable to IDA will be made
to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
(d)    Each implementing unit will report semi-annually to the project coordinating team on
implementation, including progress and delays.
(e)    By January 15, 1997, the PS of CONAPO will prepare and provide to IDA for its
approval a plan for carrying out a mid-term project review. The PS will, with the
assistance of the implementing units, carry out a mid-term review in accordance with the
agreed plan. Thereafter, Government will promptly take all actions recommended as a
result of the review that are required to achieve project objectives.
(f)    The project coordinating team will be responsible for coordinating arrangements for Bank
supervision missions and for providing information required by missions.
(g)    Mission briefing meetings on arrival and wrap-up meetings before departure will be
normally chaired by the Minister in charge of Planning in the Ministry of Plan and
Finance.
2.    Cofinanciers' Contribution to Supervision. Cofinanciers will be consulted on, and invited to,
participate in supervision activities, and will be kept fully informed regarding TORs, aide-memoires, and
results of IDA supervision missions. It is expected that cofinanciers will participate in annual joint review
missions and bring complementary skills to supervision missions.
