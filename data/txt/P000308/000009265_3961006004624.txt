MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURKINA FASO
FOR A POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Burkina Faso for SDR 19.0 million, the
equivalent of US$26.3 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help
finance a population and AIDS control project. The Government would contribute US$2.2
million. Cofinancing of a total of US$6.0 million may be provided by the Govermnents of
Norway and Denmark.
2.           Country Economic Backg. ound. Burkina Faso is a landlocked country with a
population of about 10 million. With a gross domestic product per capita of US$304 in 1992,
Burkina is among the world's poorest countries. Social and economic conditions are alarming.
The Human Development Index of UNDP ranks the country 157th out of 160. Basic social
services are underdeveloped. The economy is dominated by agriculture and the public sector.
Agriculture and stock rais ng are the main sources of income and provide employment for almost
90% of the active population, and account for about 40% of GDP and 60% of exports.
Cultivation of traditional food crops (millet and sorghum) is by far the most important farming
activity, while cotton is the major cash crop. The service sector accounts for an additional 40%
of GDP, while mining and manufacturing-mainly agroprocessing and textiles-remain under-
developed and together contribute only 13 % of GDP. With the other twelve countries of the CFA
zone, Burkina Faso devalued its currency by 50% relative to the French Franc in January 1994.
The Country Assistance Strategy for Burkina Faso is presented to the Executive Directors in a
free-standing document together with this operation.
3.           Sector Background. Burkina's commitment to addressingpopulation and AIDS-
related issues has increased very considerably in recent years. Burkina's population is growing
at about 3% per annum. At this rate, the population will double in 23 years. Bank projections
based on recent fertility trends and assumptions about future changes suggest that, in the absence
of aggressive measures to enhance fertility decline, the population will reach about 50 million
before it stabilizes. Increased public understanding of the negative impacts of such a dramatic
increase has led the Government to take a number of actions designed to advance the onset of
fertility decline. Family planning (FP) was first introduced into public health facilities in 1985
and integrated into maternal and child health care (MCH). In 1991, the Government approved
a national population policy which sets ambitious targets in terms of contraceptive prevalence
(CP) and fertility reduction. In December 1993, it approved legislation to give primary
responsibility for disseminating and operationalizing this policy to the Interministerial Population
Commission (CONAPO) and its Permanent Secretariat. It also adopted a National Family
Planning Strategy for the 1993-1998 period, which introduces a number of reforms essential for
the expansion of the FP program, such as allowing obstetrical assistants, more numerous in rural
areas than midwifes, to prescribe and distribute clinical contraceptives, and authorizing traditional
birth attendants to refill prescription contraceptives. The Strategy also acknowledges the need to
establish a FP outreach program beyond the public health system, supported by non-governmental
(NGO) and other private sector organizations.
4.           Efforts to expand FP services have so far mosdy benefitted the country's urban
areas, while they remain limited in rural areas. This has resulted in a considerable difference
t,Aween the CP in urban areas (17%) and that in rural areas (1.5%). Efforts to expand CP are
also constrained by high infant and child mortality, high illiteracy rates, particularly among



2
women, and an inadequate health service delivery system. Under the FP Strategy, the
Government aims to increase the CP in rural areas to 9 % and that in urban areas to 32%.
Helping the Government make FP service more accessible, particularly in rural areas, while at
the same time stimulating the demand for contraceptive services is the main thrust of the
population component of the proposed project. Activities under this project complement those
supported under the Health and Nutrition Project (approved by the Board on March 31, 1994)
which will help the Government to improve significantly the quality, coverage, and utilization
of basic health services.
5.           AIDS was first reported in Burkira Faso in 1986 and has since been growing
rapidly. As of December 31, 1992, a total of 2,886 AIDS cases have been reported. The high
prevalence of endemic diseases (malaria, tuberculosis and other pulmonary infections, chronic
diarrhea) with symptoms similar to AIDS, the limited skill of health providers, and the limited
availability of diagnostic tests and equipment have led to misdiagnosis, hence considerable
underreporting of the disease. The Ministry of Health (MS) estimates that about 7% of the adult
population is currently infected with HIV, the AIDS-causing virus. Taking into account also
infected newborns, it is estimated that about 450,000 persons are currently HIV-positive. This
prevalence rate places Burkina Faso third, after the C6te d'Ivoire and Ghana, among the Western
African countries most affected by the disease. Heterosexual transmission is predominant (85%
of the cases), followed by blood transfusion and perinatal transmission. Women are being
increasingly infected, and it is expected that infection rate among women will soon equal that of
men. Biological factors and traditional harmful practices, such as excision (still widely practiced)
make women more vulnerable to HIV. With more women being infected with HIV, perinatal
transmission of the infection will also increase. It is estimated that one in every four children
born to an infected mother is also infected. A high prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(STDs) increases several-fold the susceptibility of acquiring HIV. This has important implication
for women, since at their initial stages, STDs are asymptomatic in women and are left
undiagnosed and untreated. The above issues underline the importance of mainstreaming
HIV/AIDS/STD prevention into MCH/FP programs.
6.           As the number of AIDS cases mounts dramatically in the country, the
Government has moved from a stage of reluctant acceptance to one of more constructive
engagement. MS has nou declared the fight against AIDS one of its top priorities. Efforts to
slow down the spread of AIDS are constrained by (a) insufficient awareness of risk behavior, thus
reluctance to adopt safer health practices, such as the use of condoms; (b) limited information on
the development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, due to poor epidemiological surveillance; (c) low
condom distribution; and (d) very weak institutional capacity. Particularly vulnerable is the youth,
who becomes sexually active early but lacks the information on how to prevent HIV/STD
transmission. The economic impact of AIDS (the sum of the direct cost of treating the disease
and production lost to the economy because of AIDS) has been estimated to be between US$8
million and US$16 million (based on the currently reported incidence rate of 0.173 per 1000
population). While already substantial, these figures are expected to increase rapidly as the
number of AIDS cases grows.
7.           PrjQect Objectives. The overall objectives of the project are to: (a) enhance the
onset of fertility decline by increasing the prevalence of modern methods of contraception, and
(b) slow the spread of HIV infections by promoting behavioral change and treating STDs.



3
8.           Project Description. The project would finance investments designed to: (a)
support the implementation of the Government's population policy by: (i) improving quality of,
and access to, FP and MCH services nationwide; (ii) promoting information, education and
communication (IEC) programs in the areas of population, FP and women's rights, with
particular emphasis on issues concerning their reproductive health; and (iii) strengthening
institutions in charge of implementing the national population policy and of planning, managing
and evaluating FP programs; (b) strengthen the national capacity to contain the spread ot
HIV/AIDS/STDs by: (i) strengthening the institution in charge of implementing the national AIDS
program and the health system's capacity to deal with AIDS needs; (ii) promoting safer health
practices and behavioral change through information, education, and communications campaigns;
(iii) promoting the use of condoms; (iv) treating STDs; and (v) strengthening clinical management
and community care; and (c) encourage private sector and NGO participation in the areas of
population. FP and HIV/AIDS/STD, by establishing a Fund to finance projects in those areas.
9.           Project Implementation. The project will be implemented by existing entities
in the health system and in the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Plan (MEFP), NGOs, and
private sector agencies. IEC interventions will be implemented through the Ministry of Health,
the Ministry of Social Action and Family (MSAF), and the Permanent Secretariat of CONAPO
in the MEFP, and through the country's television and radio system, NGOs and other private
sector organizations. Overall project coordination would be the responsibility of CONAPO's
Permanent Secretariat. The Permanent Secretary would delegate day-to-day coordination of
project implementation and monitoring to a Coordinator, under his supervision. The project is
expected to be completed over a five-year period, and the IDA Credit disbursed in six years.
10.          Project Sustainability. The incremental recurrent costs directly generated by
project investments would be small. However, the project contributes essential inputs to two
Government programs, the FP and AIDS control programs, which have important recurrent cost
implications for the financing of contraceptives, condoms, drugs, and medical and protective
supplies. The annual cost at the end of the project of supplying the above material has been
estimated at about US$3.4 million. These costs are expected to remain high for a number of years
and donor funding will probably be necessary for the foreseeable future. As cost recovery is
being gradually introduced in Burkina Faso's health system together with decentralization,
chirges will be made for drugs, with the proceeds being r^tained within the district health budget.
Contraceptives and condoms are currently being sold by the public health system and through a
social marketing program (for condoms) at highly subsidized prices, and will continue to be sold.
However, as far as condoms are concerned, given the urgency to dramatically increase the
demand for this commodity, free distribution is also envisaged in the context of IEC campaigns
and some interventions targeted to high risk groups.
11.          The recurrent costs generated by the project are small compared with the long-
term cost of not launching an aggressive FP and AIDS prevention program. Without the inputs
provided by the project a much more serious sustainability problem would arise in terms of
factors such as: (a) costs for increases in social services to cater to a rapidly growing population;
(b) costs for caring for AIDS and STD patients if the HIV infection and the STD were left
unchecked; and (c) costs of caring for the children of AIDS victims. A rapid assessment of the
economic impact of AIDS carried out during project appraisal estimated the average lifetime
treatment cost for an AIDS case to be about US$416 (pre-devaluation cost). The total indirect
cost of one case of AIDS has been estimated 18 times greater (US$ 7,488). The direct cost of
one-year supply of condom. for one sexually active male was estimated at appraisal to be about
US$2.

12.          Drugs for STDs and AIDS-related opportunistic infections and protective supplies
for health workers would help restore health or prevent illnesses. Every STD or TB patient
treated, or every HIV-infection averted reduces the number of future potential patients seeking
health care. The drugs and other medical supplies provided by the project would help ensure the
sustainability of existing and forthcoming large investments in health care infrastructure.
13.          Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. The project benefits from
the experience gained under the Bank's two previous operations in health, the regional
Onchocerciasis Control Program, started in 1974, and the First Health Project (Cr. 1607-BUR).
Lessons from the latter operation suggest that greater attention needs to be paid to: (i) ensuring
that the necessary policy reforms are in place prior to start-up of project investments; (ii)
decentralization of activities, coupled with training and supervision through district management
teams; (iii) improving the quality of existing health care facilities; and (iv) active demand creation
and government support for FP activities are essential to increasing acceptance rates. The result
of the Operations Evaluation Department's evaluation of population projects, as well as the
experience gained under AIDS and STDs control projects in developing and developed countries
have also been taken into account in the design and preparation of this project. The main lessons
learned from these experiences are: (i) need to strengthen and maintain a commitment to
population and FP on the part of all officials responsible for implementation of the program; (ii)
need to integrate efforts in FP with efforts to directly reduce the demand for children, such as
female education, and programs aimed at increasing women's income,-earning capacity and reduce
child mortality; (iii) interventions in the early stages of the AIDS epidemic have a greater impact
and a higher benefit-cost ratio than interventions at a later stage; (iv) large-scale condom
promotion has resulted in large observed changes in sexual behavior and significant increases in
condom use; and (v) need to involve NGOs to reach high-risk groups.
14.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's country strategy for Burkina Faso is
presented to the Board in a free-standing document together with this operation. The strategy
rests on the following thiee elements: (i) assisting the Government in creating a policy and
regulatory environment more supportive of the private sector; (ii) helping the Government
manage public resources more efficiently: and (iii) supporting critical actions needed to alleviate
long-term constraints on economic growth and social development, with a focus on population,
health and education. The proposed project is a central part of this assistance strategy. The
programs required to implement this strategy demand considerable external financial support and
a strong Government commitment. IDA has played a catalytic role in a number of important
policy reforms recently adopted by the Government in the health and population sectors and is
in a good position to mobilize the needed assistance from the donor community and to influence
the Government's strategies. The project would provide a framework for enhanced donor
coordination in the areas of population and HIV/AIDS prevention.
15.          Agreed Actions. The following would be conditions of credit effectiveness: (a)
approval of a training program for the project period acceptable to IDA; (b) signing of technical
assistance arrangements widh WHO for the procurement of condoms, and with UNFPA for the
procurement of contraceptives. Such arrangements would be reviewed after two years to
determine the need for further extension; (c) establishment of (i) the project coordination team
within CONAPO's Permanent Secretariat in numbers and qualifications satisfactory to IDA, and
(ii) an accounting system satisfactory to IDA; (d) (i) establishment of an independent project
selection committee, satisfactory to IDA, to review and approve financing proposals prepared by
NGOs benefitting from financing under the Fund, and (ii) approval of the procedural manual
regulating the management of the Fund and of the standard contract, satisfactory to IDA, between



5
the Government and the NGOs; (e) reorganization of the Permanent Secretariat of the CNLS and
its staffing with adequate full-time personnel in numbers and qualifications satisfactory to IDA,
and enact a new ministerial decree clarifying the roles and functions of the Permanent Secretary
and those of the technical sub-committees; (f) appointment of an independent auditor under a
multi-year contract acceptable to IDA to carry out yearly review of the project accounts; and (g)
the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system satisfactory to IDA. The effectiveness
of grant agreements between the Government and the Governments of Norway and Denmark to
assist in the financing of the project would be an additional condition of effectiveness.
16.          Environmental Aspects. The project is rated C. There are no likely direct
negative environmental effects. However, the likely medium to long-term impact of the project
on fertility reduction and subsequent decline in the rate of population growth would have positive
implications for the environment.
17.          Project Objective Categories. The project responds directly to the human
resources developinent and anti-poverty objectives of the Government. Improving population
analysis, planning and management, extending FP services, strengthening MCH services,
addressing the important issue of women's reproductive health, and controlling the spread of
HIV/AIDS/STDs will contribute significantly to the achievement of the long-term development
objectives of the country.
18.          Project Benefits. The project's interventions would help increase by 1999 the
prevalence of modern methods of contraception in rural areas from 1.5% to 9% and in urban
areas from 17% to 32%. The number of FP users would grow from an estimated 80,000 to
about 350,000 in 1999. The wider practice of PP would have a particularly beneficial impact on
the health of women and children. The project would help slow the spread of the HIV infection
and alleviate the burden of HIV/AIDS on individuals, families and the nation. The project would
have significant returns in terms of years of healthy life saved and would hold down the indirect
economic cost of AIDS, i.e., losses in production and human capital, which threaten the long-
term economic development of Burkina Faso. Most impor antly, the cost of dealing with the
disease now would be small in comparison to the cost if the disease were allowed to become more
widespread. The pr3ject would help combat STDs, which is one of the most effective strategies
to inhibiting the spread of HIV. By 1999, reliable supplies of condoms would provide protection
from HIV/AIDS/STD, to at least 20% of Burkina's sexually active adult males and their partners
(about 570,000 couples), who are expected to be persuaded by the public information campaigns
to use condoms, to do so. Distribution of condoms to high-risk populations, supported by an
intensive IEC effort, is expected to cover a much higher percentage of these populations.
Protective supplies would safeguard an estimated 4,500 health personnel. By integrating
HIV/AIDS/STD prevention in FP/MCH activities, the project would contribute to alleviating the
number of infections transmitted to women. Neonatal infection would be reduced.
19.          Project Risks. The project faces two major risks. First, attainment of project
goals may be hampered by the fact that changing reproductive and health behavior is a difficult
and time-consuming undertaking. To mitigate this risk, the project would provide heavy support
to IEC activities and use NGOs and other private-sector organizations to reach those at risk. To
mobilize continued, strong support for FP as well as for HIV/AIDS/STD prevention and control
among political, traditional and religious leaders, the project would support (i) actions to increase
these leaders' awareness to the urgency of addressing these issues, and (ii) extensive information
campaigns to which nasional leaders are expected to contribute actively. Second, iovernment's
weak capacity may result in poor project implementation. This risk would be addressed through



6
(i) the strengthening of the institutions involved in the implementation of the project, and (ii)
heavy reliance on the private sector and NGOs. Activities in this area would complement those
undertaken under other Bank Group operations to strengthen the health services delivery system.
20.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
