PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This report presents a completion evaluation of the Feeder Roads
Project and the Fifth Highway Projects in Liberia. Since August 1984, Bank
Group disbursements have been suspended almost continuously on all loans
and credits to that country, however. disbursements continued for certain
exempted activities, mainly procurement and consultants. Disbursement
even under these activities were suspended for both projects as of the
present closing date of December 31. 1987.  Under these circumstances, it
was not possible to complete the civil works, and the substantial
undisbursed balances remaining in both the Loan and Credit accounts of
US$1.8 million and US$4.7 million respectively are now in the process of
being cancelled. Thts report explores why the performance under both
projects, which was executed by the same agency over roughly the same
period of time, was so poor. It also highlights the lessons to be learned
from these two lending operations.
The PCR was produced by staff of the Africa Region. It
was based on the project's Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the
President's Report, the Credit Agreement and internal Bank memoranda
and reports as project implementation and issues contained in relevant
files.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED). The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on May 3, 1989 for
comments by June 9, 1989. No comments were received.

REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FEEDER ROADS PROJECT - LOAN 1664-LBR
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT - CREDIT 1449-LBR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMYARY
Introduction and Objectives
1.        The Feeder Roads and Fifth Highway Projects aimed at upgrading
road sector institutions and rehabilitating and maintaining part of
the country's road network (paras. 2.02-2.05 and 2.08-2.09). Both
projects were to be executed by the same agency, the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) (para 1.05). Because of the Bank Group's frequent
suspension of disbursements in Liberia, the latest in December 1986,
the completion of the feeder road project was delayed beyond its
closing date, and the civil works componeats of both projects in
particular, were only partly completed. The undisbursed balances
in both the Loan and Credit accounts are now in the process of being
cancelled (paras 3.29 and 3.44).
Implementation Experience
2.        As the Feeder Roads Project was started first, its civil works
were about 402 completed, while for the Fifth Highway Project only about
281 of the regravelling and 1OZ of the routine maintenance were completed.
Because payments for consultants and purchases of equipnvmnt were only
partially affected by the suspension of disbursements, riore irogress was
made on these components than on civil works. Performance on civil works
also suffered because of a critical shortage of local currency, and the
limited capacity of the MPW (paras 3.06, 3.10. 3.13 and ?.42).
R,sults
3.        Overall, performance of the Borrower under both projects must be
rated as poor. It is doubtful that much progress in the way of institution
building has been accomplished, given the difficult circumstances under
which the projects were carried out (para 5.08).
4.        The Bank Group's performance was mixed; in earlier years staff
was changed frequently, but after mid-1984 a concerted effort was made to
improve the frequency and quality of supervision. The Bank made a number
of constructive changes in the Loan/Credit Agreements to assist both
projects. However, no amount of assistance could overcome the devastating
effect of a general suspension of disbursements and a shortage of local
funds on project execution, in the light of the deteriorating economy of
Liberia (paras 7.02-7.08).



(vii)
Sustainability
5.        Due to the limited project achievements and macro-economic
conditions, the prospects for *wstainability are poor. Institutionally,
the Ministry of Public Works deteriorated over the life of the projects
(paras. 3.04-3.26, S.30-3.39 and 5.01-5.08).
Findings and Lessons
6.        Most of the Loan/Credit funds for both projects were used for
consultants and procurement, and little for construction work which was the
largest component in both projects. The Bank should carefully assess the
disastrous effect on its ongoing projects when it suspends disbursements
for non-repayment of earlier loans. Suspension is usually brought about
because of the country's inability to repay its debts, and meet current
obligations. Thus suspension only adds to the difficulties of executing
ongoing projects, and invites even more adverse performance. Perhaps at
the time of a suspension, the Bank should make a decision to either
continue to support its ongoing projects fully, or withdraw completely and
shut them down (para 8.06).
7.        Among the lessons learned are the following:  i)  Given the
adverse effects of a general suspension of disbursements on its on-going
projects in a country like Liberia, the Back should consider using letters
of credit more frequently under these circumstances to finance contractors
and consulting services as well as for procurement of goods; ii) every
effort should be made to avoid frequent changes of Bank supervisory staff
and to carry out supervision missioas on a regular basis on projects where
difficult execution problems are being experienced, and iii) more use
should be made of international contractors to carry out civil works rather
than relying on the departmental forces of understaffed and underfinanced
Government executing agencies (paras 8.03-8.11).



REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FEEDER ROADS PROJECT - LOAN 16 4-LBR
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT - CREDIT 1449-LBR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank has participated in Liberia's road subsector since
1964, when the First Highway Project. Loan 368-LBR (US$4.25 million) was
approved. A total of six Loans/Credits including the Fifth Highway
Project, have been made totalling US$74.4 million.
1.02      In the late 1970s, the transport sector of Liberia consisted of
6,200 miles of road network, 300 miles of privately-owned railways, four
seaports and one international and 13 domestic airfields serving regular
local flights. The road network was composed of 366 miles of public and 93
miles of private paved roads, 2,084 miles of g-avel all-weather and 2,276
miles of earth dry weather public roads and 1,381 miles of gravel and earth
surface private roads. The network was far from adequate to accommodate
the traffic levels and development needs of the country.
1.03      The Government's objectives in the road subsector aimed at i)
postponing investment in new road construction and increasing emphasis on
upgrading existing primary and secondary roads; ii) improving performance
in road maintenance; and iii) developing feeder roads in support of the
priority sector, agriculture. The proposed public expenditure for the
Transport Development Plan for the 1981/82-1984/85 period was set at
US$159.3 million, of which the roads sector allocation was 68Z
(US$109.0 million). The Plan, even though in the right direction, was
optimistic in terms of local funding available and implementation capacity.
1.04      In the past, road construction and maintenance in Liberia had
been financed largely by foreign lending, with the Bank Group, United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Federal Republic
of Germany (FRG) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) as principal
sources. Consistent with the Development Plan to expand and maircain
feeder roads, in 1979 the Bank provided a US$10.7 million loan for
construction/ improvement and subsequent maintenance of feeder roads. In
1984, the Association made a US$11.4 million credit for the Fifth Highway
Project to strengthen MP`'s management, carry out a three year road
maintenance program and provide technical assistance. By the closing date
of December 31, 1987 of both these lending operations, about 82Z of the
Loan and 59Z of the Credit had been disbursed.
1.05      The executing agency for both projects was the Ministry of
Public Works. However, during execution some of the responsibility for the
Feeder Roads Project was transferred to the Ministry of Local Government
(MLG) (para 3.02).
1.06      This PCR was prepared by Bank staff, based on information
obtained from the Staff Appraisal Reports and from review of Bank files,



- 2 -
including supervision and progress reports and other correspondence. The
Borrower did not provide the Project Completion Reports called for under
Loan/Credit Agreements and no Bank mission was sent out for the purpose of
preparing the PCR.
II.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A.   Feeder Road Prolect
Identification and Preparation
2.01      The Feeder Roads project was discussed between the Bank and the
Government in December 1976, by a Bank identification mission. Agreement
was reached on the strategy for the preparation of the Project. in 'ine
with the Government's transport sector investment plan. The November 1977
preparation mission report identified the main components of the proposed
project.
2.02      The following issues were highlighted in the project brief and
were duly addressed by the pre-appraisal mission of February 1978:
(a) the proposed feeder road program indicates the means
which would be used to define the location,
classification and standards for the road construction
program proposed together with an elaboration of the
basis for selecting priorities;
(b) review the sources of trained and experienced manpower
likely to be available in MPW and in private industry
for managing and executing the project, and to
indicate how the expected deficiencies can be made up
by training and by technical aide; ,nd
(c) consider what modifications might be necessary in
timing the execution of- the project so that it and the
other functions of planning, constructing and
maintaining roads in Liberia can be undertaken without
excessive strain on MPW and the local constrv:tion
industry.
A,^Draisal
2.03      The project was appraised in May/June 1978.  The principal
objective was to continue assisting Government in building and improving
feeder roads necessary to achieve its rural development goals. In so
doing, the project vas to establish a feeder roads institution in the MFW,
train the staff in planning and maintaining the feeder roads and instigate
closer cooperation among Government agencies on feeder roads. Other
objectives were to improve overall transport planning and coordination, and
to provide a basis for developing the domestic road construction industry.



-3-
2.04      The project components includeds
(a) A four-year program for the construction/improvement
and subsequent maintenance of about 700 miles of
feeder roads. plus the maintenance of an additional
200 miles of existing feeder roads;
(b) assistance to the domestic contracting industry;
tc) studies for the follow-up feeder roads program and
monitoring of project progress and its socio-economic
impact;
(d) assistance to the Bureau of Transportation in the
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Transport (MCIT);
and
(e) training for local staff including an overseas
scholarship.
2.05      The Loan was to assist in financing the following:
(a) purchase of road construction and maintenance
equipment, spare parts, vehicles, office equipment,
workshop tools and survey equipment;
(b) purchase of materials and supplies;
cc) construction of workshops and office buildings;
(d) survey and design of about 250 miles of feeder roads
by local consultant's and construction of these roads
by local contractors;
(e) tecbnical assistance and consultancy services; and
(f) an overseas scholarship.
The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1984.
B.   Fifth Hig.hwa  Proiect
Identification and Preparation
2.06      The project was first discussed between the Bank and the
Government of Liberia in September 1979, five months after the Feeder Road
Project became effective. However, appraisal did not take place until
September 1982 because of the increasing shortage of local funds and the
fast decline in the country's economy. As a result of this, the
composition and scope of the project was reduced by 70Z from US$64.0
million in 1979 to US$19.3 million at appraisal.
2.07      A Five-Year Highway Maintenance Program, developed by
consultants under the Fourth Highway Project, suggested an investment level



-
of US$68.0 million or USS100o0 million including salaries. In the
September 9, 1982 Project .Brief meeting, the Bank. vhile agreeing to the
basic concept of the Program, found the proposed investment level
unrealistic in size and scope given Government's financial constraints and
implementation capability. Based on MPW's views on the effectiveness of
past technical assistance, it was agreed to limit the technical assistance
component under the project to assistance needed to remedy MPS's
institutional shortcomings.
Appraisal
2.08      The project was appraised in September/October 1982.  At the
time the Project was identified, the proposed project was to continue
upgrading the primary network by paving road sections identified and
prepared under earlier projects, and further improve road maintenance.
However, in view of the Government's limited ability to provide counterpart
funds for new road construction, the deterioration in MFW's management
capability and the inadequacy of present maintenance operations, it was
agreed with the Governmeut that the proposed project should focus on:
(a)  strengthening of MPW's technical and financial
management capability to ensure efficient use of
scarce available resources for the development anc
maintenance of Liberia's public road network; and
(b)  preservation of past investments in highway
infrastructure by securing adequate funding for
minimum routine maintenance and by taking a first step
towards elimination of the periodic maintenance
backlog.
2.09      To attain the above objectives within the prevailing local
funding constraints, the proposed project consisted of the following:
(a)  the development and implementation of a medium-term
program for improvement of MPW's managerial and
financial accountability, including related technical
assistance and training;
(b)  a three-year road maintenance program to include:
(i) routine maintenance by force account to
cover the all-weather road network (2,450
miles) and to gradually expand to include
the dry-weather network (2,280 miles);
(ii) periodic maintenance of about 450 miles of
gravel roads by force account (350 miles)
and by contract (100 miles);
(iii)  basic rehabilitation of workshop facilities,
including replacement of ancillary equipment
and hand tools;



- 5 -
(iv) limited additions to the road maintenance
equipment fleet and overhaul of some of the
exiting equipment.
(v)   consultant services tos (i)  asuist the
Operations Bureau in the MPW in improving
the efficiency of road maintenance
operations, (ii) prepare, in collaboration
with the Programing and Planning Bureau
(PPB). in the MPW, a follow-up maintenance
program, and (iii) audit project
expenditures; and
(vi)   fellowships.
The Project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1986.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Feeder Road Proiect
3.01      The Project was approved by the Board on March 4, 1979, it was
signed on April 4. 1979 and become effective on April 30, 1979. There were
no special conditions for Loan effectiveness.
3.02      In April 1980, one year after the Feeder Roads Project became
effective, there was a change of Government and new Ministers were
appointed in different ministries. Four different Ministers of diverse
experience, have directed the MPW over the life of the project. Several of
the senior and middle-level staff were also promoted and transferred within
the Ministry. These changes affected the progress of the project, until
the new appointees became familiar with their new responsibilities. In
1982, the transfer of the main responsibility for feeder roads from MPW to
MLG created further administ-atives problems (para 5.01).
3.03      In September 1982, the Loan Agreement was amended to add new
components and to increase the percentage of disbursements under some of
the project components. The project closing date was extended by two years
to December 31. 1986. In August 1984. the Bank suspended disbursements of
all projects in Liberia due to arrears of repayments. However,
disbursements continued up to the final closing date of the project for
civil and consultanting contracts in progress; and for goods shipped and
delivered, as they from time to time, were exempted from the general
suspension.
1.  Civil Works
3_04      MPW was to construct/improve 450 miles of feeder roads using two
new and one existing force account brigades. The brigades' equipment,
spare parts, materials and supplies and workshop and office facilities were
to be financed from the proceeds of the Loan. The contracts for the
purchase of the equipment were signed in December 1979, seven months later
than the appraisal schedule. Portions of the equipment ordered were



delivered in March 1980. In May 1980, when the rest of the order was
expected to arrive, the supplier requested a cancellation of the
procurement contract, stating it would no longer be in a position to
provide after-sales services (para 3.16). This cancellation resulted in an
imbalance in the brigades' equipment fleet, and became one of the main
reasons for an average of 18 miles output per brigade per year as compared
to the 50 miles production rate estimated in the appraisal report.
3.05      The two new force account brigades were mobilized in mid-1980,
but were not in full operation until November 1982, because of shortage of
local funds. The existing brigade started work in mid-1983, three years
later than scheduled at appraisal. The three brigades continued operating
over a long period with unbalanced equipment and, at project closing date,
completed 260 miles, representing 58Z of the planned 450 miles. The actual
construction cost was US$21,400 per mile as compared to the appraisal
estimate of US$16,700, an overrun of almost 30Z.
3.06      The performance of the brigades was affected by a severe and
persistent shortage of supervisory and operational staff; a critical
shortage of materials and supplies such as fuel, lubricants and spare
parts; frequent change of key headquarter's and brigades' level staff; and
ineffective logistic support.
3.07      Out of the 700 miles of feeder roads, 250 miles vere to be
constructed/improved by domestic contractors following local competitive
bidding procedure acceptable to the Bank. The soils/materials
investigation and bridge designs for the roads were to be carried out by
HPW, while the field location survey and geometric and pavement designs
were to be carried out by consultants. The MPV did not start its share of
the design activities until the first half of 1981. A local consultant
firm was engaged in December 1979 to do the design of the first 54 miles in
150 calendar days. The quality of the consultant's work was low early in
the contract period and later the firm went out of business before the
design was completed. The designs for two roads were completed in June
1985 by MPW staff, assisted by 4 consultant, six years after the time
specified in the appraisal report.
3.08      MPW engaged a consultant in August 1984 to assist in design, to
process bids, to train its staff in contract supervision and to train
domestic contractors. Four contractors were prequalified out of the eight
who indicated their interest. Two contractors were awarded contracts for
each of the two designed roads in October 1985. The bid amounts were
US$1.6 million for 14.2 miles and US$1.4 million for 14.8 miles, the
average of which was 3.5 times the US$20,500 per mile cost estimated in the
appraisal report. Both contractors completed the work within the contract
time. The quality of work of the two contractors was satisfactory and the
experience gained should enable the two firms to compete with international
firms.
3.09      In line with the objective of developiub the domestic
construction industry, the following provisions were made for the two
contracts to alleviate some of the common constraints usually encountered
by domestic contractors;



(a) waiver of performance bond requirements;
(b) reduction of the retention money to 5 as compared to
a normal 10? requirements; and
(c) provision for increased interest free mo''lization
advance loan (252) with collateral to ensure the loan.
This enables the two contractors to repair their
existing equipment in order to start the work.
3.10      In total, 289 miles of feeder roads were constructed/improved in
seven year by both force account and contractors as compared to planned 700
miles in four years. The accomplishment on the average was only 41? of the
planned target at 732 of total cost, in 175Z of the estimated time. The
total cost was USS7.7 million or an average of US$26,900 per mile, while
the appraisal estimate was to construct/improve 700 miles at a total cost
of US$12.6 million an average of US$18,000 per mile. This represents a 49?
increase in US$ in per mile cost.
3.11      The force account brigades were to be equipped and funded to
carry out the annual reshaping of the roads they built, and other selected
roads within or close to their operating areas. The contractors were to
maintain the roads they constructed for one year. After this period of
maintenance provision was over, the roads were to be handed over to MPW to
carry out periodic maintenance with its own forces. The financing of
routine maintenance was to be shared among the local communities by
contributions of free labor and/or cash. MPW9s district engineers were to
have overall responsibility for technical supervision.
3.12      The Government. through the MLG, was to organize the local
communities directly benefitting from the roads, to participste in the
routine maintenance of the feeder roads. In March 1979, a Bank consu'tant
(sociologist) visited Liberia and highlighted the main problems in
encouraging the local communities to participate in routine maintenance as
follows:
(a) shortage of manpower at the local level;
(b) shortage of funds for routine maintenance;
(c)  'the coordinating problems between MPW technical
assistance and MLG administrative supervision, between
routine maintenance and periodic maintenance, and
during peaks in the agricultural cycles and peaks in
routine maintenance activitiess;
(d)   possible weakening of the approach proposed because
of association with the former requirements of
involuntary contributions of labor and cash'; and
(e) dangers of progressive decline in motivation,
particularly if land in the area moves into the hands
of outsiders, or if other promised maintenance inputs
do not materialize.



-8a -
3.13      In later 1979, a joint coinittee formed from representatives of
MPW and MLG tried to organize the local comunities to participate in
routine maintenance of the roads. The reaction of the elders was positive
whereas the younger generation adamantly opposed the idea. It was finally
decided that individuals be hired and paid directly by the MPW to carry out
the routine maintenance of the feeder roads. The MPU was not able to make
meaningful progress in maintaining the constructed feeder roads because:
(a) there was a persistent critical shortage of local
funds;
(b) Government's freeze on hiring, again because of
shortage of local funds;
(c) requirements that Government's ministries make a 15Z
saving on their previous year budget; and
(d) critical shortage of qualified middle and lower-level
staff due to the closure or phasing out of the Camp
Mechlin Training Center financed by the FRG.
3.14      The plan, under the project agreement, was to bring the overall
responsibility for feeder roads under the MPW. Earlier, there was a move
in this direction; however, in late 1982, the responsibility for the
construction and maintenance of a portion of the feeder roads was passed to
MLG. This action seems to have been spurred by a decision made by the
Government to distribute the equipment purchased (about 200 units) under a
US$18.4 million Japanese commodity loan. This transfer of responsibility
will have the long-term effect of spreading scarce human and physical
resources too thinly, lowering output, and reducing quality standards.
3.15      MPW was to complete the design and construction of workshop and
office facilities for the brigades by December 1979. In mid-1980, MPW
started the construction of the two workshops and offices by force account.
Because of delay of completion of these facilities, the brigades were not
provided with the appropriate shelter and repair space fer over one year,
and this reason among others, contributed to the accelerated deterioration
of the equipment.
2.   Procurement of Equipment. Vehicles and Spare Parts
3.16      Equipment, vehicles, spare parts, and materials and supplies
were to be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. Bids for the bulk of equipment, vehicles and
spare parts were advertised on April 23, 1979, with a bid closing date of
May 31 of the same year. Four to six bids were received for the different
types of equipment and the bids were evaluated and contracts were awarded
foilowing the Bank's no objection. The first group of equipment (about
half the value ordered) were delivered in March 1980, mostly from stock in
Liberia. In May 1980. when the balance of the equipment ordered was
expected to be delivered, the supplier asked the Government to cancel the
procurement contract (para. 3.04). The undelivered equipment consisted of



- 9 -
35 units which included all dump trucks (18 units), all transport vehicles
(15 units) and two water trucks.
3.17      While efforts were being made to rebid the cancelled equipment,
Liberia was experiencing a critical shortage of local funds. Moreover, the
delay in the start of the training of road foremen, mechanics, equipment
operators and drivers was becoming a serious problem, aggravated by an
increased demand for trained staff because of the arrival of 200 units
financed through a Japanese Commodity Loan. The local fund constraint and
shortage of staff delayed the decision to reorder the cancelled equipment.
After a long delay, the Government requested, and the Bank agreed, to
reorder the equipment through limited competitive bidding from at least
three suppliers. This equipment was delivered in February 1983. With the
new order, the actual loan disbursement for equipment and spare parts
amounted to US$3.5 million or 132 more than the US$3.1 million allocated.
3.   Technical Assistance
a.   Feeder Roads Advisors Service
3.18      The project included 156 man-months of technical assistance to
train, coach and supplement MPW's staff and to develop a follow-up program
for feeder roads improvement and maintenance. While the initial plan was
to engage individual experts, at the request of MFW the Bank agreed to use
a consulting firm, cautioning MPW of the possible increase in cost. While
MPW was modifying the contract agreement based on the Bank's comment and
prior to signing a contract, the selected consultan  started mobilizing his
staff early in November 1979 on the basis of a letter of intent.
3.19      The consultant's performance was not up to the standard expected
and according to the files *... after nearly two months in Liberia, the
team leader had only a superficial knowledge of the project and had not yet
made any definite plans or proposed a strategy to ensure an effective
implementation of the project. Therefore, it must be doubted if he will be
able to carry out in a satisfactory manner the duties of a team leader.,
The consultant had about 20 years of continuous service in Liberia - long
enough to fully understand the level and type of expertise needed to
provide the services needed. MPW was reluctant to include under this
contract the training expert originally agreed upon to supplement the
activities at the Camp Mechlin Training Center.
3.20      The contract which was for a period of 30 months, did not fully
achieve the expected results because:
(a) the newly established Feeder Roads Divisions (FRD) was only
about 50o staffed, hence the consultant's service was rendered
to only half of the targeted group originally envisaged;
(b)  the logistic support for the Planning and Programming Bureau was
not provided primarily due to insufficient funds;



- 10 -
(c)  the operational assistance to the field brigades could not be
fully rendered since, during the consultant's service period,
the brigades completed only 15 miles as compared to 250 miles
planned- and
(d)  the consultant service was related to assisting the FRD in
construction and road maintenance operations. and since no
operation was started in these two areas the services rendered
to FRD during the 30-month contract time was limited, and the
transfer of knowledge was minimal.
b.   Design of Feeder Roads
3.21      MPW was to engage a domestic consultant to carry out the field
survey, geometric and pavement designs of the feeder roads to be
constructed/improved by domestic contractors, while the soils and materials
investigations and bridge designs were to be carried out by MW's
departmental force. A domestic consultant was selected through local
advertisement and a contract for the design of the first 54 miles was
signed after Bank's clearance in March 1980. The total contract amount was
US$73,850 and the design was to be completed in 150 calendar days. The
consultant had financial problems because of the firm's limited capital as
well as payment delays. It also had a problem of controlling its field
personnel, who, when monthly payments were delayed, confiscated the field
equipment and refused to continue working until they were paid. The firm
finally informed the MPW of its inability to execute the work.
3.22      The draft detailed design was finally submitted to MPW by
another firm, an outgrowth of the firm to whom the services were
contracted. The design entailed a high construction cost compared to the
originally anticipated cost. It was revised and completed by the MPW with
the assistance of an expatriate consultant, who lowered the standards of
vertical and horizontal alignments to reduce cost. The per mile
construction cost of the reduced standard was at an average cost of
US$72,400, which was still 3.5 times the appraisal estimate of US$20,500
per mile.
C.  Technical Assistance to Domestic Contractors
3.23      MPW was to obtain the services of two experts:  one to be
attached to the MPW for two years as a member of the staff of the
Programming and Planning Bureau to assist =n preparing a program of work
suitable for domestic contractors, and to advise them how to build up their
capability; and the other to be attached to the Liberian Bank of
Development and Investment for a period of two years to assist in
developing capacity within the Bank for approving and monitoring loans to
contractors.
3.24      In October 1979, MPW recruited a civil engineer with training in
law as the construction industry specialist. He had a problem to adjust to
local conditions and finally left the country in mid-1980. After a long
interruption, mainly due to delay in completion of the detail engineering
design of roads to be contracted out, MPW, in March 1984, invited proposals
from five selected consultant firms. Only two proposals were received and



- 11 -
based on the evaluation results of the two proposals, MPW signed a contract
on August 20, 1984 for 35 van-months at a total cost of US$484,000
(USU13,800/man-month) including reimbursables and 1OZ contingency costs).
The contract agreement was amended on November 13, 1984. to include one
civil engineer to assist the MPW in reviewing feeder roads designs,
processing bids and supervising the contract construction. After these
amendments the contract amount increased from USS84,000 to US$814,000.  A
total of 29 miles of feeder roads at a cost of US$2.1 million was
constructed under this assistance at a cost of 37Z of the value of the
civil works contracts.
d.   Technical Assistance to MCIT
3.25      The project provided for a transport specialist to assist the
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Transportation (MCIT) in improving its
transport planning function. This service was later transferred to the
Ministry of Planning and External Affairs (MPEA) at the request of the
Government. Based on an invitation for proposals issued to six shortlisted
firms, MPEA signed a contract on August 20, 1984 with the technically
highest rated firm. The contract amount was US$601,663 for 30 man-months.
The consultant submitted the draft final report in December 1986. MPEA's
benefit from the study will depend upon the effective implementation of the
planning techniques proposed.
e.   Overseas ScholarshiP
3.26      Under the project, provision was made for an overseas
scholarship for an experienced engineer for an 18-months construction
management course which included nine months of practical training with a
reputable construction firm. Upon completion of the scholarship, the
engineer was to join the Feeder Roads Division of MPW, to oversee the
Feeder Roads Division. In November 1982, MPW nominated a 1979 graduate who
was accepted by the University of Illinois for study in materials
engineering. He moved to another university after which MPW withdrew its
financial support. In July 1984, another civil engineer who graduated in
1982 was nominated and accepted for a two year graduate program by Case
*Testern University, and started his studies in January 1985.  He
successfully completed his studies and returned to the MLC to take charge
of rural works.
f.   Auditing of the Proiect Accounts
3.27      Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement required the auditing of the
project accounts on the basis of certified expenditures. MPW engaged,
without Bank knowledge, a local firm to carry out the audit for the period
from April 1979 to January 31. 1984. In August 1984, the Bank informed MPW
that the audit report was not satisfactory. Following the Bank's
agreement, MPN signed a contract in April 1985, with a foreign firm in
Joint venture with the local firm at a total cost of US$45,000. MPW
submitted the audit up to June 30, 1986. Since then no further audits have
been carried out.

4.   Proiect Cost
3.28      A comparison between the appraisal estimate and the final cost
of the project is shown in Table 1. For the 289 miles of feeder roads
constructed and improved. the total expenditure was US$7.7 million. This
expenditure was 54? higher than rhe appraisal estimate for the same length
of roads. This is mainly due to an average of 350Z per mlile cost increase
in vorks done by contract and 282 increase on force account per mile cost.
The expenditures for the technical assistance component was US$2.43 million
as compared to the appraisal estimate of US$2.14 million, an increase of
10: over the appraisal.
3.29      US$8.9 million or 82? of the loan funds have been disbursed to-
date. The last disbursement was made in February 1988. three years after
the original project closing date of December 31, 1984. The undisbursed
balance of US$1.8 million is in the procesi of being cancelled.
B.    Fifth Hi2hway Proiect
1.   Start-un Delas
3.30      The Project was negotiated before a financing plan was firmed up
and was not approved by the Board until March 30, 1984, sixteen months
after appraisal. This delay was due to difficulties encountered in
obtaining firm financing commitments from possible donors which. in turn,
was due to the continuous decline in the country's eco-1omy. During the
project processing period. Liberia vent from an IBRD to an IDA-eligible
country which entailed further delays because of the then scarce IDA funds.
The US$10.5 million cofinancing anticipated at appraisal to make up US$19.4
million total project cost failed to materialize, except for an indication
from USAID of a US$3.1 million grant.
3.31      The Bank's efforts to provide the needed foreign component
balance of US$11.4 million from a combined IDA and Special Account fund
were not successful because grouping components of the project to meet the
different procurement eligibility criteria between the two sources of funds
was not found to be practical. The financing of the project finally
consisted of US$11.4 million from IDA, US$3.1 million from a USAID grant
and US$4.9 million from the Government, amounting to a total of U$19.4
million.
3.32      The loan became effective on July 30, 1984 four months after the
project was approved. The special conditions of effectiveness were:
(a) the opening of a Project Account and a Special Account;
(b)  the payment into the Project Account of an initial deposit of
US$400,000 equivalent; and
(c) the making by the Borrower of arrangements, satisfactory to the
Association to obtain the USAID grant.



- 13 -
3.33      In May 1983. the Bank approved the Government's request for PPF
funds, for consultant services to improve MPW's management and
administration system as a prerequisite to assuring efficient
implementation of the proposed Project. The MPW submitted an evaluation of
proposals received from the four shortlisted consultant firms, which was
carefully reviewed by the Bank. Based on the Bank's comments, the MPW-
selected firm replaced the proposed team leader and two cost accounting
specialists with better qualified staff, after which the Bank then agreed
to the selection.  Following the Bank's comments on the consultant's mid-
term report, the consultant revised and modified the proposed cost
accounting system to ensure simplicity and applicability. The system was
successfully implemented during the period when MPW was assisted by the
second consultant financed under the Project.
2.   Civil Works
a.   ReRravellin"
3.34      MPW, assisted by c,onsultants, was to regravel 350 miles of roads
by deploying three force account brigades. They were to be made up of
existing equipment (to be repaired under the Credit) and limited additional
equipment. Equipment repair contracts for 5 graders, 2 bulldozers and 3
loaders were signed in August 1984 with a private workshop for a total firm
contract cost of slightly under US$200,000. The first contract for
equipment and spare paris purchase was signed in Hay 1985 and the last in
October 1985, which was an average of 12 months delay after the project
became effective.
3.35      The first force account brigade was mobilized in November 1985,
15 months after the estimated starting tAme at appraisal. Shortly
thereafter, the brigade's dump trucks were withdrawn to work on
construction financed outside the regular budget. The Bank objected to the
withdrawal of the equipment and the MPW returned it shortly thereafter. In
the first year, only 20 miles (202) of the plaaned 100 miles were
regravelled. By the project Closing Date of December 31, 1987, only an
estimated 40 miles (11Z) of the total 350 miles were regravelled by force
account. In the meantime, because of the poor performance of the force
account brigades, a decision was made to have the remaining regravelling
work done by contract.
3.36      The regravelling by contract required an amendment to the Credit
Agreement, which was approved in December 1985. It took ten months after
the amendment was approved before the first regravelling contract for 60
miles at US$1.24 million was signed. Because of the critical financial
problems in the country, private banks were reluctant to accept each others
checks and vendors had difficulty in obtaining bank guarantees. The
contractor requested the opening of a Letter of Credit for payments to
which the Bank agreed. The second regravelling contract, for which bids
were received in March 1987, was not started when the project was
terminated on December 31. 1987. Among other reasons, this was due to the
Bank groups' suspension of disbursements on all loans/credits to Liberia.



- 14 -
3.37      A total of US$0.88 million was disbursed for 60 miles of
regravelling by contract, out of US$0.95 million payable from the Credit.
Between force account and contract works, a total of about 100 miles or
282, were regravelled out of the planned 350 miles, at a total calculated
cost of US$2.69 million, giving an average cost of US$26,900 per mile as
compared to US$26,405 per mile estimated at appraisal.
b.   Routine Maintenance
3.38      Out of the total US$1.84 million under the project, to cover 402
of expenditures per annum for routine maintenance, only US$0.2 million was
spent in three years, representing only 102 of expenditure required. This
accomplishment in routine maintenance was minimal as it was affected mainly
by repeated Bank Group disbursement suspensions; inadequate counterpart
funding; lack of operable equipment; delays in the supply of spare parts;
and poor institutional performance. Moreover, routine maintenance had to
compete with the Feeder Roads Project for funds.
3.39      Reduczion of surplus and non-productive labor force was one of
the planned measures to be taken by MPW to improve performance and to save
funds to supplement the road maintenance operation funds. During the
project period, MPW reduced staff by 75 persons per annum while the
proposed transfer of 800 permanent employees to seasonal labor force was
postponed by the Government.
3. Procurement. Equipment. Tools. Spare Parts and Eauipment Regairs
3.40      A total of about US$2 million was disbursed for purchase of
equipment, tools and spare parts. However, delivery for most items did not
take place until the end of the second year, thus the contribution of these
items to the prograummed work was insignificant.
4. Consultant Services
3.41      MPW engaged a consulting firm in August 1984 tot  (i) implement
the financial and administrative management systems; (ii) improve workshop
and equipment management; (iii) strengthen the Operations Bureau to help
achieve an efficient road maintenance delivery system; and (iv) assist in
regravelling of 450 miles of road. This contract, which was exempt from
the Bank's general suspension of disbursement, continued until the Project
Closing date, however, progress on civil works was minimal. At project
completion a total of US$2.7 million or about 1002 of the funds allocated
for consultant services was disbursed.
3.42      Under the contract, MPW was able to put in place the cost
accounting system developed with the PPF funds and was able to develop
routine maintenance and regravelling pro-rams. However, as the
acromplishment in routine maintenance was about 102 and regravelling only
289 of the planned program, the physical output was extremely low to
justify the cost in consultant services.

S.   Auditing Services
3.43      The auditing of accounts of the Fifth Highway Project was
undertaken in conjunction with and financed under the Feeder Roads Project
(see para 3.27).
Proiect Cost
3.44      The comparisrn between appraisal estimate and the final cost of
the project is shown in Table 2.  Routine and periodic maintenance
represent 18? of planned target 4itile consultancy services, which was
mainly for civil works implementation, represent 10OZ of the funds
allocated under this category. Disbursement under the project was US$6.78
million which represents 352 of the appraisal cost estimate of US$19.4
million. The last disbursement was made on June 30, 1988, and the
undisbursed balance of US$6.05 million is in the process of being
cancelled.
IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALTJATION
A.   Feeder Road Prolect
4.01      The economic justification of the project was based on reducing
transport costs and produce spoilage in the influence areas of the project
roads; in contributing to the expansion of agricultural production; in
providing improved access to bhalth, education and other social amenities;
and in institutional-building. All the roads constructed and improved are
located in areas of ongoing agricultural development projects. In both
Lofa and Nimba Counties the agricultural development projects were
supported by multilateral and bilateral financing agencies including IDA,
AfDB, USAID. and PRG.
4.02      The MFW assessed the achievements in the agricultural
development in October 1984, for Lofa and Nimba Counties. The results show
that farmer participation exceeded the appraisal estimate by 22; for the
three main crops marketed -- rice, cocoa and coffee achievements were 1002,
72? and 522, respectively. Crop yields have ranged from 762 to 137Z of the
appraisal estimate except for few low yields for cocoa and swamp rice in
the first and fifth harvest seasons in some areas.
4.03      The appraisal report took account of the benefits from road user
savings to non-agricultural traffic and net incremental agricultural
production attributable to road improvement for existing roads and on net
incremental agricultural production for new roads. The agricultural
development projects have achieved the expected incremental agricultural
production which supports the traffic growth estimated at appraisal of the
feeder roads projects. Under these circumstances, it is safe to assume
that non-agricultural traffic will also increase from the ADT recorded at
appraisal. Based on the above assessment, it would be reasonable to
conclude that the ERR of an average of 172 estimated at appraisal was
attained for the roads built.



- 16 -
B.   Fifth Highway Proiect
4.04      The economic justification of the project was derived from its
role in reducing vehicle operating costs (VOC) using the methodology
developed under the Bank's and Transport and Road Research Laboratory's
(TRRLLs) research programs in Kenya. VOC savings were calculatmd as the
difference between VOC on the rapidly deteriorating network under current
maintenance levels and those resulting from implementation of the Project's
maintenance strategy, applying road deterioration parameters and user cost
relationships by TRRL.
4.05      The project ERR was estimated at 1002 at appraisal for both
routine and periodic maintenance. Under the project, only 102 of the
planned investment in routine maintenance was implemented in three years,
hence the anticipated benefit in VOC has not been attained. In fact,
because only minimal routine maintenance has been carried out during tre
three years, the road system further deteriorated, which would result in
increased VOC. No data is available on which to base a revised ERR on the
regravelled roads. However, because of higher VOC and high consulting
costs, the revised EB would be substantially lower than the appraisal
estimate.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A.        Feeder Road Proiect
5.01      One of the main objectives of the project was to strengthen
MPW's capacity to assume responsibility for feeder roads construction and
subsequent maintenance. Liberia was to benefit by avoiding duplication of
management, in different ministries and agencies. Even thov i, at the
start of the project there was a move to this direction, in j82 the main
responsibility for feeder roads was transferred to K.G. This had the long-
term effect of spreading scarce himan and physical resources too thinly so
that in the end little output would be realized, quality standards would
generally be low, and economic losses would be unavoidable. In general,
the objective in this area of institutional building was not achieved.
5.02      To ensure effective performance of the FRD, MPW was to engage
seven experts who would train and coach both head office and brigade level
staff. Even though the FRD was established within a reasonable time, the
division was not fully staffed. As years went by, several of the head
office and brigade level staff were reassigned to different posts within
MNW and replacements were not appointed. Moreover, the number of experts
under the technical service, was reduced to about half.   Because of such
variations from the initial plan, the achievement in this area of
institutional development was poor.
5.03      To supplement and strengthen the brigades of the staff needs,
MPh was to train road foremen, mechanics, equipment operators and drivers.
Early in the project implementation period, the FRG financed Camp Mechlin
Training Center, where the planned training was to be provided, phased out
its training activities because of shortfall in financing. Even though MPW
was encouraged to use Loan funds to finance a training expert, it was
z:'uctant to do so. The shortage of staff was furthpr aggravated by the



- 17 -
arrival of some 200 units of road construction equipment financed under a
Japanese Comiodity Loan. -The failure to start-up the planned training
resulted in poor utilization, maintenance and repair of the brigades'
equipment. In this area of institution development. MPW was worse off at
project completion than when it started.
5.04      The development of the domestic construction industry was to be
achieved by contracting out the constructionlimprovement of 250 miles of
feeder road. However, only two contracts for a total length of 29 miles
were awarded to two Liberian contractors in October 1985. Despite a slow
start, some local contzactors have continued to do road works with
financing by USAID, and thus appear to have benefited from the project
improvement.
B.   Fifth Highway Proiect
5.05.     MPW had been inadequately staffed in middle management and field
technical personnel, even under the Fourth Highway and Feeder Roads
Projects. the failure to start up the training program under the Fifth
Highway Project has further aggravated its staff shortage. Under this
constraint, the start of the Fifth Highway Project, while the Feeder Roads
Project was still in progress, placed a major burden on MPW's weak
institutional capability.
5.06      The low salary scale and absence of a production-based incentive
system has also affected MPW's institutional performance. Moreover, the
insufficient and delayed allocation of local funds adversely affected staff
morale and performance.
5.07      MPW's inability to assign the required number of qualified
counterpart staff to work with the consultants significantly reduced the
possible transfer of skills and sustainment ability of the cost accounting
system developed under the Project. MPW vwas not able to introduce the
Consultant's recommended changes in organizational structure hence,
anticipated improvement in institutional development has failed to
materialize.
5.08      Overall, performance of the Borrower under both projects must be
rated as poor. The objectives set under both projects, in institutional
building and in road maintenance improvement, were not met. Despite the
projects, MPW was left institutionally worse off than when it started
because of the general deterioration in its management.
VI. CONSULTANT'S PERFORMANCE
A.   Feeder Road Proiect
6.01      As previously noted, the Liberian consultrnt firm engaged for
the design of the feeder roads went out of business, and MPW had to
complete the design by itself.



- 18 -
6 02      The consultant engaged to train, coach and supplement MFPW's
staff and to develop a follow-up program for feeder roads Improvment and
maintenance initially did not provide a capable teas leader. The first
team leader of the consultant failed to perform satisfactorily and had to
be replaced. Overall. performance was much less than the appraisal
expectation.
6.03      Technical assistance to domestic contractors was limited to 29
miles of construction by two contractors, compared to the larger number of
contractors needed to do 250 miles of feeder roads construction. However.
the benefits achieved in helping the domestic construction industry are
being sustained on USAID financed works.
B.   Fifth Highway Proiect
6.04      The consultant engaged under the PPF funds, after considerable
effort on the part of the Bank, was able to develop an applicable cost
accounting system which was introduced in the MPI by a second consultant
financed under the project. The second consultant was able to introduce
the cost accounting and monitoring system. However, the consultant's
contribution was limited to 10 of routine and 28S of the regravelling
target planned under the project, even though the services expenditure was
100o of the funds allocated. Nevertheless, this poor performance in civil
works was influenced by factors not related to the consultants'
performance.
VII  ROLE OF THE BANK GROUP
A. Feeder Road Proiect
7.01      The design of the project was in keeping with the Government's
Development Plan. It included comprehensive provisions necessary to ensure
success in its implementation, and took into account the then prevailing
situation in Liberia. However, the progress of the project was handicapped
by critical shortages of funds and local staff. constant transfer of key
personnel, and frequent general suspension of disbursements by the Bank due
to arrears in repayments, the latest in December 1986. Despite the
suspension, the Bank continued to disburse for civil and consultant
services contracts in progress, and for goods shipped and delivered.
7.02      Bank Group performance on the project was mixed.  Bank
supervision missions contributed to developing short range revised work
programs and implementation schedules despite the prevailing problems and
constraints. Without these suggestions, the performance of the project
could have been more adverse than was the case. Nevertheless. supervision
was handicapped by frequent changes in Bank staff assigned to the project
during the early years of project execution. From mid-1984, supervisory
staff remained unchanged, and a commendable effort was made to get the
project back on track. While some progress was made, the Bank Group's
general suspension of disbursements undermined these efforts.



- 19-
7.03      The Bank might have been more prompt in having an incompetent
project manager for one of the consultants on the Feeder Road Project
removed when the problem first became evident. This problem might have
been recognized earlier if it were not for the frequent changes in Bank
supervision staff during the early years of project execution.
7.04      The failure of local communities to participate in the routine
maintenance program might have been avoided if the Bank and the Government
had consulted them during the planning and preparation stage of the project
by getting their reaction to their proposals, and soliciting their
cooperation and participation.
7.05      The Bank should have objected to the transfer of responsibility
for feeder roads to MLG, as it clearly violated Section 3.06 of the Loan
Agre ment which called for the FRD to be maintained in the MPW. It should
also have made a greater effort to carry on the training activities at Camp
Mechlin.
7.06      Bank decisions to approve the amendments to the Loan Agreement
to include new project components and to increase the percent of
disbursements from the loan funds was helpful. Also the steps agreed to by
the Bank to assist local contractors (para 3.09) were constructive. But
again the general suspension of disbursements undermined the assistance
these actions were designed to provide.
B.   Fifth Highway Proiect
7.07      IDA was confronted with unusual difficulties in solving issues
related to local funds constraints and mobilizing cofinancing for the
foreign component of the project. Considerable staff effort went into
project identification, preparation and finalization of the project after
appraisal which required eight Bank missions prior to appraisal. The Bank
Group's efforts in seeking cofinancing, and to have the project, which was
initially planned for IBRD lending, financed by IDA. was also commendable
and helped to maintain good relations with the Government.
7.08      The Bank's supervision of the project was thorough, which
resulted in the development and introduction of a usable cost accounting
system.  Its detailed review arz  coments on MPW's evaluation on the
consultant's proposals and reports helped in ensuring expected final
results. Also despite the suspension of disbursements, local contractors
seem to have benefitted from their training program as they have been
successful in securing work under the ongoing USAID road program.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
8.01      The Bank Group's level of supervision was inadequate on the
Feeder Road Project, but in mid 1984 supervision of the project improved as
execution the Fifth Highway Project was getting underway. Commendable



- 20 -
effort was made to improve the execution of both projects but the general
suspension of disbursements undermined any progress that could be made.
8.02      Execution of broad based highway projects in a politically and
economically unstable environment such as Liberia, is bound to produce
problems particularly when there is frequent turnove. of government
officials, shortages of budgetary funds, and under-financed local
consultants and contractors. Furthermore, the Feeder Road Project was
hampered by unavoidable problems such as the failure of a supplier to
deliver an order of equipment, and the bankruptcy of a local consultant.
It is impossible for the Bank to avoid these risks in developing countries,
and they must be expected as a part of doing business.
8.03      Two-third of the cunstruction/improvement works under the Feeder
Road Project were to be built by force account and the remainder by local
contractors. It might have been more appropriate to have brought
inexperienced foreign contractors under both projects with the provision
that they use local supervisors, foremen, operators and mechanics to a
substantial extent. This would have given local construction personnel
good practical experience, and at the same time assured that the civil
works components were successfully carried out.
8.05      Even though the Fifth Highway Project's objectives were only
partially met, one component was effective in that MPW now has at its
disposal a well developed cost accounting system and study-based
recommendations to improve its organizational effectiveness, which could be
introduced when the situation in the country permits.
Lessons learned
^.06      Most of the Loan/Credit funds for both projects were used for
consultants and procurement, and little for construction work which was the
largest component in both projects. The Bank should carefully assess the
disastrous effect on its ongoing projects when it suspends disbursements
for non-repayment of earlier loans. Suspension is usually brought about
because of the country's inability to repay its debts, and meet clarrent
obligations. Thus suspension only adds to the difficulties of executing
ongoing projects, and invites even more adverse performance. Perhaps at
the time of a suspension, the Bank should make a decision to either
continue to support its ongoing projects fully, or withdraw completely and
shut them down (para 8.06).
8.07      If there is a likelihood of suspension of disbursements,
consideration should also be given to extending the use of letters of
credit beyond the supply of goods as presently permitted to civil works and
teFhnical assistance contracts, as a means of protecting on-going projects
from sudden and frequent cut-off of Loan/Credit funds.
8.08      During the execution of projects being carried out under
difficult conditions such as in Liberia, particular effort should be made
by the Bank to avoid frequent changes in staff, and to carry out
supervision missions on a regular basis.



-21 -
8.09      These two projects, as vell as others in West Africa, reflect
the mistake of relying on force account operations as the primary means of
carrying out civil works by public works agencies that do not have the
capacity to even maintain their roads, let alone improve or rebuild
existing roads. Under these circumstances. greater use might be made of
foreign contractors to supplement local contractors and to ease the burden
on local executing agencies.
