MEMORANDUW AND RECOMDATION OF THEPD
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBIC OF TUNIA
FOR A
FIFtH URBAN PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Tunisia for US$58 million to finance a Fifth Urban Project is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 17 years including a five-year grace
period with interest at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.       Sector Issues.  Tunisia is already hiphly urbanized and urbanization is
expected to continue at a fast pace. Of the total population of 7 million, 4
million live in urban areas, 2.5 million being concentrated in Tunis and three
other coastal cities, in which most non-agricultural economic activities are also
located. By the year 2000, more than 7 million people will be living in cities.
Current demand for housing is estimated at 45,000 units per year.  This demand
and the demand for serviced land and infrastructure will grow rapidly. Housing
constitutes about 20Z of all investments. Until now, Tunisia has been successful
in avoiding many of the worst features of rapid urbanization; slums and
homelessness are relatively uncommon, as indicated by low average occupancy rates
of 5.3 inhabitants (or 1.03 household) per dwelling. Moreover, basic utility
services have improved considerably over recent years in most urban areas.
3.       But the ability to meet future needs, even to preserve the achievements,
is jeopardized by shortcomings in the regulatory framework, standards and
institutions, as well as by a lack of appropriate financing. Until recently,
urban housing and development were officially almost the exclusive the domain of
the State. In keeping with the broad economic liberalization in progress in
Tunisia, regulations have been modified to permit more private activity, but they
remain in many other respects ill-suited to the country's conditions, as do the
standards governing urban housing and infrastructure. The sector institutions
also need to be overhauled to meet the needs of the emerging private activity in
the sector, and to function effectively in the liberalized financial sector.
4.       Much of urban housing development has slipped into the informal sector,
where official standards are disregarded and utility services are often difficult
to obtain. Where official standards are applied, urban housing densities are low
and the cost of services correspondingly high. A severe long-term problem of
land registration has emerged; ownership is assured by the Torrens system of
registering rights in a land book kept by the State, but only 50% of land in use
has been registered. At the present rate, registration of all plots could take
decades to complete. The problem affects rural land equally and, because of its
conseauences for the land information system, prevents efficient land management
by hampering land-use control, establishment of boundaries, collection of taxes,
and implementation of projects. The authorities are especially concerned by
their inability to regulate the competition between housing and agriculture for
land adjacent to towns.



-2-
5.       The housing sector also lacks adequate financing. The former housing
finance agency (CNEI.), which financed low-income housing through a contractual
saving scheme, experienced difficulties because of rigid regulations concerning
savings and lending products, and the inability of the State system to supply
housing, resulting in withdrawals by depositors. The desire for housing is a
powerful incentive for household savings in Tunisia, wtheras long-term lending
for housing by the deposit and investment banks remains very limited. These
diffical1ties associated with securing collateral and the inability to make
long-term mortgage loans, have led to the Government's decision to transform CNEL
into a full-fledged housing bank so that the new institution can operate with
greater flexibility in the liberalized finacial sector.
6.       Recent Actions. In July 1988, the Government adopted a new housing
policy. Its principal features are to: (a) increase the supply of land for
housing by increasing densities, reserving sites. reorienting the public land
development agency towards low-income households, and facilitating subdivision by
private developers; (b) increase the supply of appropriate financing for land
development and housing by restructuring the existing housing savings institution
and removing restrictions on active participation by the banking and insurance
sector; and (c) reclaim leadership in the management of urban development by
defining an active policy to oversee and direct growth, setting up a land-use
data base, revising outdated building and infrastructure standards, and updating
the urban planning regulations. In March 1989, the Parliament passed a law
authorizing the establisbment of the new Housing Bank (Banque de l'Habitat [BIR),
which was accomplished on April 28 at its shareholders' meeting.
Project Obiectres
7.      The principal objectives of the project are to: (a) increase the supply
of affordable low- and medium-income housing programs through increased
mobilization of domestic savings and rationalization of resource allocation; this
would be done by supporting the new Housing Bank to fulfill its role as a
financial institution; (b) increase the share of the formal private sector in
land and housing development, and in surveying activities; and (c) initiate the
modernization of the land information management system by simplifying the
procedures for land registration and exchange.
Pject D
8.       To support the necessary institutional and policy changes, the project
would finance the following three components: (a) housinA finance, which includes
the transformation of CNEL into a housing bank, BR, with such necessary
accompanying measures as training and technical assistance, as well as a line of
credit to the new bank of US$51 million; the line of credit would be available
for land development, housing construction, acquisition, extension, and
rehabilitation; (b) institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Housing to
help implement and monitor Government's new housing policy adopted in June 1988,
including a new regulatory framework facilitating private land and construction
development, and restructuring of its parastatals SNIT (housing company) end APH
(land developer); and (c) land information mana_ement including the modernization
of land registration and the production of base topographical maps.

Rationale for Blank Iuvolvement
9.       This project is a logical evolution of the Bank's involvement in the
urban and financial sectors in Tunisia. Following continuous dialogue between
Bank mitsions and the Government, the latter has moved towards reforming the
housing sector. The proposed project is the first Bank operation in Tunisia to
address critical issues in housing finance and the regulatory framework, in
addition to continuing support to housing development. It comes at a time when
the Government has decided to implement changes to allow the private sector to
play a greater role in the provision of low-cost housing. The Government's
decision to transform CNEL into a housing bank, BR, which will compete with othet
financial institutions in the full range of banking activities, is a big step
towards building a universal banking system. Although other banks would remain
free to lend for housing, the transformed CNEL would retain a competitive
advantage because of its specialization and experience. The project would thus
complemeut the financial sector reform supported by the Bank under the Structural
Adjustment Loan approved in June 1988. The project would also initiate action in
the area of land management, which the Government and the Bank have increasingly
identified as a major constraint to the implementation of many projects. Land
management policies will be followed up under forthcoming operations such as the
proposed Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Project and the Municipal
Development Project. Given the complexity and sensitivity of land management,
the Bank can contribute the experience gained in other countries and assist the
Government in its effort to overcome existing institutional constraints to a more
efficient utilization of land.
Lendines 
10.      The funds would be borrowed by the Government, which would onlend part
of them to BE at the current Bank interest rate plus at least 0.5S or the money
market rate offered by the Central Bank, and which reflects the supply and demand
conditions in the inter-bank money market, whichever is higher. The proposed
line of credit to BE would assist it over a two-year period in refinancing a
share of its land development, combined construction-cum-mortgage loans for
low-cost housing, including individual construction loans. Maturities of land
development and construction loans would be up to three years; those of mortgages
and individual construction loans would reach 20 years. The average lending rate
of these subloans would assure a two-point spread over the total weighted average
cost of resources- . BB would ensure that the total amount of all construction
loans and mortgages for a particular subproject financed from the Bank loan would
not exceed the total investment cost of that project (exclusive of land). BR
would rely on borrowings and diversified savings instruments to fund its loans,
in con.rast with CNEL, which relied exclusively on contractual savings. It would
thus be able to raise a much wider spectrum of resources, both locally and abroad.
Agtreed A4tions
11.      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained that: (a) the
Government would onlend US$51 million to BR on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank; (b) BR's financial accounts would be audited annually by an independent
1/ Currently, the mortgage loan rate is 8.25% and the construction
loan rate is 11.32, compared with an inflation rate of about 7Z.

auditor satisfactory to the Bank; (c) a system, satisfactory to the Bank,
regulating real estate and land development activities would be introduced by
December 1990; (d) an action plan detailing further studies and technical
assistance would be prepared and provided by BB to the Bank by December 31,
1989; (e) a review meeting between MER and Bank representatives would be held
once a year to assess progress made in streamlining the regulatory system
controlling urban planning activities and in the implementation of SNIT and
AFH contrat-programmes; (f) an action plan (inclading a contrat-programme for
OTC) would be agreed for the proposed institutional changes for the
modernization of land registration; and (g) a review meeting between the
Ministry of Plan and Fin-nce and Bank representatives would be held once a
year to assess progress made in the implementation of the action plan for
institutional changes for the land management component, and to agree on
necessary adjustments.
Jusifiatin4Benef Its and R-Isks
12.      (a)  Housing.  The project would endow the housing sector, which
accounts for one-fifth of the annual investments made in Tunisia, with an
autonomous and healthy financial institution able to contribute to the
sector's financing requirements.  The new institution would rely on the State
budget only for subsidizing housing finance targeted to low-incoLe groups.
The project would thus assist the Goverament in fostering the "creditization"
of the housing sector, with a view to eventually reduce the share of informal
investments. The latter objective, which is a consequence of a more effective
housing policy, would be achieved only in the medium-to-long term, and would
be expected to be supported by further Bank projects. The main risks of this
component are those inherent in any institutional restructuring. The project
involves a new institution, BE, whose future effectiveness is uncertain
despite all the built-in safeguards and whose institution-building efforts may
be delayed by inherent resistance to change by its staff. The effects of the
in-depth changes in strategies, procedures, and staff skill mix to be
introduced in the three public agencies, may take longer than planned due to
the extent of the retraining needed. To minimize these risks, a statement of
general policy, a document of procedures, and an organization chart
satisfactory to the Bank have been developed by BR, and a comprehensive
technical assistance package has been included in the project.
13.      (b)  Land Information Management. Project benefits would come from
improved security of tenure (legal aspect of cadastre) and improved knowledge
of spatial development (topographical plans). The expansion of systematic and
accurate mapping of urban areas would allow priority investment programs to be
planned and executed more rapidly, and city plansing to be more effective.
More specifically, the main benefits are the following: (i) speedier land
transactions to achieve more efficient land use; (ii) expanded use of credit
based on land as collateral to finance investments; and (iii) better land
consolidation and land redistribution, which are essential conditions for
improving the productivity of land.  The main risk is related to the ability
of the institutions' management and staff to implement rapidly the necessary
organizational changes leading to possible delays in the expected increase of
private sector involvement and in the improved overall efficiency in financial
intermediation.



14.      I am catisfied that the proposed project would comply with the
Articles of Agrbement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.

FIFTH URBAN PROJECT
Procuremeat and Disbursement
Based on the experience under the Fourth Urban Project of 1986, and
other Bank lines of credit in Tunisia, the line of credit to BH would
refinance civil works and acquisition of housing units constructed under the
project. No contract is expected to be suitable for international competitive
bidding. Public developers would be subjected to Government procurement
practices for public works. Private developers tend to execute construction
works either by themselves or through a variety of small contractors.
The technical assistance comg2onets include the implementation of
several studies and associated surveys. Contracts for which Bank financing is
requested would be awarded according to Bank guidelines to qualified local and
foreign consulting firms.
Topographical, cartographic, and computer material and equipment
would be procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank guidelines.
However, a wide variety of small items of specialized equipment with
individual amounts not exceeding US$150,000 and up to an aggregate total of
US$1.5 million may be procured through shopping on the basis of evaluation and
comparison of bid invited from a list of at least three qualified suppliers
eligible under Bank procurement guidelines.
