I    In August l955 the Gove.rnnient of Nicaragua requested a loan of
'.3e6 million for the rehabilitation of the Port of Corinto.  The pro-
posed project included the construction of a new quayj the relocation
of the railway line into Coriiitoy the corxstruction of a water supply
system to serve the city of Corinto as well as the port, and the con,
struction of a marine repair shop. The relocation of the railway
would have required th-e construction of a new bridge and the Goverrnent
proposed to build a combired rail and highway bridge wh.ch T;ould also
carry the proposed extension of the Hanagua-Chinandega all-weather
highway into Corinto.
IL   '7ith the loan aoplication the Govermrent subpiitted the reoort of
a firm of consulltng engineers i*ho had been engaged to studv the port
facilities4
III* A Bark Mi1ission visited iicaragus in Leptember 1955 to st.udyT the
economic and technical aspects of the project.  The .ission found the
project generally sound but was of th1e opinion that the rail,cay re-
location and shin repair shon were not needed at this ti'me, and that
the project should be confined to the extension to the docking and
cargo hantdling facilities and the water suroply system. The Government
is requesting the Bankts approval to modify the existing Loan 81-N1I to
include both a highwiay bridge and the 15 mile highway from Chinandega
to Corinto.
IVY  The growth of Ni caraguaIs foreign t rade in recent years has
rendered existing port facilities inadequate. The rapid increase in
traffic through Corinto, the principal port, has resulted in serious
congestion, and excess traffic has had to be diverted to otlher ports.
Poor management and conflicting authlority over port operations hove
added to these difficulties.
V.   Corinto has the best deep water harbor on the Test Coast of
Nicaragua and serves the rnost highly developed azea of the country.
It is thus the logical location for a nort development program.  The
steady growrth of exports and imports justifies the improvements of
the port.
VI. The project as modified by the Government and as reconraended by
the iassion consists of:  (1) a new 1,2C0 foot quay w-ith necessary
services, (2) cargo handling equipment, and (3) a water supply system
to suoply water for both the port and the city of Corinto, part of the



cost of 1,vhich would be borne by the Govermlent or thie city.  On the basis
of reasonable estimat es, the project ixr-uld cost 13.2 ,:nillion in foreign
currency and 10.87 million cordobas (X1.51 -million equivalent) in local
currency.
TII. The Government has established an autoaonoue port a&thority and
h&s agreed- to scoure the seiqvices of an experienced port manager, the
project is considered suitable f7or a 3n'- loan to t1ie woit  t^ovity in the
arnount of ~3.2 million U.S. An appropriate tenn  .wiould be 20 years with a
3 year grace period.
I.  INTPInuuU1TIC!5
1.         In August l9e5, the Government of Nicaragla requested the Bank to
consider a loan for '.3,600,000 to finance the foreign exchange costs of
a project for the rehabilitation of the F:ort of Corinto. The project
included the follo&ing:
(1)  TDe construction of a new qLuay .;ith suitable transit
sheds, cargo handling equipment, etc.
(2)  The construction of a i,ater sup,ply system to supply
potable ,-ater for both the port and the city of Corinto.
(3) The relocation of the railioad line into Corinto and
the construction of a combined railroad and highwnay
bridge.
(4)  The construction of a ship repair shop.
The Govern-aent also indicated its interest in a ihighway connection to
the port but proposed to request the inclusion of the highvray under the
present Hi,gh-ay Loan No. 81-NI.
2.    In Sep,te-mber 19$55, a "3ank mission visited Nicaragua to study the
economic and technical aspects of the proposed project. The mission
found the Project generally sound but concluded that it could be
modified by the elimination of items (3) and (4) of the loan application
without substantially lessening its value.  Relocation of the railroad
line had been proposed by thle Governnent to remove the danger of breaching
by wave action, but furtlher investVgation indicated that this ;might be
accomplished more cheaply by increasing the effectiveness of the Protec-
tive works along-, the shore, and that in any event the Railroad should
bear the cost rather than the Port. A new highway bridge would be
needed to carry the proposed highway connection into Corinto but,
like the highNay, could be included in the present Highwray Loan
No, 81-NI.  It is understood that the Governient is now preparing to
request such an axnerdment. With respect to item (4), present and
pros-pective ship traffic did not seer, heavy enough to justify a ship-
repair shop4 The mission discussed these modifications with tne



Government  Which has umcpto  the  modified nroject including only
the proposed new quav wivti shieds and accesscries and part of the cost
of the wl ter supp ly system.
3.   A ccnsultants  r-nort orn the );'ox:o.sed ext-ensTons ant atdditions to
the docking facilities was subi;itted nrith the loan request.  The mission
was of the opinion that the im.provenents to t1h  dock facilLties pronosed
by the consultants -were technically sound, but it recorrnended a re-
duction in the length of the aronosed quay since a study of port traffic
4_ndicated tha t a shorter quxy would meet proLable needs for 15-20 years.
ht the request of the Govermrent) the consultants hIzve modified the
project and submn.tted re-vised cost estiLmtes.

l!*,  wUicarsgua borders cn both the Atlanrtic and Pacific Oceans), but the
concentration of der relopricnt in the P .cif ic area has faced. it towards
the uesta  The cspita1, N:anag;ua, lies close to the Padific (see iap,
Appendix .) aid is connected by rail1-aay with the Pacific at th1e port of
,orinto, and Tnractically all of 1Ticaraeua' s eorts originate in the
Pactfic aroa.  Although 75%, of imports come from- the east coast of the
United States, the absence of rail or lhighltray conLnections between the
east coast ond the rest cf the country limits tne use of east coast
norts evren for innorArDts, and only one r,oint on the east  coast, Li D uff,
has docking facilities. As a result, over 95% of iNicaragua's Iexorts
and imports teass througl Pacific ports.  Corinto, the only naturally
protected deern water port on tlhe west coast, accounts for about 75% of the
country's exocrts and imports.
Port of Corinto
5.   Corinto is local-ted on the Uorth Pacific Coast of hicaragua
(Appendix A) approximatey1 35 miles from the Hionduran bordor and 88 miles
by rail from Eanagua,  A 3'-6" gauge railroadt 'i th several branches runs
fromr Corinto to Managua tI.hrough the fertile northwestern and central
western parts of the country. There are no highwTay connections to the
nort at oresent, but one is rlanred for early construction. The
Government nro-,ses to renuez-t an amendment to Loan iNo. 81-1TI to cover
the cost of this cornnection. It will, in general, paraliel the rail-
ropd from Corinto to Cih.ran.cieUa, a distance of about 15 rdiles, where it
will connect with the road to d lana-ua now being built under Loan Mo. L$-o
6.   Corinto has a firie naturally protected harbor (A.onDendix B) and is
the best deep water nort on the west coast of ilicaragua,  The harbor
entrance has a depth of only 26' at present but it can be develoned into
a large deep sea harbor with a depth of 35t with very little difficulty
whenever this becomes economic ally justifiable.
7,   Traffic through the nort has been increasing rapidly for several
years, but it has now reached a limit because of inadequate and anti-



-'   -
quated facilities for doc:king and unloading, an absence of highway
connections, and congested railiway faci'Lities,  Increasingly, traffic
is being diverted to lighterage oorts to the south.
8.   The port fa.c LI-it3.s are o-ned by tie raij.road, whicha in turn i3
on.ed and operated by the GovernmaentS.  The facilities and stevedoring
operations are under a port maragement which in practice is separate
from the railway administratior.
Other Ports
9.   All of 11caragua's other west coast ports are lighterage ports
unprotected against heavy seas,  Their incluidle Tarnarindo, 35 miles south
of Corinto and 38 miles from lianagua, which is now being improved;
liasachapa, 65 miles south of Corinto and 36 miles from Managua;  and
San Juan del Sur (the principal lighterage port), 125 miles south of
Corinto and 85 miles from llianagua (Pppendix P),
10.  Tamarindo is bein., improved at an estimated cost of half a
million dollars  primarily as a tem-oor.ry measure to relieve the con-
gestion at Corinto urtil facilities at that oort have been enlarged
and it has beon connected by hi,hwiay with *iaragua.  There is little
possibility that a protected deep water harbor can be develzped
economically at Tanarindc'o, and it stems probable that little traffic
will flow through the port wihen Corinto's oort facllities are exoanded
and modernized.  Its onll,r advantage Jies in the fact that it is the
port closest to iianagua.
11. iEasachapa is used at oresent only by the hsso Standard Oil Caapany
and thae Texas Comapany to discharge liquid .-etrolcum nroducts.  T1he Lsso
Company is now in the process o' n.roving to Corinto, but the Texas
Coanpany plans to continue using  7asschana.
12. San Juan del Cur handled about 2$j %s ca.rch traffic as 'orinto in
1954., in soite of the fect tlhat it is a much poorer port.  Although
the snall bay offers some orotection to ships at anchor, all cargo
must be lightered.  Developmlent to permit deer draft ships to dock
seems unlikely.  Hovevc r, the l0cation of t1le nort gives it an
advaantage over Corinto in southwestern iiicaragua, as far north as
ilaragua, the area which it now serves.  hlost of the coffee nroduced in
this area is shipped from this port.  It seems probable, therefore,
that evren after the modernization of -ort facilities at Corinto, San
Juan del Sur would continue to attract a sizeable amount of traffic
from-i south,estern i!icpragua.
13. El Bluff, the only eastcoast port with docking facilities, is a
potential site for a deenwater port.  At present, its use is restricted
by the 12' depth of water over the bar, and the absence of rail or
highway connections betwreen the east coast and the rest of the country.
Although a highwa7r is ex::ected to be completed by 1958 between Hianagua
and Rama, about 420 miles up the Escondido River from El Bluff, obstacles
to the use of an east coast port will persist.  The Lscondido River



has a depth of' about 30 feet, bu-t a bar at t.he mouth of the river .vith
about 9 feet of -rater, as -uell as the ocean 'ber at t'.he entrance to
Bluefield 3ay, li mit the size of shippirng that can reach Rama. Even
if deep Yrater navigrat-on is eventually opened to haama, the distance
from Rama to 2)a nagua (160 miles) ma ces it unli'cely that much of the
ezisting e..port trade, thle greeter part of wh-ch originates in  estern
Nicaragua, ,iould be diverted from thie 1.7est Coast.
14. A deepwater port at :<ma might attract part of the imnport trade,
sorre 75cZ of' which cor.es from the east coast of t,e United States, as
,wrell as some oF the coffee grovin in southeastern Nicaragua. By the time
such a port is likely to oe availabLe, ho:.ever., the countriy should be
able to su,pport deep vfater po:rts on both the east and the west coasts.
Port Facilities at lorinto
15. The  main  cep water docicing fac-ility at Coririto (Appendix C) is a
reinforced concrete pier parallel to the shore, $08' long by 51, tmrde,
whi-ch is connected to the shore at an angle by a trestle 390' long.
Two railway trrc,cs extend out over the trestle and along the face of
the pier.  '.he pier is supported on reinforced concrete piles with re-
inforced concrete beams and cross-braces, and it has a timber deck.
There is a two-store-? corrbi4ned office anrc residence for t;e port
manager on the northlern end of' the pier; a narror shed which previously
extended along rmost of the remainder of thle pier has bean removed.
Although it is more than 50 years old, the pier seems to be in fair
condition.  The fender systerm and severel ipiles along thle front have
either been broken out or badly damaged, but these piles along with the
f5ender sX.stem Fn- pier deck are being repaired.
16. The -vrater is approximately 221 deep along the northern end of the
pier and 30t to 321 along, the southern half. If it becomes necessary
in the future, howoiever, it would be possible to increase the deoth
along, the entire face of the pier to 30' by dredging without endangering
thle safety- oL ti-e structure, thus perritting deeper draft ships to dock
alongside.
17. Thaere are no facilities on the pier for bunkering or for sup,\plying
fresh water to ships.  There is no road connection betwseen the pier and
shore, and tractor-trailers and fork lifts cannot operate on the pier
becaase of the obstructing railroad tracks.  'T"he tran,asportation equip-
ment which consists of a few small diesel locomotives and a limited
num,ber of flat cars is insufficient for requirements.  The equipment
belongs to the railroad but is assi,gned to the port, The stevedoring
equipment, such as slings, tackle, etc., is also inadequate for
present require-aents.
18. There is no covered storage and no spece for open storage on the
pier or i n the imr.mediate shore area belonging to the port.  Customs
and private cotapanies have a reasonable amount of storage on shore, but
it is some distance from the dock.



-6.-
19.       In addition to the goverr.uaent-onmed pier, two small private
lighterage piers are in operation. One, known as the Mamenic Line pier,
was constructed in 1954 and is used exclusively by the Mamenic Line for
barging operations. Double railroad tracks, laid flushL with the concrete
paving, extend onto the pier. The other, a T-head pier for lightering
operations, was recently completed by the Grace Line Company. It was
designed for truck, tractor-trailer ar.d fork lift operation, and has no
rail connections.  It was intended as a relief measure during the period
of congestion at the main dock and will probably be abandoned when Grace
Line ships can dock at the proposed extension to the goverrment dock.
20.       Liquid. cargo, such as petroleum products and molasses, is now
handled Arom the north end of the government pier through pipe lines to
takks ion the shore. The Xsso Standard Oil S.A. have armroved plans for
the construction of a T-head pier and dolphins, approximatelY 500t north
of the existing government dock, and the Government has approved this
project in principle,  '.hen this pier is corpleted, the old pier will be
freed of all tankers except molasses ships which can dock along the
approach trestle.
111. D-SCRIPTICT1 QF THE PO2E0CT
21,       A report submitted to the Nicaraguan 1;inistry of Public Works
by Christiani & Nielsen, an engineering and construction firm of Copen-
hagen, on the development of harbor facilities in Corinto, proposed the
construction of a quay, extending south from the existing pier for a
distance of 1,214 feet and in a south-westerly direction at an argle of
137io to the main quay wall for an additional 560 feet (Appendix C). The
proposed structure would have been capable of be.thing three large ships.
The designs called for a quay of   reinforced concrete construction.
The area belind the quay wall was to be filled with sand dredged from
the harbor. There were to be two transit sheds on the quay and railway
tracks were to rvn in front of and in back of the sheds. The consultant
estimated that the construction would take Z2 years.
22,       After discussion of the project with the mission, the government
decided that additional berthing space for two large ships was all that
was needed at present. The consultants therefore reduced the length of
the proposed new quay to approximately 1,200'. This seems sufficient to
meet traffic requirements for 20-25 years. Analysis of traffic prospects,
discussed in detail in Section IV below, indicates that about 230,000 tons
of dry cargo will move through the port In 1959, the first year when the
new facilities are expected to be in operation, and about twice that amount
or 460,000 tons, by 1980-85. A study of local conditions indicates that
each berth of 600 feet can handle about 200,000 tons per year. Thus, the
new quay would have a capacity of 400,000 tons.  At the same time, the old
pier is being improved and strengthened.  If, in addition, new trestles are
built to connect the old pier with the shore and permit joint use by it and



.* 7 -
the new quay of cargc-handtling equiwnent to be included in the present
project, the old pier should easily be a'ole to handle at least 120,000 tons
provided it is properly maintained and not overloaded,  The entire instal-
lation would thus have a capacity of about 520,000 tons per year, or roughly
the annual traffic envisaged for 1980-85.
23.       When it becomes necessary to construct additional quay space,
the question of location will have vo be examined again. According to
shipping people familiar with the harbor, there may be heavy surges at the
proposed location of the ad&7itional 560 feet of quay.
24       TIn addition to the reduction in the length of the proposed quay,
the pioject was modified further by the inclusion of some items not
covered in the original estimates. These items were electrical, water
and plumbing installations, fire fighting equirpment and office space,
25-       The city of Corinto has no water system at present and fresh
water is brought in by tank cars.  As water will be needed to supply the
quay and the-r fire sprinkler system as well as for the clty's needs, the
Government proposes to build a supply system to bring potable water to
the area. It Is proposed that the project contribute $75,000 towards the
foreign exchange costs of the water supply system.
26.       The cost of the modified aroject is estimated at the equivalent
of UT.S0 $4,742,0o0 (A-ppendix B), including an estimated U.S. $3,200,000
equivalent in foreign exchange and 10,871,000 cordobas in local currency
(U.S. $1,542,000 equivalent).  The Government is willing to advance the
local currency f.unds needed on the same terms as in the case of the Bank-
financed power plant (121-NTI), that is, at 2,% interest with amortization
at an annual maximum rate of 35.  This loan would be subordinated to the
proposed Ba;£i loan.  In preparing the above estimates, no allowance has
been made for duty or wharfage fees on imported material and equipment
for the oroposed structure, or on the contractors' construction equipment.
27.       It is proposed to obtain the sand fill required for the con-
struction of the new quay by hydraulic dredging along the quay front;
this will provide a depth of water of 10.7 meters alongside the new cquay and
an enlargement of the turning basir seaward of the quay.
28.       In addition to the proposed project, the following work is
recowmended as a necessary supplement, but it is not included in the pro-
posed loan:
(1) Annual hydrographic surveys of the harbor, channel
and bar, and current studies to determine velocities
and paths in front of the new quay wall and along
the peninsula of Isla Punta Icaco.
(2)  A study of the deuirabtlity of establishUag a pier-
bulkhead line along the entire waterfront of Corinto
beyond whic1i no structure could be built, and of
defining a suitable anchorage and turning basin sea-
ward of the existing and proposed pier and qusy.

29.       The Go-zernmant is proceeIng with the rejairs to the existing
pier at its own expense.  -The cargo-hanl'ing equipment for this pier,
which is included in the proposed project, should be purchased and put
into service as soon as possible. The cost of this equi-pment is included
in the estimate, Apnpendix F.
IV.  PRESENT  1A0YIC AND i?3ABLE FYUTUR3 T.2AP'IC DE'TiLCP1qiT
30        Ti'e volume of foreign trade moving through the port of Corinto
has increased steadilyr over the past 25 years and particularly since tie
close of the war. (See Appendix D.) Total traffic through the port
amounted to 224,000 tons in 1954, consisting of 83,000 tons of exports
and 141,000 tons of imports, about half of which was dr,r cargo.  Traffic
through the nort of San Juan del Sur in the same year totaled 65,000
tons, about equally div--ided between exports and imports.  The future
prospects of both ports depend largely on developments in cotton, cotton
seed and coffee, which account for rougnly two-thirds of the exports from
both ports today and provide the buEL: of the foreign exchange to finance
impoorts.
31.       Exports of cotton and cotton seeds from Corinto and San Juan
,el Sur wore about 110,000 tons in 1955, cr about twice the volume in
1954. The acreage planted to cotton for the 1956 export season was
increased by about one-fifth, but production and exports are expected
to be slightlY less than in 1955 owing to heavy rains.  The boom in
Nicaraguan cotton production which began in 1950 soems now to have
come to an end.  The miost suitable land h1as already been put into
cotton production, and the encroachment of cotton on other crops has
gone as far as it seems likely to go. Moreover, no stimulus for a
further expansion in cotton production is likely to come from prices,
which are generally expected to decline, mainly as a result of the
recent change in the United States cotton policy.  }2or these reasons,
the future acreage planted to cotton may in fact prove to be slightly
less than in 1956, and exports of cotton and cotton seeds in 1959 are
therefore expected to be only a little higher than the level reached
in 1955, or about 125,000 tons.
32.       Coffee exjorts have averaged about 18,000 tons a year on the
avera-e since the rise in coffee prices in 1949.  There has, however,
been a steady increase in the number of new trees planted, and, although
they have served mainly to renlace old trees, a similar increase in the
number of productive trees.  As a result of this increase, even assuming
a reduction of present prices, exports of coffee seem likely to increase
at a rate of about 5't a year.



- 9 -
33.      Only a modest increase ?Aay, .bout 2% a year) is expected in
exports of all other cornaricdities, the most important of wihich are sugar,
sesame and corn.
34.      Present indicat-.ons ate that exports from the Pacific area
amounted to about 175,000 tons in l955 with cotton and coffee accounting
for 75% of the total. On the assumptions set forth above, total exports
through Corinto and San Juan del Sur in 1959 (the first year when the pro-
posed new port in Corinto is to be in operation) are likely to be around
200,000 tons. Although impro-eement of port facilities in Corinto may en-
able it attract some trai>fic from the area now served by San Juan del Sur,
it has seemed preferable to estimate Corintofs exports in 1959 more con-
servatively by distributing total exports between the two ports on the
basis of the distance between inland shipping points for various commodi-
ties and each port, On this basis, it has been estimated that total ex-
ports through Corinto would amount to about 155,000 tons in 1959 (Appendix K).
35.      lImports of dry cargo throuch Corinto probably amounted to about
75,000 tons in 1955. They- consisted mainly of insecticides, machinery,
vehicles, iron and steel, textiles and a large variety of other consumerst
goods. The future volume of imports will depend to a large extent on
Nicaragua's foreign exchange earnings from her main ex.oort commrdities,
cotton, cotton seed and coffee. In view of the probabie decline in cotton
and coffee prices, it seems probable that imports of dry cargo over the
next few years will be limited to the present level, or about 75,000 tons.
36,      About three-fourths of the petroleum products consumed in Nicaragua
are imported through Corinto by the Esso Standard Oil Company. TIports in
1955 probably amounted to around 83,000 tons. By 1959, consumption is ex-
pected to increase to 130,000 tons, with about one-third of the anticipated
increase going to the Bank-financed power plant which is expected to be com-
pleted in 1957.
37.      In 1959, therefore, imports through Corinto may be expected to
total about 205,000 tonso On this basis total traffic through Corinto in
1959 will be about 360,Q0O tons, distributed as follows:
Exports, dry cargo          155,000 tons
Imports, dry cargo           75,000 tons
Total,   dry cargo           230,000 tons
Imports, petroleum pro-
ducts                   130,000 tons
Grand Total                 360,000 tons

e.       It is posrf.ble t'lat exports of cotton through Corinto may fall
below the estimates as a result of sotme inc%rease in shipments through
Tamnair.do of cottcn and cotton seed from the imned-ate surrounding areas.
Yrore than offsetting this possibility, however, are the possib-lities of
a shift in t.rffic, especially of imports, from San Juar del Sur to Corinto,
and of an increaze in the transshipment of cargo at Corinto for HordiLran
ports by the Iamenic Line. Lighte:age in these ports is impaired by weather
conditions during certain seasons of the year, and shipm.ents beyond Corinto
are there-ore carried by coasters0
39,      Lny eftimnates be,-ond 1959 aiust necessarily be very uncertain9
There is no evidence at present, homever, that the long-range rate of in-
crease in Nicaragua's foreign trade is likely to exceed 3% per year. On
that ass-umption, the volume of dry cargo traffic is not likely to double
the estimate for 1959 in less than 20 to 25 years, or by 1980-85 at the
earliest.

ho.      Port charges in Corinto are generally high compared to those in
US and European ports but compare favorably with other Latin Aii.erican ports.
6harfage charges, paid to the rai-lroad administration, vary between US
808.5 and US $L50 per ton for general cargo, and between $Cp60 and  "I.87
per ton for petroleum products, In additions $3.58 and $1.80 per ton are
charged by the customis administration for handling imports and exports res-
pecti,rely in the sheds for customs clearance purposes.  A sma'l tonnage and
lighthouse fee is also charged by the customs adninistration which maintains
the buoys marking the entrance to the port. Port c1harges might be simpli-
fied by the establishrment of a single charge covering customs, port hand-
ling and harbor fees.
41,      The combined revenues from all sources totalled about US $620,000
equivalent in 1954 (Appendix G).  This corresponds to an average rate of
approximately $3650 per ton for general cargo, and approxiimately $1.30 per
ton for petroleum products.
42.      On the basis of the expected volume of traffic in 1959 (the first
year of operation of the new port facilities) at present rates, it is es-
timated that net income will amount to well over US $200,000 equivalent
(Appeildix H).  Thus, more than aniple funds will be available to cover the
amortization of the Bank loan and the Government investment in local cur-
rency, Since operatin2g costs ha-e been assessed cornservatively. it is
possible that the present rates could be reduced if, after a period of
operatioii, the inerome remained at the expected level.

43.   Inadequate port facilities are serlously hampering the flow of
Nicaragua's forelgn trade, and causing substantial losses to the
national economy. The situation is deterioratin. rapidly, as traffic
increases.
44.   Port conpestion has m&de it rery difficult to handle shipments
of cotton, Ylcarapuats principal export.  A substantial fraction of the
1l9J)A crop had to be left in open storape, and heavy loss was avoided
ornly because the rainy season was unrsually late.
45.   In a number of caies, delivery contracts for both cotton and coffee
could not be fulfilled in time.  As a result of' their irability to ship
when pr'.ces were at a poak, exporters were forced to accept substantial
price reductions in some instances. Some foreign buyers have withdrawn
entirely from the m icaraguan mar!ket.
46.   Port charres are h.pgher than they would need to be, if better
docking facilitiee were available. Congestion at Corinto has made
necessarrr the di'vers±on of some traffic to San Juan del Sur, with a
resulting increase in inland freIght costs. Two steamship companies have
even cancelled their calls at Corinto.
47.   The greateet los3es arise, however, from delays to shippIng.  The
cost of thece delays is reflected in the freight rates charted by
shipping companies calling at Corinto.  An analysis of the record of all
freighters and tankers callina at Corinto during January-June, 1955
shows a loss of about 470 days by freighters and of about 20 days
by tankers as a result of conrestion and slow handling of cargo. With
demurrage rates of about $1,200 a day for cargo ships and $1,800 for
tankers, loeses to shipping companies during this period may be
estimated roughly at $600,000.  Allowing for the hi.her turnover of
traffic during the first six months of the year, total losses in l155
may be estimated to $00,000.  Because of these heavy costs, the shipping
companies have recently placed a surcharge of 20% on freight rates.
Adequ3ate port facilities would permit a reduction in present high freight
rates by the elimination of surcharges.
VII.  PB0RU:310X  PS'OD G   JI7ATIOIN
48.   The administration of Corinto's port facilities is generally
unsatisfactory at present.  The existing pier is owmed by the railroad,
and operations on the pier are managed by a port superintendent appointed
by the railroad administration. In addition there is a custome officer
in charge of all operations in the custons sheds. This division of
resDonsibility gives rise to frequent friction and to congeation of
cargo in the areas of one or the other authority.

49.   Ad,^tic.al c 'mrltLas are ra,orte-d to be cause3 by the unwill-ingness
of freight agents to move cotton from their sh'aeds t,o the pier on overtime
during periods of particullar congestion because of the additional cost, involved.
50.   If the ,rono,>ed new Dort is to operate eff-'iciently, it maust be managed
uy a single auth-ority with ovcrall resno ibility.  A governmient decree en-
acted in January 1956 created thle establis3a-,ent of such an authority with
pow,ters si.ilar to those granted to the National Light and Po;er Company.  The
terms of the decree are generally satisfacto5.ry.
51.   The decree provides for an autonomous por-, authority with a Board of six
directors, i ncluding the PuIblic Works '^-nis-ter (who will be chairman), the
Finance Minister, a representative of the miiiority political party, and three
members chosen by the Government from Lists subliitted by comiiiercial, farming
and shipping irn-terests respectively.  The Board wiJl be recuired to secure
Government- approval on ma.4or policy mattacs blit will be free from Government
interfevence in day to day operations.  The Board has been appointed and is
preparing to take over the oort.
52.  'The decrae orovides also for the aopointment of a general manager of
recognized capacity to supervise operation of the port. He is to have the
power to appoint all but the most senior officials, who will be appointed
by the Board on his recommuendation.  Since no qualified candidatae for this
post is available in ITicara-ua a suitable man will have to be found abroad.
It is desirable that two Nicaraguans should be appointed as ass:Istant port
superirtendents, for training purposes.  Ole might serve as general assistant
to the port superintendent, the other might be responsible for supervising
labor and maintenance of equiptient.
VTII. C2,§ ' 313S AI1D B72ilDATIG'
53.  Existing port facilities at Corirto are inadequate to handle the present
vo2ume of traffic, which amounted to  2t4,000 tons in 1954.  Estimates indicate,
moreover, that traffic will increase to 360,000 tons by 1959.  An expansion of
present facilities is therefore urgently required to relieve present congestion
and to insure that the flow of Nicararuas foreign trade will not be hampered
by lack of adequate port facilities.
54.   The proposed expansion would be sufficient to provide for the estimated
traffic growth over the next 20 to 25 years. The project is economically and
financially sound. Studies indicate that even with a reduction in the present
port rates it w ould remain self-supporting.
55.  Corinto is the logica' locat-on for a modern deep water port.  It has
the best natural harbor on the West Coast of Nicara&ua, and is located in the
most highly developed area in the country.
56.   The project is considered suitable for a Bank loan to the Port Authority
in the amount of 03.2 million provided that consultants are retained and that
the Authority secures the services of an experienced port administrator. An
appropriate term would be 20 years with a three-year period of grace.

Note:  The distribution of exoorts in 1959 reflects some change in coffee,
cotton and cotton seed shipments from San Juan de'l Sur to Corinto:
Coffee:  About one-third of the present exports throvgh San JYuan del Sur
originate in the Jinotega-Matagalpa region.  Even if the direct distance
to Corinto is much shorter, co:fee from this area is shipped through San
Juan del Sur c.ue to the lack of adequate road connections with Corinto.
Transshi,?ment to the Managvua-Corinto railroad is possible, but impractical
and expensive. With the contemplated completion of a road to the new
port, it has been ass'med that all of the coffee exports from this area
will be shiipped through Corinto.
Cottorn and cotton seed: About 18%  of the ginning capacity is situated
in the Gra iada area, and the remainder in the Managua-Leon-Chinandega
area. The distributlon of cotton and cotton seed exports in 1959 between
Corinto and San Juan del Sur respectively has been calculated pn the
basis of the shortest distance, Managua being situated approximately
half way between the two ports,
