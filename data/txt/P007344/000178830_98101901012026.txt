SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT - LOAN 896-HO
HIGHLIGHTS
The Sixth Highway Project achieved its main objectives of improving
the Tegucigalpa-Talanga Road and feeder roads as well as of increasing SECOPT's
capabilities in the areas of transport planning and road maintenance at a cost
of almost 20% below that estimated at appraisal (para 4.01). Such savings
were largely due to the Government's decision, early in the project implementa-
tion stage, to carry out a thorough review of the previously prepared engineering
of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road, claiming that the average cost per km was
unacceptably high (para 3.02). The Government's view, although originally
not fully shared by the Bank, proved to be sound.
The Loan included a special contingency allowance because of uncer-
tainties in the bidding outcome for the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road (para 2.04).
Although the funds were not needed for the original purpose, their availability
proved to be very fortunate since they were later allocated, on an emergency
basis, to repair the damages caused by Hurricane Fifi, which devastated the
Northern part of Honduras in September 1974 (para 3.06).
Surplus funds resulting from the 'low' cost of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga
road (para 3.04) and the lower design standard of the Bridge over the Ulua River
(para 3.12) were used for new and/or increased project elements. These included:
a)   additional works to complete the reconstruction of sections of the
Comayagua-La Libertad road which was not included in the original
project (para 3.10).
b)   inclusion in the project of the reconstruction of the most critical
sections (17 km) of La Ceibita-Santa Barbara Road (para 3.26).
c)   assistance in implementing a feeder roads demonstration project
utilizing labor-intensive construction techniques (para 3.27).
The loan included financing of technical assistance to the three
Government agencies involved in transport planning and a training program for
maintenance personnel (para 3.22, 3.23, 3.24 and 3.25). These institution
building aspects of the project proved to be well chosen and resulted in
long-term improvements in the areas mentioned above, in spite of shortage
of qualified personnel and frequent changes in staff assignments (para 6.02).
The completion report identifies one lesson to be learned from
this project, and that is the importance of the Bank maintaining a flexible
and cooperative attitude toward changes in project elements resulting from
significantly changed circumstances.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT - LOAN 896-HO
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since the early 1950's when road development in Honduras began to
receive priority attention, road transport has been the primary land traffic
mode. The highway network, totalling about 5,600 km at the time of the
project's identification, was basically well developed but many primary routes
needed upgrading and new feeder roads were required to achieve full development
of selected areas.
1.02      The Government's Six-Year Investment Program for 1972-77 totalled
about US$560 million equivalent with about 26% or US$145 million allocated to
the transport sector and 80% of that amount designated for highway upgrading
and construction. The Government assigned first priority to improving the
Tegucigalpa-Talanga-Juticalpa road which passes through very mountainous
terrain and carried up to 600 vehicles per day including a substantial volume
of logging trucks from adjacent forest areas. Also considered as high prior-
ity was the construction of feeder roads to assist in the development of
forestry and agricultural areas served by the Tegucigalpa-Talanga-Juticalpa
road. Construction and studies of selected sections of these high priority
investments comprise the main elements in this project which is the sixth in
a series of Bank-financed highway projects designed to assist the Government
in its efforts to provide needed improvements and expansion of the road network.
1.03      This completion report is based on information obtained from the
file of the Bank's Record Center, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision reports for Loan 896-HO and on the final project report dated
January 1979 prepared by the Secretariat for Communication, Public Works and
Transport (SECOPT).
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
Preparation
2.01      Project preparation started in 1968 when, with financing provided
under the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 495-HO), feasibility studies of the
Tegucigalpa-Talanga-Juticalpa Highway (195 km) and for feeder roads to the
Western Highway were carried out by consultants. A draft report was submitted
to the Bank in mid-1969 and finalized in January 1971 incorporating the Bank's
and Government's comments.
2.02      Detailed engineering of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga-Juticalpa Road was
financed jointly by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI)
and the U.K. Government. A contract for these engineering works, including



terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, was awarded in December 1971 to
a UK consultant who prepared the feasibility study with detailed engineering
for the highest priority section (Tegucigalpa-Talanga) to be expedited so that
it could be considered for the proposed Bank loan. At the same time the
Government was preparing, through other consultants and with other sources of
finance, the engineering of several secondary roads which they planned to
propose for inclusion in the project.
Appraisal
2.03      Project appraisal was carried out in November/December 1972.    During
appraisal a change of government led to the removal of many of the senior
SECOPT officers and the mission was left to deal directly with consultants
who, of course, were unfamiliar with the position of the new government.
Although officials of the new government negotiated the loan, subsequent
further changes in SECOPT staff contributed to project delays resulting from a
review of the main road design (para. 3.02) and addition of a new road (para.
3.26) and changes in feeder roads for detailed engineering work (para. 3.20).
Highlights of the appraisal were:
(i)  The economic and engineering studies for the Tegucigalpa-Talanga
road were practically completed. The consultants, at CABEI's
suggestions, had included about 16 km of climbing lanes which
were deleted at the Bank's request because of insufficient
economic justification.
(ii)  Although the engineering for secondary roads was incomplete and
feeder road costs were estimated by consultants on a per km
basis without any surveys and plans, the information was considered
adequate for appraisal.
(iii)  As a result of discussions during the preparation missions, it was
agreed to include in the project two institution-building compo-
nents:
(a) technical assistance for transport planning; and
(b) training for engineers and technicians.
2.04      The Issues Paper was circulated on December 29, 1972 and a decision
meeting held on January 15, 1973. As a result, agreement was reached on the
major issue identified which was the recommendation to include a 15% special
contingency allowance because of uncertainties in the outcome of the interna-
tional competitive bidding for the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road. No major contract.
for highway construction had been recently awarded in Honduras and it was
difficult to judge the response of the market to the international tender.
It was also agreed that the special contingency would be cancelled in total
if the lowest evaluated bid did not exceed the appraisal estimate for the road
(excluding normal contingencies) and cancelled prorata if the bid was higher.

Negotiations and Approval
2.05      Negotiations took place in Washington between April 2 and 5, 1973
and on May 24, 1973 the loan amounting to US$18.8 million was approved by the
Executive Directors. The loan was signed on May 30, 1973 and became effective
on August 27, 1973.
Project Description and Costs
2.06      The agreed project, as described in the Loan Agreement, is as follows:
Part A  -  The construction of a two-lane paved road between Tegucigalpa
and Talanga (55 km).
Part B  -  Reconstruction to all-weather, gravel standards of the road
between Comayagua and La Libertad (45 km).
Part C  -  Construction of a 200 m long bridge over the Ulua River.
Part D  -  Improvement to gravel standards of about 80 km of feeder roads
according to an agreed list.
Part E  -  Feasibility studies of about 330 km of feeder roads according
to an agreed list, and engineering studies of the technically
and economically feasible roads.
Part F  -  Review and improvement of the Borrower's transport planning
operations, including, inter alia:
(i) review of the Six Year (1972-1977) Transport Investment
Program;
(ii) improvement of traffic data collection and evaluation;
and
(iii) updating of the road inventory.
Part G - A training program in the fields of highway design, construction
and maintenance as well as in management, operation and mainte-
nance of highway construction and maintenance equipment.
The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1976.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Construction of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga Road
3.01      Project implementation started even before loan negotiations, when,
in March 1973, SECOPT initiated prequalification of contractors. Ten firms
submitted prequalification documents and six were prequalified. The procedures
followed and the results of prequalification were agreed with the Bank.
3.02      In early June 1973, shortly after loan signing, SECOPT decided to
carry out a thorough review of the previously prepared engineering for the
Tegucigalpa-Talanga road claiming that the average cost per km (about
US$250,000) was unacceptably high. This decision caught the Bank by surprise
since the design consultant's work had been closely supervised by SECOPT and
CABEI staff during preparation and had been accepted as reasonable by the Bank
and Government as a basis for appraisal and loan negotiations. The review
decision caused protests from CABEI (who financed the engineering) and from
the design consultant who wrote numerous letters to the Bank and SECOPT dis-
agreeing with the latter's contentions and maintaining that the engineering
prepared by them was the most suitable for the difficult topography encoun-
tered. Although the Bank felt that SECOPT had not revealed fully the reasons
behind the design review, it had no choice but accept their decision and
express its concern about the delays in project implementation which might
result.
3.03      SECOPT engaged two local consulting firms to carry out a preliminary
review of the design and determine what further action was needed. In August
1973 the firms submitted their report recommending the study of alternative
alignments along some sections and proposing a review of the cross section
and the drainage systemS The report stated that earthworks could be reduced
by as much as 876,000 m . SECOPT then appointed three local individual design
engineers to carry out the detailed review which they completed in February
1974. They proposed alignment changes along 65% of the road length, including
bypassing the city of Talanga, which would sho5ten the road by about two kilo-
meters, reduce earthworks by about 1,000,000 m and lower the total estimated
cost by about 16% or nearly US$2.2 million. The Bank agreed with the proposed
changes.
3.04      The plans were revised by SECOPT staff under the direction of
the three appointed engineers and international bids were invited in February
1974. Because of the time lag between the date of prequalification (March
1973) and the date of the invitations to bid, three of the six firms previously
prequalified (para. 3.01) indicated no further interest. The invitation was,
therefore, issued to the remaining three firms plus an additional firm which
prequalified later. Only two bids were received on the mid-May tender date:
one for US$9.9 million equivalent by a Honduran/US joint venture; and one for
US$14.3 million equivalent by a US contractor. The Government estimate was
US$11.5 million equivalent.



In view of the comparatively low bid, the Bank suggested a further investi-
gation of the joint venture's prior performance and its financial and tech-
nical capabilities. All information available indicated that the joint
venture was made up of good and responsible firms and, on that basis, the Bank
agreed to the contract award. Works proceeded smoothly and were satisfactorily
completed on schedule in February 1977 only about 3 months later than the
completion date estimated at appraisal. The quality of work was very good and
final costs, including escalation and supplementary works, was US$11.2 million,
about 11% over the original bid and some US$2.5 million (18%) below the
appraisal estimate of US$13.7 million, without contingencies. The difference
of US$3.8 million between the low bid (US$9.9 million) and the appraisal
estimate (US$13.7 million, excluding contingencies) created a "surplus" of
project funds which was used later in part for carrying out additional works.
The very good results from both a cost and time standpoint showed that SECOPT's
decision to review and revise the original design was sound.
3.05      Initially, SECOPT intended that the original design consultant be
retained to supervise construction. However, when the decision to review
and revise the designs was taken, it was also decided to appoint a different
consultant for the supervisory task. The Bank agreed to award of the supervi-
sion contract to a joint venture of Honduras/Costa Rica/Nicaragua firms whose
performance was generally satisfactory.
Special Contingency Allowance
3.06      As mentioned in paragraph 2.04, the special contingency of 15%
(US$2.06 million) should have been cancelled in view of the fact that the
lowest bid was well below the appraisal estimate. However, it was agreed
to defer the cancellation for several months until construction work was well
under way as a guard against any unusual and unexpected cost increases. This
turned out to be a fortunate decision since it left funds available to allocate
to repair of damages caused by Hurricane Fifi, which devastated the northern
coast of Honduras in September 1974, flooding roads and bridges and creating
chaos in the region. The Minister of Public Works asked the Bank to provide
emergency funds for the repair works and the Bank agreed to the use of US$1.53
million of the special allocation for this purpose. By letter of December 4,
1974 the Loan Agreement was revised accordingly and emergency procurement
procedures were established. In June 1975 the Government asked the Bank to
include two additional roads to the list of roads to be repaired with the
emergency funds to which the Bank agreed and later formalized in its letter
of February 5, 1976 addressed to the Minister of Finance. The following four
roads (including major bridges) with a total length of about 360 km were
repaired:



-7-
Western Highway
San Pedro Sula-Puerto Cortes
San Pedro Sula-Tela
Tela-Ceiba
Repair works comprised mainly the reconstruction of road sections washed out
by the floods, resurfacing and bridge protection; works were carried out by
local contractors and by force account. All works were satisfactorily com-
pleted in May 1978 at a total cost of about US$2,865,000.
Reconstruction of the Comayagua-La Libertad Secondary Road (45 km)
3.07      The feasibility study and preliminary engineering for this road
was prepared in 1970 by a US consultant with financing by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). Reconstruction costs were estimated at US$2.9 million
and the benefit cost ratio was very favorable; average daily traffic (ADT) at
that time was 65 vehicles.
3.08      In July 1973 the Highway Department (CAMINOS) invited consultant
proposals for detailed engineering to gravel standards and, with Bank agree-
ment, appointed a local firm who was later retained for construction super-
vision. The cost estimate on the basis of completed detailed engineering was
US$2.9 million, the same as for the feasibility study, but ADT in 1974 had
increased to 190 vehicles. Thus, the economic justification of the road, as
required by the Loan Agreement (para. 6.05) was easily confirmed.
3.09      However, since the Bank loan was based on an appraisal estimate
of only US$2.05 million on the basis of reduced design standards (including
contingencies) CAMINOS, with Bank agreement, decided to improve only the
most critical sections (totalling about 25 km) and to construct all bridges
and the drainage system to ensure year-round traffic on the entire road.
This first phase construction was estimated at US$2.1 million. International
bids were invited in April 1975 with the road divided into two sections and
bidders given the option to bid individual sections or both as a "package."
Three bids were received and contracts were awarded to two local contractors
who were the lowest bidders for each section: Section I - for US$1,180,000;
and Section II - for US$949,000. The total of US$2,129,000 for both
contracts was only slightly higher than the Government estimate.
3.10      In late 1975 when the contracted works were well underway, SECOPT
requested that about US$900,000 of the "surplus" funds from the low Tegucigalpa-
Talanga Road bid (para. 3.04) be allocated to complete reconstruction of the
road sections not included in the previous contracts (about 20 km). The
economic evaluation of this additional work was favorable and, with Bank agree-
ment, two contracts amounting to about US$440,000 each were negotiated with
the same contractors.



- 8 -
3.11      All work of generally good quality was completed in August 1977,
about six months behind schedule.   The final cost was US$2.94 million, slightly
less than the contracted amount.
Construction of a Bridge Over the Ulua River
3.12      The design of the bridge over the Ulua River was prepared by an
individual consultant seconded to SECOPT by the IDB. The bridge, as designed,
was 150 m in length and two lanes wide; it was estimated to cost US$970,000.
However, a two-lane structure could not be justified because of low projected
ADT volumes and, in order to meet the requirements for economic justification
specified in Section 3.01(b) of the Loan Agreement, the bridge was redesigned
for one lane only. Bids were invited in February 1974 and in May 1974 a
contract for US$321,500 was awarded to the lowest bidder, a local contractor,
and a local consulting firm was selected for construction supervision.
3.13      The contractor was issued a notice to proceed in November 1974.
Unusually heavy rains in late 1975 raised the river level to the top of the
nearly completed abutments and piers which prompted a design revision result-
ing in some time delay and increased costs.
3.14      Bridge works were completed in October 1976, about six months behind
schedule. The final cost, including supplementary works and escalation, was
US$450,000, about 40% over the original contract amount but well below the
appraisal estimate of US$800,000 which was based on a two-lane bridge. The
quality of work was good and the consultant's supervision was entirely satis-
factory.
Improvement of about 80 km of Feeder Roads
3.15      Feasibility studies for the 80 km of feeder roads to be improved
under the project were prepared by a consultant with financing provided by
IDB.  The roads are:
Length Km
(i)  Casa Quemada-Macuelizo-Azacualpa                11.5
(ii)  Western Highway-Pinalejo                         7.0
(iii)  Choluteca-Apacilagua                            28.0
(iv)  Comayagua-La Paz                                19.5
(v)  La Ceibita-San Nicolas                          14.0
Total       80.0
3.16      At appraisal and negotiations it was agreed that detailed engineer-
ing for 45 km of the above roads would be financed under the loan while
engineering for the remaining 35 km would be financed from other sources
available to Government at that time. After the loan was signed, SECOPT
informed the Bank that financing from other sources was no longer available
and requested Bank financing for the engineering of the entire 80 km. The



-9-
Bank agreed, and design contracts were awarded to two consultants: A US
firm for the first four roads totalling 66 km and a local firm for the last
road of 14 km. It was agreed at negotiations that, as the feeder roads
were to be constructed to fairly low standards, the normal level of detailed
engineering would be inappropriate and only "light" 1/ engineering would be
done which would provide a reasonable estimate of average cost per km and a
suitable basis for preparing contract documents. The engineering for the
feeder roads was prepared on that basis.
3.17      Bids from prequalified contractors were received in March 1975 for
roads (i) through (iv) and in late 1975 for road (v). In all cases the con-
tracts were awarded to the lowest bidder and construction supervision was
provided by the design consultants. Roads (i) through (iv) were completed
on schedule in early 1977 and road (v) in early 1978. The quality of all
construction and the consultant's supervision was satisfactory. Final cost
of works on the five roads was US$1,351,000, about 12% over the appraisal
estimate of US$1,210,000 (including contingencies). The increase was caused
mainly by construction of additional drainage structures and selected improve-
ments of design standards. Annex 1 shows a comparison between the costs,
traffic and rates of return for each road as estimated during appraisal (1972)
with the same data after completion.
Feasibility and Engineering Studies for Feeder Roads
3.18      The project included feasibility studies for 14 feeder roads total-
ling about 330 km serving the areas north of the Tegucigalpa-Juticalpa road
and engineering for those roads proven feasible. On the basis of expected
development and estimated traffic volumes, it was agreed at negotiations that
only "light" engineering (para 3.16) would need to be prepared for nine roads
totalling 143 km but that normal detailed engineering would be required for
the remaining five roads totalling 190 km. The list of roads studies and
grouped by type of engineering is shown in Items A and B, Annex 2.
3.19      With Bank agreement a contract for the studies and the "light"
engineering was awarded to a joint venture of US/Honduras consultants, and
work began in mid-1974. All work was completed by mid-1975 and showed rates
of return for individual roads ranging from 7.9% to 50% with only three roads
having returns below 10% (Annex 2). Although it had a relatively lower rate
of return than several other roads studied, the Government assigned high
priority to the improvement of the Juticalpa-Catacamas road (41 km) and
requested that detailed engineering be prepared immediately so that its
construction would be considered for inclusion in the then proposed Seventh
Highway Project. The Bank agreed and the study consultant's contract was
extended to include this work. The road is presently under construction
as part of that Bank project.
1/   "Light" engineering means a reconnaissance only to identify principal
improvements needed, earthwork quantities based on minimum field surveys,
standard designs and plans for drainage facilities together with speci-
fications and bid documents.



- 10 -
3.20      Unexpected delays were encountered in starting detailed engineering
for the remaining 150 km. This was partly the result of several changes in
sernior SECOPT officials but was mainly caused by Government uncertainty about
relative priorities for feeder and developmental roads in the general area of
the Tegucigalpa-Juticalpa road. In an effort to clarify the situation the
Bank agreed to SECOPT's proposal that feasibility studies be prepared for two
additional roads; 88 km road serving the area south of Juticalpa, and a second
bypass of the city of Tegucigalpa, about 16 km in length (Item C, Annex 2).
The work was carried out in 1977 by the same consultant who prepared studies
for the originally agreed 330 km (para. 3.19).
3.21      Finally, in mid-1978 SECOPT proposed and the Bank agreed that
detailed engineering would be carried out for the following three roads total-
ling about 158 km:
Telica-San Francisco de la Paz-Gualaco          58 km
Gualaco-San Esteban                             50 km
Talanga-El Provenir                             50 km
These roads include substantial portions of roads originally proposed with
extension to open new areas and connect with roads being constructed with
assistance from IDB. The engineering work was carried out by three local
consultants and completed in mid-1980. The first and third roads listed
above are included in the ongoing Eighth Highway Project and the IDB is
financing the construction of the second road.
Technical Assistance for Transport Planning
3.22      The project provided for technical assistance to the three govern-
ment agencies involved in transport planning: the Central Planning Office
(CONSUPLANE) and the General Directorate for Transport and the Sectoral
Planning Office, both in SECOPT. Staff in all these agencies lacked training
and experience in transport planning and there was little or no basic data
with which to work. In April 1974 SECOPT invited proposals from consulting
firms to carry out the assistance on the basis of terms of reference agreed
with the Bank. The joint venture of Honduras/US firms was selected and a
contract was signed in September 1975.
3.23      The General Director of Transport in SECOPT was appointed as coor-
dinator of the program and the consultant provided 40 man-months of assis-
tance. Their project manager and transport economist remained in Honduras
for the full contract period (10 months) and 8 experts in various fields were
assigned for shorter periods as required. In addition to providing much needed
training to staff of the three planning agencies, the consultant prepared
manuals for feasibility studies, analysis of vehicle operating costs and bus
route studies and made recommendations on tariffs, traffic regulations, a
transport master plan and a program for data collection including computer
processing of selected information.



- 11 -
3.24      The Government was favorably impressed with the consultant's perfor-
mance and asked the Bank to extend the original contract which, in fact, was
extended three times until May 1978 (the second and third extensions were
financed under the Seventh Highway Project).   The consultant's services during
the contract extension were carried out by a full time transport economist and
were limited to the General Directorate of Transport. In addition to follow-up
on the tasks initiated during the original contract period, the consultant
provided additional training for transport planning as well as advice and
assistance for the preparation of a much-needed new transport law together
with implementing regulations. The new law was enacted in February 1976 and
was the basis for a November 1976 decree establishing regulations for enforce-
ment of vehicle weights and dimensions. With the assistance of CABEI, SECOPT
built and equipped 13 weight control stations located at strategic points
along the most heavily trafficked roads. The stations began operations in
January 1977 and, after a short adjustment period, are working satisfactorily.
Training Program
3.25      The project helped finance a training program for maintenance
personnel which was carried out with assistance by a US consultant under a
15-month contract and that was later extended by an additional five months.
Originally a total of 29 courses were listed for consideration with 15
selected for preparation and use on the basis of priority and considering the
time, funds and staff available. The selected courses consisted of both
audio-visual and field training and were presented in each maintenance district
which were supplied with audio-visual equipment and other necessary training
aids. A training department was formed within SECOPT and two engineers were
trained as instructors in the consultants' home office. The ongoing Seventh
Highway Project includes financing of additional technical assistance and
training for maintenance staff and the same consultant has been retained to
aid in implementation.
Additional Project Road
3.26      In late 1974 SECOPT requested the Bank's agreement to use about
US$3.0 million of the US$3.8 million "surplus" funds (para 3.04) to help
finance reconstruction of the most critical sections (17 km) of the 60 km
La Ceibita-Santa Barbara Road. The economic justification for the proposed
improvement was prepared by SECOPT's Sectoral Planning Office with detailed
engineering carried out by a local consultant. The Bank found the economic
and engineering information to be satisfactory but suggested delaying bids for
the work until construction of other project items was further advanced
so that a more accurate estimate of available loan funds could be made.
In February 1976 the Bank agreed to the additional road improvement and
bids were immediately invited from prequalified contractors. Two contracts
totalling about US$2.93 million were awarded to the lowest bidders; US$2,744,831
for highway works and US$187,582 for construction of two bridges. The inclusion
of this new project component required extending the closing date from June 30,
1977 to December 31, 1978. All work was of good quality and construction was
completed on schedule in late 1978. Supervision of construction was carried
out by a local consultant whose performance was satisfactory.



- 12 -
Development of Labor Intensive Technologies
3.27      In 1975 the Government requested the Bank's assistance in implement-
ing a feeder roads demonstration project utilizing labor-intensive construction
techniques. Although this item was not included in the original project, the
Government requested, and the Bank agreed, that US$200,000 of the "surplus"
loan funds (para 3.04) be allocated to this effort; this amount was matched
by the Bank from its research funds. Work started in April 1976 with assis-
tance by a two-man consultant team and a new unit was created within SECOPT
to manage the program.
3.28      The program has progressed well and Bank support and assistance was
extended via a special allocation of US$1.0 million from savings in construc-
tion costs realized under the Seventh Highway Project. For further details
reference is made to a report issued by the Bank's Transportation Department
entitled "The Study of Labor and Capital Substitution in Civil Engineering
Construction" dated September 1978.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison between appraisal and final cost estimates (including
contingencies) is shown in Annex 3. The final cost of original project items
will be about US$19.2 million, some US$4.5 million (19%) less than the
appraisal estimate, including normal contingency allowances. As explained
in preceding paragraphs, all remaining loan funds, including the special
contingency allowance, were used for emergency damage repairs or for new
and/or increased project elements. The original disbursement percentages were
retained throughout implementation and, therefore, the Bank's participation
in the total project was the 73% estimated at appraisal.
4.02      Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates as shown in the
following table. The initial lag was caused by Government's decision to
undertake a thorough revision of the engineering and cost estimates for the
Tegucigalpa-Talanga road which delayed commencement of project works for about
one year. Decisions on use of the special contingency and "surplus" funds
resulting from the initial low bid were not taken until later in the implemen-
tation period which also contributed to disbursement delays.

V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Performance of the Economy
5.01      During the period 1967-1976, the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of Honduras grew at a slow annual rate of 3.5%. The economic situation
improved after 1976 and the real GDP increased by about 7.6% per year. The
rate of inflation averaged 8% between 1973 and 1976.

1976-78.
Plan Maestro Vial de Honduras, December 1977.
Construction of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga Road
5.02      The traffic evolution along the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road reflects
the general economic trend. Traffic growth on the old road was significantly
lower than expected during the economic recession from 1972 to 1976 but opening
of the new road in 1977, coinciding with the economic boom, generated increased
traffic. As a result, the ADT in 1977 was 10% higher than estimated at appraisal
(Annex 4). Marked changes in the composition of traffic also occurred between
1973 and 1978: light vehicles, buses and light trucks increased their share
of traffic compared to heavy trucks.
5.03      The appraisal economic rate of return (ERR) resulting from a probability
analysis, amounted to 13%. The major benefits were vehicle operating costs
and time savings, the latter representing 14% of total benefits. A SECOPT
study in 1979 yielded a revised ERR of 13.6% by considering:    (a) the final



- 15 -
construction and supervision costs, which were lower than expected; (b) the
actual traffic; (c) the traffic growth rates predicted in the Appraisal Report;
(d) the vehicle speeds measured on the new road, which are higher than expected;
and (e) lower vehicle operating costs savings than estimated because of the
change in the composition of the vehicle fleet (Annex 4). Time savings were
not included as a benefit in SECOPT's study. Consideration of these savings
would have given an even higher rate of return. This shows that the investment
was well justified (Annex 5).
Improvement of Secondary and Feeder Roads
5.04      The Appraisal Report considered a traffic growth rate of 5% p.a.
for these roads. Recent counts show that, on the average, traffic has grown
at higher rates (about 12% p.a.). For the 1978-1980 period, the 12% rate
was adopted consisting of a 5% rate of growth for normal traffic with the
remainder composed of induced traffic. Between 1981 and 1985, no induced
traffic is assumed and normal traffic is projected to grow at 5% p.a. similar
to the appraisal forecast.
5.05      The revised ERRs were computed using vehicle operating cost savings
calculated by SECOPT in December 1978. Following a conservative approach,
no time value for passengers and freight was taken into account and the
vehicle composition used was that obtained from the latest two day manual
traffic counts. The resulting revised ERRs for the feeder roads averaged
about 26% indicating that, on an aggregated basis, investments in feeder roads
were sound. Should the value of time savings and/or residual value been
considered, the ERR would be higher.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      The performance of the Borrower was mixed but, under the circum-
stances, can be rated as generally satisfactory.
6.02      One of the main causes for occasional less than satisfactory perfor-
mance by SECOPT was a chronic shortage of qualified technical personnel and
frequent changes in staff assignments. Low salary scales is the underlying
cause and effort to focus Government's attention on the problem is being made
under the ongoing Seventh Highway Project where a covenant requires furnishing
the Bank a detailed program of actions proposed to recruit and retain qualified
key personnel. The program was prepared in late 1979, but the government has
not yet acted upon it. As an interim measure SECOPT was allowed to strengthen
its capability by contracting advisors at higher than civil service salary scale.

6.03      There were frequent delays by the Borrower in processing payments
to contractors and consultants. These resulted from the Borrower's overly
complex procedures and documentation, particularly in the Ministry of Finance.
Efforts to improve the situation are being made under the Seventh Highway
Project where an "Executing Unit" has been established in SECOPT to streamline
and expedite this and other aspects of project implementation.
6.04      The Borrowers compliance with the major loan covenants was good
except for road maintenance. Following are the major covenants and the
Borrower's efforts to comply.
6.05      "Section 3.01(b)   Without limitation upon the foregoing, the Borrower
shall: (i) improve or cause the Municipalidad de Tegucigalpa to improve, in
a manner satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, about 800 meters of a
suburban avenue to provide the road included in Part A of the Project with
access to and from the streets of Tegucigalpa and to complete such improvement
prior to, or concurrently with, Part A of the Project; and (ii) not start
execution of Parts B and C of the Project, except as the Borrower and the
Bank shall otherwise agree, before furnishing to the Bank evidence satisfactory
to the Bank, based upon detailed engineering studies therefore, that the
carrying out of such Parts is technically feasible and economically justified."
The avenue designated in Item (i) was improved to four-lane
standards in mid-1975, about 1-1/2 years before the Tegucigalpa-
Talanga road was completed. The Borrower complied fully with
Item (ii) and all information needed to establish feasibility
of the proposed roads was furnished the Bank (para 3.08).
6.06      "Section 4.03(a)   The Borrower shall:  (i) cause all national roads
of the Borrower to be adequately maintained and cause all necessary repairs
thereof to be made, all in accordance with sound engineering practices;
(ii) cause all road maintenance equipment and workshops of the Borrower to be
adequately maintained and cause all necessary repairs and renewals thereof to
be made, all in accordance with sound engineering practices; and (iii) provide,
promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources
required for the foregoing." Item (iii) was the subject of a Supplemental
Letter dated May 30, 1973, which specified annual amounts to be budgeted for
road maintenance during 1974 and 1975.
Compliance with Items (i) and (ii) was not entirely satisfactory
due mainly to shortages of equipment and inadequate maintenance
of what equipment was available. As the loan did not provide
financing for equipment or workshop improvements, the Bank was
unable to exercise much leverage for improvement. However, the
ongoing Seventh Highway Project includes equipment financing
which is helping improve the situation. As for Item (iii), the
yearly allocations for maintenance have exceeded the amounts
specified in the Supplemental Letter.



- 17 -
6.07      "Section 4.03(b)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Borrower shall take all necessary action to: (i) cause the dimensions
and weight of the vehicles using the national roads of the Borrower to be kept
within the limits provided by the laws and regulations of the Borrower;
(ii) ensure permanent and consistent enforcement of the Borrower's laws and
regulations governing inter alia the dimensions and weight of vehicles; and
(iii) exchange views with the Bank on any proposal to amend or supplement such
laws and regulations."
The Borrower has complied satisfactorily with this covenant.
Thirteen permanent weighing stations have been established and
regulations on vehicle weight and dimensions are being enforced
(para. 3.24).
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank contributed significantly to project identification and
preparation by inclusion of feasibility studies under the preceding Fifth
Highway Project and by participation in review of subsequent designs and
studies which were financed by others. The project's scope and size were
appropriate for SECOPT's capacity although shortages of key technical staff
were a problem throughout implementation. The original implementation schedule
was reasonable but unexpected major changes in project scope required several
extensions of the closing date.
7.02      The institution building aspects were well chosen and have resulted
in some important improvements in road maintenance operations and transport
planning. In spite of some staffing problems, the Government actively supported
and participated in these efforts and assistance in these and other areas is
being continued under the Seventh Highway Project. At the Bank's suggestion,
SECOPT encouraged and received much greater participation of local consultants
under this project than in the past. Eight local firms either working alone
or in association with foreign firms, were engaged for construction supervision
or for feasibility or engineering studies; in the past such services were
provided solely by foreign firms.
7.03      There were 14 supervision missions during the approximately six-year
implementation period. The type and timing of these missions was appropriate
in view of the several changes in project scope effected during implementation.
The working relationship between the Borrower and the Bank was good throughout
the project and this resulted in no small degree from the Bank's willingness
to consider use of "surplus" loan funds for new and/or revised project elements
and the Bank's quick response to Government's request to use the special
contingency allowance for hurricane damage repairs.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project was successful and met its main objectives of upgrading
the highest priority section of the Tegucigalpa-Juticalpa road and feeder
roads and improving SECOPT's planning and road maintenance capacity. The
advances made are being consolidated and extended under the follow-up Seventh
Highway Project, although the main problem encountered in project imple-
mentation, shortage of key local staff, still persists. Through a fortunate
set of circumstances, loan funds were available to help repair roads and
bridges damaged during a 1974 hurricane and to participate in reconstruction
of an additional secondary road.
8.02      There are no particular lessons to be learned from this project
except possibly to emphasize the importance of the Bank's maintaining a
flexible and cooperative attitude toward changes in project elements resulting
from significantly changed circumstances.
