expenditures declined by about 62 percent from 1993 to 2000. In 1999 alone, the health budget
was reduced by 35 percent. From 1996 to 2000, budgetary resources available for health care
declined to about US$10 per capita per year. Out-of-pocket spending increased to complement
the decline of public health expenditures, raising the total health expenditures to around US$20
per capita per year in 2000.

Moldova inherited an excessive network of health facilities, which was very costly to maintain. In
1998, there were about 6.42 hospitals, 1,123 hospital beds and about 363 physicians per 100,000
population compared to EU average of 3.27 hospitals, 659.6 hospital beds and 299.5 physicians
per 100,000 population. The distribution of heath care resources was highly skewed towards the
large tertiary level hospitals, the regional hospitals and the hospitals in other sectors, which
consumed over 70 percent of all health spending.

The very low level of public expenditures, coupled with enormous and unnecessary infrastructure,
had led to a situation where most resources were spent on utilities, salaries and arrears. There was
little money available to maintain or strengthen the essential preventive care, emergency care, and
the provision of essential pharmaceuticals. As a result, the health system offered poor quality
services because of limited resources and out-dated practices. Evidence-based protocols of care
for such problems as tuberculosis, sexually-transmitted diseases, AIDS, hypertension, diabetes,
and mental diseases were not in use. Even if those protocols were in use, in most cases
pharmaceuticals would not be available or would be too expensive for patients to be able to afford
them.

Moldova's health status had markedly declined from 1990 to 2000. Life expectancy had
decreased from 68.64 years in 1990 to 67.75 years in 2000, and the incidence of some infectious
diseases had gone up, especially the incidence of TB and HIV/AIDS. In the late 1990s, the
incidence of TB in Moldova increased dramatically, especially in prisons (more than 300 new
cases/year). The number of cases of HIV/AIDs was relatively low in Moldova (408 cases in
1998), but it had increased tenfold in just two years. This poor health status was due to the
deterioration of the economic situation, and the consequent deterioration of the social and
physical environment; to lifestyle characterized by poor diet and high consumption of alcohol and
smoking; and to the deterioration of the health services. For those members of the population that
could not pay for health services, both at primary care level and for hospital services, the
deterioration of the health system had resulted in deepening poverty and substantial decline in the
quality of life.

A comprehensive and complex health care reform was needed. In the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) of January 1999, the Bank and the Government identified the critical need to
reverse the ongoing decline in health indicators and gave high priority to health reform. The
Government and the Bank agreed on a comprehensive program of health sector reform and much
of the policy content of the health reform program would be pursued under a Public Sector



                                                  1

Reform Adjustment operation (PSRC). However, given the severe circumstance of the health
sector, the Bank continued working with the Government on the design of the HIF project.
Moldova would benefit from both the financial and technical assistance that the World Bank
could provide, especially with World Bank's capacity to assist the government with the design
and implementation of a nationwide project focusing on most important health sector issues.



1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Health Investment Fund (HIF) project aimed to improve the health status of the Moldovan
population, and to increase the quality and efficiency of the public health sector, by improving
access to essential services for the poor. The project also included support for strategic work,
aiming at controlling the TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics.

Specific objectives of the project were: (i) guarantee universal access to a minimum package of
health services; (ii) modernize emergency services and primary health care; (iii) reduce excess
capacity in the health sector; (iv) strengthen health sector institutional capacity; and (v) support
the development of TB and AIDS Strategies.

Project objectives were to be measured by the following key indicators, as presented in the main
text of the PAD.1

    (i)      At least 75 percent of the funds disbursed as follows: from the first tranche by
             December 2001; from the second tranche by December 2003; and from the third
             tranche by December 2005;
    (ii)     At least 75 percent of general practice centers (270) operating in the country and
             providing the basic package of PHC by the end of the project;
    (iii)    Approval by Government of health sector restructuring plan by December 2001, and
             timely execution according to time-bound action plan;
    (iv)     Health services capacity limited to 1 general practitioner/1,500 population;
    (v)      At least 750 physicians and 1,500 nurses initiate training in general practice by the
             end of the project;
    (vi)     At least 20 senior staff from the Ministry of Health and Judet Health Authorities are
             trained in health management by the end of the project;
    (vii)    Clinical protocols for perinatal and obstetric care, integrated management of
             childhood illnesses (IMCI), STIs, TB, diabetes, hypertension, and breast and cervical
             cancer, developed and in use by training programs and general practice centers, by
             December 2001;
    (viii)   Increased access of population, especially youth, to upgraded services, as compared
             with baseline results;
    (ix)     Improved user satisfaction at those facilities supported by the project, as compared
             with baseline results;




1 The indicators listed in the result framework were based on the indicators listed in Annex1 in the PAD.
Annex1 listed 18 outcome indicators and 13 output indicators. 18 outcome indicators include all 10
performance indicators. Since 11 output indicators were virtually the same as the outcome indicators, only
two output indicators were listed in the result framework.




                                                     2

    (x)      Approval by the Government of updated TB and HIV/Strategies developed with
             project support, and in close cooperation with the WHO and UNAIDS, by December
             2001.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project objectives and key indicators were not revised during the implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The main beneficiaries as defined in the PAD were the entire population of Moldova. The poor,
women and children were expected to particularly benefit from the increased access to the basic
package of care, and from the adoption of new quality standards in emergency care, primary and
secondary health care.

Other individuals/institutions that were expected to benefit from the project (though not explicitly
identified in the PAD) included staff from MOH and Health Insurance Company, physicians,
nurses, and hospital management teams who participated in the trainings. In addition,
beneficiaries included family centers that received medical equipment and/or refurbishment from
the HIF, hospitals which received surgery and emergency care equipment and/or ambulances.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The HIF had three components with a total cost of US$20 Million.

Component I ­ Policy Development and Institutional Strengthening of MOH (US$1.67
million total estimated project cost) aimed at assisting the Government in the development of
health policies and providing support to the MOHSP through financing the development of health
reform strategy, key policy and respective legislation. This component had three sub-components.
The first was health policy development, supporting the development of the legal framework for
the health sector reform, including (i) health care financing (sources and resource allocation); (ii)
basic package of health care services; (iii) provider-payer split; (iv) user charges; (v) human
resources; and (vi) TB and AIDS strategies. The second sub-component was Communication of
Health Sector Reform, financing public communication campaigns to inform stakeholders about
the sector reforms. The third sub-component was Management and Technical Training
Program, including (i) training of physicians, nurses and other staff associated with the provision
of the basic package of health care; and (ii) training of managers at Central, Judet and health care
facility levels.

Component II ­ Health Investment Fund (US$17.72 million total estimated project cost) aimed
to establish the HIF, with the primary aim to sponsor changes through demonstration of
improvements in access, quality and efficiency of health services at all levels of the system. This
component was to mainly finance regional restructuring proposals, including the development of
emergency services and development of primary health care based on general practitioners
(physicians and nurses). This component had two sub-components. The first sub-component was
Emergency and Primary Health Care, to provide funding on a competitive basis to the



                                                  3

Municipality of Chisinau and Judets for primary health care and emergency services. The second
sub-component was Hospital Refurbishment, to make limited investments on key hospital
refurbishments up to US$300,000 per facility.

Component III ­ Project Management and Evaluation (US $0.61 million total estimated
project cost) financed project management, including procurement and financial management and
project evaluations. This component had two sub-components. The first one was Project
Management, which was to support the establishment and operation of a project coordination
unit. The second was Project Evaluation, aimed to provide financing for monitoring and
evaluation at different stage of the projects.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

The closing date was extended twice. The first extension was from November 30th, 2005 to
August 30th, 2006 mainly due to initial delay by one year on Credit effectiveness caused by
elections. The second extension was granted from August 30th to December 30th 2006, to ensure
effective completion of activities that were being financed with additional funding which had
become available because of currency fluctuations between the SDR and the US$.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

There was no formal quality at entry review. However, based on the review at the ICR stage, the
Quality at Entry was satisfactory based on the following facts:

During the project preparation, the team analyzed the country and sector's background, the need
for the project, lessons learned from other ECA countries and related projects in Moldova
financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (including completed, ongoing and
planned projects). The team also analyzed the adequacy of borrower's commitment and
ownership of the project. In addition, the team identified specific risks associated with the
operation and further defined risk mitigation measures.

The design of the project was consistent with the development objectives and the need of the
population and government. A participatory approach had been pursued with beneficiaries and
other stakeholders, including consultation with patients, professionals, health organizations, local
and international organizations and partnerships with the Municipality of Chisinau and the
(former) Central Judet Health Authority. Other alternative designs were identified and briefly
analyzed but were rejected for various reasons. These designs included pilot project (rejected
because of the overall collapse of the health care system at that time), infrastructure downsizing
without investing in emergency services and primary health care (rejected because of the possible
negative impact on population health), and investment in emergency services and primary care
without downsizing (rejected because of consequent financial burden to the health system). The



                                                4

design of the project was innovative as it supported the establishment of the Health Investment
Fund to create a competitive mechanism to allocate resources among the Municipality of
Chisinau and Judet Health Authorities and, to a lesser extent, hospitals. The HIF was also
designed to be disbursed in three phases and each phase was associated with a set of triggers that
were linked to the national health policy reform. This facilitated implementation of the national
health policy reform. There were some weaknesses in the M&E design, which is discussed in
detail in section 2.3.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

The project was the first health sector project supported by the World Bank in Moldova. It
comprised an ambitious reform package that was implemented well in a challenging environment.
Despite numerous government reshuffles, including 4 different ministers of health and the merger
of health and social protection under one ministry, the commitment by the government was
maintained through the entire implementation period.

As noted earlier, the project had an initial delay as a result of late credit effectiveness (11 months
after Board approval). However, after the project was effective, its implementation progressed
well and Moldova made considerable progress in healthcare reform. Despite good project
performance, which was supported by strong guidance from the Bank team in the context of a
challenging environment, the Quality Assurance Group rated supervision as moderately
satisfactory. Two main comments were: (1) a part of the project objective was to improve access
to essential services for the poor, but this objective was not attained and the team failed to pay
sufficient attention to it; (2) the M&E framework contained too many indicators and was not
amended during project supervision. The ICR mission, however, found that the access by the
poor was improved based on the following statistics. A representative population survey (2005)
found that in the second year of the health reform, 30 percent of the rural population (having
more poor than the urban population) considered that access to health services had increased, as
compared to 18.4 percent of urban residents; increased access was mainly mentioned by people
over 55 years, people in the age of needing health care more frequently. These achievements were,
at least partly related to the Bank team's efforts to increase the awareness and commitment of the
government to expand health insurance coverage through policy dialogue, Aide-Memories,
management letters, and more extensive analysis of health insurance coverage in the Moldova
Health Policy Note. From the supply side: (i) civil works were undertaken in 100 health centers,
which were mostly in rural areas; (ii) 100 percent of GPs were provided with portable medical
equipment kits; (iii) lab equipment for PHC were provided in all raions, covering 85 percent of all
PHC facilities; (iv) ambulances were procured and distributed to raion hospitals and the Chisinau
municipality. QAG argued that "relatively little attention appeared to have been paid to the issues
of access to health services by the poor except for the dialogue on health insurance". But in fact,
health insurance is the most important instrument to increase access for the poor from the demand
side. Regarding the second comment, the ICR agrees that the M&E framework had too many
indicators and no action was taken during supervision to improve the M&E framework. Detailed
evaluation regarding M&E is discussed in section 2.3.

During the mid-term review (January 15-30, 2004), several risk factors were identified regarding
the health insurance financial sustainability: (i) Financial risk. A large share of health insurance
funds was from the State budget to cover the segment of the population unable to contribute to
the health insurance; (ii) Administrative risk. The legal independence of the HIC was a necessary


                                                  5

condition for the HIC to properly function as a health services contracting and purchasing agency;
(iii) Political risk. The success of HIC needed the commitment of the government to support and
sustain the HIC. To address these risks, the Moldovan government, with the consultation of
technical experts, established clear rules regarding the legal status, fiduciary management,
reporting requirement, oversight and auditing of the HIC. The State budget allocation for those
who could not contribute to the health insurance through payroll taxes has been sustained for the
past three years and there are no foreseen risks of inadequate allocation in coming years.

The Mid-term review identified another risk factor related to the primary healthcare sector due to
administrative changes in the healthcare organizational system in Moldova following law
123/2003. Under this structure, PHCs no longer operated as separate legal entities and the Chief
Doctor at the Raion Hospital was responsible for the budget to the PHCs. Following successful
dialogue on this issue by the Bank team with the Government, MOH agreed to ensure adequate
budget allocation to the PHCs by requiring hospitals to provide sub-accounts for the PHCs. Chief
doctors were required to comply with MOH budgeting norms to allocate 35 percent of resources
to PHC, 15 percent to emergency services, and 50 percent for hospital services.

One facilitating factor that is noteworthy is that when the government decided to implement the
national health insurance policy, the Bank team was able to quickly mobilize a PHRD grant to
help its implementation, including financing services of a health insurance expert who provided
long-term advice to the HIC, MOH and MOF. In addition, the Bank team worked closely with
WHO experts to guide implementation of health financing reforms.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The PAD has a very detailed list of indicators and these were monitored in the course of
implementation. Most indicators provide a good indication of the progress of the project as listed
in the results framework in the datasheet. However, in terms of the design of M&E framework,
the project set up ten key performance indicators in the main text of the PAD and 18 outcomes
indicators and 13 output indicators in Annex1. Some shortcomings can be noted: (i) There was
repetition among the indicators as 11 output indicators were virtually the same as some of the
outcome indicators; (ii) One of the key performance indicators was "increased access of
population, especially youth, to upgraded services", which is not clear enough to be measurable;
(iii) some indicators were not collected property, such as "referral to secondary and tertiary care
limited to 20 percent". Despite these weaknesses, the Bank team had not revised the M&E
framework during the course of supervision.

In terms of project monitoring, the project supported and strengthened the work of the Center of
Public Health and Management (the Center) to collect data on a broad range of indicators,
including the key performance indicators, and to analyze the data. The Center sent the data to the
PCU and the PCU then sent the monitoring and progress reports to the World Bank on a quarterly
basis. The Center collected data from the raion level. The head of the Center was well trained and
the process of data-collection was reasonable. Status of implementation of key monitoring
indicators (as defined in the PAD) was reviewed systematically and reported upon after each
supervision mission and included in the supervision package.

There is high likelihood of sustainability of M&E arrangements. Over the course of the project,
the capacity of the Center had been improved. The MOH involved the Center in almost every
meeting in the preparation and pre-appraisal meetings for the new Health Services and Social
Assistance Project, demonstrating that the high level decision makers rely more on data in policy
and decision-making process.


                                                 6

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

During implementation, there was full safeguard and fiduciary compliance. No adverse
environmental impacts were associated with the rehabilitation of the health facilities supported
under the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The government developed the 2004-2006 Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (EGPRSP). EGPRSP includes one program targeting health care services rendered through
the mandatory health insurance system. Reform actions were specified including consolidation of
healthcare staff capacity at the national and regional level, development of an M&E system to
track outcomes, and ensuring the transparency of management of the National Health Insurance
Company's management. To support implementation of the government's strong vision to
continue strengthening the health care system in Moldova, World Bank team has worked with
MOH on design of a new project "Health Services and Social Assistance", which is scheduled to
be presented to the WB Board in June, 2007. The proposed project has two health-related
components. The first deals with further strengthening of the primary health care system and the
second with hospitals restructuring.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objective, design and implementation of HIF remained relevant and consistent with
Moldova's current development priorities in the health sector and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals. The achieved outcomes are consistent with the
Government's strategy of strengthening the primary health care network, improving resource
allocation, restructuring health provider networks and developing the institutional capacity at
different levels to better meet population health needs and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the health delivery system. They also reflect the critical need identified in the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (2004) to continue the healthcare reform in the direction to
remove excessive health infrastructure, strengthening primary health care, increase access to
essential health services, especially the poor. The development objectives are consistent with the
Millennium Development Goals in the health sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The project has achieved its development objectives in a satisfactory way as demonstrated
through the accomplishment of most targets set out in outcome and output indicators in the results
framework. There are five specific project objectives, which are discussed in detail with a couple
of applicable indicators.



                                                 7

(i) Guarantee universal access to a minimum package of health services:

This objective was achieved in a satisfactory way. Legislation was passed to guarantee universal
access to a minimum package of health services, and patients do not have to pay user fees for the
services covered in the package. Communication activities supported by the project helped
increase public awareness and understanding of the scheme of health insurance.

PDO indicators:

Legislation defining a minimum package of health services. This indicator was fulfilled in a
satisfactory way. Health Insurance was launched nationwide on January 1st 2004 and covered
service package was expanded in 2005 and 2006. The fundamental structure of the financing
system, based on national pooling of funds financed from both payroll taxes and general revenues
and managed by the HIC, had gone generally well. With the help from the project, the
Government approved the basic package, called "Unique program", stipulating the medical
services provided to the insured free of charge. The list of medical services provided to the non-
insured included: services provided under National Programs, life endangering emergencies and
primary care provided by FD, including clinical examination and referrals to the secondary and
tertiary care for further investigations and treatment.

Patients do not pay fees for services included in the basic health package. This indicator was
fulfilled in a satisfactory way. Patients do not have to pay fees for services included in the basic
health benefit package.

(ii) Modernize emergency services and primary health care:

This objective was achieved in a satisfactory way. HIF helped financing refurbishment of 100
Primary Health Centers across the country. The project financed the training of 748 physicians,
about 1500 nurses and 300 health managers. Under the project, 2089 portable kits were procured
and distributed to all family doctors. The condition of primary health centers were improved by
procurement and distribution of medical and laboratory equipments. The number of family
doctors increased from 1285 in 1998 to 2096 in 2004, which was from 2951 population per 1
family doctor ratio in 1998 to 1713 population per 1 family doctor. Anecdotal evidences show
that the increase in the number of family doctors was partly due to the improved working
conditions funded by the HIF project. The emergency care was strengthened by procurement and
distribution of 75 ambulances and 5 sets of communication and informational systems and other
necessary medical equipments. The investment increased the quality of health care services.

PDO indicators:

At least 750 physicians and 1500 nurses initiate training in by the end of the project. This
indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. 750 physicians and 1500 nurses were trained by the
end of the project. The training of family doctors and nurses by the University of Medicine and
Pharmaceutics "N. Testimitanu" contracted by the PCU was launched in 2003. The trainees were
mainly from medical facilities that benefited from HIF investments in medical equipment and
civil works. The main purpose of the course was to upgrade the skills of PHC medical staff
through: (i) unification of specialists' knowledge of PHC; (ii) training of family doctors and
nurses in the early diagnostics and rational treatment of the most frequent and important diseases
in Moldova; (iii) training in the use of medical equipment delivered under the HIF project, and
upgrading practical skills; (iv) promotion of team work among PHC staffs; (v) promotion of PHC
staff' collaboration with specialists from hospital sector by stressing the limits of competence and


                                                  8

criteria for patients' referral to specialized and/or hospital care; (vi) promotion of holistic
approach to the patient and to the practice based on the principles of family practice and nursing.

All the trainees had been subjected to a pre- and post-training testing on practical skills and
theoretical knowledge. According to the test results, the course contributed to a 225 percent
improvement of the FDs' theoretical skills and to 66 percent improvement of their practical skills.
Evaluation of course's effectiveness for nurses showed 107 percent improvement in theoretical
skills and 53 percent improvement in practical skills of the trainees.

Clinical protocols for perinatal and obstetric care, integrated management of childhood, illness
(IMCI), STIs, TB, Diabetes, hypertension, and breast and cervical cancer, developed and in use
by training programs, by December 2001. This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately
satisfactory way. One of the major requirements to improve the quality of medical care was the
development and use of standard approaches to medical interventions and introduction of
evidence-based clinical guidelines/treatment protocols. In this context development of standard
clinical protocols was identified by MoHSP as one of the priority issues to be addressed by the
project. Evidence-based guidelines and standard treatment protocols were developed with support
of UNICEF and WHO and introduced in the training curricula. The protocols included: antenatal
care, delivery, newborn and post-partum care, immunization, Tuberculosis, care of children under
5 etc. Development of protocols and standards was a continuous process. By June 30, 2006, 11
guidelines in 10 disease areas and 17 protocols in 5 disease areas had been developed by expert
groups. Many other protocols and guidelines were in various stages of development.

(iii) Reduce excess capacity in the health sector:

The objective was achieved in a satisfactory way. Many rural hospitals with the capacity of 50 to
100 beds were closed or converted to primary health centers. Chisinau Municipal Children
Hospital No. 2 was closed. Chisinau Narcological Dispensary was merged with the Republic
Narcological Dispensary and more than 200 ancillary facilities were closed. The number of
hospitals decreased from 276 in 1998 to 116 in 2005, that is, 6.42 hospitals per 100,000
population in 1998 to 3.23 hospitals per 100,000 population in 2005. The number of hospital beds
was reduced from 48,261 in 1998 to 22,961 in 2005, which was 112.3 bed/10,000 population in
1998 to 63.9 bed/10,000 population in 20052. The number of acute hospital beds was reduced
from 62.8 per 10,000 population in 2000 to 56.8 per 10,000 population in 2005. The closure or
merging of hospitals increases the efficiency of the health care delivery in Moldova as evidence
shows that more care is provided at the primary health care level instead of secondary or tertiary
level.

PDO indicator:

Ten percent reduction in number of acute hospital beds per 10 000 population. This indicator was
fulfilled in a satisfactory way. The number of acute hospital beds per 10,000 population was 62.8
in 2000, and reduced by 10 percent to 56.8 per 10,000 population in 2005.

(iv) Strengthen health sector institutional capacity:

This objective was achieved in a satisfactory way. The capacity of MOH in designing and leading
national policies was improved, as shown in the vision and commitment of the government in the
movement of strengthening primary health care and reducing excessive health infrastructure. The
staff members of the MOH expressed that they had learned a lot by working with the World Bank
and other donors, such as procurement and M&E. The trainings of physicians, nurses and health
managers, the strengthening of health information systems in the HIC, the equipping of medical
and laboratory equipment at different levels of health institutions improved the capacity of the
health sector.

The project also supported the MOH to have a Health System Optimization Plan. The objective of
the plan was to optimize the use of resources and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
hospital services in Chisinau, by evaluating the secondary and tertiary care facilities in Chisinau
Municipality, identifying the gaps and developing a detailed time-based implementation strategy
for each of the actions outlined. The project also supported the MOH to have a Human Resource
Plan with the objective to restructure the human resources in the sector and to optimize the use of
resources. Finally, the project supported MOH to have an Architectural and Engineering
Assessments of physical changes needed for hospital consolidation and restructuring to prepare
for further hospital consolidation and the accompanying hospital equipment management plan to
match the architectural and engineering assessments of physical changes.

PDO indicator:

At least 20 senior staff from the MOH and Judet Health Authorities were trained in health
management. The indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. 300 senior staffs from
MOH and Judet Health Authorities were trained, which was critical as the implementation of the
health restructuring program required increased capacity of healthcare managers both within
health services delivery system and the MOH. The nationwide training of 300 health managers
was designed to upgrade the trainees' management capacities, especially in the context of the
implementation of health insurance. The training curricula included a variety of aspects of health
management, including general management, strategic planning, health economics and financial
management, and quality control. The trainees came with different background: 49 percent of the
trainees were from primary care, 31 percent from hospital care, 4 percent from emergency care
services and 16 percent from preventive medicine.

(v) Support the development of TB and AIDS Strategies:

This objective was achieved in a satisfactory way. TB and AIDS Strategies were developed and
approved in June 2001. The implementation had started under several grants arranged with Bank
assistance including GFATM grant of US$5.2 million for TB/AIDS; SIDA/Sweden Grant of
US$0.5 million for TB/AIDS; US$0.1 million from US$10 million Dutch Grant under the HIF
project; and US$5.5 million IDA grant. New strategy for period 2006-2010 was approved in
September 2005.

PDO indicator:

Approval by the Government of updated TB and AIDS strategies by December 2001. This
indicator was achieved in a satisfactory way. TB/AIDS Strategy 2001-2005 was approved on
June 18, 2001. TB/AIDs Strategy 2006-2010 was approved on September 5, 2005.



                                                10

In summary, the project objectives were achieved. The project increased the quality of public
health sector by modernizing emergency services and primary health care, including civil works,
investment in medical equipments, training of family doctors, nurses and health care mangers.
The project improved the efficiency of health care services in terms of reducing excess capacity
in the health sector, especially in terms of number of hospitals and hospital beds. The program
also strengthened the primary health care centers, which provide more cost-effective care, as
proved by the international literature. The project improved access to essential services for the
poor by establishing the national health insurance scheme in which most vulnerable groups are
covered by the state and by guaranteeing access to a minimum package of health services. The
project also supported the strategic work aiming at controlling the TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

During project preparation, cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out. The results of the study
indicated a present value of net benefits, after investment and recurrent costs, of almost $10
million and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 39 percent. No overall IRR or net present value
calculations were carried out at the end of the project because the calculations rely too much on
assumptions, especially for indirect benefits. In addition, it is hard to attribute the indirect benefits
solely to the project. For example, analysis assumed that infant mortality would be reduced by 20
percent and the actual reduction in infant mortality rate (at national level) was 33 percent (from
18.54 per 1000 live birth in 1999 to 12.42 per 1000 live birth in 20053). However, the reduced
mortality rate is an outcome of many factors including investment in primary health care.

Nonetheless, it could be argued that the cost-effectiveness of the project is high. International
literature has documented the high cost-effectiveness of primary health care. Research shows that
the cost of delivering medical care, and especially preventive care, through primary health care is
low relative to care delivery through hospitals or through specialists. Research also shows that
health service delivery by primary care physicians is associated with low use of diagnostic tests,
less referrals to secondary services, and less prescriptions, relative to other models of service
delivery, all with no significant difference in patient satisfaction.4

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory

Given the high relevance of PDOs, the overall achievement of the PDOs, and the likely high cost-
effectiveness of the project, ICR rates the overall outcome as satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Access to health care by low income group was improved. More importantly, quality and
evidence-based services were rendered to the poor through the rehabilitation and provision of
equipment of health facilities in rural areas as outlined under section 3.2.

The communication activities supported through the project concentrated on informing the public
about the reform and focused on areas of interest such as access to services and health insurance.
Public opinion surveys (which are seldom carried out under projects) attest to the increased
consumer satisfaction for the improved services and the role that health insurance was playing in
the development of the sector.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Capacity building was at the core of the project. The numerous training activities supported
through the project to upgrade technical, clinical and management skills of physicians, nurses,
health managers and staffs of the MOH were instrumental not only in strengthening the
performance of the sector, particularly PHC, but also in raising the morale of health staff. The
project trained 748 physicians and about 1500 nurses in family medicine. It trained 300 health
managers (well above the original target). Training for the senior staff was conducted in and
outside the country. Several staff of the Ministry had the opportunity to attend international
conferences, to make contacts with counterparts in other countries and to be exposed to
international experiences with implementation of health reform in general and particularly health
insurance and hospital autonomy. Training was also provided for the development of clinical
protocols and guidelines. Providing technical assistance and training was greatly facilitated due to
an implementation PHRD to guide the early stages of implementation of health insurance.
Technical assistance and training was also provided in hospital restructuring, development of a
human resource strategy, etc.

A Moldova-based Flagship Course on health sector reform and sustainable financing was
conducted in Chisinau from June 28 to July 3, 2004. Forty health sector staff participated in the
training and got exposed to health sector reform experiences in Europe and Central Asia as well
as to the successful and unsuccessful experiences from countries in other regions. All these
trainings and courses broadened the knowledge of the senior staff and improved the capacity of
the MOH.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project has contributed to the development of an efficient procurement system in the MOH,
and especially the introduction of streamlined procedures for procuring medical equipment and
supplies. The project paid particular attention to communication activities. These activities helped
increase public awareness and generate positive attitudes for health reform and better
understanding of health insurance.

The PCU did an outstanding job in coordinating and implementing the HIF project (please see
details in section 5.2(b)).With the support from the Bank, the capacity of PCU had been built up



                                                  12

in the areas of procurement and financial management. The PCU had become the core
implementation agency not only for the HIF project, but also the IDA financed HIV/AIDS project,
Global Fund grant for HIV and TBC projects and Council of Europe Bank financed Blood
Security Project.



3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Beneficiary Surveys

HIF financed a Public Opinion Research, consisting of the design and implementation of a
research strategy to provide quantitative and qualitative data on public perceptions of the health
sector reform in Moldova. The research was designed to examine both existing state of public
opinion on the health care reform and how people would react to various messages concerning
the reform. The survey found that the level of population's awareness of the reform increased by
16 percent and the number of people acknowledging that improvements in Moldova's health
sector can only be achieved through implementation of a health reform increased by 13 percent.
For details on survey results see Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is rated moderate based on the following:

First, the sustainability of the achievement of the development objectives and further healthcare
reforms depend to a large extent on the ownership and capacity of MOH. The current MOH is
highly committed to the healthcare reform agenda and has been working with the World Bank
and other donors extensively. The possibility of change of the leadership and key senior staff in
the Ministry would hamper the healthcare reforms in terms of strengthening primary health care
networks and downsizing hospitals.

Second, the HIF project was successfully implemented by the PCU, which was physically outside
of the MOH and managed by a PCU director, who reported to the Minister. With the closure of
the project and following closure of the PCU, MOH has greater responsibility to sustain the
outcomes. The capacity of MOH has been improved during the project, but the capacity still
needs to be strengthened. Some factors are outside the control of the project, such as relatively
low salaries in the public sector, which makes it hard to attract and maintain highly competent
staff.

Third, the average age of family doctors in Moldova is around 50. With the aging of physicians
and limited supply of family doctors in rural areas, the primary care network may face a great
shortage of supply of doctors.

Fourth, currently primary care health centers are incorporated into the Raion health authority with
hospitals and have little financial autonomy, which raises the barriers for the primary health
centers to develop and to better serve patients.

However, some of the risk factors identified above can be mitigated by the follow-up project
(Health Services and Social Assistance Project), which is going to the Board by the end of this



                                                13

fiscal year. The objective of this project is to further support the Government's program to
increase equity in access to quality and efficient health and social assistance services for the
Moldovan population in line with the MTEF for 2007-09. Under the continuous dialogue between
the World Bank and the government, MOH officials are to be provided with further trainings and
capacity building. Primary health care network is going to be further strengthened by various
means.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality of entry is satisfactory based on: (i) the consistency of the
project objectives with the priorities identified by the Government, and the CAS (1999), in which
the Bank and the government identified the critical need to reverse the ongoing decline in health
indicators, and gave high priority to health reform; (ii) the adequacy of the project design given
the needs of the health sector at the time of the project preparation; (iii) conditions established for
the disbursement of the HIF to ensure adequate policy changes; (iv) the realism of needs
assumptions, implementation arrangements, system priorities which were in line with the
situation in the country; (v) A sound analysis of the project alternatives and the reasons for
rejection and consideration of potential risks and appropriate measures to mitigate them.

The overall project result framework could have been improved given the current standard.
However, the project has profited from the thorough preparation based on the solid understanding
of the main sector issues, the sound background analysis and careful and accomplishable project
design. Therefore, the quality at entry is rated as satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was closely supervised by a team of Bank specialists and consultants all through its
implementation. Supervision missions took place at least twice a year. Only one "virtual
supervision" was conducted through a video conference, while all other supervisions were
conducted in country including field visits to project sites. The Bank supervision team changed
leadership two times but there was overlapping between the former leadership and the new
leadership so the transition was smooth. The Bank closely monitored the progress of the project
and identified new issues and actions to be taken. The quality of the mid-term review was
satisfactory. Risks to meeting development objectives were identified and mitigation measures
were agreed upon and implemented. The Bank also used supervision opportunities to engage the
Government on health insurance issues, especially with the new Ministerial leadership due to the
changes in Government. The write-ups in ISRs and AMs were candid and clear. Each supervision
mission organized a workshop with the participation of management and staff of the MOH and
other central ministries as well as international partners such as WHO and UNICEF. Frequently,



                                                  14

the supervision team also participated in press conferences organized by MOH to inform the
media of progress under the project, including successes and challenges.

Despite numerous Government reshuffles, the Bank has enjoyed a trusting relationship with the
Government at all levels of the system because: (i) the team was always proactive and ready to
provide options to resolve complex issues as they arose, and (ii) the team ensured continuous
communication between the Borrower and the Bank before, during and in between missions. The
supervision team followed the original result framework and reported the indicators regularly.
But the supervision team could have done a better job by improving the M&E framework.
Considering the overall satisfactory performance of the Bank supervision team, especially in the
context of the country's circumstances, the ICR rates the quality of supervision as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank, to a large extent, ensured the quality at entry and supported the implementation
through appropriate supervision work. The Bank also ensured adequate transition arrangements,
including the writing of detailed handover notes to guide the new TTL. The result framework
could have been improved, but considering the overall performance, the ICR rates the Bank's
performance as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's performance in preparation and implementation is assessed as satisfactory.
There was close cooperation at the time of preparation between the Government and the Bank.
The government was actively engaged during project preparation and provided the necessary
political leadership and technical expertise. Despite the political changes, each Government
supported the objectives and implementation of the Project. Commitment and ownership by the
Government, especially the Ministry of Health was apparent at all stages of project despite
numerous government reshuffles.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Ministry of Health: Highly Satisfactory

The performance of the MOH is rated satisfactory due to political commitment and support
towards the preparation and implementation of the HIF project and the health sector reforms in
general. It is relevant to note that the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social Protection were
separate institutions at the appraisal stage, but merged during the last year of the project
implementation. The ministries have separated again since the credit closed.

The project was managed by the PCU. The PCU was established as a legal entity reporting to the
MOH and the MOF. The PCU developed a Project Operational Manual to ensure the quality of
the operation. In the course of implementation, the PCU involved hospitals and health care
centers to get their inputs about the conditions of facilities and the request for improvement. The
funds were then allocated to facilities based on need and priority and through competitive



                                                 15

procedures as part of the HIF operations. The PCU employed a key procurement specialist and a
financial management specialist, who had training abroad. Over the course of implementation, the
ministers changed 4 times, however, the continuity of the PCU ensured that there were no delays
in implementation. The PCU engaged the government in the project by consulting with the
Ministers, senior staffs and main specialists. In terms of monitoring and evaluation, the PCU
closely worked with the Center of Public Health and Management to get the key indicators and
sent the Bank progress reports. The PCU also hired an independent consultant to conduct the mid-
term evaluation and end-of-the-project evaluations. Given the overall performance of the PCU,
especially under the circumstances of leadership changes in the MOH and the World Bank Team,
the ICR rates the performance of the PCU highly satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

This project provides the following lessons:

First, the Bank team was able to mobilize financial resources to engage and leverage the
government to achieve the overall objectives. When the government initiated the national health
insurance policy, the Bank team was able to quickly mobilize a PHRD grant to help the
implementation of national insurance policy, which on the one hand facilitated the
implementation and on the other hand built more between the counterparts.

Second, the project design included disbursement triggers on the credit and grant. The triggers
were linked to the overall healthcare restructuring and reform objectives, which provided
relatively strong incentives to the government to pursue the overall objectives of the project.

Third, close coordination with development partners to ensure coherence and complementarities
of activities is critical. Establishing strong working relationship with development partners,
especially WHO and UNICEF, was key to ensuring coherent advice related to health financing
and clinical protocols.

Fourth, stakeholders' involvement throughout project implementation is crucial. Local
empowerment for planning and implementing locally developed plans to compete for HIF
funding resulted in greater ownership, commitment and transparency.

Fifth, communication, information dissemination, and capacity building played a significant role
in the successful implementation of any project and this project was no exception.

Sixth, a focus on identifying problems and seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative Bank-
client team is important for achieving results. The Bank team's role in creating an atmosphere of
trust and partnership was paramount for effective implementation and achieving the desired
results.

Seventh, other projects also benefited from the PCU established originally for the HIF project.
The HIF project enhanced the capacity of the PCU, especially in terms of procurement and



                                                16

financial management, which facilitated the management and coordination of other projects
financed by IDA and other international agencies.

Lastly, the indicators need to be measurable, reliable and reflect development objectives. There
should be a clear distinction between output indicators and outcome indicators. The specified
indicators need to be consistent across the PAD and ISRs. In addition, the project could benefit
from a focused impact evaluation design to provide more scientific evidence on to what extent
national policy and the improvement in primary health care centers made differences in access
and utilization of health services.5

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The summary of borrower's ICR is the executive summary from the Government's End-of-
Project evaluation. The evaluation raises a couple of issues that need to be emphasized. First,
there is a need for continued down-sizing and re-engineering in the public hospital sector. It is a
valid concern. Though the number of hospitals and number of hospital beds has been reduced to a
large extent during the project, most downsized or closed hospitals are in rural areas. Chisinau
Municipality is still considered with over-supply of hospitals and hospital beds. Further
downsizing is necessary in Chisinau municipality. At the same time of downsizing or closure of
some hospitals, up-grading the remaining hospitals are important as to provide quality of care.
The second issue is the concern of the sustainability of family doctors in the rural area given the
relatively low salaries paid to the family doctors in Moldova. This again is a valid concern.
Increasing the lifetime earnings prospects of physicians and nurses is urgent. More fundamentally,
steps will ultimately have to be made in the direction of financial autonomy and direct contracting,
which is reflected in the new Health Services and Social Assistance Project.

(b) Cofinanciers

The Cofinancier agrees ICR's findings of the project.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)




5  The project had a national policy change in 2004 with the implementation of the national health
insurance. There were variations in the primary health centers in terms of the extent of the refurbishment
and the equipping with medical devices. These exogenous variations could be exploited with pre-post
household level data collection to provide more scientific evidence on to what extent national policy and
the improvement in primary health care centers made differences in access and utilization of health services.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

During project preparation, cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out. The results of the study
indicated a present value of net benefits, after investment and recurrent costs, of almost US$10
million and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 39 percent. No overall IRR or net present value
calculations were carried out at the end of the project because the calculations rely too much on
assumptions, especially for indirect benefits. In addition, it is hard to attribute the indirect benefits
solely to the project.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

HIF financed a Public Opinion Research in 2002 and 2003, consisting of the design and
implementation of a research strategy with a view to providing quantitative and qualitative data
on public perceptions of the health sector reform in Moldova. The research was meant to examine
both existing state of public opinion and how people would react to various messages concerning
the reform. In particular, the research was expected to probe the general public as well as specific
target groups assessment of the existing situation in the health sector and their preparedness to
support various measures to be introduced under the HIF Project. The research included: (i)
conducting two nation wide surveys; (ii) conducting 9 focus groups sessions with various
stakeholders that are likely to develop distinct attitudes towards the reform.
The main findings of the research can be summarized as follows (comparative analysis of the 1st
and 2nd surveys):

    · The level of population's awareness of the reform increased by 16 percent.

    · The number of people acknowledging that improvements in Moldova's health sector can
        only be achieved through implementation of a health reform increased by 13 percent.

    · The quote of opponents to closure of small and inefficient hospitals decreased by 9
        percent.

    · Respondents had improved their opinions about the institution of family doctors. A large
        part of the surveyed residents (55 percent) had benefited from the services, which
        encouraged a positive opinion about this innovation.

    · Slight improvements with respect to the emergency service: fewer respondents (23
        percent) complained about the shortage of medications and instruments at emergency
        services.

    · The percentage of respondents who called for emergency assistance had decreased since
        the last survey (52 percent in 2002 and 45 percent in 2003).

    · Informal payments (including cash and in-kind) were offered to doctors as often as before
        (52 percent of respondents in both surveys), although the number of people who would
        prefer to pay only official charges had increased considerably (41 percent of respondents
        in 2002 and 51 percent of respondents in 2003).

    · There were fewer people (22 percent) who favored the reinstatement of the Soviet system.

    · An increasing number of people accepted the existence of various types of medical
        institutions, including the private ones. The population was getting used to the need to
        pay for certain medical services. The number of people who prefer to pay legal fees had
        increased by 10 percent.

Summary of Borrower's ICR

Background and objectives

The objective of the evaluation has been to consider three questions:

         · If the problem to be solved with the project still exists in the same terms as originally
             presented
         · If the impact on the beneficiaries and the environment have been relevant
         · If the programming execution of the process has been effective

In 1999 the situation in Moldova was dramatic. After almost 10 years of transition, health and
economic indicators were both poor and worsening. In the intervening period, great
improvements have been made although health status in the country is still poor (average life
expectancy 68), the economy is still weak and average income is still low (average
US$720/Capita), especially compared to EU countries.8 But life expectancy has stabilized and
great improvements have been made in terms of key indicators such as infant and mortality rates.

The current situation is therefore still difficult but more stable. Considerable long-term challenges
exist to improve the health status of the population but the situation is no longer one of crisis.

In terms of public health care enterprise(s), the HIF project provided a lifeline. Roughly
equivalent to the annual turnover of the MOH in 2000, the importance of the project to the
survival of public health care enterprise(s) cannot be underestimated. As the bulk of the
population, and certainly those in the rural areas, depend on publicly provided services for their
health and social care needs, the scope and ambition of the project was considerable.

The strategy of the project was to refocus the public health care (Shemashko) system from
specialist care, provided through a vast, degraded and unaffordable network of hospitals to
relatively more cost-effective General Practice and ambulatory care. While General Practice
(which came to be called `Family Medicine') is widely practiced and accepted in Western Europe,
and had been piloted in Moldova as early as 1993, it was still not recognized as a medical
specialty in Moldova in 2000. Family Medicine was seen as a viable means to provide universal
access to essential services.

Methodology and data collection

The approach taken was to develop a list of questions based on a matrix linking the project and its
activities to the background to and implementation of the health sector reform. The matrix

resulted in 7 groups of questions. The evaluation questions can also be clearly linked to the key
indicators as specified in the Project Appraisal Document.

The question matrix was used to guide data collection using both qualitative and quantitative
techniques and data sources. These guiding questions were further broken down or reformulated
where relevant in terms of evaluation method or stakeholder, data source.

During the evaluation, the team was faced with a number of challenges and risks:

    · The short period for the evaluation
    · Availability problems for some key stakeholders due to vacations and moves to new
         positions (particularly outside the country)
    · Despite these challenges the team managed to visit 10 of 35 Raions. Those interviewed
         were open and frank. Structured interviews were also held with more than 30 key
         stakeholders.

Project implementation

Family medicine is now an established concept in Moldova. The HIF project has played a key
role in this achievement. The project has renovated 100 of 430 need facilities, provided
equipment in 360 of these facilities, established retraining courses and facilities, and provided re-
training to 750 of approximately 2500 needed physicians, and 1500 nurses.

These achievements were realized despite 4 changes in Minister and a reorganization of public
administration from Judets (11) to Raions (35) that fundamentally changed the original planning
base for investments and led to considerable repetition in work and delays.

In terms of down sizing the hospital sector bed capacity reduced from 106 to 58 per 10,000
between 1998 and 2004. The major gains were made early in the project. The project aimed to
stimulate restructuring in the hospital sector by linking the availability of funds to invest in
primary care facilities to restructuring targets. Managerially, this `competitive mechanism' failed
to recognize that the upsides and downsides fell to different parties, and undermined its own
efforts to stimulate planning and project management capacity at peripheral levels by adjusting
the value of funding to investment projects planned by a coefficient linked to a score based
primarily on restructuring targets; with no consideration as to how this might have affected the
implementability of the original plan made. The need for continued down-sizing and
reengineering in the public hospital sector is well appreciated by Moldova and a second phase of
planning is underway. The focus now is re-engineering, i.e. not only down scaling but also up-
grading the remainder. External funding agencies might also consider how restructuring pain in
the hospitals market might also be alleviated in the hospital market to support a difficult
managerial process.

In the event, planning of investments became relatively informal, certainly in terms of
infrastructure projects, but the HIF Project management proved highly effective and flexible in
leveraging funding at local levels to maximize results on individual sites. A great success of the
project as an Investment Fund has been its ability to use available funding to leverage additional
finance for infrastructure ­ "if you pay for the cosmetic work I will pay for the roof" ­ while this



                                                  29

has happened somewhat informally, planning and contract formalisation (both at site and network
level) would certainly need to improve for bigger capital projects, it shows great potential. The
project limited itself to local public funding but a greater deal of finance is available in the private
sector and from doctors themselves. Ownership issues with respect to the assets would then arise,
and subsequently how public services might be contracted from public-private facilities but the
problems are not insurmountable and examples exist both within Moldova and Internationally.

Almost all stakeholders agree that there is no turning back from Family Medicine, but the path
has not always been smooth. Numerous trade-offs exist. The project itself illustrates how the
concept must compete with other needs and requirements. For example, US$4 million was spent
on ambulances that may have resulted in patients by-passing Family Medicine. Spent on Family
Medicine, for example, approximately 75 percent of facilities could have been upgraded and no
by-pass risk would have been created.

While the training courses have been well received retraining existing cadres in only 4 weeks to
take on an increasingly medical role, i.e. that of Family Medicine has limitations. The Medical
University itself is now carrying the baton forward through compulsory Continuous Medical
Education, but as the medical knowledge of Family Doctors deepens and widens this is likely to
have knock on effects for the social work these same people did and still do. Interviews and site
visits illustrated that while some Family Doctors feel comfortable with, for example, rectal touché,
others clearly do not, and have a strong preference for their community work and/or mid-
wife/pediatrics functions. The fact that Family Doctors have to fulfill all these functions is putting
them under an increasing strain of responsibilities; and associated administration. In rural areas
Family Doctors can be responsible for the social and medical needs of up to 6000 people.

Increasing responsibilities and poor terms of conditions are making Family Medicine, particularly
in rural areas, a very unattractive proposition for young doctors. The medium to long-term
sustainability of the achievements of the project are now threatened by a new problem, instead of
accelerating, the replacement of retrained older cadres with young and fully trained Family
Doctors is actually decelerating.

Project impact

The impact of the project went beyond its immediate activities. It is of course difficult to
precisely correlate project activities to policy and management changes in the public health care
sector but the financial size of the project relative to state budget would suggest, and stakeholder
interviews confirmed, that the project created strong incentives. The use of targets, linked to
disbursement to the project was the prime link. The targets related to:

Inputs and process: the level of funding and the organization of financing within the public
health care network.
Outputs: universal access to an essential services package.

A significant increase in public funding to public health care providers has been achieved.
Increased public funding, in part financed by an earmarked 4 percent payroll tax, under a
Compulsory National Health Insurance Scheme introduced on January 1, 2004. The introduction



                                                  30

of compulsory insurance under a national Health Insurance Company finally lead to a key
indicator level of 35 percent of public health care expenditure (not less that MDL 430 million)
being spent on primary care. The Medium Term Expenditure Framework would seem to indicate
that this increased level of funding to the public health sector is secure in the medium term.

The National Health Insurance Company provides cover to its beneficiaries for an essential
service package (programul unic). The essential package is also free at the point of use. While
registered coverage is not universal, the eligibility criteria for the non-formally employed mean
that key target groups amongst the young, mothers and the elderly are covered and access to
essential services amongst these groups has improved significantly.

The National Health Insurance Company estimated that approximately 25 percent of the
population, principally amongst the un- and informally employed, are uninsured. A challenge will
be to make insurance products which are attractive to these people. Indeed as private
predominantly out-of-pocket expenditure still accounts for a large, potentially even the bulk of
health care expenditures (but no reliable data exist), there is also the challenge of making health
insurance products which will be attractive to the formally employed. This might include
changing the scope of medical products and services covered under the programul unic.

The scope of the essential service package is subject to much discussion. While benefits could
always be increased it is clear that there will be trade-offs first between, for example, the ability
of the central government to raise a compulsory levy, the scope of the package and the level of
co-payment on the package. Benefits under the package are frequently seen as only relevant to
those who have no other choices.

Despite the tangible benefits of the free essential service package, particularly for vulnerable
groups, the price has been a growing pressure on providers and medical professionals. Doctors
particularly feel `unprotected'. Blame frequently focuses on the HIC. In the decade prior to
reform patients had grown used to paying out-of-pocket for services. The project financed an
intensive campaign around the free essential service package. As insured persons demanded these
rights, chaotic scenes in clinics and hospitals ensued.

If a number of critical targets under the project had been pursued falling (formal and informal)
incomes for physicians and other medical staff could have been compensated by increased
income as providers became financially independent and were directly contracted for services.
Unfortunately, while these goals may have been achieved de jure, de facto they were not
achieved. Instead at the beginning of 2004 primary and hospital providers were fused at a Raional
level to form integrated health care providers under unified Raion Chief Physician management.
Physicians and staff have remained salaried civil servants, and secondary incomes came under
pressure as patients demand free care.

The medium to long-term consequences of these events is now becoming clear. The medical
profession ­ and family medicine in rural areas in particular ­ is no longer a viable career option
for the highly educated people needed. The profession of Family Medicine in particular is in
danger of imploding and with it, in the medium to long-term, so will Family Medicine in
Moldova.



                                                  31

In principle the problem is not only financial. If, as officially stated is the case, each insured
person is worth a capitation fee of MDL.90 the average allocation to a Family Doctor under the
essential package is approximately MDL.140,000 for a list of 1,500 patients. Where is the money
going? On drugs? On maintaining still large infrastructure? The discussion cannot be de-linked
from that of transparent priority setting in the essential package.

After almost 15 years of constant change, reform exhaustion is apparent at all levels. A slogan
that kept emerging at all levels throughout the evaluation, however, was `we can't turn back, so
let's move forward'. The creation of the HIC, while much improvement is needed, creates an
institutional structure in which difficult choices can be made more managerial, than political. If
however the MOH is to move to a more coordinating role a primary challenge for the MOH will
be to free itself of the burden and potential conflict of interest in managing a large number of
(republican) facilities including the bulk of significant public hospitals (and, indirectly,
emergency services).

This brings us back to a number of key conclusions from the Health Investment Fund project
experience. Restructuring is as much a question of management as policy, particularly in a
national health care enterprise (or system/ network of). A basic textbook lesson in management is
to delegate/ equate authority with responsibility. Secondly, management motivation can be linked
to the goals you want to achieve. The HIF Project experience has demonstrated that there are
managers willing and able to mobilize and leverage additional funding if they feel they will profit
from the venture. The importance of the private sector to both patients and physicians would
suggest normalizing these transactions will be fundamental to the health of the sector itself.

What applied to investing in Family Medicine under the Health Investment Fund Project will
apply in equal measure to investing in the Centre of Excellence hospitals. Motivated and engaged
physicians and medical staff are the prime pre-requisite to access to services, whether essential or
otherwise. Achieving this is becoming urgent.

Project Importance

The project was relevant and timely (when the health system was in a deep crisis) and we can say
that the project practically gave new life to the health system.

The objectives were correctly selected, taking into account the future of the system reflected in
the health system development strategy for 1997-2003. It was done in consultation with World
Health Organization and approved by the Government of Moldova. It also proposed a rather
equitable mechanism of funds distribution of the project, based on competition and in accordance
with the reform steps taken and planned in one region or another.


World Bank's Performance

It should be mentioned that from the design phase of the project, the World Bank employed a
team of experienced professionals such as, Armin Fidler, Joana Godinho, James Cercone, Imre
Holo, Christian Hurtado and others who displayed a rare sense of professionalism both during the
preparation and the regular bi-annual supervision missions of the project.

Borrower's Performance

After 5 years of operation, the government can confirm that the decision to set up a PIU for
project implementation was correct. The unit formed of eight specialists managed project
coordination, implementation and monitoring. Over 130 contracts were prepared, signed for
delivery and installation as well as for staff training. All the measures and activities were
coordinated with the Ministry of Health. However, this coordination was superficial, the reason
being the frequent change of ministers and lack of continuity in the Ministry. Four ministers acted
during project implementation and each time the process of explanation and convincing had to be
done from the start.
