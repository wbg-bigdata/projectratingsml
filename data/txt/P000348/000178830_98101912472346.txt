CAMEROON
SECOND HEVECAM RUBBER PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A.   General
1.01      The United Republic of Cameroon is located on the Gulf of Guinea in
Central Africa. It extends northward to the shores of Lake Chad and is
bounded by Nigeria to the west, by Chad and the Central African Republic to the
east and by Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Congo to the south. Covering 475,000
km2 (183,000 sq. miles) the country embraces a wide range of climatic condi-
tions, from Sahelian in the extreme north to tropical rain forest in the
south, permitting a well diversified agricultural sector and near self suffi-
ciency in food production.
1.02      The country's mineral resources are being increasingly exploited.
An oil refinery is planned near Victoria to process offshore oil reserves and
important aluminium deposits (bauxite) are to be processed at Edea. Iron is
believed to exist in workable quantities in the Kribi region. Other industrial
development is largely based on agriculture and forestry and involves domestic
processing of primary commodities, such as cocoa and palm kernels, and the
conversion of logs into lumber and paper products.
1.03      Infrastructure developments include improvement of the road network,
particularly rural roads critical for the evacuation of agricultural produce,
modernization and expansion of the railway system, expansion of the port
facilities at Douala and the creation of a new port at Rocher du Loup (Wolf
Rock) between Kribi and Campo. The country is favored by a number of sites
suitable for the generation of hydro electric power, and the first major
installation has been created on the Sanaga river at Edea. This serves the
principal towns in the North-West, West, South-West, Coastal and South-
Central Provinces.
1.04      The population, estimated at 7.9 million in 1978, is currently
growing at about 2.3% per year, and over 40% is under 15 years of age.
Of the adult population of 4.5 million, 74% or 3.3 million, are engaged in the
rural sector and 25% are in urban employment. Population density varies
widely between regions. It is highest in the northwest, where it reaches 200
or more per km2, and lowest in the east when it falls to about three.
1.05      The GNP, currently estimated at US$3.6 billion  is equivalent to a
per capita income of US$460. Although per capita incomes were increasing at
6% a year in the 1960s, they are now growing at only about half that rate.
The drop was attributed initially to a decline in commodity prices, notably
coffee and cocoa, and then to a slowdown in the investment rate. Government
has set itself the objective of re-establishing a 6% growth rate under the 4th
National Plan (1976/7-1980/81) with an increase in the investment budget
during the period from an originally planned CFAF 685 billion (US$3.3 billion)
to CFAF 930 billion (US$4.4 billion). Twenty four percent of this increase,
CFAF 59 billion (US$280 million), is to be allocated to rural development.

B.   Agriculture
1.06      Agriculture playg a major role in the economy of Cameroon and
agricultural expansion is likely to remain the cornerstone of the country's
economic development strategy. The rural sector contributes 40% of the
GNP, 70% of the country's export earnings and employs about three quarters
of the total labor force. Per capita incomes vary widely between regions,
the main distinction being between the forested areas in the south, US$90-
160, and the Northern savannah areas, US$66-90, where income is less than a
third of the national average.
1.07      Cameroon's diversity of soil and climatic conditions are reflected
in the variety and geographic distribution of its principal agricultural
products. In the North, millet, sorghum, rice, maize, groundnuts and cotton
are produced and there is potential for wheat. In the Center and Eastern
Provinces, marked by low population density, root crops, groundnuts, coffee,
tobacco and some cereals are grown and livestock production is also an impor-
tant feature. In the Center South, comprising the principal urban concentra-
tions, 80% of the country's cocoa is produced while plantain and taro are
major food crops. In the coastal provinces, robusta coffee, cocoa and bananas
are produced by individual farmers, while palm oil and rubber are produced
on industrial estates. In the heavily populated Western Provinces maize
and tuber crops are the main food sources supplemented by groundnuts,
beans and vegetables.
1.08      Smallholder farming is the predominant source of agricultural
output.  Nearly a million farm families, cultivating an average of about 2 ha,
contribute 90% of total production. Of the export crops, coffee and cocoa
come principally from peasant producers.  Three other important crops, namely
cotton, tobacco and rice are also supplied largely by small farmers.
1.09      Attention in the past, particularly in the field of research,
technical support and extension has been focussed on export crops such as
cocoa, coffee, cotton and oil palm. By contrast, food crop production has
suffered from weak rural institutions, limited access to credit and seasonal
inputs and lack of training and agricultural research dissemination to the
small farmer.
1.10      Recent agricultural production trends have varied.  Food crop and
cereal production have remained stable over the past 5 years following poor
results during the drought of the early 1970s. Root crop production has
grown at an appreciable rate over the past decade. Cash crop production has
followed an uneven trend: expanding between 1967 and 1972; regressing between
1972 and 1976; and, more recently, increasing as a result of improved producer
prices, stronger Government support and intervention policies, and the matur-
ing of investments from earlier years. Potential for increased production is
great as Cameroon possesses considerable unexploited land resources: it is
estimated that little more than 4% of potentially cultivable land is currently
under production. Only in the Western Province and North Western Highlands is



- 3 -
there a density of population which puts pressure on available cultivable
land. Government is currently pursuing measures to encourage migration out of
these areas by opening up new productive lands such as those envisaged as part
of the present project.
1.11      In terms of Government commitment to the agricultural sector, the
Fourth National Plan accords an inerease of 4% of the investment budget to
agricultural and rural sector activities (US$740 million) over provisions
made in the Third Plan (US$575 million). In pursuing overall objectives of
improving income distribution and regional disparities, modernizing social
facilities and living conditions and developing local technology, Government's
agricultural policy is concerned with improving: (i) extension coverage;
(ii) availability of agricultural credit; (iii) farmer organization through
cooperatives; and, (iv) research dissemination to smallholders for major
crops. In pursuing attempts to stem the growing exodus of young people from
rural areas, funds have been earmarked to help establish young farmers in
cash and food crop production.
1.12      The Bank's activities in Cameroon include a number of integrated
rural development projects although almost 60% of sector lending to date has
been to industrial crop projects for rubber and oil palm such as CAMDEV,
SOCAPALM and HEVECAM. These projects are assisting Cameroon to diversify its
production of export crops.  Rubber production now amounts to about 18,000
tons a year and palm oil about 50,000 t (primarily for domestic consumption)
as against coffee and cocoa at 90,000 t and 100,000 t respectively. Govern-
ment is also considering diversifying into coconut production for which
variety trials are underway and seed gardens are being established in a pilot
component of the CAMDEV II project (Loan 1508-CM).
1.13      In line with Government's wishes to involve smallholders in tree
crop projects, CAMDEV II and SOCAPALM II (Loan 1392-CM) include plans
for 3,000 ha of smallholder oil palm and 1,000 ha of smallholder rubber,
and the presently proposed HEVECAI Il project incorporates trials of 250 ha
of rubber to be planted by some 100 smallholders. Smallholdings would
be developed alongside the estates so that participating farmers could
benefit from the technical expertise of the nucleus organization and from
the estate processing facilities. This would make possible a higher
quality end-product than would be attainable using traditional smallholder
methods, thereby benefitting the economy and providing the individual
farmer with a greater return from his labor. The overall size of such
smallholder components is however constrained for at least the next few
years by the low population density in areas adjoining the estates currently
being developed.
1.14      The total area under rubber in Cameroon at the present time is
about 25,000 ha, two thirds of which are in tapping.   The major contribution
comes from CAMDEV with about 11,000 ha in tapping and an annual production
of 12,000 tons. SAFACAM with 4,000 ha in tapping, produces about 4,000
tons and PAMOL, with 1,600 ha, about 2,000 tons. Long-term plans for



- 4 -
further expansion of the area under rubber wiLl depend on the outcome of
two regional master plan studies for which financing has been provided
under ongoing Bank projects. In terms of land availability, it is probable
that the area under rubber could be increased to 100,000 ha without jeopardiz-
ing other important agricultural developments, in particular the expansion
of production of staple food crops.
C.   Performance under the First Project
1.15      HEVECAM (Hevea-Cameroon) a wholly state owned development company,
was established by decrees 75/284 bis of April 30, 1975, and 75/346 of May 23,
1975, and was charged with the development of a 15,000 ha rubber estate within
a 40,000 ha concession traversed by the Niete river (Map IBRD 14374). The
company's operations are regulated under law 68/LF/9 relating to "Societes
de Developpement" (Development Companies).
1.16      The land value was assessed at CFAF 400 million (US$1.9 million) and
constituted a part of Government's contribution to the establishment of the
new company. Initial finance, totalling CFAF 300 million (US$1.4 million),
was contributed by Government, CFAF 50 million; the National Office for
Marketing of Primary Commodities (ONCPB), CFAF 200 million; and the National
Investment Company (SNI), CFAF 50 million. An IDA credit (574-CM) of US$16
million, and a CCCE (Central Bank for Economic Cooperation-France) loan of
FF 20 million were granted in 1975. This external financing contributed to the
administrative costs of the company, its investment in equipment and materials,
and the civil works and agricultural operations required to initiate the first
phase with a target of planting 5,800 ha of plantation rubber. Also financed
under the project were associated activities which included technical assistance
to HEVECAM and the preparation of a Plan Directeur (Master Plan) for the Kribi
Region. The latter work is being carried out under contract by a consortium
of local companies comprising SEDA (Societe d'Etudes pour le Developpement de
l'Afrique), SATET (Societe Africaine de Travaux et d'Etudes Topographiques)
and SAFACAM (Societe Africaine Forestiere et Agricole du Cameroun).
1.17      The problems and difficulties of implementing a plantation project
in this hitherto largely undeveloped region, particularly the difficulty of
attracting and retaining labor, and climatic conditions unfavorable to highly
mechanized deforestation, resulted in a slow start, and plantings achieved in
the early years lagged behind appraisal estimates. However, these problems
are gradually being cvercome and at the end of four years HEVECAM had come
within 5% of achieving the physical objectives set for that period.  Quality
of the plantings is generally good, the company's operations have been
well managed, and yield expectations at maturity (2.3 tons dry rubber per ha)
should be realized.

1.18      However, costs have been much higher than originally estimated
and available financing will be exhausted by the time the 1979 program, which
will bring the total planted area to 4,200 ha, has been completed. It is
proposed that the balance of 1,600 ha be financed under the second project.
1.19      The Company's accounts at June 30, 1979, showed a total cost overrun
on the four years' operations of CFAF 1.6 billion (US$7.6 million) an increase
of 38 percent over appraisal estimates. Table 1.2 summarizes these over-
expenditures.
1.20      The greatest cost overrun has been on the construction of housing
for estate labor, an increase of 128% (US$3.1 million). For social reasons,
the Government decided that the standard of accommodation originally
envisaged was no longer acceptable and the housing program was revised.
Both the quality of construction and the habitable area per worker were
substantially increased.
1.21      An over-expenditure of US$2.7 million (an increase of 52% over the
appraisal estimate), was incurred on plantation development and is attribut-
able in large measure to a change in the method of land preparation. At
appraisal it was not expected that windrowing of the felled timber would be
necessary. The intention was to fell the forest and then open planting
rows with a V-blade attached to the front of a heavy tractor. Because of
the difficulty of getting a satisfactory burn without piling the logs, and
because windrowing was considered to reduce the risk of root diseases
(particularly Fomes) infecting the young rubber trees, the more expensive
method was subsequently approved and adopted. Heavy losses due to rodent
damage, particularly severe where seed was planted directly in the field,
necessitated a revision of planting techniques with a greater use of
container grown, 'polybag', plants raised in irrigated nurseries. This,
too, had a significant impact on costs.
1.22      An important ancillary activity financed under the first project has
been the preparation of a Plan Directeur (Master Plan) for the economic
development of the Kribi region, within which the Niete concession is located.
Although primarily designed to identify areas suitable for further expansion

of the tree-crop sub-sector, particularly rubber, oil-palm and coconut, the
terms of reference included the investigation of other possibilities, such as
forestry, mining, tourism and cottage industries, and the infrastructure needs
associated with such economic development.
1.23      Implementation of the study was delayed, and the final report is not
expected until early 1980. However, a report on the first phase has been
issued, and this tentatively identifies a number of possible sites for new
industrial estates. While the work is not yet far enough advanced to allow
the formulation of a regional plan, all the required data exist to permit
completion of the development of HEVECAM's plantation at Niete.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01      The project area, a 40,000 ha concession, is located 25 km south-
east of the port of Kribi to the south of the main Kribi-Ebolowa road; the
geographic center of the plantation is located at map coordinates 1007' East
and 2044' North (see Map IBRD 14374).  The estate headquarters, already
established within the concession, are 40 km by road from the port.
Population
2.02      Prior to the start up of the first project the area was practically
devoid of population. Such villages as existed were concentrated along the
Kribi-Ebolowa and Adjap-Zuingui roads. The future interests of these villages
have been protected by the establishment of concession boundaries which leave
a substantial band of cultivable land at the disposition of local farmers
along these two main axes.
2.03      The Ocean department, although one of the least populated areas of
the country, shows remarkable ethnic diversity. At least ten different
peoples are represented including some pygmies, believed to number about
3,000, whose interests are specially protected by the state.
Topography
2.04      The concession area lies for the most part less than 100 m above sea
level and is relatively flat.  There are, however, chains of low hills rising
to 200 m. Prospections to date show that some 16,000 ha, or 40% of the
concession, are sufficiently level, with slopes of 15% (about 80) or less, for
mechanized land clearing and the creation of industrial blocks. Flood liable
areas along the river banks and swampy areas between streams would be excluded,
as would slopes steeper than 15%.



-8-
Soils
2.05      Soils are mostly sandy-clays with up to 40% clay and a high propor-
tion of fine sand. These are considered very suitable for rubber. Less
suitable, but still plantable, are areas where there is a significant propor-
tion of lateritic gravel mixed through the soil profile. Soils are moderately
acid, pH about 5, and are generally deficient in potassium. Provision has
been made for complete manuring of all plantings during immaturity and correc-
tive doses of selected fertilizers, principally potash, during exploitation.
Hydrography
2.06      The concession is traversed by the river Niete which would provide
an adequate year round water supply for the factory and industrial area.
Potable water for the residential areas would come from new wells to be
constructed at each village site.
Climate
2.07      Prior to the commencement of the first project no precise meteo-
rological data existed for the Niete area. On the published rainfall maps
the concession lies between the isohyets for 1,850 and 2,700 mm and con-
siderable variations in total annual precipitation occur over rather short
distances, with more than 3,000 mm of rain at Kribi, and less than 2,000 mm
at Ebolowa. Essentially, however, the pattern of distribution results in a
main dry season of 3 to 4 months between the end of November and March, a
small dry season in July and August and adequate rainfall during the
remainder of the year. In the two full years for which estate records are
available the mean rainfall has been about 2,200 mm (87 inches) with an
estimated annual moisture deficit of 100-200 mm. No accurate data are
available on sunshine hours or solar radiation. Sunshine would be expected
to vary between 1,500 and 1,800 hours annually with a mean daily solar
radiation of about 350 gram calories/cm2/day. Temperature averages about
26 C0 (79OF) and seasonal variations are slight. One possible hazard
is wind damage, and this has had to be taken into account in selecting the
planting material to be used under the project. In rubber cultivation the
material planted usually consists of seedling root-stocks budgrafted with
selected high yielding clones - that is collections of genetically identical
material obtained by vegetative multiplication from single parent trees of
proven productivity. Some of the highest yielding and most vigorous
clones, such as RRIM 600, are very susceptible to wind damage and would not
be planted extensively at Niete.
Vegetation
2.08      The dominant vegetation type is dense, low altitude, evergreen
tropical forest. Although the Niete concession has already been logged over,
and most of the top-class timber has been taken out, some merchantable logs
remain.  Since all standing timber has anyway to be felled prior to the
planting of rubber the cost of extracting these logs would be minimal. The
recovery of as little as 8 m3 per hectare of salvage logs, at a stumpage value



of CFAF 10,000 per m3, would repay more than 50% of the costs of land clear-
ing. This would improve the financial rate of return by about one percentage
point. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government would engage
a suitably qualified forestry consultant to undertake a study to determine by
species and volume the quantity of merchantable timber remaining on the Niete
concession. This work would be completed not later than December 31, 1980, and
Government would thereafter take appropriate measures to ensure the commercial-
ization of this resource (para 9.01).
Communications
2.09      The estate is linked to the national road network by a 12 km access
road maintained by HEVECAM. This main road connects with Kribi, 33 km, and
Ebolowa, 138 km. From Kribi there is a northward link to Edea which provides
access to Douala and Yaounde. However, these roads are generally in poor
repair and are scheduled for upgrading. Meanwhile, much use has to be made of
local air transport, with scheduled services between Douala and Kribi, and,
now that an airstrip has been constructed, chartered flights direct to the
estate. Douala, 254 km from Niete, is likely to be the main port for shipment
of the plantation rubber in the early years. Eventually, the new port to be
constructed at Rocher du Loup (Wolf Rock), 38 km south of Kribi, will provide
a less costly evacuation route. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that Government would give priority to completing the public works
required to ensure year round road communications between the estate, Kribi
and Douala, via Edea, and that these works would be carried out by December 31,
1980 (para 9.01).
Services
2.10      Kribi, the administrative center of the region, is served by the
usual public utilities and services. While the estate itself has a police
post all other services will have to be provided under the project. These
will include a hospital, additional schools and recreational facilities
associated with each new village and the installation of water and electricity.
There are already 3 schools, which include kindergarten facilities, 4
nursing centers with qualified staff, 3 clubs, 4 sportsfields, 3 covered
markets, a number of stores and "boutiques" and a mobile cinema. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the schools built, and to be built,
at Niete would be operated in conformity with the regulations governing the
public educational system.
Labor
2.11      The project is heavily dependent on labor recruited from outside the
region. Such recruitment is costly and the turnover rate is high, with two to
three workers being recruited for every one retained. However, the situation
is expected to improve as the estate develops and the social ambiance becomes
more attractive. Nevertheless, the difficulty of establishing a stable,
adequately skilled, and disciplined work force constitutes one of the most



- 10 -
serious problems facing the Niete operation. At present 45% of the labor
comes from the South-Central and Eastern provinces.  Eighty percent of the
workers are less than 30 years old, and the majority are unnarried. While
most do come from rural areas fewer than 5% are from the north which is,
currently, one of the major areas of underemployment in Cameroon. Agricul-
tural wages are fixed by Government decree. Although the legal minimum
remains below US$2 equivalent per day the average wage paid by HEVECAM,
including bonuses, seniority pay, and overtime earnings, is about US$3.
Workers also enjoy substantial fringe benefits, such as housing provided by
the company. Wages are expected to continue rising faster than the general
level of inflation, resulting in further increases in living standards for
plantation workers.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Summary Description
3.01      The project would comprise a second five-year phase in the develop-
ment of an industrial rubber estate within the 40,000 hectare Niete concession.
3.02      It would include:
i.   felling and preparing for planting, a further 9,800 ha of forest:
(a)  2,300 ha to complete the 7,500 scheduled for clearing under the
first project,
(b)  6,000 ha to bring the plantation to a total of 13,500 ha
under the proposed second project, and
(c)  1,500 ha in preparation for the planting of 1,500 ha under a
third phase, thus completing the 15,000 ha development
envisaged by Government;
ii.   planting a further 9,300 ha with selected rubber clones:
(a) 1,600 ha to complete the 5,800 ha planned under the first
project and,
(b)  7,700 ha to extend the estate to 13,500 ha;
iii.   maintaining during the pre-production period the 4,200 ha planted
under the first project together with the 9,300 ha that would be
planted under the proposed project;
iv.   bringing into tapping the first 1,500 ha planted under the first
project;



- il -
v.   establishing the infrastructure necessary for the expansion of
the estate, including the construction of housing for workers,
the installation of water and electricity services, and the provi-
sion of a hospital, schools, markets, stores, recreational build-
ings, and sports facilities;
vi.   constructing the first stage of the rubber factory and installing
processing capacity to treat 30 t/day;
vii.   establishing nurseries to provide material for the 1,500 ha that
would be planted under phase 3 in order to complete the 15,000 ha
development;
viii.   completing the prospection of the Niete concession and preparatory
topographical and soil studies on a new site to provide for the
company's further development;
ix.   providing technical assistance to HEVECAM under the existing manage-
ment contract with SAFACAM; which includes provision for the train-
ing of Cameroonian staff at all levels of responsibility;
X.   continuing the ongoing program of applied experimentation and
field trials on rubber;
xi.   clearing forest and making land available for food crop husbandry by
the estate workers and their families and provide them with improved
seed and other planting material for the major subsistence crops;
xii.   clearing about 250 ha of land outside the concession area, conduct-
ing trials and making other preparations, such as establishment of
credit facilities for participating growers, for the introduction of
rubber as a smallholder crop in association with the industrial
plantation. About 100 participants would be expected during the
project period; and
xiii.   conducting a survey to determine the amount of merchantable timber
remaining in the areas of forest that would be cleared under the
project.
B. Detailed Features
3.03      The area of forest to be cleared would exceed the net area to be
planted by about 15%. About 3% would be required for the creation of roads
and tracks, and 12% would be unplantable due to steep slopes, unsuitable
soils, impeded drainage and other technical problems. Unless it is specified
to the contrary figures in this report refer to net planted hectares. Felling
would be completed a year in advance of field planting and, wherever possible,
trees would be uprooted in order to minimize the risk of root diseases affecting



- 12 -
the development of the young rubber. After knocking down, the salvable logs
would be extracted, and the remaining material would be pushed into windrows
40 m apart and burnt. As at present, local contractors would be employed
whenever possible for chain-sawing operations; felling the large trees that
cannot be pushed over by tractor and opening lines in preparation for plant-
ing. Other than this it is proposed that all land clearing operations be
carried out on force account. HEVECAM has demonstrated its ability to achieve
the annual programs of around 2,000 ha required to meet the project timetable
and, with its existing fleet of 14 large and several smaller crawler tractors,
which are already equipped for deforestation work, has practically all the
material resources required to complete a 15,000 ha estate.
3.04      The following schedule summarizes the proposed timetable for the
principal field operations:

/a   Planted in the first half of 1980, an additional 1,052 ha would have
been planted during the second half of calendar year 1979 to complete
the 4,200 ha of the first project.
3.05      Under the first project it was intended that two-thirds of the
area would be planted with "seed at stake" (seedlings raised directly in
the field and bud-grafted subsequently with selected clonal material) and
one-third with nursery grafted container-grown plants (seed sown and raised
in "polybags"). Losses due to rodent attack and increasing evidence of the
superiority of polybag plants have led to a change in policy (para 1.21).

- 13 -
3.06      Experience has also dictated a change in the choice of the varieties
to be planted. Clone GT.1 has made the best early growth under the first
project and would be the main variety planted under the proposed second
project. Other clones that have performed well elsewhere, and should be
included in future Niete plantings, are PB.217, PB.235, PR.261 and Avros
2037.  Although not yet widely grown in West Africa, PB.217 has already been
approved by the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia for large scale commer-
cial planting. An additional eight hectares of budwood gardens would be
established and maintained under the project in order to ensure an adequate
supply of top quality material. Initial planting density would be 555 trees
per ha (8 m x 2.25 m) with an average of 420 trees being brought into tapping
by the eighth year after an initial opening with 300 trees in year six. In
this report seed at stake is considered as being planted in year NO. Polybag
material and budded stumps would be planted in Ni, or occasionally even in N2.
3.07      On all areas a leguminous cover crop (Pueraria) would be established,
and maintenance would as far as possible be achieved using chemical herbi-
cides, in preference to hand weeding. The use of herbicides both reduces
labor costs and minimizes soil erosion hazards. The major risk to the young
trees is root disease, caused by Fomes, and provision has been made for
routine inspection and control measures. Once in production the trees would
be susceptible to various diseases of the tapping panel; "black-stripe" caused
by Phytophthora palmivora being the most serious. The cost of appropriate
treatment has been taken into account. All chemical products used on the
project would be selected with due regard to their environmental safety.
3.08      Manuring during immaturity would be based in a complete NPK mixture,
using principally rock phosphate, urea, diammonium phosphate and muriate of
potash. Detailed schedules are given in the project file. Once in production
it is unlikely that an economic response would be obtained to anything other
than muriate of potash.
3.09      Tapping would be twice weekly, 3 and 4 day intervals alternating,
on a half-spiral cut (S.2; d3/d4) and trees would be stimulated from the
outset by the application of an ethylene generating compound. "Ethrel", based
on 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid, is currently recommended, but other formula-
tions such as "Ethad" are under test and may become commercially available at
a later date. Exploitation costs have been calculated on the assumption that
Ethrel would be used. It is probable, however, that further advances will be
made both in the formulation of stimulants and in tapping techniques. Most
promising at present would appear to be a combination of conventional tapping
with the system of puncture tapping first tested by IRCA (Rubber Research
Institute in the Ivory Coast) and now being developed in a number of rubber
producing countries. Since labor costs are expected to go on rising in real
terms there will be a continuing incentive to evolve less labor intensive
methods.
3.10      Yields forecast for the Niete program start at 200 kg dry rubber
per ha in year six and rise to 2,300 kg at full maturity. A tapping life of
32 years is assumed for each planting, with some yield decline in the later
years. This would result in an overall mean annual yield of 1,972 kg per ha.



- 14 -
The yield of 2,300 kg per ha at maturity is the same figure as was adopted
for the first project. Available evidence, based on performance of the
selected clones on older estates, indicates that these forecasts are realistic
and, given good management, should be achieved. Production is compared in
Figure 1 with some recent forecasts from Malaysia. The better early yields
expected at Niete are due to the high initial planting density and the con-
trolled use of Ethrel from the outset of tapping. This technique, prudently
applied, reduces tapping costs, by allowing less intensive tapping for a given
yield target, without adversely affecting the development of the trees or
yield at maturity. The alternative approach, advocated at present by the
Rubber Research Institute in Malaysia, gives a less favorable distribution of
production over time with a dramatic, though short-lived, increase in yield
about year 17 when Ethrel stimulation is first applied. A summary of produc-
tion estimates for the estate is given in Table III.1.
3.11      The use of yield stimulants prolongs latex flow and reduces the
proportion of the crop that can be economically collected as liquid latex.
The late drippings are allowed to coagulate in the tapping cup and have to be
collected subsequently as "cup-lump". The estimate retained in planning the
factory has been 75% liquid latex and 25% secondary grades, comprising cup-
lump, tree-lace, bark-scrap and ground-scrap. The factory would produce crumb
rubber from all grades. This would be marketed in standard bLocks of 33.3 kg,
30 to the ton, and shipment is planned in 18 ton containers. The factory
design provides for ponding of the effluent, and the eventual discharge into
the Niete river would have an acceptable biological oxygen demand.
3.12      The total number of people employed by HEVECAM at the end of the
first phase, 4,200 ha planted, will be about 1,600. During the period
covered by the proposed second project this number would increase to about
3,000. Accommodation would be provided under the project for the additional
1,400 employees and, where these are married, for their immediate dependents.
Medical and other social services would also be expanded to cater for the
additional numbers.
3.13      Costs have been assessed on the assumption that, amongst the skilled
and unskilled laborers, the percentage of married men accompanied by their
famailies would increase from 25% to 50% between 1979 and 1985, and that for
artisans and specialist workers the proportion would rise from 50% to 70% over
the same period. Eventually, the estate would provide direct employment for
between 6,000 and 7,000 workers of whom 80% would probably be married. A
typical estate village, would house 400 workers and would supply the labor
required to operate 1,000 ha of plantation in full production.
3.14      In immediate proximity to each village an area of 60 ha of
forest would be cleared by HEVECAM, and allotted to individuals wanting
land to grow their own food. Provision has been made in the project
financing for HEVECAM to establish and maintain a food crop unit that would
multiply, and distribute free of charge to the workers, supplies of improved
planting material. This work would be conducted in collaboration with IRAF
(Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute).



- 15 -
3.15      Government is anxious to develop smallholding rubber in association
with the industrial estate and a sum of CFAF 109.0 million (US$0.5 million) has
been included in the financing plan for the launching of a smallholder pro-
gram.  This is seen as essentially experimental in nature and would involve
only about 250 ha, and perhaps 100 participants during the project period.  It
would be unrealistic to attempt a more ambitious program under the proposed
project. Rubber is an unfamiliar crop, population density in the area sur-
rounding the concession is low, and local farmers already have time and labor
constraints in the practice of their traditional husbandry. Of particular
importance for the long term success of the small holding venture would be the
establishment of an integrated farming system that takes into account the
conditions under which the small farmer operates. In particular, the inclu-
sion of food crops, and perhaps small livestock, in the system would both
improve farm incomes and reduce risk of roct diseases infecting the young
rubber trees.
C.   Project Costs
3.16      The total cost of the proposed project during the five year invest-
ment period is estimated at CFAF 20.0 billion (US$95.0 million) inclusive of
all identifiable taxes. Substantial investments already made under the first
project would contribute to the implementation of the second. For example,
the fleet of heavy tractors already purchased would suffice to complete 15,000
ha of deforestation. In consequence the foreign exchange component of the
second project would be only 36% or CFAF 7.3 billion (US$34.5 million).
3.17      The tax element accounts for CFAF 1.3 billion (US$6.2 million) or 7%
of total project costs, leaving a net of tax total of CFAF 18.7 billion
(US$88.8 million). Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% on civil
works and buildings and 5% on all other costs except salaries. Price contin-
gencies have been calculated throughout at 10%, compounded annually, on
January 1979 base costs, plus physical contingencies. This is consistent with
the judgment made in respect of other recently presented Cameroon projects and
is again considered appropriate in the present case. Total contingencies,
thus calculated, amount to 42% of base costs. Although differently consti-
tuted, this overall percentage is identical with that applied in the first
project.
3.18      A summary of project cost estimates is given in Table 3.3.  For
a more detailed presentation see Table III.2. Since the project would
comprise a time-slice out of an ongoing and continuing development program
the costs to be incurred during the five year project period would be
distributed between a continuation of the first phase (4,200 ha), implementa-
tion of the second phase (9,300 ha), and preparation for a third phase (1,500
ha), under which Government plans to bring the estate to completion (15,000
ha).

3.19      All expenditures during the project period attributable to the third
phase of development, expansion of the estate from 13,500 to 15,000 ha, would
be financed 100% by Government under part B.2 of the project (Table 3.5).
D.   Proposed Financing
3.20      A Bank loan of US$16.5 million and an IDA credit of US$15 million
are proposed, making a total Bank Group participation of US$31.5 million. In
addition, the Cameroonian Government would receive two loans from the CCCE
(Central Bank for Economic Cooperation - France) totalling FF80 million
(US$19.0 million) and a loan of É12 million (US$25.7 million) from the CDC
(Commonwealth Development Corporation - U.K.). The proposed financing plan is
set out in Table 3.5.
3.21      Contributions of the Bank Group would cover eligible expenditures
under part B.3 of the project (Table 3.5) incurred between January 1, 1980,
and June 30, 1984, or such later date as may subsequently be agreed.
Retroactive financing would be provided for a total amount not exceeding
US$400,000, the anticipated reimbursable costs prior to Loan/Credit signature.
The CCCE loans would be divided between parts B.1 and B.3 of the project
involving US$4.9 million of parallel financing and US$14.1 million pari
passu with the other participants. CDC would finance 80% (US$4.9 million)
of expenditures under Part A (July 1 -December 31, 1979) and 26% of expendi-
tures under part B.3. Government would contribute CFAF 3.9 billion (US$18.8
million) of equity which would cover 20% of the costs of Part A, 100% of
the costs of part B.2, and 16% of the costs of part B.3 of the project.
The Government would, also contribute CFAF 1,012 million (US$4.8 million)
of additional equity to finance HEVECAM's working capital requirements
during the project period and would pay a total of CFAF 2,542 million (US$12.1
million) in debt service (Table VII.6) on its external borrowings -- first
project CFAF 399 million (US$1.9 million) and second project CFAF 2,143
million (US$10.2 million). Thus the total Government contribution during the
five years would be CFAF 7.5 billion (US$35.7 million).

3.22      All external loans would be made to Government and would be
relent to HEVECAM with a 10 year interest free period. Lending and
relending terms are set out in Table 3.6. The general principle agreed
during negotiations for calculating relending rates was that Government
should recover its outgoings but would not seek any additional return
on the monies relent to HEVECAM. It was, however, agreed that: (i) the
IDA Credit would be relent on terms equivalent to those applying to the
relending of the IBRD loan, (ii) the CCCE credit of FF 20 million (US$4.8
million) would be passed to HEVECAM as equity, and (iii) CFAF 781 million
(US$3.7 million) of the CCCE credit of FF 60 million (US$14.3 million)
would be passed to HEVECAM as a grant. At the assessed opportunity cost
of capital in Cameroon (9%), these arrangements represent a net present
value to HEVECAM of US$25.1 million, derived in approximately equal
amounts from the terms of the external donors (US$12.7 million) and the
onlending terns granted by Government (US$12.4 million). The signing of
a project financing agreement between HEVECAM and Government giving
effect to the arrangements set out in Table 3.6, Part B, would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of both the IDA credit and the Bank loan (para 9.02).
The smallholder component of the project, which would be financed 100% by
Government, would be managed by HEVECAM under a credit administration
agreement with FONADER which would be concluded on terns acceptable
to the Bank (para 9.01). The Government would ensure that HEVECAM main-
tained at all times cash and bank balances, including overdraft facilities
guaranteed by Government, to cover HEVECAM's expenditures for a four month
period. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (para
9.01). Effectiveness of both the IDA Credit and the IBRD Loan would be
contingent upon the Government's contracting loans with CDC and CCCE to
cover the balance of projeet costs. Government would also ensure additional
financing, after the project period, sufficient to bring all plantings to
maturity, and to extend the factory facilities to handle the full production.
E.   Procurement
3.23      Contracts of US$100,000 or more would be awarded through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Goods so purchased would be expected to total about US$7 million, of which
the Bank/IDA would finance US$2.3 million, and would cover vehicles and
equipment, fertilizers and chemicals, and factory equipment.  Purchases
would be grouped wherever practical to derive maximum advantage from bulk
procurement. CCCE would finance, under its own procurement rules, light
vehicles and wheeled tractors to a value of FF 4.4 million (US$1.0 million).
Contracts for goods and services worth less than US$100,000 would be
procured through local competitive bidding under procedures acceptable to
the Bank, while those of less than US$50,000 would be on the basis of
quotations, from not fewer than three suppliers.  Such contracts would not
be expected to exceed US$5.5 million (Bank/IDA US$1.7 million). Civil
works totalling US$12.3 million (Bank/IDA US$4.1 million), comprising
industrial and, social buildings, workers' housing, site preparation, and

other works, would mainly be carried out by HEVECAM on force account with a
limited amount of local sub-contracting. Past experience has shown that
such work is unlikely to attract foreign bidders, and suitable local
contractors are not available in the area. Deforestation and plantation
development work, costing US$35.1 million would also be carried out by
HEVECAM on force account. The continued use of force account for deforesta-
tion is justified on two counts: (i) the possibility to put to effective
use the substantial residual capacity now at HEVECAM's disposal for
carrying out these operations (heavy equipment, workshop facilities and
trained manpower), and (ii) on the basis of HEVECAM's current performance
and recent international tenders for deforestation work in Cameroon, force
account affords the less costly alternative. As under the first project,
HEVECAM would sub-contract operations such as tree felling with chain-saws
for which local contractors are available. Since the purchase of land
clearing and other agricultural equipment was financed under the first
project, depreciation costs would be specifically excluded in calculating
reimbursable amounts on force account operations. HEVECAM's management and
administrative expenses would total US$28.2 million of which US$9.4
million would be covered by Bank/IDA financing. The company already
employs a number of expatriates amongst its managerial and technical staff
whose services would be retained under existing contracts, satisfactory to
the Bank, during the proposed second project. About 720 man months of
expatriate time would be involved during the project period at an average
salary cost of US$4,000 per man-month, total US$2.9 million (Bank/IDA US$1
million). CCCE would finance the cost of continuing the SAFACAM management
services, provided under an existing technical assistance contract approved
under the first project and estimated to cost US$2.7 million during the
five years of the proposed second project (para 4.02).
F. Disbursement
3.24      The Bank Group financing (US$31.5 million, an IDA credit of US$15
million and an IBRD loan of US$16.5 million) would be disbursed over about
five years. It would cover 40% of the costs of part B.3 of the project
(Table 3.5) representing 33% of total project costs including taxes and 35%
of total costs net of taxes. The IDA credit would be disbursed first. It
is expected that no claim would be made against the IBRD loan until the
second semester of FY1983. Costs during the first three quarters of FY1980
(July 1979 - March 1980) would be financed by Government and CDC. A
schedule of disbursement for both credit and loan is shown in Table III.3.

All disbursement claims against contracts would be fully documented.  Dis-
bursements for management expenses and force account operations would be
made against statements of expenditure. Full supporting documentation,
showing costs incurred and works completed, would be retained for inspection
by the Bank during project supervision. HEVECAM has already installed a
cost accounting system, and experience under the first project has shown
the statements provided to have been accurate. Control would be reinforced
by specific verification provided by the external auditors (para 3.26).
G.   Accounts, Audit, and Reporting Requirements
3.25      HEVECAM would, within the context of its financial accounting
system, keep records consistent with sound accounting practice and adequate
to reflect both its general financial situation and the detailed costs of
its operations. HEVECAM would submit quarterly reports to Government and
the colenders containing summary financial information. The report would
show actual against budgeted expenditures and would also relate physical
progress achieved to target objectives. In addition to these quarterly
reports, half yearly inspection reports would continue to be prepared
jointly by SAFACAM and HEVECAM and would be submitted to Government and the
colenders. HEVECAM's annual budgets would be made available to the colenders
for comment prior to final ratification by the Board of Management.
3.26      HEVECAM would continue, as under the first project, to appoint
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank for the annual auditing of its
accounts. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank within 4 months



- 23 -
after the close of each financial year, that is not later than October 31
in respect of the year terminating June 30. The auditor's opinion on
project expenditures would include verification whether: (i) goods and
services had been procured from member countries of the Bank or Switzerland;
(ii) goods had been received or work performed; (iii) payment had been
made; (iv) goods and services financed by the colenders were eligible for
such financing and had been used exclusively for the project; and (v) a
special opinion on HEVECAM's submissions of statements of expenditures
covering its force account operations. In addition the auditor's opinion
would include a verification of HEVECAM's debt to equity ratio.  Assurances
regarding the application of these arrangements were obtained during
negotiations (para 9.01).
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Plantation Development
4.01      Existing arrangements, which have worked well, would be continued.
HEVECAM (Hevea-Cameroon) is a state-owned development corporation established
by Government decrees in 1975 (para 1.15) to create a 15,000 ha industrial
rubber estate within a 40,000 ha concession in Ocean department (see Map
IBRD 14373). The company's management structure is illustrated in the
organization chart (Chart 1). Control is exercised by a Conseil d'Adminis-
tration (Board of Management) composed of nine to twelve members each
appointed for a three-year term. The President of the Board is nominated
by the President of the Republic, and the Prefect of Ocean Department is
an ex-officio member. The "Office National de Commercialisation des
Produits de Base", (National Office for the Marketing of Primary Commodities)
has two seats on the Board by virtue of its contribution to the company's
capital, the "Societe Nationale d'Investissements" (National Investment
Company) has, likewise, one seat. The Ministry of Agriculture and the
Ministry of Economy and Planning each have two representatives, the Ministry
of Finance and the Government Commissary one each. The Managing Director
(Directeur General) is responsible to the Board for the day to day management
of the company's affairs.
4.02      Responsibility for the creation of the plantation, its maintenance,
and eventual exploitation has been assigned to SAFACAM (Societe Africaine
Forestiere et Agricole-Cameroun), a plantation company with international
affiliations, under the terms of a technical assistance contract concluded
at the commencement of the first project, and scheduled to last for eight
years. This contract has operated satisfactorily to date and is expected
to continue through the five-year period of the project now proposed.
SAFACAM puts at the disposition of HEVECAM its technical expertise in all
subjects relating to rubber cultivation, and the processing and marketing
of the crop. It assists HEVECAM in the preparation of annual budgets and,
through formal inspection visits conducted twice a year, keeps the HEVECAM
Board advised on all matters relevant to the successful implementation of



- 24 -
the program of development. Either by secondment or separate recruitment,
SAFACAM ensures that key posts in HEVECAM are staffed by suitably qualified
personnel. HEVECAM would at all times employ a Technical Manager, an
Industrial Manager and a Financial and Administrative Manager with qualifica-
tions and experience acceptable to the Bank. Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations (para 9.01).
Training
4.03      Under Article 7 of the agreement SAFACAM undertakes to ensure
appropriate training for HEVECAM's Cameroonian staff. At the field level
this is essentially a question of on-the-job training in the special skills
required, for example, bud-grafting and tapping. Despite the high turnover
rate, and the continuing need to train new recruits, the system has proved
effective and HEVECAM now disposes of sufficient skilled labor to ensure
meeting its planting targets of around 2,000 ha a year. At the intermediate
level, foremen, supervisors and technicians on-the-job training is also
proving effective and the company has a good nucleus of staff on which to
build. Incremental numbers required during the project period would be
relatively small and no insuperable problems are foreseen. At the management
level the problem is rather one of structured career development within the
company than of basic training. Most management recruits have a sound
agricultural background derived from an ENSA (Higher National School of
Agronomy) education and it is management experience which is lacking.
HEVECAM is, however, very conscious of these problems and a training and
development program anticipating the long term needs of the company has
been approved by the Board of Management. Management trainees who are
considered to show potential for career development in plantation manage-
ment would be given the opportunity to gain experience by being sent on
assignments with established plantation companies either within Cameroon or
abroad.
Applied Research
4.04      While fundamental research is the task of the national research
institutes, an organization the size of HEVECAM requires qualified staff
of its own able to deal with project specific problems as they arise.
Provision has, therefore, been made for the creation of a small applied
research unit with an annual budget equivalent to about IJS$55,000. This
unit would carry out field trials on a variety of subjects including
maintenance techniques, the relative performance of different clones,
disease control, and, later, tapping systems. Arrangements have also been
made for periodic visits to the estate by specialists from IRCA (Rubber
Research Institute with headquarters in France). The total cost of this
unit during the project period would be about US$0.5 million, wholly
financed by Government.
Food Crops
4.05      A second small ancillary unit, also Governient financed, would be
created to ensure the provision of planting material to HEVECAM's workers
for their food farms. This would have a budget comparable with that of the



- 25 -
applied rubber research unit and would work in collaboration with IRAF, the
National Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute.
Project Related Studies
4.06     Government's plans for the future expansion of HEVECAM's activities
call for the selection of a new site that could be developed to provide
the company with a second industrial estate. The choice should await the
completion of the Master Plan study for regional development.  But, once
the site is finally selected on the basis of an integrated land use plan,
the detailed survey work required for the proper planning of the estate
would be carried out by HEVECAM which has the expertise required for this
type of prospection. The studies would be financed by CCCE at a cost of
US$0.7 million.
Sector Plan
4.07      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government
would prepare, and submit to the Bank not later than December 31, 1981, a
long term plan for the future development of perennial tree crops in the
coastal zone of Cameroon. This study would take into account the manpower
and financial requirements of such a plan and would make recommendations
regarding the allocation of resources between industrial plantations,
intermediate scale operations and smallholding activities (para 9.01).
B.   Rubber Smallholdings
4.08      During the project period, efforts would be concentrated on
establishing techniques suitable for the incorporation of rubber into the
local farming system. For reasons discussed in para 3.15 a large-scale
program could not be realized under existing circumstances. The limited
experience acquired to date from other tree crop projects has shown that it
is difficult for farmers to give sufficient time to the tree crop during
immaturity to ensure its successful establishment.  Other more urgent matters,
such as the sowing or harvesting of food crops, intervene and absorb all
available labor at critical periods.
4.09      Both because of the root-disease problem, and because of labor
constraints, it would be unwise to encourage farmers to clear forest
and plant immediately with rubber.  The system that is likely to prove both
the most practicable and the most profitable to the farmer, would involve
an initial period of food crop husbandry, followed by combined rubber
establishment and food farming, with the area only being devoted purely to
rubber when the canopy closes and there is insufficient light for inter-row
cultivation. During at least the first two project years, the approach
would be essentially experimental with HEVECAM preparing areas that would
eventually be handed over to selected individuals or cooperative groups.
It would be premature at this stage to create a full extension service.
This would be disproportionately expensive, with so few potential partici-
pants, and the technical package is not yet sufficiently well defined to
ensure success. Because of the low population density in the area, and the



- 26 -
time required for any spontaneous settlement to occur in such a region,
substantial small holding activity in association with HEVECAM's estate
would not be expected until well beyond the project period, probably by
about 1987, with 1,000 ha of small holdings being created by 1990.
V. PRODUCTION
5.01      The first rubber production would be obtained in 1982 from areas
planted in 1976 under the first project. However, the tonnage would be
very small and, in the first two years, arrangements would be made for the
crop to be processed in the SAFACAM factory at Dizangue, near Edea (Map
IBRD 14373).  A summary of production year by year, from 1982 through 2022,
is given in Table III.1. This shows separately the tonnage attributable to
each phase. In Table V.1 production is shown per hectare and by individual
planting year, for the 9,300 ha that would be planted under the second
project. Maximum yield of 34,500 tons would be attained by about the year
2000 when the full 15,000 ha would have attained peak production of 2.3
tons a hectare. The area planted under the second project would contribute
an estimated 21,000 tons of this total.
5.02      A problem inherent in this type of project is the maintenance
of production in the long term. Economic considerations call for a rapid
initial development, and the failure to achieve the early planting targets
is one reason for the low financial rate of return now expected from the
first project alone (Table 7.2). However, a rapid development leads
inevitably to an equally rapid decline in production at the end of the
economic life of the first generation of trees. Unless new extension areas
are planted, and brought in to tapping to compensate for the decline in
yield from the original stand, the installed factory capacity would be
fully utilized for only about five years.  To maintain production at 35,000
tons a year would call for the creation of a plantation of at least 20,000
ha, so phased that about 3% of the area would be replanted each year.
Although the completion of a 15,000 ha plantation within the Niete concession
is envisaged in the project cost estimates, any subsequent Bank Group
participation in the further expansion of HEVECAM would be contingent upon
the acceptability of the sector plan (para 4.07) and evidence of the
long term financial viability of the Company's operations.
VI. MARKETS AND PRICES
6.01      Long-term prospects for natural rubber, its competitiveness with
synthetic elastomers, and the chances of its retaining the present propor-
tional share of the total elastomer market have been the subject of much
debate and intensive study. A recent World Bank/FAO report -- "The World
Rubber Economy: Structure, Changes, Prospects", (June, 1978) provides a
full treatment of the subject.



- 27 -
6.02      The long-term cost competitiveness of natural rubber would
seem to have been further strengthened by the recent increases in energy
prices. It was estimated in 1977 that, to be profitable, new investment in
styrenebutadiene production in Western Europe would require a future real
price (1977 terms) of USi 88 per kg. At that time the natural rubber
industry in Malaysia would have expected to achieve comparable profitability
at a price of only USe 77 per kg.  The total world demand for elastomers
is expected to increase at a rate of about 5% over the next decade and
about 3% between 1990 and 2000. If this demand is to be met, present
production of around 15 million tons has to be doubled over the next 20
years, to reach 30 million tons by the year 2000. For natural rubber to
maintain its present 30% to 35% of the market, production must be increased
to at least 10 million tons.
6.03      To put this in perspective, Malaysia, at present the world's
largest producer of natural rubber with a 45% market share, would have to
increase its area of rubber in tapping by about 60%, that is from 1.7 to
2.7 million hectares, making a total of over 3 million hectares devoted to
this one crop. Quite apart from the difficulty of finding another million
hectares of suitable land, in competition with currently more profitable
crops such as oil palm, there is the even more formidable problem of
attracting another 250,000 workers to the industry in order to ensure the
harvesting of the additional crop. Indonesia, the second largest producer,
with a smallholder-dominated rubber sector and a high proportion of over-
aged trees, would also be expected to have problems mobilizing the capital
and manpower resources required to maintain its market position. It may be
concluded, therefore, that there are excellent prospects for West African
countries, such as Cameroon, to acquire an increasing share of the trade.
6.04      The proposed HEVECAM project would produce technically specified
block rubbers equivalent to the Malaysian "SMRR" grades. The top quality
that would be aimed at, and should be attained by 60% of the crop, would
be grade "5L", light rubber with a dirt content below 0.05%. This currently
commands a small premium, about 5%, above the price of RSS1 (first quality
ribbed smoked sheets) which is the basis for market price forecasts.
However, the remaining 40% of the crop would be of lower quality, with
higher dirt content and darker color, and would command a price marginally
below RSS1. In estimating the price that HEVECAM rubber would fetch, it
has been assumed that the overall average would equal the RSSI price, and
that sales would be to Western Europe. Available data are based on cif
London forecasts. For 1982, when the first rubber would be marketed, the
price predicted by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Department
is USel3l.5 per kg (CFAF 276) in constant terms, or USe2l3.3 in current
prices. No forecasts have been issued beyond 1990. However, since maximum
production from the Niete plantings would not be achieved until 1999, and
the economic life of the plantation extends to 2022, alternative assumptions
have been tested in order to calculate a rate of return. A continuation of
the 1979-90 trend until 2000 would mean a real price increase of 1.5% per
year, or a price, in 1999, of CFAF 317 per kg (US151 in constant 1979



- 28 -
terms).  One hypothesis tested ('A') is that the price, having risen to
this level, would remain constant in real terms during the remaining life
of the plantation. An alternative hypothesis ('B'), allowing the real
price to continue rising at the same rate, would give a price of CFAF 447
per kg (USe2l3) in 2022. The average over the 41-year exploitation _
period would be CFAF 301 per kg under the first hypothesis and CFAF 327
under the second. These figures may be compared with the current (November,
1979) price of CFAF 310 per kg.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      The proposed project would form an integral part of HEVECAM's
development program. Financial rates of return have, therefore, been
calculated on the basis of a number of different options: (a) terminate
the program on completion of the 4,200 ha estateifinanced under the first
project (CR 574-CM); (b) proceed with the second project, adding another
9,300 ha, to make an estate of 13,500 ha; or (c) envisage a third phase,
planting 1,500 ha in 1984/85, to bring the planted area to 15,000 ha, as
originally proposed by Government in 1974. Yield and price assumptions are
as described in Chapters III, V, and VI. In view of the very high initial
investment in creating an industrial plantation of this type, and the
comparatively low cost of a replanting operation to take the estate into a
second generation, it would have been of interest, had it been practicable,
to extend the analysis over a longer time scale, encompassing two cycles.
Unfortunately uncertainties regarding (a) future prices, and (b) the yield
potential, under more advanced technology, of the improved clones that will
be available in 20 to 30 years' time, make such an exercise too speculative
to be of real value.
7.02      Table 7.1 shows, in constant 1979 terms, the total investment
required per hectare, excluding debt service charges, for each phase up to
the time when the cash flow becomes positive, and also the net benefit per
hectare over the life of the plaptation.

7.03      The second phase alone, based on the incremental costs of creating
an additional 9,300 ha of plantation, shows a higher rate of return,
about 11%. For the final 1,500 ha, again based on incremental costs, the
rate of return would be about 17%. However, these figures are of less
practical importance than those set out in Table 7.2 which show rates of
return for estates of different total areas.
7.04      With a 15,000 hectare plantation at full maturity HEVECAM's
annual operating costs would be about CFAF 5.5 billion (US$25 million), in
constant 1979 terms. Revenues from sales of rubber would exceed twice this
amount, CFAF 11.5 billion (US$52 million). Table 7.3 shows approximately
how the costs at maturity would be distributed over the major categories of
expenditure.

7.05      Table VII.1 shows HEVECAM's Projected Profit and Loss Account
until FY2000 based on the assumption that the company's expansion would
cease after completion of a 15,000 ha estate within the Niete concession.
By FY1986, when annual rubber production would have reached some 6,000
tons, with average yields of 1.2 tons per hectare, HEVECAM's first net
profit of CFAF 249 million (US$1.2 million) would appear. By the year
2000, when yields should reach the estimated peak of 2.3 tons per hectare,
annual income from sales would be almost double the operating costs. Over
the period 1975-2000 cumulative net profit in current terms would be CFAF
98 billion (US$467 million). With cumulative depreciation of CFAF 41
billion (US$194 million), the internal cash generation during the period
would be CFAF 139 billion (US$661 million).

7.06      Table VII.2 provides estimated Balance Sheets at the end of
the first project, 1978-79, and annually thereafter through the year
2000. The present debt:equity ratio of about 1:1 rises to 2:1 by the
end of the project period as a result of additional long term borrowings
of CFAF 14.2 billion (US$67.8 million) during the five years. The debt:equity
ratio presented in Table VII.2 assumes that all further financing required
to complete the 15,000 ha development at Niete would be provided by Govern-
ment in the form of equity. All self generated funds are shown as retained
earnings.
7.07      Although long term plans for HEVECAM's future expansion remain
tentative, it is probable that, rather than being distributed as dividends
these self generated funds would be reinvested in new plantings. Given that
HEVECAM were required to sustain annual planting programs of 2,000 ha for a
further 15 years, a figure compatible with Government's regional planning
objectives, the company would continue to need external financial support
throughout the period.  Cash flows for HEVECAM and Government, based on the
15,000 ha Niete development only are shown in Tables VII.3 and VII.4.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project would provide continuing support to Government's plans
for the economic development of the Kribi region. Initiated under the first
HEVECAM project in 1975, the development of this sparsely populated, and
hitherto largely neglected, forest region is keyed to the expansion of indus-
trial scale plantation agriculture. Depleted, logged-over forest of little
economic value would be rèplaced by perennial tree crops, principally rubber,
oil palm and coconut. Concentration on these three crops, all well suited to
the region, would reduce the country's present heavy dependence on cocoa and
coffee for its agricultural export earnings. Moreover, tree crops of this
type are probably the most satisfactory alternative, in environmental terms,
to the maintenance of a forest cover on these erodable, fragile soils.
Reforestation with hardwood timber, or pulpwood, plantations might provide a
viable alternative if labor constraints should prove a limiting factor to
plantation development on the scale currently envisaged.
8.02      While industrial estates would provide the focal points for
development of the region, Government's long-term plan calls for the
creation of associated smallholding complexes. The estates would provide
local farmers with technical guidance, processing facilities, and an
assured market for their crop. However, the success of smallholder programs
in this underpopulated region would be contingent upon Government's ability
to mobilize labor and create new settlements. When the first HEVECAM
project was prepared, the assumption was made that most of the estate's
labor requirements would be met by unemployed workers coming down from the
north. This has not happened; the northern plainsmen are not attracted by
the totally alien environment of the southern forests and fewer than 5% of
the present work force are northerners. About 45% come from the south
central province, 32% from the west and 16% from the coastal province, all
areas where there is competition for labor. Although the problem of
availability of sufficient labor does not pose an immediate threat to



- 32 -
HEVECAM, it could, nevertheless in the long term, hamper the programs
envisaged by Government for the three major agro-industrial development
corporations, CAMDEV, SOCAPALM and HEVECAM (para 8.09).
Economic Rate of Return
8.03      The readily quantifiable benefits directly attributable to the
project would derive from sales of rubber on the export market. The real,
but difficult to evaluate, additional benefits that would accrue to the
region as a result of this development initiative have been excluded from
the following analysis, which deals only with HEVECAM's industrial estate
operations. All costs and benefits (revenues from rubber sales) have been
expressed in constant 1979 terms, net of identifiable taxes, but inclusive of
physical contingencies. Foreign exchange costs have been calculated on the
basis of US$1 = CFAF 210, while local costs have been adjusted by a standard
conversion factor of 0.73 to take account of present distortions in the
economy.  Labor has been costed at market rates.
8.04      Under the above assumptions the economic rate of return (ERR)
expected from phase two, the development of an additional 9,300 hectares of
plantation, would be about 15%. The originally planned 5,800 ha first
phase would have been expected to have a rate of return of about 10% but
termination of HEVECAM's development at 4,200 hectares, the area actually
achieved under first project financing, would result in an ERR for the
first project of under 8%.  The two phases combined, making an estate of
13,500 hectares, would yield a return of about 11%; this would be increased
by 0.4% by completion of the 15,000 ha.

La   Crossover values indicate the changes in costs or benefits required
to reduce the net present value to zero (cost - benefits) or,
alternatively, to bring the economic rate of return to 9%, the
assumed opportunity cost of capital in Cameroon.



- 35 -
8.08      Table 8.4 shows the impact on rates of return and present values
of: (î) a 10% increase in costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in benefits, and
(iii) a one-year lag in the realization of benefits. In a follow-up
project of this nature, where appraisal estimates were based on current
performance, real cost increases greater than 10% are considered unlikely.
It is also considered unlikely that benefits would be more than 10%
below the appraisal estimates. Table 8.5 shows that for the first project,
either costs would have to go down by 9% or 11%, or benefits rise by 10% or
13% (depending on price assumptions), before the ERR would reach the
assumed opportunity cost of capital. However, a 13,500 hectare plantation
should prove an economically sound investment: costs could increase by 19%
or benefits fall by 16% before the rate of return would drop below the 9%
opportunity cost of capital. On a 15,000 ha estate, using price assumption
'B', cost increases of 28% or a fall in benefits of 22% would be required
to reduce the net present value to zero or the rate of return to 9%.
Risks
8.09      It is expected that measures already taken by HEVECAM would
ensure the availability of sufficient labour to implement the project as
planned. In the longer term, however, there may be some difficulty in
obtaining the skilled tappers needed to realize the full production poten-
tial of these high yielding rubber clones. A sound regional development
plan, based on the as yet uncompleted Kribi Master Plan study financed
under the first project, should ensure that appropriate measures are taken
to resolve the labour issue before it becomes critical. The principal
agricultural risk would be 'Fomes' root disease. However, the precautions
that have been incorporated in the project design (methods of deforestation
and land preparation) are considered adequate to ensure a satisfactory
stand of trees at maturity.
IX. AGRElà4ENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
9.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained on the following
points:
(a)  Government would undertake to provide financing to maintain,
bring to maturity, and effectively exploit plantings made under
the first, and proposed second, projects and also to plant,
and subsequently maintain, under a third phase, the additional
