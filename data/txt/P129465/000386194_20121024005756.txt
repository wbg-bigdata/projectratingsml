Operation Type              Second in a series of two programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs)
Main Policy Areas           In line with priorities set by the Government, this Second Programmatic Fiscal
                            Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan supports the
                            implementation of reforms in three main policy reform areas: (a) budget
                            predictability and stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c)
                            disaster risk financing.
Key Outcome Indicators      (a) Budget Predictability and Stability:
                            • The central government structural fiscal balance is reduced to -2.4 percent of
                                GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2013.
                            • The Consultative Committee concludes in its annual statement that fiscal rule
                                implementation is satisfactory by 2013.
                            • Central Government non-oil tax revenue is increased to 13.2 percent of GDP
                                in 2013.

                                Guarantee Fund (FOSYGA) for medical goods and services outside the
                                Mandatory Benefit Package of the contributory regime do not exceed COP
                                2,400 billion by 2013 (recurrent expenditure).
                            (c) Disaster Risk Financing:
                            • The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) has implemented three
                                financial instruments to mitigate natural disaster risks by 2013, consistent
                                with the recommendations of the national Disaster Risk Financing Strategy.
Program Development         Enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience of economic growth.
Objective(s) and            The programmatic DPL operation supports the long-term outcome of ‘improved
Contribution to Country     fiscal, financial, and social risk management’ of the World Bank Group’s Country
Partnership Strategy        Partnership Strategy under the theme of ‘inclusive growth with enhanced
                            productivity’.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The DPL operation is subject to two types of risks: (1) A deteriorating external
                            economic environment. Colombia is exposed to three types of external shocks,
                            including: a slowdown in economic activity in the US, a decline in oil prices, and
                            global financial market turmoil. By way of mitigation, the country has a high
                            economic policy response capacity. (2) Risks to reform program implementation.
                            The absence of legislative measures reduces risk as program implementation is
                            entirely under the control of the Executive. The overall risk classification is
                            considered low.

                 IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
     SECOND PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND GROWTH
        RESILIENCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN TO COLOMBIA

                                  I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Colombia has requested a Second Programmatic Fiscal
Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan for US$200 million. The
First DPL for US$300 million, approved by the Board in July 2011, supported the legislative
approval of several important fiscal reforms. Building on the progress achieved under DPL I,
this Program Document proposes a second DPL supporting the sustained implementation of
these reforms. The request underscores the Government’s continued interest in engaging with
the World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal management.

2.       The fiscal reform program supported by the loan series seeks to enhance fiscal
sustainability and strengthen growth resilience. The program includes a series of measures
that can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a) budget predictability and
stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c) disaster risk financing. The first
area includes the implementation of a fiscal rule and a tax reform. The second area covers
important legal and regulatory changes to the health insurance system, including the update of
the mandatory benefit package and the creation of a contingency fund. The final area
includes the development of a national disaster financing strategy and measures to enhance
agricultural insurance coverage within a holistic agricultural risk management strategy.

3.      The Government of Colombia has made substantial progress in implementing its
ambitious fiscal reform program. During the first half of the Presidential term, Congress
approved a series of major fiscal reforms, including: a fiscal rule, a reform of the royalties
system, a fiscal sustainability constitutional change, tax reforms, and a health law. As
detailed in this document, the Government has made good progress in implementing this
legislative agenda. Fiscal reforms, combined with strong macroeconomic management and a
solid economic performance, prompted all three major rating agencies to upgrade Colombia’s
foreign-currency bond credit rating to investment grade in 2011. In August 2012, Standard
and Poor’s became the first rating agency to raise its outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘positive’ citing
the effective implementation of fiscal reforms and strengthened crisis resilience.

4.      The Bank is committed to a long-term engagement in support of the
Government’s fiscal reform program. The proposed operation is fully consistent with the
Bank’s business model in Colombia, which emphasizes a strategic and integrated client
engagement in support of selected development outcomes through three main lines of
business, including financial, knowledge and convening services. To complement and
enhance its policy dialogue on the fiscal reform agenda, the Bank engaged in a new series of
Fiscal Policy Programmatic Knowledge Services (PKS) in 2011. Under this PKS, the Bank is
providing a range of analytical and convening services in support of the formulation the
Government’s envisaged reforms of Colombia’s tax and pension systems. In 2012-13, the
PKS will continue supporting the Government’s fiscal management program.

5.    The proposed development policy loan fits into a broader strategic engagement of
the World Bank in support of improved fiscal and risk management in Colombia. The


                                               1
following examples are illustrative and include some of the most recent and noteworthy
activities (see Table 1 and Table 4 for a complete list):

(a) Budget Predictability and Stability.
    • Tax expenditure study: In support of a planned tax reform, the Bank analyzed the
       increased use of tax incentives and benefits in Colombia and advised the Government
       on how to improve the management of this policy instrument.
    • Fiscal policy and equity analysis: Given the Government’s aim of reducing income
       inequality, the Bank prepared a paper on fiscal redistribution to illustrate the potential
       use of Colombia’s tax-transfer system to achieve this goal.
    • Ex-ante tax reform simulation: The Bank is carrying out simulations to estimate the
       revenue and distributional impact of a set of personal income tax reforms.

(b) Social Security Liabilities.
    • Health care financing: The Bank developed a proposal for a new risk adjustment
       formula of the premiums in the harmonized Mandatory Health Benefit Package.
    • Pension analysis: In support of a proposed pension reform, the Bank prepared two
       studies to analyze reform options to increase the coverage and equity of the pension
       system in a fiscally sustainable manner. The Bank also convened government and
       multilateral agencies on a regular basis to discuss pension reform.

(c) Disaster risk financing.
    • Disaster risk financing: A first Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT
        DDO) DPL provided Colombia with an immediate source of liquidity (US$150
        million) during the recent La Niña in December 2010. 1 A second CAT DDO for
        US$250 million was approved by the Board on July 10, 2012. The Bank has also been
        advising the Government on its National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy.
    • Fiscal Risk Management: The Bank organized a South-South study tour for the
        Government of the Philippines to exchange experiences with Colombia and Mexico.
    • Agricultural risks: The Bank is providing technical assistance on agricultural risks,
        including on the new Agricultural Risk Management and Financing Directorate.

6.      The indicative triggers for preparing this second DPL have largely been met. In
the policy area of budget predictability and stability, this includes progress on introducing the
fiscal rule and on issuing the implementing regulations of Law 1430 (a tax reform). In the
area of social security liability management, the Government updated the mandatory health
package. In the area of disaster risk financing, a new strategy on managing the fiscal risks
associated with natural disasters was published. On the other hand, and while progress was
registered, envisaged reforms of debt and cash management took longer than expected and
were therefore not included as prior actions. The Government remains committed to making
progress in this area: the new debt strategy, currently under preparation, is expected to be
implemented in January 2013, and, the issuance of a new decree partially implementing the
expanded Treasury Single Account was imminent at the time of loan preparation.

 The 2010-11 La Niña caused heavy and prolonged rainfall in Colombia and has been classified as one of the
country’s most severe natural disasters in recent time. See Section V.C for details.

7.      The expected development outcomes from overall Bank engagement in the area
of fiscal and risk management are summarized as follows. In the area of improved budget
predictability and stability, Bank interventions support two medium-term outcomes: improved
management of commodity revenues to facilitate an efficient and effective public spending
pattern at national and subnational levels, and; a more efficient, equitable, and simpler tax
system that collects sufficient resources to finance development. In the area of improved
social security liability management, the Bank supports the adequate and equitable access to
health services and pension benefits within the framework of fiscal sustainability. Finally, in
terms of disaster risk financing, the Bank is supporting two transitory processes: from ex-post
to ex-ante risk management policies (i.e. from reactive to preventive measures), and; a
gradual transfer of risks from the public to the private sector (for instance through increased
use of insurance instruments).


                               II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

8.       Colombia has undergone a transformation over the past decade. It has gradually
moved away from the internal violence, drug trafficking, and weak institutions that has
historically plagued the country. In that context, the Santos Administration recently initiated
negotiations for peace. Today, Colombia has a resurgent economy with promising prospects.
It is a safer, more stable country that is popular with foreign investors, and it aspires to join
the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) group of countries.

                             A. Recent Economic Developments
9.      Colombia was the fastest country in the region to recover from the 2008-09 global
economic crisis. The economy recovered after two quarters compared to the regional average
of close to six quarters (World Bank, 2012d). Colombia’s strong macroeconomic framework
combined with financial sector resilience and an appropriate regulatory response helped the
economy cushion the shock and recover from its effects.

10.     The economy expanded by a solid 5.9 percent in 2011 – one of the best growth
performances in the region. This pace of expansion brought Colombia’s growth rate above
the regional average of 4.5 percent and close to that of emerging markets of 6.2 percent.
Private domestic demand, supported by high consumer and investor confidence and access to
cheap credit, led the growth process. On the supply side the expansion was spear-headed by
the oil/mining, financial services, and commerce sectors.

11.    The growth process was accompanied by substantial employment creation.
Economic growth was sufficiently labor intensive to generate about 1¼ million new jobs in
2011. The manufacturing, commerce, agriculture, and other services sector accounted for the
bulk of job creation. Better economic conditions and demographics also increased labor
market participation by one million people. In effect, unemployment declined by about ¼
million people, while the rate of unemployment declined from 11.8 to 10.8 percent in 2011.

12.     Oil sector activity reached an all-time high in 2011. The country came closer to
reaching the target of producing 1 million barrels per day. This, combined with record high
prices, resulted in a 70 percent expansion in oil exports and a 41 percent increase in total
exports. Foreign direct investment– most of which originated in the oil and mining sector –

                                               4
almost doubled in 2011 to gross US$13.2 billion (4 percent of GDP), bringing Colombia’s
share of global foreign direct investment (FDI) up from 0.5 to 0.9 percent.

13.     Despite the export boom, the current account deficit remained unchanged owing
to an equally substantial increase in imports. Colombia is one of the few oil-exporting
countries which is running an external current account deficit (3.0 percent of GDP in 2011) in
times with very favorable international prices. While the trade surplus improved from 0.8 to
1.7 percent of GDP in 2010-11, the impact was dampened by a strong 35 percent increase in
imports driven, in part, by currency appreciation. Like many other oil exporters, Colombia
runs a deficit on the external current account owing to a deficit on the services balance and the
repatriation of profits by foreign companies based in the country. Both items deteriorated in
2011 with the strongest effect related to repatriated profits. Net foreign direct investment
financed about half of the current account deficit that year, while external debt increased by
half a percentage point of GDP to 23.2 percent.

14.     Colombia exhibited a relatively strong fiscal performance in 2011 thanks to
strong growth, favorable oil prices, and tax reforms. The deficit of the combined public
sector was reduced from 3.3 percent in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2011, while the primary balance
turned positive from -0.4 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP. This, in turn, contributed to a
decline in the public debt ratio from 36.9 to 34.2 percent of GDP. The key driver was a
strong increase in the central Government tax-to-GDP ratio which rose by 1.3 percentage
points (see Section III for details).

15.     The gradual appreciation and volatile movements of the Colombia Peso remains
a substantial macroeconomic policy concern. The Colombian peso (nominal as well as real
effective rate) has grown gradually stronger in recent years in response to significant capital
inflows (primarily foreign direct investment) and improved fiscal policy (see Annex 1 for
details). At the same time, the flexible exchange has exhibited substantial volatility, acting as
a shock absorber in times of global economic crises and uncertainty (Figure 1, Panel d).

16.    The authorities recently stepped up their efforts to reduce the pace of currency
appreciation. Over the past couple of years, the Central Bank has been managing a dollar
purchasing program (of about US$20 million per day) to smoothen out excess volatility in the
adjustment path and international reserves have increased gradually as a result. The
Government has also intervened, including through the delayed repatriation of dollar
denominated dividends from Ecopetrol (the partially state-owned oil company). In August
2012, following a sustained Peso rally, the Central Bank increased average daily purchases to
US$28 million while the Government engaged in open market operations worth US$700
million. More broadly, the Government is also working to strengthen competitiveness
through increased infrastructure investments and tax reform.

17.     The economy slowed down in 2012, mainly as a result of a deteriorating external
environment. Economic growth is expected to fall to 4.3 percent in 2012 at a rate close to
potential. The continued meager economic performance in the US combined with lower
prices for Colombian exports is increasingly affecting the domestic economy. A tight
monetary policy stance also help explain the slowdown, though monetary policy was loosened
during the second half of 2012 (as explained next). The ongoing process of fiscal
consolidation also dampens economic activity. Finally, further growth in oil production has


                                               5
been hampered by a recent rise in attacks against oil pipelines, delaying the country’s
aspirations of reaching the goal of producing 1 million barrels per day. 2

18.    In response to slower domestic economic activity, the Central Bank has initiated
a process of monetary loosening. Since August 2012, the policy interest rate has been
reduced by 50 basis points to 4.75 percent. This followed a period of tightening in which the
monetary authorities had gradually raised the rate by 225 basis points since the start of 2011
to reduce the risk of overheating. Further interest rate cuts to boost the economy would be
expected during the rest of the year, especially in the context of low and declining inflation
(3.0 percent in July 2012). Lower interest rates would also reduce portfolio capital inflows,
thereby alleviating appreciation pressures somewhat.

19.     The financial sector remains sound and credit growth is decelerating. The
banking system is well-capitalized with a reported capital adequacy ratio of 15.3 percent in
March 2012 and a tier 1 ratio of 12.5 percent. Colombia’s banks are among the most
profitable in the region with return to assets and return to equity amounting to 3.8 and 26.0
percent, respectively. Nonperforming loans are manageable at 2.8 percent. Credit to the
private sector has slowed down from 22 percent y/y in October 2011 to 18 percent y/y in May
2012. Non-mortgage consumer loans accounted for almost 30 percent of total credit in May
2012 (up from 18 percent in 2004) with mortgages only explaining 12.5 percent of the total.
Credit growth in recent years has mainly derived from an increase in the average size of loans
as opposed to an increase in the number of debtors.

20.     In summary, Colombia’s economic performance has been impressive in recent
years – the combined result of good luck and good policy. Favorable international oil
prices certainly played a role with positive effects on foreign direct investment, exports,
growth and fiscal outcomes. At the same time, good policies have supported positive
outcomes. Fiscal consolidation reduced the sovereign risk premium, strengthened the
resilience of the economy to external shocks, and enhanced the power of fiscal and monetary
policy to act counter-cyclically (see Annex 1 for details). Colombia currently has the lowest
EMBI (Emerging Market Bond Index) interest rate spread in the region. The country also
exhibits solid liquidity management as evidenced by rapid reserve accumulation and has
tapped international markets for external financing at favorable terms.

 Between September 2011 and April 2012, Colombia experienced an average of 12.5 attacks per month against
oil pipelines. By comparison, the period between January 2009 and August 2011, registered an average of 2.6
monthly attacks.

                                     B. Poverty and Inequality
21.     Economic growth has been accompanied by poverty reduction. Between 2002 and
2011 headcount poverty fell from 49.4 to 34.1 percent, while the proportion of the population
that could not satisfy basic nutritional needs (the extreme poor) declined from 17.6 to 10.6
percent (Table 3). Although this is a positive development, Colombia’s progress in reducing
poverty, given its strong economic performance, falls below that of regional peers. Between
2005 and 2010, poverty reduction in Colombia was exclusively the result of economic growth
rather than reductions in inequality. This experience contrasts with that of Latin America,
where falling inequality explains about 40 percent of poverty reduction (World Bank 2012e).

22.     Colombia has one of the most unequal income distributions in the world. The
country has the 7th highest Gini coefficient worldwide and ranks 2nd both in regional
comparisons and among upper-middle income countries. While other Latin American and
middle-income countries experienced declining inequality over the past decade, Colombia did
not. Regional inequality declined because of reduced labor income disparities, explained by a
reduction in skills premiums as education access expanded. There is also evidence to suggest
that fiscal redistributive policies have played a positive role in reducing regional income
inequality. In Colombia, however, the expansion of education across the population has been
inadequate, while the current tax-transfer system is ineffective as a redistributive tool (World
Bank 2012e; Moller 2012).

23.     Despite high income inequality, the equality of opportunities index suggests
improvements. The World Bank Human Opportunity Index, which captures access to basic
services for children while adjusting for the fairness in its distribution among the population,
places Colombia above the regional average. Between 1997 and 2008, there was significant
progress in terms of improving children’s opportunities to receiving health care, attending
preschool, completing middle and high school, and having access to electricity and
telephones. While significant challenges remain (in terms of food security, nutrition,
education and health quality, access to water and victimization), improvements in the equality
of opportunities of children offers some reassurance that this may eventually translate into
better inequality and poverty outcomes for the next generation of Colombians (Velez et al,
2010).

                                    C. Macroeconomic Outlook
24.     Colombia has a robust macroeconomic framework, which rests on three
mutually re-enforcing pillars: (a) a responsible fiscal policy based on a credible medium-
term fiscal framework, anchored in a structural balance rule, (b) a monetary policy based on
an inflation targeting regime complemented by a floating exchange rate with moderate
interventions, and (c) sound macro and micro prudential policies combined with a solid
financial system. This framework provides a solid basis for the country’s future economic

                                                    9
prospects. In the short to medium term, aggregate demand is likely to be boosted by
consumer and investor confidence, infrastructure investments, and the implementation of the
Free Trade Agreement with the US. The protracted Euro Zone crisis, on the other hand, is
expected to continue dragging down the global economy in the coming years, with negative
spillover effects for Colombia.

25.     The projections described below focus on the short and medium-term outlook.
They incorporate the latest prospects for the global economy as well as recent Central Bank
monetary and exchange rate policy announcements. The baseline scenario follows the latest
update of the 2012 IMF World Economic Outlook, which assumes: (1) a gradual, but slow,
recovery of US economic activity reflecting ongoing weakness in house prices, pressures to
deleverage, and a weak labor market; (2) a short-lived recession in the Euro area as a result of
fiscal consolidation and deleveraging – without major disruptions to the monetary union, and;
(3) continued elevated oil prices arising from global supply constraints and geopolitical
tensions with a gradual declining trend. Within this global context, the domestic economic
policy mix is expected to be tight on the fiscal side and accommodative on the monetary side.
In this baseline scenario, the Colombian economy is expected to develop as follows (see
Table 2 for details):

•   Growth and inflation. Following the strong economic growth performance in 2011 of 5.9
    percent, real GDP is projected to moderate to 4.3 percent in 2012 and converge to its
    potential rate of 4.4 percent in the medium term. Private consumption and investment are
    expected to sustain domestic demand growth. Inflation will stay on target of around 3
    percent over the projection period, kept in check by timely Central Bank interventions.

•   Fiscal accounts. The Central Government fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 2.8
    percent of GDP in 2011 to 2.2 percent in 2014, as revenue growth outpaces a gradual rise
    of public spending. The Government is expected to meet the fiscal rule interim target for
    the central government structural deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP by 2014. In light of
    Colombia’s solid track record of fiscal management, the authorities are expected to take
    the necessary corrective policy measures needed to meet this target.

•   External accounts. The external current account deficit widened during the 2010-11
    economic recovery as imports accelerated and factor income outflows increased. In the
    medium term, the external deficit will gradually narrow again and is expected to be
    financed by continued high inflows of foreign direct investment. The pace of export
    growth is expected to slow down owing to capacity constraints in the oil/mining sector,
    while imports will grow slower on account of more moderate economic growth.

26.     Colombia is not immune to a global economic crisis, but the country is very well
prepared to respond. Colombia’s chief vulnerabilities relate to three types of external
shocks: a slowdown in economic activity in the US, a decline in oil prices, and global
financial market turmoil. By way of mitigation, the country has a high capacity and room to
respond to shocks through counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies (Box 1). The recent
rise in global food prices, on the other hand, is not expected to constitute a major risk to the
baseline scenario (Box 2).

27.     While fiscal and external accounts are vulnerable to a decline in oil prices, there
are reasons to remain cautiously optimistic. Commodity dependence adds fiscal risks. Oil
revenues account for about 16 percent of total public revenues. For each US$10 decline in the
oil price per barrel central government revenue is reduced by 0.4 percent of GDP (with a one
year lag). In the event of another global economic crisis, oil prices would likely fall sharply,
which would reduce government revenues and increase the external current account deficit
(which in 2011 was 3.0 percent of GDP). On the other hand, Colombia is an investment
grade country that enjoys solid investor confidence. Healthy levels of foreign direct
investment to the hydrocarbon and financial sectors will continue to finance most of the
external current account deficit. In addition, the government continues to make efforts to
rebuild fiscal buffers that could cushion the negative impact of a decline in oil prices. In
particular, the fiscal rule supports a steady decline in the fiscal deficit over the medium term.

                                         D. Debt Sustainability

28.      A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that the trajectory of public debt
is declining in the baseline scenario. The DSA was prepared by IMF staff in August 2012
and is consistent with the macroeconomic assumptions outlined in Table 2 (see Annex 4 for
details). In the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from
34.2 percent in 2011 to 30.7 percent in 2014 (of the Combined Public Sector, gross). Given
the large share of central government debt on fixed-terms and in local currency, interest rate
and exchange rate shocks have a modest impact on the debt trajectory. The debt outlook is
also not severely affected by shocks to economic growth or the primary balance. Contingent
fiscal liabilities represent the single most important risk to debt sustainability, although the
simulated shock of a ten percent of GDP increase does not alter the declining debt trajectory.
In sum, public debt sustainability is not a major concern in the medium term.

29.      The most important contingent liabilities relate to legal claims against the state
and natural disasters. 3 According to the Medium Term Fiscal Framework 2012 document,
the net present value of legal claims against the state amount to 69 percent of GDP in 2012-
2022, of which 54 percent of GDP relate to a single case (a land dispute 4). 5 The contingent
liability associated with natural disasters is estimated at 11-18 percent of GDP for the 2011-50
period (World Bank, 2011). Other contingent liabilities, for which estimates exist, include
(expressed in NPV, 2012-2022): infrastructure guarantees (0.29 percent of GDP) and public
credit operations (0.17 percent of GDP). No estimates were available for fiscal risks
associated with State Owned Enterprises, but the latter are generally very well managed and
have historically produced fiscal surpluses in the aggregate.


3
  Colombia is one of the pioneers in Latin America in terms of the disclosure and management of contingent
liabilities. See MFPC (2010) for a detailed overview of Contingent Liabilities in Colombia. The Government of
the Philippines recently visited Colombia on a study tour on this topic, organized by the Bank as a part of the
South-South Knowledge Exchange Program.
4
  The Government recently created a unit within the Ministry of Justice to strengthen the legal defense of the
State. The likelihood that the Government would lose the legal land dispute is considered low, according to the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (2012), in light of the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development already has won a previous case, which was subsequently appealed.
5
  Annual budgetary expenditures to settle legal disputes are relatively low, but rising: COP 800 billion in 2011
(0.12 percent of GDP) compared to COP 300 billion in 2005. The Government does not provision for these
annual losses, which have been partially financed by issuing government paper.

           Box 1. The Potential Impacts on Colombia of a Global Economic Crisis
The sources of contagion on Colombia’s economy from a potential global economic crisis are
expected to be similar to those experienced in the 2008/09 crisis – namely the trade, financial and
expectations channels:
   • The trade channel. Colombia is the fourth largest oil producer in the region, and the fourth
       largest coal exporter in the world. Lower external demand (mainly for oil and mining
       products) combined with reduced world prices would increase Colombia’s current account
       deficit. The oil and mining sector contributed by about 20 percent to Colombia’s growth rate
       in 2011, implying a non-negligible aggregate demand effect.
   • The financial channel. In the event of a global crisis external and domestic financing
       conditions would tighten. Currency depreciation would intensify as flight-to-safety would
       lead to a reversal in net capital flows. Financial markets dislocations could cause strain on
       brokerage houses and other leveraged investors.
   • The expectations channel. Given that GDP growth is driven primarily by private domestic
       demand, consumer and investor confidence are critical for future aggregate demand growth.
       A shock to confidence can also reduce credit growth as banks raise lending standards.
Colombia is well positioned to respond to a crisis, particularly on the monetary/exchange rate
and financial fronts:
   • Monetary easing is likely to be the first line of defense. The period of interest rate hikes
       since 2011 created room for monetary easing, which the authorities are currently exploiting.
       The monetary policy rate could be reduced further, while closely monitoring impacts on
       consumer and asset price inflation, as well as credit growth.
   • The flexible exchange rate is an effective shock absorber. The flexibility of the exchange
       rate regime allows the currency to depreciate rapidly, as happened during 2008/09. Along
       with the relatively comfortable financial cushions, this can help to absorb the impact of a
       potential reversal in net capital flows.
   • Colombia’s financial sector is sound and it has proven resilient to the global financial
       crisis and the associated economic slowdown. The Colombian banking system is primarily
       domestically owned with limited exposure to European banks.
   • External financing needs are manageable. The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) with the IMF
       (see Annex 3 for details) and an expected high inflow of foreign direct investment provide
       sufficient cover.
But Colombia remains moderately vulnerable on the fiscal and social fronts:
   • Fiscal vulnerability: Colombia is highly exposed to a fall in the international price of oil. Oil
       revenues account for about 16 percent of total public revenues. For each US$10 decline in the
       oil price per barrel central government revenue is reduced by 0.4 percent of GDP (with a one
       year lag). That said, Colombia has strong fiscal institutions and moderate public debt levels,
       and could thus engage in some counter-cyclical stimulus within the fiscal rule framework.
   • Social vulnerability: The relatively high poverty elasticity to growth observed during the
       2008-09 crisis implies that an economic slowdown would have a more severe impact on
       Colombia’s poor than elsewhere in the region. The recent one percentage point decline in the
       unemployment rate may also partially reverse if growth comes to a halt. On the other hand,
       Colombia has a relatively strong basis for responding to a potential crisis using existing safety
       net programs, temporary employment programs, and training programs. 6
                                         Source: World Bank (2012c).

 Colombia has a well articulated social safety net comprising inter alia of a conditional cash transfers program
(Familias en Accion) and an integral approach to supporting poor families through the Unidos strategy, as well
as subsidized health insurance for the poor. Social programs share a unique targeting mechanism, are relatively
well institutionalized with strong management and information systems, and are well funded without having
experienced spending cuts in times of crises.

                                                      12
               Box 2. The impact of Higher Global Food Prices in Colombia
Global prices of many key agricultural commodities rose dramatically in July 2012. These
increases took the prices of wheat and maize to more than twice their level of June 2010, while the
World Bank’s overall food price index has risen by 51 percent.

Colombian food price inflation has not yet been affected owing to the time lag in the
transmission from global to local prices. Food price inflation in Colombia was 3.8 (y/y) percent in
July 2012, compared to 4.8 percent a year earlier. Food inflation contributed by 1.1 percentage points
to the overall rate of 3.0 percent (the weight of food items in the Consumer Price Inflation index is
28.2 percent).

Colombia experienced a rise in food prices during the 2008 global food price crisis. As illustrated
in Figure 2, Colombian food price inflation peaked at 14 percent in August 2008 – four months after
global price inflation had peaked at 70 percent. If this time lag repeats itself, Colombian food price
inflation may rise towards the end of 2012.

Food prices in Colombia may not increase as much as elsewhere in the region. According to the
IMF (2011), Colombia has the lowest estimated pass-through among major Latin American economies
(about 0.1), and this estimate is not even statistically significant.

Given that poor people devote a higher share of their household budgets to food, they experience
a higher rate of inflation than the rest of the population when food prices rise. In July 2012,
annual inflation of low income groups was 48 percent higher than high income groups and 17 percent
higher than the middle income group.

Country specific estimations for the potential poverty impact for Colombia are not yet available.
Preliminary results for an unrepresentative sample of five Latin American countries suggest a modest
impact, except for Guatemala where poverty could increase by 1.8 percentage points (Ivanic and
Martin, 2012). Given the low-pass through coefficient for Colombia, the poverty impact would be
expected to be modest.

As a net exporter of food, Colombia may even reap benefits from higher agricultural prices. In
2011, the country exported around US$5 billion (9 percent of total goods exports) of agricultural
products and coffee and showed a food trade surplus of US$2.4 billion (0.7 percent of GDP). The
main export product is coffee (US$2.6 billion), followed by flowers (US$1.2 billion) and bananas
(US$815 million). In spite of the commodity boom, Colombian agricultural exports have lost global
market share, declining from an average 0.68 in the period 1995-1999 to 0.55 in 2000-2009.
Nonetheless, Colombia has a great potential to expand agricultural production and exports and the
Government is taking measures to increase productivity.

                                                                                      13
30.    In summary, the analysis presented in this Section (II) concludes that Colombia’s
macroeconomic policy framework is deemed adequate. Medium-term fiscal policy
remains prudent, in part as a result of policy reforms supported by this operation, with
proposed fiscal adjustments already well underway. Monetary and exchange rate policies are
also supportive of macroeconomic and financial stability.


                          III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

31.     During the first half of its four-year term, the Santos Administration has carried
out a comprehensive set of fiscal reforms. Overall, the reform program has enhanced fiscal
sustainability while strengthening the economy’s resilience to economic shocks. The program
includes a series of measures that can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a)
budget predictability and stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c) disaster
risk financing management.

                          A. Budget Predictability and Stability

32.     A recently introduced fiscal rule reduces and caps the structural fiscal deficit.
The rule establishes a gradual reduction of the central government structural fiscal deficit
(adjusted for the commodity and economic cycles) to reach 1.0 percent by 2022. Excess
fiscal resources will primarily be used to reduce the public debt burden though accumulation
of funds in the macroeconomic savings and stabilization fund may also be an option in the
long term. The fiscal rule facilitates the temporary use of countercyclical policy in times of
sluggish economic growth. Implementation of the rule is monitored by an independent
committee. (See Section V for further details).

33.    A reform of the royalties system enhances equity of subnational government
revenues derived from commodities production. The newly created National Royalties
System departs in important ways from how these resources were hitherto distributed and
managed. Effective from 2012, royalties are now received by all departments and practically
all municipalities and not just in producing jurisdictions as was previously the case. A share
of these resources is saved in a sub-national savings and stabilization fund to smoothen
commodity cycles (see below). Moreover, the rules for spending royalties at the sub-national
level have been more clearly defined with an important emphasis on financing regional
investment projects. A number of special purpose funds have been created, for instance to
compensate poorer regions, finance regional innovation projects, and cover sub-national
pension liabilities. The National Royalties System exists separately to the general budget
system and allocations will be approved every two years. Finally, the reform introduced
increased central government oversight and transparency with the use of these resources while
affirming that they ultimately will be spent at the sub-national level.

34.    The new institutional framework envisages two main mechanisms to absorb the
macroeconomic impact of commodity windfalls: debt reduction and sub-national
savings. At the central government level, the strategy of the current Administration is to
gradually reduce the central government public debt burden to 20 percent of GDP in 2023
from about 35 percent in 2011. This is expected to reduce interest payments by about 1
percent of GDP, thereby creating additional fiscal space. The macroeconomic stabilization

                                              14
and savings fund is not expected to accumulate funds until this debt threshold is reached. At
the sub-national level, the strategy is to gradually accumulate funds starting with 0.2 percent
of GDP in 2012 out of total royalties revenues of 1.5 percent of GDP. By 2020, current
government projections point at an accumulation of resources in the sub-national savings and
stabilization fund of about US$12 billion.

35.     The strategy of the current Administration to reduce the debt burden through
fiscal consolidation reflects an important policy choice. This is best illustrated by
considering the alternatives. For instance, the authorities could have chosen to accumulate
fiscal savings in a reserve fund. This has the advantage of making funds available in terms of
limited market access, for instance during a crisis situation. From a financial perspective, a
possible disadvantage of accumulating saving could be that the return of financial assets falls
short of the cost of servicing the public debt. In a similar vein, the decision to embark on
fiscal consolidation reflects the stance that the long-term returns from reducing public debt in
the form of lower interest payments (as the stock of debt falls and the market risk premium
declines) are greater than the potential return from public investment.

36.     The introduction of ‘fiscal sustainability’ as a constitutional criterion encourages
the judicial system to consider the fiscal implications of its rulings. The amended
Constitution emphasizes that while the State is responsible for the attainment of positive
rights (Estado Social de Derecho) of its citizens, it should proceed progressively towards the
attainment of such rights and use a framework of fiscal sustainability as an instrument. The
amendment also facilitates a ‘fiscal sustainability review’ of court rulings, which can be
requested by the Attorney General or a Minister. The review, which will examine the fiscal
consequences of implementing a specific court ruling, may result in a modification of the
ruling. The fiscal sustainability cannot be invoked to affect fundamental rights or
entitlements of the citizens, however.

37.      A tax reform has been approved to enhance revenue sufficiency and improve the
efficiency of the tax system. The reform supports the objective of budget predictability and
stability by establishing a clear medium-term time path for individual tax rates. Key reform
elements included: the elimination of the tax credit for investment in fixed assets of firms, the
closing of loopholes of the financial transactions tax (along with a plan for its gradual
elimination), a reduction of the energy surcharge levied on firms, and a temporary increase in
the base and rate of the wealth tax to finance the fiscal response to the 2010-11 La Niña.

38.    Building on these achievements, the Government is continuing to prepare
additional legislative and administrative measures, including a structural tax reform.
The latter forms an important part of a potential ‘second wave’ of legislative reforms by
aiming to further enhance the equity, efficiency and simplicity of the tax system. The
Government is also in the process of increasing the efficiency of debt and cash management
through the preparation of a medium-term debt management strategy and increasing the
coverage of the Treasury Single Account (TSA).

                         B. Social Security Liability Management

39.    Changes to the legal and regulatory framework of the health system have been
introduced to strengthen the financial and fiscal sustainability of health care provision.

                                               15
This includes the introduction of a new ordinary health law which emphasizes primary health
care and improves the regulation of health insurance financing. Important administrative
measures to contain health expenditures outside the Mandatory Benefit Package of the
contributory regime have also been taken, primarily by controlling reimbursements related to
costly pharmaceuticals. The Government has also updated the Mandatory Benefit Package of
both the contributory and subsidized regimes and it has established a new contingency fund.

40.     Going forward, the Government is contemplating changes of the pension system
to address challenges of coverage and equity in a fiscally sustainable manner. This
includes issuing the implementing regulations associated with a voluntary savings plan with
matching contributions from Government (BEPS) aimed at workers earning around the
minimum wage. A legislative reform of the pension system and a statutory health law may
also be presented to Congress in the remaining two years of the Administration.

                                C. Disaster Risk Financing

41.      An important component of improved contingent liability management relates to
a new strategy to manage the fiscal risks associated with natural disasters. As a part of
its medium-term response to the 2010-11 La Niña, a National Disaster Risk Management Act
was signed into Law to improve the implementation of risk management and financing
initiatives. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit published a National
Disaster Risk Financing Strategy designed to identify the appropriate financial instruments to
financially protect the state against natural hazards.

42.     Within this context, the Government is also taking steps to address agricultural
risks in a comprehensive manner with initial reforms to expand agricultural insurance
coverage. The National Development Plan 2010-14, establishes a new agricultural risk
management framework and envisages an enhanced institutional role for the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development. The ongoing establishment of an Agricultural Risk
Management and Financing Directorate within the Ministry supports a comprehensive
approach to agricultural risk management.

              IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                       A. Link to the Country Partnership Strategy
43.     The National Development Plan (2010-14) aims to increase employment, reduce
poverty and improve security. The Plan, Prosperidad Para Todos, has three pillars: (i)
sustainable growth and competitiveness, (ii) equality of opportunities for social prosperity,
and (iii) consolidation of peace. Moreover, it has four cross-cutting themes: (a) international
relevance, (b) environmental and disaster risk management, (c) good governance, and (d)
regional development and integration.

44.      The proposed development policy operation supports the objectives of the
National Development Plan. The prior actions of this operation contribute to pillar (i) of the
Plan, as well as cross-cutting theme (b). The fiscal management program enhances budget
stability and predictability and facilitates fiscal consolidation, which in turn, supports
economic growth. The Plan makes explicit references to the Government’s fiscal reform
agenda in a chapter on macroeconomic consistency. The Plan also outlines the importance of

                                              16
updating the mandatory benefit health insurance package, designing a natural disaster risk
financing strategy, creating an Agricultural Risk Management and Financing Directorate in
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and expanding agricultural insurance.

45.     The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-16 is
also aligned with the key themes of the National Development Plan. The CPS (Report No.
60620-CO), discussed by Executive Directors on July 21, 2011, has three themes: (1)
expanding opportunities for social prosperity, (2) sustainable growth with enhanced climate
Resilience, and, (3) inclusive growth with enhanced productivity. Each of these themes, in
turn, supports three long term outcomes. The DPL operation supports the long-term outcome
of improved fiscal, financial, and social risk management under theme (3).

                                       B. Consultations
46.     The Government’s fiscal reform program supported by this operation was an
integral part of President Santos’ election platform. Juan Manual Santos, who won the
second round of the Presidential Elections in August 2010 convincingly, heads the National
Unity Coalition which controls over 90 percent of the seats Congress. Central elements of the
fiscal management program carried forward by the Government were included in the
President’s election manifesto Buen Gobierno Para La Prosperidad Democrática. This
includes proposals to introducing a fiscal rule as well as key components of the 2010 tax
reform, such as eliminating the investment tax credit. Major elements of the ongoing health
reforms to improve the financial sustainability of the insurance system were also included in
the election manifesto, such as the importance of updating the mandatory health package.

47.     The National Development Plan, which includes the fiscal management program,
was completed and approved by Congress followed extensive nationwide consultations.
The exercise took place in 2010-11 with 16 administrative departments with an ample range
of stakeholders from academia, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), private sector,
unions, indigenous people, and the media. As part of the CPS process, the Bank participated
selectively in relevant Government consultation events.

48.     Key parts of the fiscal management program have also been discussed in public
fora. The Colombian think tank Fedesarollo organized a series of seminars on the fiscal and
tax reforms. These seminars were open to the public and were attended by Bank staff. The
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has also presented its Economic and Fiscal Strategy in
public fora where the Bank participated. Participants in these seminars expressed support for
the fiscal rule legislation and the royalties reform while proposing ways in which institutional
arrangements could be strengthened. Views on the fiscal sustainability constitutional
amendment were mixed as participants either questioned the potential effectiveness of the
measure or expressed concerns that it would constrain constitutionally protected social
entitlements. Such concerns were addressed in the final legal text, which establishes that the
fiscal sustainability criterion cannot be invoked to affect the entitlements of citizens. Finally,
the Government has had an active dialogue and consultations with private sector associations
related to other reform measures, such as the proposal to eliminate the capital investment tax
credit and the energy surcharge. The private sector supported both initiatives.

              C. Collaboration with the IMF and other Development Partners
49.     The Bank’s country team has been collaborating very closely with the IMF. 7 This
cooperation includes the review of macroeconomic developments, including fiscal projections
and analysis of debt sustainability. The proposed DPL program is consistent with IMF policy
advice. In fact, the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department advised the Government of Colombia in
the process of designing and implementing the fiscal rule. The two institutions have also been
collaborating closely in other areas, including revenue administration improvement and public
financial management (including debt management). The IMF and the Bank have also been
advising the Government on tax policy reform and customs administration.

50.    The Bank is also coordinating with other development partners, particularly the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), in key fiscal management topics. In the area
of pension reform, the World Bank is leading the coordination efforts between multilateral
and Government agencies. In the area of fiscal rule design and tax reform, the IDB has been
providing support and has shared its findings with Bank staff. Moreover, on tax policy, the
Bank has also been collaborating closely with the OECD. In the health sector, the IDB helped
evaluate different health technologies, on the institutional structure related to the periodic
update of the Mandatory Benefit Package, and on cost control related to pharmaceuticals.
The Bank interacts regularly with the IDB on all these topics to avoid overlaps, ensure
synergy and coordinate on policy messages.

51.     The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has activities that are related to the
three main policy areas of the fiscal management program. In the area of budget stability
and predictability, IFC has initiated a program with DIAN for simplifying tax administration.
In the area of social security liability management, IFC is supporting the growth of health care
providers. In the area of disaster risk financing and agricultural insurance, IFC is developing
a pilot program to facilitate the development of agricultural insurance products.

                          D. Relationships to other Bank Operations
52.     The Bank is committed to a long-term engagement with the Government of
Colombia in the area of fiscal management. The programmatic DPL series is only one of
several different instruments of engagement. As mentioned in Section I, and as illustrated in
Table 1, the Bank is implementing a multi-sectoral and programmatic package of convening,
knowledge, and financial services in support of this program. The Fiscal Policy
Programmatic Knowledge Services, in particular, has strengthened the Bank’s policy dialogue
with the Government substantially on this topic.

53.     The Bank’s partnership with Colombia on disaster risk management is
substantial. The current portfolio of investment lending in Disaster Risk Management
includes the National Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 1
(P082429), designed to strengthen the capacity of the national Government to coordinate
disaster risk management, to build capacity at the municipal level, and to reduce disaster risk.
The Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction APL 2 (P085727), meanwhile, aims to reduce
Bogotá’s exposure to human and economic losses in case of natural disaster. Following the
2010 disbursement of the country’s first DPL with a CAT DDO (P113084), the Bank

7
  Colombia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. In May 2012, the IMF completed the
review of Colombia’s performance under the two-year Flexible Credit Line (see Annex 3 for details).

                                                  18
approved a second CAT DDO (P126583) in July 2012. An additional two projects are
currently under preparation including a Second National Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
project and the Barranquilla Urban Flood Management Project both scheduled to be delivered
in 2013.

54.      The Second Catastrophic Deferred Draw Option (CAT-DDO) DPL, approved in
July 2012, complements this Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience DPL. To
illustrate, this programmatic fiscal DPL supports the development of a National Disaster Risk
Financing Strategy. The DPL with a Catastrophic Deferred Draw Option, in turn, is one of
several financial instruments that the Government has implemented in the context of this
Strategy. It is noted that the scope of each operation differs in the sense that the CAT-DDO
focuses on the general challenge of disaster risk management (DRM), whereas the DPL
focuses exclusively on the DRM topic of disaster risk financing.

55.     The Bank has provided analytical and technical assistance support in a majority
of the prior actions identified for DPL II. This includes: fiscal rule (prior action II-1), tax
reform (prior action II-2), disaster risk financing (prior actions II-5 and II-6), and agricultural
risk management (prior action II-7) (see Annex 5 for the full list of prior actions).
Additionally, the Bank is providing knowledge and convening services for related reform
areas, including pension reform as well as debt management.

                                      E. Lessons Learned
56.    The design of the proposed operation takes into account the lessons learned from
the Bank program with Colombia and the Bank’s experience with other middle income
countries. The most important lessons include the following:

•   Operations should be focused and avoid large and complex policy matrices. Rather
    than seeking to cover an extensive list of measures this programmatic DPL series has
    sought to concentrate on the key elements of the Governments fiscal management
    program. This has resulted in a policy matrix with 5-7 policy actions per operation.

•   The need to take into account the political economy of reform. In designing a policy-
    based operation, political factors and the legislative needs of the country need to be well
    understood and included in the dialogue with the client. Lessons from DPL I preparation
    suggests caution in including legislative measures (particularly Constitutional reforms)
    that although approved by Congress may face subsequent legal challenges. The proposed
    second operation focuses exclusively on administrative measures fully under the control
    of the Executive.

•   Bank support to a reform program early in a Government Administration also
    increases the likelihood of successful implementation. This DPL series is prepared
    during the first two years of the four-year presidential term. Legislative measures
    included in DPL I successfully passed in Congress as a result of high initial political
    capital, a strong national unity coalition, and an administration committed to reforms. The
    implementation of already approved legislative measures, supported in DPL II, has
    progressed very well.



                                                19
•   The commitment of the Government is central in ensuring the success of the
    program. Previous policy-based and investment operations all pointed to the important
    role of strong government leadership in their success. The proposed operation effectively
    responds to the Government’s own priorities and commitment as reflected in the actions
    already taken. These priorities are reflected in the National Development Plan, the Fiscal
    and Economic Strategy Document of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (2010),
    and the annual Medium-Term Fiscal Framework report.

•   Coordination with other international financial institutions, including the IMF, is
    critical to ensuring a consistent policy approach towards borrowers. The proposed
    operation builds on very close coordination with the IMF on the macroeconomic
    framework, particularly fiscal policy and projections, debt sustainability analysis and
    coherence in policy dialogue and messages.

                               F. Analytical Underpinnings
57.     The actions supported by the DPL have been assessed through analytical work of
the Bank and the IMF. This body of analytical work has provided the basis for a policy
dialogue with the Government and has supported the design of the DPL. The substantial tax
policy dialogue (based on analysis of tax expenditures, tax system progressivity, and ex-ante
reform simulations) should be emphasized. The Bank also prepared studies of options to
expand coverage and enhance equity in the pension system, which deserve mention, even if
no prior actions were included in the policy matrix. Table 4 shows the links between the prior
actions included in the DPL and the recommendations included in recent analytical work.

                       instrument, the Government should design and implement a tax
                       expenditure management strategy, including the introduction of
                       systematic evaluations and the more active use of term dates for

                       Box 3. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Ownership: The operation supports the objectives of Colombia’s National Development
Plan, particularly the first pillar: ‘Sustainable Growth and Competitiveness’ as well as the cross-
cutting theme of ‘Disaster Risk Management’.

Principle 2: Coordinated Accountability Framework: The program document defines the actions
agreed with the Government and summarizes expected outcomes in a program matrix. Contact with
other multilaterals, particularly the IMF, which also support policy actions in key program areas has
been regular and close, including during the preparation of the operation.

Principle 3: Customization: The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has indicated that it intends
to cover part of its multilateral fiscal financing needs through the programmatic DPL operation,
complementing the budget support and investment lending portfolio of the Bank and other multilateral
agencies. The selected policy areas covered by the DPL program are derived from the National
Development Plan, the Fiscal and Economic Strategy and the annual Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
report. Accordingly, the specific actions and intended outcomes also enjoy technical and political
support in their respective sectors. The relevance and soundness of said actions have been assessed
through Bank analytical work and follow-up activities.

Principle 4: Criticality Actions: The prior actions form part of an agreed accountability framework
that focuses on the Government’s critical actions for achieving the program objectives. The operation
supports three complementary policy areas and the policy matrix has been limited to a number of
actions considered necessary to maintain coherence of the policy dialogue and benefit from
complementarities towards the intended outcomes.

Principle 5: Transparency and Predictability: The approach and the timing of planned
disbursement respond to the Government’s stated financial needs. The program matrix clearly states
expected outcomes and indicators in a transparent manner. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
and the National Planning Department (DNP) will exercise joint leadership in coordinating the
monitoring and evaluation arrangements (see Section VI.C).



                V.      THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

58.     The fiscal management program 8, which forms a core part of the Government’s
fiscal strategy, aims to tackle Colombia’s fiscal challenges. These challenges can be
divided into three main areas: (a) budget predictability and stability, (b) management of social
security liabilities, and, (c) disaster risk financing. 9 This section describes the Government
actions supported in this development policy loan in each of these three areas, as summarized
in the Matrix of Policy Actions (Annex 5).

                              A. Budget Predictability and Stability
59.     The Government is taking measures to improve budget predictability and
stability. The implementation of a new fiscal rule seeks to reduce and limit the structural
fiscal deficit and address commodity concerns. Meanwhile, the sufficiency of revenue

  The term ‘fiscal management program’ refers to the Program supported by this development policy operation,
as summarized in the policy matrix (Annex 5) and as described in the Borrower’s Letter of Development Policy
(Annex 2). The Program is a subset of the government’s fiscal reform strategy.
9
  See World Bank (2011) for a detailed discussion of these challenges.

                                                    22
collection and efficiency of the tax system are being strengthened through the implementation
of important tax reforms.

Fiscal Rule

Prior action for DPL II: The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance and Public Credit,
has taken key steps to implement the Fiscal Rule Law, including: (a) the publication of the
2012 Medium Term Fiscal Framework Report; and (b) the issuance of Decree No. 1790 dated
August 28, 2012 (duly published in the Borrower’s official gazette on August 28, 2012),
which, inter alia, established a consultative committee to monitor the implementation of the
Fiscal Rule Law by the Borrower’s Executive Branch.

60.    Policy challenges associated with commodities production can be effectively
addressed through fiscal rules, stabilization funds and a flexible exchange rate policy.10
These policy instruments help enhance budget predictability and stability in countries that are
economically and fiscally dependent on natural resources production. Fiscal revenues related
to commodity (mainly oil) production in Colombia are expected to reach 4.6 percent of GDP
in 2012. 11 While Colombia’s economic and fiscal commodity dependency is moderate in a
regional comparison, the Government is nonetheless determined to manage these resources
prudently.

61.     DPL I supported the approval by Congress of the Fiscal Rule Bill of Law 1473 in
July 2011. The Rule sets a target for the central government structural fiscal deficit of 1.0
percent of GDP by 2022. It facilitates temporary counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus in times of
sluggish economic growth. A new stabilization fund allows for the accumulation of windfall
revenues, but is not expected to be used in the short term. The implementation of the fiscal
rule will be monitored by an independent Consultative Committee. The Law entered into
effect in 2012. (See Box 4 for further details on the Fiscal Rule Law).

62.      The full implementation of the fiscal rule would enhance credibility,
transparency and predictability of fiscal policy. The fiscal rule makes explicit the
objectives and targets of fiscal policy, in this case debt sustainability and a target for the
structural balance. Fiscal policy is now subject to operational rules that are reviewed by an
independent committee of experts. Colombia has made good progress in implementing the
fiscal rule, though the process has not yet been fully completed.

63.     The Consultative Committee has been legally established by Decree 1790 dated
August, 28, 2012. The nine-member Committee is composed of deans of economics faculties
(3), consultants (2), researchers (2), and the Presidents of the Congressional Economic
Commissions (2). Its members are selected by the Minister of Finance and Public Credit,
except for the congressional members selected by the President of Congress, for a period of
three years. The Department of Macroeconomic Policy of the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit will serve as the Technical Secretariat to the Committee. Finally, the Decree also
establishes two technical working groups: The GDP Working Group is responsible for
estimating potential output while the Commodity Price Working Group is charged with

10
  See World Bank (2010).
11
  Including sub-national royalties revenues (1.5 percent of GDP), oil/mining-related income tax revenue (2.0
percent of GDP and Ecopetrol dividends (1.1 percent of GDP).

                                                    23
presenting commodity price forecasts. The members which have been selected in 2012 for
the Committee and its working groups include reputable and independent Colombian
economists.

                                     Box 4. The Fiscal Rule Law
Colombia’s Fiscal Rule Law aims to ensure fiscal discipline, facilitate a counter-cyclical fiscal
policy, and improve the management of commodity revenues. It targets a central government
structural deficit of 1.0 percent of GDP by 2022, including interim targets of 2.3 percent of GDP in
2014 and 1.9 percent of GDP in 2018, each aligned with the political cycle. The structural deficit (i.e.
the overall deficit adjusted for economic and commodity cycles, and extraordinary items) must follow
a declining path each year. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline in the medium-
term, although the Law does not include an explicit debt target.

The Law targets the central government structural balance, which is the major contributor to
the deficit and debt accumulation of the nonfinancial public sector in Colombia. Eighty-seven
percent of the combined public sector debt stock arises from the central government. Similarly, the
combined public sector deficit is essentially the result of a deficit on the central government accounts,
as the rest of the public sector has historically registered a fiscal surplus. A more comprehensive
concept of the public sector may nonetheless have been preferable from a technical point of view, as
pointed out by the IMF (2011) and the World Bank (2011). While subnational entities already have a
set of rules to constrain fiscal excess, this is not the case for the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
including decentralized agencies and state owned enterprises. On the other hand, the Government
opted for a measure over which it has a higher degree of control.

The fiscal rule facilitates counter-cyclical fiscal policy. The government can introduce fiscal
stimulus when the projected annual real GDP growth rate falls below the long-term economic growth
rate by at least two percentage points and an output gap is simultaneously projected. Counter-cyclical
spending cannot exceed 20 percent of the output gap and additional spending must be phased out after
a period of two years.

A Macroeconomic Savings and Stabilization Fund has been established to smooth out the impact
of the economic and commodity cycles. However, according to the MTFF (2012) document, the
Government does not intend to accumulate resources in this Fund until the central government debt-to-
GDP ratio reaches 20 percent, except through possible voluntary contributions. The funds can be
drawn to finance the counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus (up to 10 percent of the total balance in any given
year). Alternatively, the Government can use accumulated funds to reduce public debt. The Fund will
be administered by the Central Bank

An exemption clause exists such that the Government can temporarily deviate from the fiscal
rule in exceptional circumstances. This would be the case if the Government declares a state of
emergency or if the fiscal advisory committee (CONFIS) considers it advisable in the case of a shock
to macroeconomic stability.

A government-appointed, independent Consultative Committee will monitor the implementation
of the fiscal rule. The Committee has two technical working groups that advice on potential GDP and
commodity prices, respectively. Its main role is to evaluate the Governments compliance with the
rule, though its statements are non-binding.

64.     The role of the Committee is to monitor the Government’s implementation of the
fiscal rule. It can do so through the issuance of public, non-binding statements on the
methodology and definitions used by the Government. Of particular importance would be a
statement issued on the annual implementation report that the Government must present to the

                                                     24
  Economic Commissions of Congress together with the annual Medium Term Fiscal
  Framework report. Although the Government does not have to follow the recommendations
  of the Committee it has an incentive to do so given that Committee statements are made
  public and will be followed closely by analysts and market participants.

  65.     The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has integrated the fiscal rule into its
  Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). The annual Medium Term Fiscal Framework
  Report, published in June 2012, contains projections of the structural fiscal balance for the
  2011-2023 period, including annual targets (Table 5). In deriving the structural balance, the
  Ministry used independently prepared estimates of the Consultative Committee (CC) and the
  relevant Ministries. Specifically, it used the potential GDP projections and the price forecasts
  for oil, coal, gold and nickel prepared by the two working groups. Commodity production
  forecasts, meanwhile, were provided separately by Ecopetrol, the National Hydrocarbon
  Agency (ANH) and the National Mining Agency. The Ministry, meanwhile, independently
  defined the formula for computing the structural balance, including the revenue elasticities.

  66.       The structural fiscal deficit is projected to be larger than the observed one,
  reflecting the existence of favorable shocks. Table 5 summarizes key fiscal rule variables
  and assumptions. The most important source of transitory fiscal revenue is the oil and mining
  cycle that contributes annually with additional income of about ½ percent of GDP until 2014.
  The economic cycle, meanwhile, does not affect the structural balance much, reflecting a
  growth path that does not deviate substantially from potential. The only exception to the
  regularity of favorable shocks is the fiscal costs of the 2010-11 La Niña, which represent net
  expenditures that result in a deterioration of the effective balance of about ½ percent of GDP
  per year.

  67.   The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has prepared a draft methodological
  document detailing how the fiscal rule is being implemented. A key merit of this
  document is that it outlines the different aspects of fiscal rule implementation and forms the

                                                         25
analytical basis for the drafting the relevant decrees to implement Law 1473 of 2011. The
document also details the definition of key concepts and methodologies. It defines what is
understood by ‘central government accounts’ and it outlines how the structural fiscal balance
rule is integrated into the budget cycle. Finally, it lists the membership of the Consultative
Committee as well as its two technical working groups.

68.     A draft decree for counter-cyclical spending is currently under preparation. The
draft, which draws upon the methodological document, specifies the role of different
Government agencies with respect to counter-cyclical provisions, in particular: The
Department of Macroeconomic Policy of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is
responsible for regularly monitoring whether the conditions for proposing counter-cyclical
spending are met. It does so by independently projecting annual real economic growth and
taking into account the potential output estimates prepared by the relevant technical working
group. If the conditions are met (see Box 4), the Macro Department requests a meeting of the
Fiscal Policy Council (CONFIS), which authorizes the amount, nature and timing of the
additional public spending.     The CONFIS, in turn, authorizes the budget office of the
Ministry of Finance to prepare a budgetary amendment for approval by Congress. The
financing of the additional spending is determined by the Government. In the event of a
protracted recession, there is also a possibility of extending the period during which
countercyclical spending is being implemented.

69.     While the Government has made good progress in implementing the fiscal rule,
important challenges remain. First, the implementation process would benefit from greater
transparency. This includes the publication of relevant background documents prepared by
the Government and the Consultative Committee. Moreover, these documents would benefit
from including a greater degree of detail on methodology and data such as to facilitate the
independent verification and replication by others, including the computation of alternative
scenarios (e.g. effects on fiscal balance using alternative oil price forecasts). Second, the
methodology used to project commodity prices by the relevant working group could benefit
from being more transparent, consistent and objective, with the more systematic use of
international sources. Third, the calculation of the structural balance would become more
simple and transparent if aggregate revenue elasticities were used as opposed to disaggregated
ones. While the methodological document appreciates the point that both approaches yield
similar results, the Ministry is currently opting for the disaggregate approach.

70.    The implementation process is expected to gradually improve over time as a part
of a learning process, especially in light of evaluations by the Consultative Committee.
In recognizing the scope for improvement in some areas, it is important to emphasize that this
was the first year in which the rule was implemented and that the process can be improved
over time. Moreover, the Consultative Committee has the opportunity to comment on these
improvements as it publishes its annual evaluation report (starting mid-2013).

71.    Next steps: The remaining steps include the preparation of: (1) a CONFIS
methodological document defining central government accounts (Article 2 of Law 1473), (2) a
Decree regulating the functioning, administration, operation and investment of the Fiscal and
Macroeconomic Savings and Stabilization Fund (Article 15 of Law 1473), (3) the issuance of
the implementing regulation of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (Article 8 of Law
1473), and (5) a Decree regulating the operation of the budget cycle (Articles 4 and 9 of Law


                                             26
1473). While these steps have been defined in the methodological document they remain to
be legally approved.

72.     Pending challenges: Beyond completing the implementing regulation of the fiscal
rule, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit may want to take steps to improve budget
planning with the new structural balance rule. Specific challenges include: (1) clarifications
related to the use of the structural balance as a fiscal anchor; (2) managing incentives for
evasion and creative accounting; (3) clarification of whether the structural balance should be
targeted only ex-ante or also ex-post. Moreover, there is scope for a more effective use of
Public Financial Management instruments, such as Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF)
and the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This includes a re-sequencing of the
MTFF and MTEF to occur prior to the budget process. This way the Fiscal Council
(CONPES) would have the time to have an informed discussion on the strategic direction of
the budget and the establishment of hard expenditure ceilings based on the baselines of line
ministries and new spending initiatives. Finally, the full adoption of economic classification,
and eventually program classification, for recurrent and investment expenditures both for
formulation and execution is a key issue going forward. The Fiscal Policy PKS could be a
useful vehicle for the continued support of the Bank in fiscal rule implementation, in
coordination with the IMF.

Tax Reforms

Prior action for DPL II: The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance and Public Credit,
has issued the Implementing Regulations of Law 1430, to increase the Borrower’s tax
revenue, enhance the Borrower’s tax system efficiency and improve the competitiveness of its
economy.

73.     The Colombian tax system is characterized by a relatively low tax take, inequity,
inefficiency and complexity. Tax revenues appear insufficient given Colombia’s level of
economic development and structural spending pressures. Colombia’s high Gini coefficient
of income appears unaffected by taxes. Moreover, tax treatment of similar economic agents
frequently does not meet standards of horizontal equity. Finally, inconsistencies in the tax
code, tax expenditures, and a complicated Value Added Tax (VAT) system add to system
complexity (World Bank 2012b).

74.     In 2010, the Government introduced two tax reforms aimed at raising the
revenue-to-GDP ratio and improving tax system efficiency. These reforms were supported
in the first DPL. Law 1430 aimed to increase tax revenue, enhance tax system efficiency and
improve competitiveness while Decree 4825 aimed to temporarily raise revenues to part-
finance the fiscal cost of the 2010-11 La Niña emergency. Enacted in December 2010, these
reforms were expected to result in an increase in the tax revenue of an average of 0.6 percent
of GDP per year in 2011-14 relative to the 2010 baseline, according to Government estimates.
The tax reforms supported the objective of budget predictability and stability by establishing a
clear medium-term time path for individual tax rates. The major changes included: (a) the
elimination of the tax credit for investment in fixed assets of firms, (b) closing of loopholes of
the financial transactions tax, (c) a gradual phase-out of the financial transaction tax, (d) a
reduction of the energy surcharge levied on firms, and (e) an increase in the base and rate of
the wealth tax (see Box 5 for details).

                                               27
75.   The implementing regulations of Law 1430 have been fully issued. Following the
enactment of Law 1430 of December 29, 2010, the Tax and Customs Revenue Authority
(DIAN) proceeded to issue the implementing regulation, as summarized in Table 6.

            Table 6. List of Decrees which Implement Law 1430 of December 29, 2010.

                                                financial institutions.

76.     Tax collection improved substantially in 2011. Tax revenues increased by 1.3
percentage points of GDP in 2011 (Figure 1, panel e). About three quarters of this rise is
explained by higher collections for the two main sources of revenue: the income tax (+0.6
percent of GDP) and the value added tax (+0.4 percent of GDP). Solid economic growth and
favorable oil prices combined with a reduction from 40 to 30 percent in the fixed capital
investment tax credit for firms, introduced through Law 1370 of 2009, explain income tax
performance. Higher VAT revenues, in turn, relates to higher consumption given a favorable
economic environment. Tax collections also rose due to improved administration, including
strengthened electronic information cross check and enforced collection.

77.     The tax reforms supported in the first DPL explain most of the strong revenue
performance observed for the wealth and financial transactions taxes. About a quarter of
the tax revenue increase in 2011 is explained by these two taxes. The reduction of loopholes
in the financial transaction tax (Law 1430 of 2010) resulted in an increase of 0.3 percent of
GDP compared to a projection of 0.1 percent (see Box 5). Similarly, a higher rate and broader
base of the wealth tax, introduced through Decree 4825 of 2010, increased collections by 0.4
percent of GDP compared to a projection of 0.1 percent of GDP. 12

78.     Next steps and pending challenges: The Government is currently preparing a tax
reform which inter alia aims to improve the equity and simplicity of the tax system. The
reform does not explicitly aim to raise tax revenues. Further measures to raise revenues may
nonetheless be warranted in the medium-term to bring Colombia more closely in line with the
tax collection performance of its peers and to meet the structural balance target. The Bank
will continue to be an important partner supporting the Government in meeting these
challenges (Box 6).

79.     Expected medium term outcomes for component (A) improved budget
predictability and stability: Fiscal rule implementation and the tax reforms are expected to
lead to a more predictable, stable and efficient management of fiscal resources.




12
  Reductions in trade tariffs from about 12 to about 8 percent led to a 0.2 percent of GDP decline in 2011 tax
revenue collections.

                                                     28
         Box 5. The Tax Reforms of December 2010 (Law 1430 and Decree 4825).
A tax credit linked to fixed capital investments by firms was eliminated. This measure, which
enhances the tax base, is expected to raise the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio by 0.5 percent per year (Table
6). Between 2004 and 2010, firms were allowed to deduct 30 percent of the value of their fixed capital
investments from their taxable income (40 percent in 2008-09). The tax exemption for capital
investment was originally introduced to encourage investment and was particularly benefitting capital-
intensive sectors. Soaring investment levels and doubts regarding the effectiveness of tax incentives
prompted this move.

Loopholes in the financial transaction taxed were closed to increase tax collection efficiency. The
financial transaction tax is levied on all the bank transactions of firms and individuals. The tax was
first introduced in 1998. Since 2003, the tax rate has been 0.4 percent of the nominal transaction
amount. The effectiveness of tax collection decreased substantially in recent years owing to a change
in the behavior of economic agents, who increasingly resorted to transaction methods which are not
liable to taxation, including cash transactions.

The financial transactions tax would be phased out gradually from 2014 to 2018. The current rate
of 0.4 percent will be reduced to 0.2 percent in 2014-15, 0.1 percent in 2016-17 and zero in 2018
onwards. The rationale for eliminating the transaction tax is related to its distortionary impact on
financial intermediation and credit expansion with an associated negative impact on economic growth.
The tax also tends to penalize small firms and low-income households with limited ways of avoidance.

The energy surcharge for manufacturing was eliminated. To reduce the production costs for the
manufacturing sector, the Government eliminated the 20 percent surcharge on electricity costs to
industrial facilities. The measure is intended to improve competitiveness of manufacturing firms in the
context of the strong appreciation of the local currency.

A series of other adjustments in the tax code also have a positive short-term revenue impact: (a)
taxation on interest payments on private external debt to harmonize with tax rules on private domestic
debt, (b) elimination of tax exemption on intermediary services in the oil and mining sector, (c)
retention of one percent of oil and mining revenues, (d) VAT collection efficiency measures.

The base and rate of the wealth tax for individuals and firms have been increased. This
expanded the wealth tax base to also include amounts lower than COP3,000 million and introduced a
temporary 25 percent surcharge for amounts higher than COP3,000 million for the 2011-14 period.
The revenue generated from this change financed recurrent spending in the wake of the end-2010
heavy rains.

     Box 6. World Bank Engagement on Tax Policy and Administration in Colombia
The Bank has a very close and intense engagement with the Colombian authorities on tax policy.
On the basis of the fiscal policy DPL and PKS instruments, the Bank has prepared studies on tax
expenditures and tax-transfer system progressivity. Ongoing work includes the simulation of the
revenue and redistributive impact of a planned tax reform as well as estimations of tax evasions

The Tax Expenditure Study estimates that the revenue forgone due to tax incentives and benefits is
equivalent to 4.5 percent of GDP – an amount which exceeds Colombia’s current budgetary spending
on defense and security. Tax expenditures are increasingly used as a policy instrument in Colombia,
as reflected by a 60 percent rise over the past decade. This trend is of concern, since only a few of the
201 tax expenditures currently in place have been subject to a systematic impact evaluation. In other
words, the net benefits to society of this fiscal outlay are largely unknown. Aside from the associated
revenue loss, tax expenditures may give rise to higher administrative and compliance costs, economic
inefficiencies, horizontal and vertical inequity, and open the door for fraud and evasion. Tax
expenditures in Colombia typically do not have any expiry dates, implying that they will remain in the
tax code perpetually unless repealed through discretionary legislative action. To address these
challenges, the Study proposes the implementation of a strategy to improve the management of tax
expenditures. Key elements of the strategy include a more systematic effort of evaluating costs and
benefits and a more active use of term dates. Finally, the study proposes an analytical framework for
evaluating tax expenditures and applies it to three prominent case studies: VAT exemptions and
exclusions, the special regime for non-profit entities, and, the free trade zone regime.

The Fiscal Redistribution Analysis points out that Colombia has the seventh highest Gini coefficient
of income inequality in the world. The current Administration aspires to join the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which exhibits much lower income disparities,
mainly as a result of effective policies of fiscal redistribution. In Colombia, meanwhile, direct taxes,
indirect taxes, and monetary transfers hardly dent the high Gini coefficient. To reduce income
inequality, Colombian policy makers could consider introducing a more progressive tax-transfer
system. The paper considers a range of inequality-reducing fiscal policy options and ranks them based
on their effectiveness. It argues that there are potentially important redistributive potential gains
available from tax reforms if combined with good spending decisions. An illustrative reform package
suggests that Colombia could reach levels of inequality similar to Chile or Costa Rica in a fiscally
neutral manner.

Ex-ante Tax Reform Simulation. To inform the design of a new tax reform in Colombia, the Bank is
currently undertaking a series of simulations which aim to estimate the revenue and distributional
impact of proposed changes to the personal income tax.

Tax Evasion Estimations. To improve the estimation of tax evasion in Colombia, the Bank is
currently evaluating existing tax evasion estimations of the personal income tax with the aim of
suggestion improvements to methodology and providing revised estimates.

Tax Administration. The World Bank has piloted a new model in Colombia to measure tax
administration performance over time (IAMTAX). The model is built around a reference system of
fourteen core strategic dimensions which are broadly considered as desired features of a modern tax
system. A key attribute includes the identification of performance gaps against a set of desirable
benchmarks indicators and good practices. Indicators can be tailored to the specific characteristics of
individual countries and used to track performance over time. Finally, the model can form the basis
for a roadmap for a tax administration reform strategy.

                              B. Social Security Liability Management
80.      Obligations related to the provision of social security constitute the most
substantial long-term fiscal challenges in Colombia. The net present value of future health
care obligations has been estimated at 97 percent of GDP (2006-50), while public pension
liabilities reach at least 110 percent of GDP in net present value terms (2011-60). 13 To
improve long-term fiscal sustainability, the Government has taken steps to improve the
management of health insurance liabilities, as discussed next, while continuing its plans for
reforming the pension system. 14

Prior Actions for DPL II:
- The Borrower, through its Health Regulatory Commission, has issued the Accord (Acuerdo)
No. 29 dated December 28, 2011 (duly published in the Borrower’s official gazette on
December 30, 2011), which, inter alia, (a) updated the Mandatory Benefit Package of both
the contributory and subsidized regimes for purposes of expanding the coverage of health
goods and services under said regimes; and (b) introduced a list of healthcare goods and
medical services to be excluded from said Mandatory Benefit Package.
- The Borrower, through its Ministry of Health and Social Protection, has issued Decree No.
4107 dated November, 2, 2011 (duly published in the Borrower’s official gazette on
November 2, 2011), which, inter alia, established a contingency fund for the Borrower’s
health insurance system for purposes of ensuring the availability of sufficient funds available
for contingencies, including health emergencies stemming from different types of natural and
biological epidemics or disasters.

81.     The key factors explaining the fiscal pressures arising from the health insurance
system in recent years include: (a) weaknesses in the regulatory framework to foster
improved quality and efficiency in the delivery of health goods and services within a
framework of evidenced-based medicine, (b) a rapid expansion of health insurance enrollment
in the subsidized regime 15, (c) a health insurance benefit design that fosters incentives for
supply-induced health care demand for goods and services not included in the Mandatory
Benefit Package, and (d) the expansion of the Mandatory Benefit Package so that all
individuals covered by the Subsidized Regime have the right to the same benefits as those
provided to individuals covered by the Contributory Regime. 16

82.    The Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to improve the
management of health insurance liabilities. The overall objective of interventions focused
on stemming the rapid growth in expenses related to the provision of health goods and
services not included in the Mandatory Benefit Package of the Contributory Regime. These

   The Government is finalizing the implementing regulations for an individual savings scheme for low-income
earners (BEPS) and it is also working on a legislative reform. The Bank is providing analytical support in
pension reform design through different knowledge and convening services activities.

   The Colombian social health insurance has two main regimes: (a) the Contributory Regime financed through
payroll tax of formal workers, and, (b) the Subsidized Regime financed through national and sub-national
budgets and transfers from the Contributory Regime. Ninety-six percent of Colombians are covered by the
system.

Court rulings.

reimbursements rose from 0.9 to 17.0 percent of total health spending in 2003-2010, to a total
of COP2,345 billion. To address this fiscal challenge, the Government implemented a series
of measures, which were supported by the First DPL. This included the enactment of Law
1438 of 2011, as well as various administrative and regulatory measures aiming to reduce
spending related to high-cost medicines (Resolutions 4370-2010, 1020-2011 and 1083-2011).
The Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MSPS) is carefully monitoring and enforcing
the compliance with requirements for reimbursement of medicines to keep these expenditures
in check, and with good results. Reimbursements for services provided outside the
Mandatory Health Care package fell about ten percent in 2011 (from COP 2,345 billion to
COP 2,103 billion) and currently remains below the government target of maintaining
nominal costs constant at COP 2,400 billion in 2013 (see Annex 6). As explained below, the
Government has taken additional measures to reduce costs and improve budget predictability.

83.      The Government has updated the Mandatory Benefit Package of both the
Contributory and Subsidized regimes. Accord (Acuerdo) 29 dated December 28, 2011,
mandates the update of the Mandatory Benefit Package and forms part of the implementation
of Law 1438 of 2011. This Law stipulates that such updates must take place every two years
and that an analysis of inclusion of medicines and procedures should be carried out using an
evidence based medicine approach that includes cost-effectiveness analysis. The Accord also
facilitates the future introduction of a cost-containing tool, namely the use of a list of
exclusions (a negative list). Currently, there are very few exclusions (e.g. aesthetic surgery)
but this new tool, if used more proactively, has the potential to better manage the risk of
supply induced demand.

84.      The update of the Mandatory Benefit Package improves budget predictability of
the health insurance system and enhances the ability of the system to manage financial
risks. A Mandatory Benefit Package constitutes an essential planning tool to estimate
financial resources needed in any given health insurance system. It is used to determine
priorities by linking the health needs of the population (based on epidemiological and
demographic profiles) with the allocation of available resources. There are various
approaches to setting priorities and designing a benefit package. Frequently, it is a
combination of a positive and a negative list of conditions and/or interventions. Previous
updates of the Mandatory Benefit Package in Colombia had been irregular and not sufficiently
comprehensive with very limited use of standard approaches and analytical tools for priority
setting.

85.     Budget predictability may also improve, to the extent that the update of the
Package reduces health-related legal challenges. Dissatisfaction with the provision of
health services in the contributory regime frequently induces patients to seek improved health
care through a constitutionally mandated legal process known as the Tutela. The legal system
frequently rules in favor of patients, and the health insurance system is ordered to pay for such
services, even if they do not form part of the Mandatory Benefit Package. This situation
makes health care costs highly unpredictable and not always based on scientific evidence or
international standards of health care. Improved clarity on which types of health goods and
services are included in the benefit package would be expected to reduce some of these legal
processes.

86.   The updated benefit package facilitates financial planning and efficiency in the
procurement of health goods and services within health insurance firms. To illustrate, if
                                               32
a medicine does not form part of the Mandatory Benefit Package then insurance firms have
fewer incentives to develop efficient purchasing arrangements, leading to higher costs in their
discretional acquisition. If, on the other hand, the medicine forms part of the Package then
firms have positive incentives that encourages efficiency within the framework of an
improved model of health care. Moreover, inclusion of health goods and services also makes
it easier for regulators to closely monitor evolution of use and prices, which is particularly
relevant for items such as costly medicines that are now being closely observed by the
Government.

87.     The Government has established and financed a Contingency Fund for the health
insurance system. Article 41 of Decree 4107 dated November 4, 2011, establishes a
Contingency Fund known as Cuenta de Garantía del FOSYGA to ensure that there are
sufficient funds available for contingencies. The Decree establishes a level of reserves of at
least of 5 percent of the general health insurance fund (Cuenta de Compensación del
FOSYGA). The Reserve Fund has already been endowed with an initial contribution from
central government, derived partly from the proceeds of the cost-containment measures
supported by DPL I. A steady flow of resources from a share of the contributions of insurers
secures the Fund’s long-term financial viability.

88.    The Contingency Fund seeks to improve risk management of the health
insurance system. Its establishment is a very important step towards a sound policy of
improving the tool kit to manage the financial risks that stem from reimbursements arising
outside the Mandatory Benefit Package. This contingency fund also serves to ensure that
reserves exist for other contingencies, including health emergencies stemming from different
types of natural and biological epidemics or disasters.

89.     Finally, the Government also enacted Decree Law 19-2012 of January 10, 2012
(Ley de Anti-trámites). This Decree Law overhauls and streamlines various administrative
and bureaucratic procedures (‘red tape’) and facilitates the resolution of a large number of
health system claims and liabilities in the short term. These provisions are complementary to
the update of the Mandatory Benefit Package as they provide clearer rules about what is to be
financed as part of the Mandatory Benefit Package and what constitutes legitimate claims for
reimbursement of benefits not included in the health insurance coverage of both regimes.

90.     Pending challenges: Priorities for the health sector that still need to be addressed
include: (a) to develop policies and interventions to reduce the risk of corruption in the health
insurance system and enhance governance and accountability; (b) to develop and implement a
more comprehensive policy for improving supply and demand side information systems to
enhance transparency, accountability and timely monitoring of health system performance and
efficient allocation of human and financial resources; (c) to develop an information system to
improve the a systematic and continuous analysis of types of public information sent to the
Constitutional Court, as part of the judicial process of the legal claims (tutelas) and its impact
on health insurance liabilities management. 17 The Government is expected to address some
of these challenges through a new statutory health law.


17
   Constitutional Court Ruling T-760 of 2008 includes a mandate for the Executive to report any changes in the
trends in tutelas that result from health policies developed to address the issues raised on this ruling. The
Ministry of Health, thru the Universidad de los Andes is studying a national sample of tutelas sent for review to

                                                      33
91.     Expected medium term outcomes for component (B) improved social security
liability management. Support for updating of the Mandatory Benefit Package and
establishing the Contingency Fund are expected to improve the management of health
insurance finances thereby reducing the fiscal risk of the government.

                                       C. Disaster Risk Financing
92.     The Government is taking measures to improve the management of fiscal risks
associated with natural hazards. These measures aim to gradually move from ex-post to
ex-ante fiscal risk management, and, to transfer the risk from the public to the private sector.
In guiding these efforts, the Government has published a Disaster Risk Financing Strategy
and taken actions to improve insurance coverage for earthquakes and in the agricultural
sector.

Prior Actions for DPL II:
- The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, has approved and
published a disaster risk financing strategy, dated May, 2012, to reduce the Borrower’s fiscal
vulnerability against the occurrence of natural disasters.
- The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, has issued Decree No.
4865, dated December 22, 2011(duly published in the Borrower’s official gazette on
December 22, 2011), which, inter alia, modified the reserve requirement of private insurance
firms providing insurance against earthquakes.

93.      Colombia has established itself as a leader in Latin America in developing an
integrated approach to disaster risk management, including disaster risk financing.
Advances in monitoring, early warning systems, and organization of emergency response
have resulted in a reduction in the loss of life caused by natural phenomena. Despite these
advances, Colombia is experiencing rising economic and fiscal costs of natural hazards, as
illustrated by the US$4.5 billion of economic losses from extreme flooding caused by the
2010-11 La Niña. This is the result of the country’s higher vulnerability to natural disaster
risks compared to other developing countries.           Inadequate urbanization processes,
environmental degradation, and possibly climate change are increasing this vulnerability.
Natural hazards therefore represent an important contingent liability for the Government,
estimated at 11-18 percent of GDP for the 2011-50 period (World Bank, 2011).

94.     In the aftermath of the 2010-2011 La Niña, disaster risk management and
financing moved to the top of the political agenda. Encouragingly, Government reform
efforts have continued beyond this disaster episode, as evidenced by the implementation of a
new National Disaster Risk Management Law (1523 of 2012). The Law supports a national
policy on disaster risk management and a National System for Disaster Risk Management and
is an important component to improve the implementation of risk management and financing.
It provides Colombia with coordinated national policies on natural disaster prevention and
response. Moreover, Law 1523 establishes a new Disaster Risk Management Fund to replace
the current National Calamity Fund. The Disaster Risk Management Fund contains, among



the Constitutional Court. An important challenge relates to the identification of a systematic data collection tool
to monitor trends in tutelas. The Bank is supporting the Government on this issue through technical advice.

                                                       34
others, dedicated subaccounts for supporting activities related to risk financing and post-
disaster response.

95.    The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit has approved and published a
National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy. This is an important step which few other
developing countries have matched. The main components of the Strategy include: (1)
enhancement of financial catastrophe risk assessment and applications for financial decision
making, (2) development of a risk layering approach to disaster risk financing that builds on
the National Disaster Risk Management Fund, and, (3) improvement of catastrophe insurance
for public buildings and infrastructure.

96.     The Strategy establishes the context and framework for Colombia’s engagement
in disaster risk financing and identifies the next steps for a more comprehensive
financial protection of the state. This includes a series of subsequent analytical, procedural
and legal steps with the objective of: (1) creating risk financing policy guidelines, (2)
developing an insurance strategy for the central government, including requirements for
future investment in public assets, (3) calculating sectoral probable maximum losses, and, (4)
applying financial protection instruments for the government’s portfolio.

97.      The implementation of the Disaster Risk Financing Strategy would require a
number of specific steps. These steps include: (1) further assessments of the contingent
liability of the Government using catastrophe risk modeling and dynamic financial analysis
tools, (2) increased use of risk retention and risk transfer to protect the budget against natural
disasters, (3) developing a catastrophe risk insurance program for public assets, and, (4)
promotion of the long-term development of property catastrophe risk insurance for private
dwellings. The Government is already planning to carry-out some of these activities, as
outlined below.

98.     Insurance for public buildings is to be gradually transferred from individual to
collective coverage. Today, each individual central government entity is mandated by law to
take out insurance policies for their buildings. The existence of incomplete and inaccurate
information, however, regarding the relative exposure of buildings is problematic and causes
suboptimal coverage and policy pricing. A more effective insurance strategy improves
information on the assets to be insured and exploits the use of pooled risks by collectively
placing insurance for all central government buildings. The Bank is currently providing
technical assistance to support this area of the disaster risk financing strategy. A pilot is
planned for 2012-13 to assess the level of cost savings possible from improved information,
with the medium-term goal of transitioning to a collective approach.

99.     The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is preparing revisions to Law 1523
that would allow the National Disaster Risk Management Fund to accumulate reserves
and to be used to execute catastrophe risk transfer. Although the Fund includes a
dedicated subaccount for implementing a financial protection strategy against disasters, the
limitations of its current design make it unviable for implementing an integrated disaster risk
financing strategy. The Ministry has identified the limitations of the current design and it is
preparing a decree to propose modifications to the Fund.

100. To support the implementation of the Disaster Risk Financing Strategy, the
Government has also made good progress in further developing the legal and regulatory
                                               35
framework. A new Public Private Partnership Law (1508, dated January 2012) reduces
future contingent liabilities associated with infrastructure investments, in part, through risk
transfer to concessionaires. As explained below, important modifications have been made to
the reserve requirements of private firms insuring against earthquakes with the objective of
gradually increasing private insurance coverage.

101. A new Decree establishes that earthquake reserves in private insurance
companies must take into account the real exposure, as quantified through risk-based
modeling. Decree No. 4865 of December 2011, issued by Ministry of Finance, demands that
insurance companies use quantitative models authorized by the Financial Superintendence.
Additionally, the Financial Superintendence must develop its own reference model. The
decree brings to bear two advantages. First, it reduces the contingent liability of the
Government. With the new Decree, reserves will be defined according to risk exposure.
Secondly, the Decree introduces the technical practice of establishing earthquake reserves in
the insurance market that takes the real exposure of insured risks into account. By reflecting
the true cost of the risk (rather than market-based rates), prices will provide signals to policy
holders on their exposure. This can promote investment in risk mitigation and discourage
location in high-risk areas. The Bank will provide analytical support to the Financial
Superintendence in implementing this decree.

102. As Colombia starts implementing its new Disaster Risk Financing Strategy, it is
expected to make increased use of new financial instruments. Table 7 provides an
overview of the ex-ante financial instruments currently in place in Colombia. This includes
annual budget allocations, reserve funds, and contingent credit (such as the DPL with CAT
DDO). Future use of parametric insurance or catastrophe bonds as a part of sovereign disaster
risk transfer may be a possibility. Finally, it is noted that the Government made active use of
ex-post financing through increased taxation in the wake of La Niña, as discussed in the
previous section on tax reform.

    (indemnity-based)

103. Improved disaster risk financing forms part of a holistic strategy to improve the
management of contingent liabilities of the government. Other important initiatives that
the Government has taken in recent years include the above mentioned PPP law, the creation
of a legal defense unit of the state, improving the tool box to assess the fiscal risks associated
with legal claims, and improved guidelines related to risk management in the process of hiring
in the public sector, amongst others.


                                                   36
104. Next steps and pending challenges: To fully implement the National Disaster
Financing Strategy, several ongoing technical studies would need to be completed to ensure
an appropriate financial risk assessment; mainly, the collection of exposure information for
public assets needs to completed. Financial instruments would increasingly have to be
implemented. While it is possible that this can be accomplished over the next years,
implementing the strategy is a long-term effort and an iterative process. Additional work also
needs to be done on designing the institutional mechanisms and implementing the legal
clarifications. The relative roles and responsibilities of the Ministry of Financing and Public
Credit and the recently created National Disaster Risk Management Unit for implementing the
National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy also remain ambiguous in the legal text.

Agricultural Risk Management

Prior Action for DPL II: The Borrower has improved the institutional framework for its
private agriculture insurance market, through: (a) the promulgation of Law No. 1450, dated
June 16, 2011(duly published in the Borrower’s official gazette on June 16, 2011) which,
inter alia, established a risk management framework to integrate adaptation and mitigation
strategies to improve production risks; (b) the issuance by the National Agricultural Credit
Commission of: (i) Resolution No. 1, dated August 23, 2011 (duly published in the Borrower’s
official gazette on September 2, 2011), which inter alia, expanded the type of risks that
qualify for public subsidies for agriculture insurance premiums; and (ii) Resolution No. 1,
dated May 16, 2012 (duly published in the Borrower’s official gazette on May 16, 2012),
which, inter alia, preserved the voluntary access to insurance.

105. The agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. To
illustrate, during the 2010-11 La Niña, 1,086,000 hectares of land were severely affected,
160,000 heads of livestock died, 13 million square meters of rural infrastructure was
permanently damaged, and 140,000 housing units in rural areas were affected by floods.
More generally, accumulated losses in the agricultural sector are on the increase in Colombia,
rising from 1.5 percent of GDP in 1971-80 to 5.6 percent of GDP in 1991-2000 (Natural
Hazard Assessment (ERN), 2004).

106. The lack of a comprehensive ex-ante strategy to manage fiscal risks in the
agricultural sector has resulted in higher-than-anticipated fiscal layouts in recent years.
Reserve funds created to provide financial cover arising from natural disaster events were
generally insufficient. As a result, the Government had to allocate additional funds of around
US$48 million to support 179,450 producers for damages caused by highly irregular weather
patterns in the 2007-09 period. Moreover, in the aftermath of the 2010 La Niña, the
Government announced an ambitious coping plan for the agricultural sector of around US$1
billion with the highest component for rural credit, but also including irrigation infrastructure,
sanitary infrastructure, and rural housing.

107. The anticipation of a government bailout reduces the demand for insurance from
farmers. The Colombian agricultural sector has limited access to insurance instruments and
farmers are increasingly relying on government support. During recent weather events
farmers relied on informal financial instruments, individual resources, and any support
provided by the government or development partners. The perceived probability of
government support decreases the demand for instruments such as insurance. This does not

                                               37
contribute to the efforts of the Government and the private sector to increase the limited
insurance penetration of agriculture insurance (currently at less than one percent of the
cultivated area). This situation highlights the importance of promoting a comprehensive and
coordinated risk management tools for farmers, including the facilitation of a gradual transfer
of risk from the public to the private sector through an improved institutional framework for
responding to disasters.

108. The Government has improved the institutional framework to manage
agricultural risks. 18 The National Development Plan Law 1450 of 2011 establishes a new
risk management framework that integrates adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to
improve production risks. The Plan also promotes a reduction in market risks through the
improvement and development of insurance and hedge instruments. Finally, it envisages an
enhanced institutional role for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR).

109. A new legal and regulatory framework seeks to promote the development of the
private agriculture insurance market. Law 1450 of 2011 (Articles 72-77) reinforces the
support for agriculture risk management instruments; in particular agricultural insurance. The
Law establishes an increase in public funding for agriculture insurance premium subsidies, an
expansion in the types of risks covered by public subsidies, and places the management and
regulation of the public subsidies for agricultural insurance with the MADR.

110. As a part of the new framework, the National Agricultural Commission of Credit
(CNCA) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have issued several
resolutions. 19 Resolution 1 dated August 2011, issued by the CNCA, expands the type of
risks that qualify for public subsidies for agriculture insurance premiums to also include
natural and biological hazards. Resolution 1, dated May 16, 2012, also issued by CNCA,
preserves the voluntary access to insurance (see explanation below). Finally, Resolution 53 of
2012, issued by the MADR, regulates the specific types of hazards, crops and activities that
can be covered by a subsidy and establishes the ceiling amounts covered (per hectare or
agriculture activity) based on the 2012 annual insurance plan.

111. Although mandatory insurance may appear to be an attractive option to reduce
agriculture credit risks, a voluntary scheme is a more sustainable option. If insurance is
mandatory then farmers perceive the purchase of insurance as a requirement for obtaining
credit rather than a rational solution based on a risk assessment. Credit officers may similarly
perceive insurance to be ‘one more item on their check list’, as opposed to undertaking a risk
profile assessment to determine whether insurance is necessary in the first place. If insurance
is voluntary, then banks would be expected to request insurance if the client truly needed it
(thereby avoiding unnecessary costs if they do not). Moreover, if the farmer has insurance
then the terms and conditions of the loan could be improved. However, for voluntary access
to result in adequate insurance coverage, it is indispensable to build capacity with farmers and
credit officers on the types and benefits of agriculture insurance.

18
   Aside from natural hazards, agricultural performance is also affected by a series of other risks related to: (1)
phytosanitary risks (all agricultural products); (2) exchange rate risks (traders of flowers, coffee, rice, banana and
plantains); and (3) commodity price volatility (bovine meat, poultry, flowers, and coffee).
19
   The National Agricultural Credit Commission (CNCA), which is responsible for managing the national
agricultural credit system, includes the MADR (chair), the DNP General Director, and the President (through
two representatives). FINAGRO functions as the technical secretariat.

                                                         38
112. The new framework was well received by the private insurance industry. To
illustrate, prior to its introduction only one private insurance firm (Mapfre) was providing
insurance coverage in the agricultural sector in Colombia. In 2012, two additional firms (Sura
and La Previsora) started to provide coverage in the sector, in response to an improved
institutional environment.

113. Based on its new risk management role, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development has also taken steps to create an Agricultural Risk Management and
Financing Directorate. The creation of this Directorate has become part of a more
comprehensive process of institutional reorganization within the MADR. This explains, in
part, why the legal establishment of this Directorate has taken longer than expected. The
Bank has advised the Ministry on the institutional design of the Directorate, as a part of its
knowledge services on agricultural risk management.

114. The fiscal exposure to agriculture sector risks is expected to be better understood
as a result of the ongoing reform process. The overall objective of the new Agricultural
Risk Management and Financing Directorate is to identify, assess and quantify agricultural
risks, as well as to enhance public and private sector capacity in developing tools and
instruments for reducing, transferring and managing agriculture production and market risks.
The Directorate is expected to provide important information and risk analysis to public sector
decision makers, as well as to financial institutions, in order to design and coordinate
agriculture risk mechanisms and instruments to smooth the incomes of farmers and reduce the
need for ex-post disaster relief from the government. The availability of high quality and
timely agro-meteorological data and forecasting tools will facilitate improved agriculture
production decisions. Moreover, it is likely to lead to cheaper and higher-quality agricultural
insurance contracts as insurance companies improve their understanding of the actual
magnitude of risks that they are covering. Improved data availability could also potentially
leverage private sector funds for hedging agriculture risks. All of these effects would
ultimately reduce the need for unplanned emergency government support and allocations.

115. Pending challenges include the analysis and quantification of agriculture risks
which could potentially serve as an input into the National Disaster Financing Strategy.
International experience demonstrates that developing a basic public sector capacity for
undertaking agriculture risk assessments is an important step in the process of moving from
an ex-post to an ex-ante management of fiscal risks. Other Latin American countries have
already established such agriculture risk management units, providing risk mapping, risk
quantification, training and capacity building for mainstreaming agriculture risk management
into public sector programs and private sector financial instruments. 20 In the medium term,
additional public investments in agricultural infrastructure are necessary to increases
resilience to natural hazards and lay the basis for climate change mitigation.

116. Expected medium term outcomes for component (C) improved disaster risk
financing management. Support in the area of disaster risk financing is expected to assist in
the identification of sources of natural disaster risks, the quantification of their potential fiscal
impact and the introduction of relevant financial instruments to mitigate risks.
Operational Design

  The Office of Agriculture Risk Management of Argentina was one of the first offices created in the region.
Other countries include: Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic.

                                                    39
117. This operation is a programmatic series of two Development Policy Loans
designed to support the Government of Colombia’s fiscal management program. The
program covers three policy areas: budget predictability and stability, social security liability
management, and disaster risk financing. Given the medium-term nature of the reform
efforts, Bank engagement naturally lends itself to a programmatic engagement. The first loan
was designed to support relevant and necessary legislative changes to strengthen the fiscal
framework. The second loan supports the implementation the fiscal management legislation
and other relevant administrative fiscal measures. The operational design is summarized in
the Policy Matrix (Annex 5).

118. DPL II prior actions differ in various aspects from the set of indicative triggers
identified in DPL I, reflecting varying speed of reform implementation. Out of a set of
seven indicative triggers, four were converted to prior actions while the remaining three were
substituted with alternative prior actions. The quality of the Program supported in DPL II is
comparable to what was originally proposed in DPL I. Moreover, the Government stands
committed in all the areas, as evidenced by policy continuity (as opposed to reform reversals).
Inevitably, however, the speed of reform implementation varies as the Government may face
competing political priorities or implementation capacity constraints.

119. Envisaged reforms under policy objective (A) of debt and cash management took
longer than expected and were therefore not included as prior actions. While progress
has been registered in developing a new design for the Treasury Single Account, the issuance
of key implementing regulation was still being developed at the time of loan preparation.
Similarly, the ambition to develop a ‘state of the art’ medium term debt management strategy
has resulted in a slower-than-expected trajectory of completing this important document,
which currently exists in draft form and is expected to be implemented in January 2013. 21

120. On the other hand, progress in the areas of social security liability management
(B) and disaster risk financing (C) has been more substantial than originally anticipated.
As a result, prior actions were included to acknowledge the establishment of a health system
contingency fund and efforts to reduce fiscal contingent liabilities related to earthquakes.
Implementation progress in policy areas (B) and (C) compensate for the slower reform
progress related to debt and cash management under policy area (A).

121. Finally, actions to expand agricultural insurance coverage substitute for the
creation of the Agricultural Risk Management and Financing Directorate. While the
legal establishment of the Directorate is well underway it was not completed at the time of
loan preparation. This action is taking longer than expected because it became embedded in a
more comprehensive process of institutional restructuring that the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development embarked on. At the same time the Government made progress on the
legal and regulatory framework for agricultural insurance, which the policy matrix
acknowledged instead. Agricultural insurance is an important component of a risk
management strategy for the sector, and the eventual establishment of the Risk Directorate
provides reassurance that the Government is approaching the issue of agricultural risk
insurance in a comprehensive manner.

     The Bank has been providing technical assistance to the Government in the development of the debt strategy.

Results Framework

122. The Government is performing very well against the targets identified in the
First DPL Operation. The central government fiscal deficit declined from 3.9 to 2.8 percent
of GDP between 2010 and 2011 – well below the 2013 DPL I target of 3.2 percent of GDP.
This, in turn, is explained by the strong revenue performance: central government non-oil tax
revenues rose from 12.0 percent of GDP in 2010 to 12.9 percent of GDP in 2011 (DPL I
target: 12.5 percent of GDP in 2013). The Government also managed to reduce the costs in
the health insurance system by more than expected. Specifically, reimbursements for services
provided outside the Mandatory Health Care package of the Contributory Regime fell about
ten percent in 2011 (from COP 2,345 billion to COP 2,103 billion) and remains below the
target of maintaining nominal costs constant at COP 2,400 billion in 2013 (see Annex 6).

                                                             42
123. The Results Framework for DPL II has been modified to reflect changes to the
policy matrix and stronger-than-expected performance against original targets. To
measure fiscal rule performance, a structural fiscal balance indicator has been introduced
using the Government definition and targets, replacing the above mentioned overall central
government balance indicator. A complementary indicator has been introduced to track the
evaluation of the Consultative Committee of the Government’s fiscal rule implementation
efforts. The indicator to measure tax revenue collection effort remains unchanged with
targets adjusted upwards to reflect current government targets. The indicator to measure
health system costs also remains unchanged as does the target (which is equivalent to the
official one). Finally, a new indicator has been introduced to measure the expansion of
agricultural insurance.

                           VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                   A. Poverty and Social Aspects
124. The Government actions, supported in this DPL, are expected to have a positive
poverty and social impact. There are reasons to expect a positive or neutral impact of each
of the supported reforms, as explained below.

125. The fiscal rule contributes to improved fiscal performance and macroeconomic
stability, which are important foundations for sustained economic growth and poverty
reduction. Moreover, the fiscal rule strengthens the capacity of the Government to pursue
counter-cyclical fiscal policy, including the implementation of social programs that can
protect the poor and vulnerable in times of growth decelerations. The structural fiscal
adjustment implemented thus far has taken place primarily through enhanced tax revenues,
and there is no evidence to suggest that further adjustment will take place through a reduction
in pro-poor spending. On the contrary, the Government has proceeded to expand the main
conditional cash transfer program (Familias en Acción) and has initiated the construction of
low-cost housing for the extreme poor. Existing social safety nets are affordable and fiscally
sustainable.

126. The 2010 tax reform is estimated to have had a small positive impact on low
income households. The reform tends to affect mainly high-income individuals and private
sector firms. The elimination of the capital investment tax credit of firms, the reduction of the
energy surcharge of firms and the closing of financial transaction loopholes are not expected
to have any direct impact the poor. The gradual elimination of the financial transaction tax
will have a positive impact on the low income households who use the banking system. The
increased base and higher rate of the wealth tax will not directly negatively affect the poor.
On the contrary, proceeds from this tax were used to finance humanitarian efforts in the wake
of the 2010-11 La Niña.

127. The update of the Mandatory Benefit Package brings important benefits for the
poor, vulnerable groups and women. 22 The Colombian Benefit Package is not a ‘basic
package’, but rather a very comprehensive one and the recent update expanded the coverage
of health goods and services. The burden of disease of the poor necessitates health
22
  This paragraph summarizes the findings of an analysis of the social impact of the update of the Mandatory
Benefit Package developed in the context of loan preparation.

                                                    43
promotion, prevention and health care interventions that were already included in the previous
Package and the update contains improvements to primary health care. For instance, new
medicines and other goods needed to deal with acute and transmittable diseases as well as
with chronic conditions (i.e. diabetes and hypertension), that disproportionally affect the poor,
were improved. Moreover, the introduction of a set of mental health care services facilitates
the treatment of vulnerable groups such as internally displaced population and victims of
domestic violence. The expansion of new pharmaceutical alternatives needed for health care
of individuals living with HIV/AIDS will improve the quality of life of patients. The
introduction of procedures to improve the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological and
obstetric conditions represent important improvements in the quality of health of women.
Finally, the update will not change the special arrangements for indigenous communities as it
does not govern these benefits by which each community can also include their own
traditional medicine.

128. Being financially prepared for natural hazards reduces the need for governments
to divert fiscal resources away from long-term development goals when a disaster
strikes. Ex ante disaster risk financing instruments facilitate an appropriate fiscal response to
a natural hazard event thereby reducing the magnitude and duration of adverse impacts on the
affected population, which typically include the poorest and most vulnerable segments. Such
instruments also gradually transfer the risk from the public to the private sector thereby
reducing the fiscal contingency of the state. Increased insurance coverage, whether of public
buildings or private agricultural land, reduce the fiscal burden of the government in
responding to natural disasters and allows the government to focus limited resources on the
most vulnerable populations. This, in turn, reduces the need for the Government to reduce
public spending on long-term development (including social spending), to respond to a crisis.

129. Colombia’s existing social safety net is well equipped to handle natural disasters.
The core social protection program, Familias en Acción, has operational rules for disasters
and has demonstrated its ability to continue serving poor disaster victims in several recent
disaster episodes. Similarly, the Unidos strategy played an important role during the 2010-11
La Niña, as the program's social workers and municipal staff contributed substantially to
developing a census of affected families that was later used to target government
interventions, and to coordinating interventions at the local level. Finally, a temporary
unemployment program (Programa de Empleo de Emergencia) was designed to respond to
the La Niña, and the Government is currently institutionalizing the program, which is to be
triggered during crises in the future.

130. Support to agricultural risks management will have positive effects on the rural
population, particularly small farmers. By making fiscal outlays for the management of
agriculture risks more predictable, facilitating agro-meteorological information for
forecasting, and developing the agriculture insurance market, it is expected that small farmers
will gain access to more readily accessible support to prevent and respond to production
losses due to natural disasters. The smoothing of agriculture incomes, in particular for the
rural poor, can have significant positive social and economic implications for investment and
consumption.

                                    B. Environmental Aspects
131. The proposed operation is not likely to have any significant effects on the
environment. Following OP 8.60, the operation was reviewed for any potential effects
relating to the environment, forest, and natural resources. As this operation focuses on
implementing a fiscal management program it is not expected to have any impact on the
environment.

132. The Government of Colombia is well prepared to address potential
environmental impacts. The National Development Plan (2010-14) focuses on sustainable
growth, with environmental and disaster risk management as a cross-cutting theme, and calls
for the strengthening of the National Environment System. The new Ministry of Environment
and Sustainable Development 23 has prioritized the implementation of measures to strengthen
the sustainability of some of the priority economic sectors, also known as growth engines
(agriculture, mining, and construction). The Bank has been accompanying the Government in
this process through a package of services, including the Environmental Development Policy
Loan series, the Sustainable Development Investment Loan and the provision of targeted
technical assistance and analytical support in the area of environmental management.

133. Finally, it should be emphasized that post-disaster reconstruction efforts are
conducted under a robust environmental framework in Colombia. The National Disaster
Risk Management Law (1523 of 2012) in its Article 6 defines that post-disaster recuperation
processes must be undertaken within the context of territorial safety and environmental
frameworks with respect to physical and socioeconomic conditions. The Law also reinforces
that the recuperation process should avoid generating new conditions of disaster risk through
the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure (e.g. road or drainage) or in the construction of
new one.

                       C. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
134. MHCP and DNP are responsible for coordinating actions among the concerned
agencies. The Department for Public Credit within the MHCP will collect the necessary data
to assess the implementation progress for which the MHCP is responsible and report it to the
Bank. Similarly, the Sub-directorate of Public Credit within the DNP will collect the
information necessary related to the implementation progress for which the Ministry of Health
and the MADR are responsible and report it to the Bank (see Annexes 5 and 6 for details).

                                       D. Fiduciary Aspects

Public financial management

135. The public financial management systems are adequate to support development
policy lending. The national level Public Financial Management (PFM) systems show
advanced levels of performance which are close to good international practices, according to
the most recent Public Financial Management and Procurement Report (2009). Moreover,

23
  The Ministry of Environment was created after the division of the Ministry of Environment, Housing and
Territorial Development into two ministries as part of the broader institutional reforms of the current
administration.

                                                  45
Colombia has an effective track record of implementing PFM reforms, which have been
supported by the Bank through a package of financing instruments and knowledge services.
Salient features of the PFM systems are summarized below.

136. The budget is comprehensive, well documented, and implemented as planned,
with actual expenditures deviating only slightly from planned levels. Budget planning is
based on a multi-year perspective and annual formulation reflects a functioning policy-based
system. Execution of budgeted expenditures suggests a largely credible budget, although
some arrears may exist. The Borrower has published its annual budget in a timely fashion
(Decree 4970 of December 30, 2011).

137. Revenue and expenditure controls are comprehensive, although some concerns
arise with the quality of revenue reporting. Of significant relevance are strong measures to
safeguard overall integrity and accuracy of revenue data, by integrating or reconciling the
different accounting systems used by the tax administrator, ensuring consistency between the
information from its accounting and statistical records, and guaranteeing timely recording of
transactions. Records and controls on cash flows, balances, and public debt support sound
fiscal management and provide public institutions with the tools for predicting funding to
execute their budgets in an orderly manner.

138. The consolidated public accounts are prepared within six months of the end of
the fiscal year. They include full information on revenues, expenditures, and financial assets
and liabilities. Year-end accrual-based financial statements are issued by the Accountant
General and presented within six months by May 15 of the following year to the Controller
General for audit purposes. The Controller General’s auditing policies and procedures
provide for the application of financial, compliance, and performance procedures consistent
with national government auditing standards. Audit reports are submitted before July 1 of the
following fiscal year to the Congress and the President of the Republic.

Procurement

139. An assessment of the public procurement system concludes that Colombia has
made progress over the past five years, although further progress is needed. There have
been leaps forward in modernizing the procurement system, but work remains in terms of
consolidating gains and ensuring sustainability. One of the most relevant steps forward has
been the recent creation (November 2011) of the Procurement Directorate (Agencia Nacional
de Contratación Pública, Colombia Compra Eficiente) to oversee and lead the procurement
reforms, replacing the inter-sectoral Commission of Public Procurement (CINCO). However,
important remaining challenges include: (1) the legal framework should regulate standards not
only processes and align procurement to expenditure policy. (2) The electronic procurement
system should be updated and become a transactional procurement platform to improve
transparency, generate competition, or streamlining processes. (3) Professional workforce
should be developed. Procurement staff lacks both knowledge and professionalism to deliver
the best outcomes, including saving costing strategies. Finally, the Procurement Directorate
should be furnished with sufficient resources and capacity to effectively champion further
modernization efforts. In sum, the legal, institutional and operational frameworks must be
dynamic and adaptable to respond the challenges in the market as new technologies and ways
of doing business develop in Colombia and around the world.

                               E. Disbursement and Auditing
140. Disbursement arrangements. Upon effectiveness and compliance with any
withdrawal tranche release conditions, and following the Borrower’s request, the Bank would
deposit the funds into an account denominated in US dollars of the Central Bank (Banco de la
República) for subsequent credit into the Treasury Single Account of the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit, thus becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit will provide the Bank with a written confirmation of the described
transaction after funds are disbursed by the Bank.

141. There is no evidence that the banking control environment into which the DPL
proceeds would flow is other than adequate. This assessment is based on a review of the
2010 and 2011 External audit report of the Central Bank, the latest IMF Central Bank
safeguards assessment (2010), and the 2011 IMF Article IV Consultation. Based on the
assessment of the Borrower’s current public financial management systems and the
conclusion that the fiduciary arrangements for this financing are adequate, the Bank will not
require an audit of the designated account, and no additional fiduciary arrangements are
considered necessary at this time.


                               F. Risks and Risk Mitigation
142. The DPL operation is subject to risks related to a deteriorating external
economic environment and reform program implementation. Despite solid fundamentals,
Colombia’s near-term macroeconomic outlook could be adversely affected in the event of
external shocks. This risk is mitigated by a high policy response capacity. There are also
risks of policy slippages related to the implementation of the fiscal management program. By
way of mitigation, this DPL was designed to exclusively support administrative measures that
do not depend on legislative processes. The overall risk classification is thus considered low.

143. Despite high exposure to external shocks, Colombia exhibits low vulnerability
because of a high policy response capacity. Colombia is exposed to three different types of
external shocks, including: a slowdown in economic activity in the US, a decline in oil prices,
and global financial market turmoil (World Bank, 2012a). Mitigation: The country’s macro
resilience is based on solid initial conditions and policy buffers to respond. Economic growth
is solid and the absence of significant domestic or external imbalances help shore up stability.
Substantial foreign direct investment inflows, ample accumulation of foreign reserves, and a
Flexible Credit Line with the IMF protect the external position. Colombia also enjoys a
flexible exchange rate and has room for monetary and fiscal policy easing.

144. The emphasis on administrative (as opposed to legislative) measures in DPL II
reduces the program risk of policy slippages. The DPL program essentially supported two
different reform stages. The first DPL supported the reform design stage, which mainly relied
on major legislative reforms that the Government was able to take through Congress during a
period of high political capital in the first year of the Administration. The second DPL,
supported the reform implementation stage, which by its very nature is more focused on
administrative measures over which the Executive has full control. This effectively reduces
the program risk associated with the legislative process. The latter may nonetheless affect the
outcomes of the supported program, for instance, if tax reforms necessary to meet fiscal rule
targets are not approved by Congress. Beyond the DPL Program, the Administration’s

                                              47
broader fiscal reform agenda, including the envisaged tax and pension reforms, would
continue to be subject to the Executive’s ability to pass legislative reforms successfully in
Congress.

145. The recent cabinet reshuffle is not expected to affect program implementation
negatively. In mid-August 2012, President Santos asked all his ministers to resign in bid to
re-orient and strengthen his Administration towards negotiating a peace deal with guerilla
groups. The decision was also prompted by declining popular support of the Government
owing to increased insecurity and the setback associated with the judicial reform. Some of
the ministers that changed include the Minister of Finance and Public Credit, and, the
Minister of Health and Social Protection. These changes are not expected to affect the DPL
Program, as most reform actions have already been taken. Moreover, it is not expected to
affect the development objective supported by the DPL, since the Colombian Government is
known for policy continuity and for strong commitment to fiscal prudence.

146.   Implementation risks differ by program area, but are generally low:

147. (A) Budget predictability and Stability. Colombia’s hard earned credibility for fiscal
prudence will come under extra scrutiny in the process of evaluating fiscal rule
implementation and as the process of fiscal consolidation gradually tightens the Government’s
room for maneuver in years to come. Mitigation: The current Administration has already
undertaken a substantial part of the necessary fiscal adjustment for the 2010-14 period.
Moreover, the Government has sufficient capacity to ensure a satisfactory implementation of
the fiscal rule. If needed, the Bank is ready to support the Government in this area with
knowledge and convening services.

148. (B) Social security liability management. Risks may be somewhat higher in the
health sector where success partially depends on the progress in implementing new fiscal and
financial instruments. The health insurance finances are generally vulnerable and may be
subject to additional unanticipated shocks in the future. Mitigation: The Government has in
recent years demonstrated its resolve fiscal and financial challenges in the health sector
through effective administrative measures, suggesting that it has the capacity to respond
adequately. The future establishment of an institute for evaluation of technologies and a new
peer reviewing system are also important mitigating factors.

149. (C) Disaster Risk Financing. Finally, the most important risk in this area relates to
administrative capacity to implement the program. In the case of the Ministry of Finance and
Public Credit this challenge is primarily related to the technical complexity of analyzing the
fiscal impact of disaster risk, and, designing and implementing financial instruments to
mitigate these. In the case of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development the
prolonged process in legally establishing the Agricultural Risk Management and Financing
Directorate may be indicative that its full effectiveness may also take time. Mitigation: The
Bank, through knowledge services in this area, can support the Government in mitigating this
risk.

     ANNEX 1: FISCAL CONSOLIDATION IN COLOMBIA – A LONG TERM VIEW 24
The adoption of a new Constitution in 1991 implied a strong expansion of the size of
Government in Colombia. Increased demand for public spending in health, education, and justice
drove central government primary expenditure from 7.2 percent of GDP in 1990 to 12.4 percent of
GDP in 2000. By the end of the 1990s, fiscal sustainability in Colombia was uncertain: Central
government debt to GDP was rising fast and several local governments were over-indebted.

Starting in the early 2000s, an adjustment was implemented, including several tax reforms. This
included reforms of the subnational transfer system and other measures that substantially reduced the
central government deficit from 6.0 percent of GDP in 1999 to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2008. As a
result, the central government debt-to-GDP ratio declined throughout the 2000s and has been stable in
recent years (Figure A.1, panel a). The fiscal reforms implemented since 2010, and supported in this
programmatic DPL, thus represent a continuation of this long-term structural fiscal adjustment.

The composition of public debt was improved to reduce financial fragility of the Government
and to encourage the development of the capital market. This included the following:
• Steps were taken to decrease the currency mismatch of the public sector, by shifting the
  composition of its debt from foreign currency denominated bonds (mostly external debt) toward
  local currency denominated bonds (mostly internally issued). As a result, a substantial drop in the
  currency mismatch indicator was achieved (Figure A.1, panel b).
• An effort was also made to change the composition of domestic debt from inflation or dollar
  indexed bonds toward fixed-rate peso denominated bonds. In September 2011, the stock of
  local, fixed-interest, peso denominated bonds accounted for 51.4 percent of total central
  government debt and represented 18.3 percent of GDP (Figure A.1, panel c).
• The maturity of new bond issues was increased throughout the last decade, as a sign of
  credibility in both fiscal and monetary policy (Figure A.1, panel d). The share of the
  outstanding stock of bonds with less than one year residual maturity has declined in the past ten
  years in favor of issues with maturity greater than five years, while the share of issues with residual
  maturity between three and five years has remained stable (Figure A.1, panel e). Today, the longest
  maturity in the government treasury bills (TES) market is fifteen years.

Empirical analysis suggests that improvements in fiscal policy and public debt management
permanently reduced the sovereign risk premium in Colombia with important positive effects:
• The long-run level of the real interest rate declined, as evidenced by a 60 percent decrease in the
   EMBI for Colombia, while controlling for other factors. A lower risk premium, in turn,
   permanently reduces the long-run real exchange rate. Hence, part of the real appreciation observed
   in the past decade can be attributed to better fiscal policy.
• The economy has become less vulnerable to global risk aversion shocks because of the
   reduced sensitivity of the risk premium to such shocks. This implies lower responses of the
   exchange rate and capital flows to those shocks, and consequently, lower pressure on inflation,
   output and monetary policy.
• The effectiveness of fiscal policy increased. A strong fiscal position improved the power of fiscal
   (expenditure) policy to affect output. The responses in the beginning of the decade were small and
   short-lived (and sometimes negative). As the fiscal stance improved over the decade, output
   responses turned positive and significant for several periods.
• Similarly, structural fiscal policy changes may also have strengthened the response of market
   interest rates to (unanticipated) monetary policy interest rate shocks. The transmission of
   policy rates to TES interest rates (and to average maturity), for instance, clearly indicate the
   existence of two different regimes: before and after 2004.

 Asunto: Carta de politica - Segundo Prestamo Programatico Para Politicas de Desarrollo a favor
                  de Ia Recuperacion del Crecimlen to y Ia Sostenibilidad Fiscal.


Estimado Seilor Kim,

El Gobiemo colombiano esta coovencido de Ia importancia que tiene para el pais garantizar un
manejo responsable de las finanzas publicas que contribuya a Ia estabilidad macroecon6mica. Por
tal raz6n, se han llevado a cabo reformas econ6micas de amplia trascendencia en el diseno de Ia
polltica fiscal que fortalecen los objetivos de sostenibilidad fiscal y que afianzan el mayor
crecimiento econ6mico que se ha registrado en lo ultimos anos, a pesar de un contexto extemo
con mayor incertidumbfe.

Los fundamentales de Ia estabi idad macroecon6miC3 se han fortalecido sobre las bases de Ia
coherencia en el manejo econ6mico del pais. fundamenlado en Ia coordinaci6n de Ia politica
monetaria y Ia fiscal, apoyadas en Ia solidez del sistema financiero y en un regimen de tasa de
cambia flexible. Asi, se idenlifican los tres pilares de Ia politica econOmica: i) una politica fiscal con
manejo responsable, en el que Ia prioriz.aci6n del gaslo social y Ia inversi6n publica es posible sin
descuidar el objelivo de garantizar Ia soslenibilidad de Ia deuda publica, i) el manejo de Ia politica
monetaria bajo un esquema de infiaci6n objetivo, facW        ila su papel cootraclcfico en favor de Ia
eslabilidad del crecimiento. Bajo este esquema, en et ano 2011 Ia economia colombiana alcanz6
Ia meta de inflaci6n. 3,0% (•1·1•4). lo cual favorece especialmenle a Ia poblaci6n de menores
ingresos, y iii) e1 desarrollo de medidas macroprudenciales orientadas hacia el forfalecimiento del
sistema financiero.

Durante los utUmos alios el Gobierno colombiano ha togrado disenar y ejecutar de manera exitosa
un programa econ6mico para el fortalecimiento de las finanzas p(Jblicas, teniendo en ruenla el
conjunto de refonmas econ6micas aprobadas durante los aoos 2010 y 2011 que brindan un nuevo
mafCO iflstitucional para Ia polilica fiscal, enlre los que se enouenlran el Acto Legislabvo de
Sostenibilidad Fiscal (Acto Legislativo 3 de 2011), el Aclo Legislativo del Sistema General de

en particular Ia ley 1430 de 2010 que ha fortalecido el recaudo tributario. Oicho marco insfitucional

De hecho, aun con todos los choques adversos el resul1ado fiscal del Gobierno Nacional Central y
del Sector Publico Consotidado son mejor que lo esperado. De hecho, mientras que para 2011 se
esperaba un deficit fiscal del Sector Publico Consolidado de 3,4% del PIB, los c!lculos arrojaron
resultados mucho mejor que los esperados (deficit de 2,0% del PIB). AI mismo liempo que el nivel
de Ia deuda neta del Gobierno Nacional Central y del Sector Publico No Financiero mantiene una
senda decreciente. Esta situaci6n es entonces el mejor ref!ejo del compromiso del Gobiemo con Ia
sostenibilidad fiscal y el manejo responsable de las finanzas pijblicas

El fortalecimiento de los fundamentos econ6mi:xls del pais, ha permilido resultados faVOfables en
terminos de aecimiento econ6mico y generaci6n de empleo, con avances en Ia foonalizaci6n
!aboral. Particularmente, Ia economla colombiana logro resistir los efectos adversos de Ia crisis
financiera intemacional en los anos 2008 y 2009, considerando que el crecimiento econ6mico en
2009 fue de 1.7%, mientras que en olras economias de Ia regi6n se obsaN6 una desaceleraci6n
mas acentuada. En los anos 2010 y 201 1 el crecimiento econ6mico se ha expandido a tasas del
4.0% y 5.9%, respectivamenle.

Especialmente, en el ano 201 1 ,1a tasa de desempleo se ubic6 en niveles de un digito a finales del
aiio {alcanz6 un 9.0% en octubre de 2011 a nivel nacional), lo cuat no se registraba desde el ano
2007, periodo en el cualla economla se encontraba en su lase expansiva. lgualmente, el empleo
formal en las principalos ciudades registro un aecimiento promedio de 5.5% durante el aiio 2011,
consistente con el mayor crecim~ento de Ia economia.

El aumento de Ia tasa de inversiOn durante los idtimos ai\os, Ia cual pas6 de 16.6% del PIB en
2002 a 27.1% en 2011, se ha retlejado eo un amptiaci6n de Ia capacidad productiva de Ia
economia eo el mediano plazo, y ha representado un crecimiento del PIB potencial cercano al
5.0%. Los objetivos propuestos con~ Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2010-2014 relacionados con el
impulso a sectores estrategicos como los de ciencia y tecnologia, infraestruclura, y el
fortalecimiento de las politicas educativas permitiran seguir avanzando en una senda de
crecimiento econ6mico sostenible que puede ser cercana al 6% durante los pr6ximos anos.

Por otra parte, si bien es cierto que Ia sofidez del sistema financiero qued6 dem      ostrada en Ia
pasada crisis financiera internaclonal, el Gobierno Colombiano sigue trabajar)dO en su
consolidaci6n para Ia cuat ha diS&nado una agenda prudencial orienlada a meJ(>rar Ia calidad del
cap~al de los bancos, conforme a Ia normatividad reciente sobre provision de cartera de credilo y
las medidas para tortatecer et capital de los establecimientos de credito, junto con el desarrollo del
mercado de capitales. El trabajo con el srstema financiero incluye ademas una ambiciosa agenda
de inclusiOn financiera cuya principal motivaci6n es promover ta formalizaci6n de un ampl10
porcentaje de Ia poblaci6n. Esla estra!egia permitira no solamente profundizar Ia oferta de
servicios del sistema ftnanciero sino que ademas hara mas "visibles' a los agenles, y mas
transparentes las operaciooes, todo lo cual tendril una incidencia tnbutaria importante.

Re.: Letter of Development Policy – Second Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience
                                      Development Policy Loan


Dear Mr. Kim,

The Government of Colombia is aware of the importance of responsible fiscal management for
macroeconomic stability. For this reason, the Government has carried forward economic reforms
affecting the design of fiscal policy to strengthen the objectives of fiscal sustainability and the
consolidation of higher economic growth, as observed in recent years in spite of the uncertainty in the
external environment.

The foundation of macroeconomic stability has been strengthened on account of a coherent economic
management, based on the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, supported by a solid financial
system and a flexible exchange rate regime. Economic policy is based on three pillars: i) a responsible
fiscal policy, which facilitates social spending and public investment without jeopardizing public debt
sustainability, ii) a monetary policy based on inflation-targeting which facilitates counter-cyclical
interventions to support growth stability. Accordingly, the Colombian economy met the inflation target of
3.0% (+/-1%) in 2011, to the benefit particularly of the low-income households, and iii) the design of
macro prudential measures geared towards strengthening the financial system.

In recent years, the Government of Colombia has successfully designed and executed an economic
program to strengthen public finances, including the reforms approved in 2010 and 2011 which provide
a new institutional fiscal framework.         This includes the Constitutional Amendment of Fiscal
Sustainability (Legislative Act 3 of 2011), the Constitutional Amendment that created a new General
Royalties System (Legislative Act 5 of 2011), the Fiscal Rule Law (Law 1473 of 2011), and an additional
set of fiscal norms oriented to promote economic growth and competitiveness, in particular Law 1430 of
2010 which has increased tax revenues. The new fiscal framework strengthens the objectives outlined
in the Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2003.

In fact, in spite of adverse shocks, the fiscal outcomes for the central government and the consolidated
public sector exceeded expectations. In 2011, the deficit of the consolidated public sector reached 2.0
percent of GDP compared to a projected deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP. At the same time, the debt
trajectory of the central government (net) and the nonfinancial public sector is declining. This outcome
demonstrates the commitment of the Government to fiscal sustainability and the responsible
management of public finances.
                                                   56
The strengthening of economic fundamentals of the country has also facilitated favorable outcomes in
terms of economic growth and employment generation with progress in labor formality. In particular, the
Colombian economy managed to resist the adverse effects of the international financial crisis in 2008-
09, given that economic growth reached 1.7 percent in 2009, while regional peers experienced a more
profound economic deceleration. In 2010 and 2011, the real economy has been expanding at rates of
4.0 and 5.9 percent, respectively.

Towards the end of 2011, the unemployment rate reached single digits (9.0 percent in October 2011 at
the national level), a rate not seen since 2007 when the economy was also expanding. Similarly, formal
employment in the major cities registered an average growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 consistent with the
high economic growth.

The increase in the investment rate in recent years, which rose from 16.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to
27.1 percent of GDP in 2011, has increased the medium term productive capacity and has resulted in a
growth rate of potential GDP of about 5.0 percent. The objectives of the National Development Plan
2010-14 related to the push in strategic sectors such as science and technology, infrastructure, and, a
strengthening of education policy will enable the economy to reach a sustainable growth path of about 6
percent in the coming years.

While the financial system exhibited signs of being solid during the past international financial crisis, the
Government of Colombia continues to strengthen its consolidation through the design of a prudential
agenda oriented towards improving the quality of bank capital, in conformance with recently established
norms related to credit portfolio provisioning and measures to strengthen the capital of credit institutions,
and in the development of capital markets. The work with the financial system also includes an
ambitious agenda of financial inclusion with the objective of promoting formalization. This strategy
allows not only for a deepening of financial services but also makes operations more visible and
transparent to economic agents, which would potentially have an important impact on tax incidence.

Following the increase to investment grade in 2011, Standard and Poor’s increased the outlook for
Colombia from ‘stable’ to ‘positive’ in August 2012. In its analysis, the agency highlighted that the
implementation of the fiscal reforms presented by this administration could lead to a reduction in the
debt burden and in the debt service. This, combined with the continuity in economic policy, could
contribute to improve the financial position of the Government and, as a result, improve the credit rating.
Similarly, the analysis highlights the capacity of the country to manage a potential deterioration in
external conditions thanks to the savings mechanisms created through the fiscal reforms implemented
by the current administration. Increased savings strengthen the reaction capacity in years of low
commodity prices and reduce the vulnerability to external shocks.

According to Article 220 of Law 1450 related to the National Development Plan 2010-14 ‘Prosperity for
All’, the Ministry of Finance has developed a financial strategy to reduce the fiscal vulnerability of the
State arising from natural disasters. In implementing this strategy, the Ministry is taking actions in the
follow two areas: i) reducing the expected loss level and ii) designing a strategy of financial protection
that evaluates retention mechanisms and risk transfer.

Along these lines, the management of catastrophic risks will be developed through the definition of loss
levels, coverage capacity and management that allows for optimal and appropriate sources of finances
in the case of high-impact events. For Colombia the development of a layered catastrophic risk transfer


                                                     57
is proposed, which justifies and facilitates the development of financial instruments as a means to cover
the residual responsibility of the State.

Despite the above mentioned achievements, the Government of Colombia recognizes that there are
important challenges ahead to ensure a sustained medium-term growth path which through improved
competitiveness facilitates employment generation, reduces poverty levels and therefore improves the
conditions of inequality in the population. As a consequence, fiscal policy design in the coming years
will be guided by meeting the targets established in the Fiscal Rule Law which contribute to fiscal
sustainability, macroeconomic stability, employment generation and increased growth and advances in
productivity.

With this objective, the Government of Colombia is requesting a Second Programmatic Fiscal
Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan from the World Bank to support a fiscal
management program with three key areas: (i) budget predictability and stability, (ii) social security
liabilities management, (iii) disaster risk financing. The Program supported by the second loan jointly
with the National Development Plan 2010-2014 aims to undertake the following reforms: the
implementation of the fiscal rule, the implementation of the tax reform (Law 1430 of 2010), updating the
Mandatory Health Benefit Package, the creation of a health insurance system contingency fund, a
national disaster risk financing strategy, and the strengthening of the institutional framework for
agricultural insurance.

Thank you for your attention and very best wishes.

           ANNEX 3: FUND RELATIONS NOTE

IMF Executive Board Completes Review of
Colombia's Performance under the Flexible Credit
Line
Press Release No . 12/ 159
May 4, 2012
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF )
today completed its review of Colombia's qualification for the
arrangement under the Flexible Credit Line ( FCL) and reaffirmed
Colombia's continued qualification to access FCL resources . The
Colombian authorities have indicated that they intend to
continue treating the arrangement as precautionary.

The t wo- year FCL arrangement for Colombia in an amount
equivalent to SDR 3 .87 billion ( about US$5 .98 billion ) was
approved by the IMF's Executive Board on May 6, 2011 ( see
Press Release No . 11/ 165) . Colombia's first FCL was approved on
May 11, 2009 ( see Press Release No . 09/ 161) and a successor
one- year arrangement was approved on May 7, 2010 ( see Press
Release No . 10/ 186) .

Following the Executive Board discussion of Colombia, Mr. David
Lipton, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair of the
Board, made the following statement:

"Colombia's continued resilience to global financial turbulence and
its vigorous grow th during the past year attest to its strong
fundamentals and skillful policy management. Sound policy track
records and institutions, including the structural fiscal balance
rule, a credible inflation targeting regime, and effective financial
supervision, have underpinned robust public and private balance
sheets .

" The FCL arrangement for Colombia, approved a year ago in a
context of heightened external risks, has supported the
authorities' macroeconomic strategy, providing insurance against
global tail risks, and helping to strengthen market confidence .
The Executive Board confirms that Colombia continues to meet
the qualification criteria for access to FCL resources .

" The authorities are committed to continue rebuilding policy
buffers gradually to protect against global risks . Fiscal
consolidation has outpaced expectations and the gradual
tightening of monetary policy has been appropriate given strong
domestic demand . The floating exchange rate regime continues
to play a key role in helping to absorb external shocks, while the
increase in external buffers is being complemented by the FCL
arrangement.

" Lingering global uncertainty entails significant downside risks,
particularly regarding the outlook for global trade, external
financing, and commodity prices . Colombia has maintained ample
policy space to mitigate the potential fallout from those shocks,
and the authorities remain committed to their rules-based
framework and to adjust policies as needed ."
