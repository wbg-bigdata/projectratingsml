F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The GEO of the proposed project was to increase public and private sector investments in
energy efficiency (EE) in buildings. The project aimed to achieve this by:

  (i) Overcoming the risk barriers in the financial markets inhibiting commercial bank
participation in EE project financing;

  (ii) Demonstrating the feasibility of packaged investments in higher-cost EE measures
in buildings and increasing acceptance of energy performance contracting mechanisms in
Poland; and

  (iii) Stimulating the demand for EE services in the buildings sector and increasing
awareness and capacity of commercial banks to originate and implement loan
transactions for EE investments.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The GEO was not revised.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal (November 2003)

At appraisal, Poland’s energy use and CO2 emissions per US$ GDP exceeded the average level of
the European Union (EU) by 35 and 273 percent respectively. 1 The high CO2 intensity mainly
reflected the strong coal dominance in the energy sector. In 2003, the residential buildings sector
was the largest energy consumer and accounted for more than one third of the final energy
consumption in Poland. 2 While the energy intensity in the residential sector had declined at an
average rate of 5.3 percent per year in 1997- 2003, the energy savings potential in buildings
remained significant. Annual costs of heat losses in housing were estimated to amount to more
than US$ 1.75 billion, resulting in a total market for energy efficient building insulation of about
US$ 12 billion. Based on average heating costs at project appraisal, total potential heat savings
were estimated at 223 petajoules with associated CO2 emission reductions of 13 million tons per
year.

The Energy Law (adopted in 1997) inter alia called for energy security, rationalizing the use of
fuels and energy, promoting competition, protecting the environment and ensuring consumer
choice. The Government of Poland had started to implement several programs and policies since
the early 1990s, which helped the country to reduce its energy intensity by more than 40 percent.
The most relevant initiatives included: (i) major reforms in energy pricing since 1991, which
resulted in a gradual phase-out of consumer subsidies and convergence towards levelized energy
costs; (ii) a government subsidized thermo-modernization loan program (‘the TM Program’),
launched in 1996, which supported energy efficiency (EE) investments for heating systems and
building envelopes with, initially, a 25 percent subsidy; and (iii) tighter enforcement of
environmental standards to improve air quality and related higher environmental user charges and
penalties.

Barriers to Energy Efficiency. The appraisal concluded that despite these considerable
improvements, the buildings sector remained an underserved market for EE investments due to a
number of market barriers:
 Insufficient access to commercial EE financing for up-front investment costs. Commercial
   banks were not familiar with technical and financial aspects of EE projects and perceived EE
   improvements as high risk investments requiring high collaterals from building owners. As a
   result, commercial banks were reluctant to provide longer-term financing for EE investments.
 High transaction costs. EE projects were relatively small and dispersed, resulting in high
   transaction costs for lenders and end-users, and there were too few Energy Service
   Companies (ESCOs) operating in Poland to help aggregate dispersed EE projects.
 Inadequate information. Building owners, residents and local banks lacked information and
   experience about the financing aspects of EE investments, including the use of energy
   savings to finance building retrofits.

  Poland’s energy intensity in 2003 was at 189 kg of oil equivalent (koe) per US$ 1000 of GDP (at constant
2005 PPP) compared to 140 koe/ US$1000 in the EU; Poland’s CO2 intensity in 2003 was at 1.68 kg CO2
per US$ 2000 of GDP (at constant 2005 PPP) compared 0.45 in the EU; World Development Indicators,
World Bank, 2013.

Rationale for World Bank assistance. The GEF Project supported the 2002 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) objective of enhancing private sector-led growth and job creation by: (i)
establishing financing mechanisms and incentives to improve the availability of local private
sector financing for EE; (ii) stimulate end-user demand for EE; and (iii) supporting global
environmental benefits through reduced energy intensity in the buildings sector. The
environmental benefits and removal of EE market barriers targeted by the Project also supported
the achievement of EU accession standards and were consistent with the objectives of the GEF
Operational Program 5 – Removal of Barriers to Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation.
The GEF Project also complemented the World Bank Krakow Energy Efficiency Project
(P065059), which helped to establish an Energy Service Company (POE ESCO) in Krakow to
provide EE services on a commercial basis.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the Project was to increase public and private sector investments in EE in
buildings. The Project aimed to achieve this by:
(i) Overcoming the risk barriers in the financial markets inhibiting commercial bank
      participation in EE project financing;
(ii) Demonstrating the feasibility of packaged investments in higher-cost EE measures in
      buildings and increasing acceptance of Energy Performance Contract (EPC) mechanisms in
      Poland; and
(iii) Stimulating the demand for EE services in the buildings sector and increasing awareness and
      capacity of commercial banks to originate and implement loan transactions for EE
      investments.

Key outcome level indicators in accordance with the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
included:
 Number of transactions relating to EE projects/ ESCOs in the Polish market;
 Volume of debt financing relating to EE projects/ESCOs in the Polish market;
 Number of EE/ESCO projects larger than US$ 250,000;
 Number of in-country commercial business that can provide EE services to target market.

1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The GEO and the key associated outcome indicators were not revised. However, output indicators
were partially revised at a restructuring in April 2011.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target group included owners and occupants of different types of buildings (e.g.
housing cooperatives, businesses, and public services facilities such as schools, hospitals and
governments). The main benefits expected from EE improvements included: (i) improved living
and working conditions in the targeted buildings by improved indoor comfort levels (e.g. better
lighting and heating, improved indoor air quality, etc.); and (ii) energy cost savings.

Other expected beneficiaries from the anticipated increase in demand for EE services, goods and
works included building industry associations, building design professionals, manufacturers of
building equipment and materials, building retrofit contractors, energy service companies,
financial organizations serving the building industry and building code officials and inspectors.

                                               2
Stakeholders, other than the implementing agency, expected to benefit from technical assistance
activities included POE ESCO, local banks, and municipalities.

1.5 Original Components

The Project was financed by a GEF Grant of US$ 11 million and consisted of three components:

Component 1 - Partial Guarantee Facility for EE project financing (US$ 5.7 million): A Partial
Guarantee Facility (PGF) was established with GEF funds and designed as a risk-sharing
mechanism to provide commercial banks partial coverage of risk exposures against loans made
for EE projects in buildings throughout Poland. The guarantee coverage was set at 50-70 percent
of loan principal on a first loss basis and was arranged through commercial banks that concluded
Guarantee Framework Agreements (GFA) with the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK), the
implementing agency for the Project. The facility targeted the national buildings sector in general,
and focused on multi-family (including cooperative) housing, schools, hospitals, as well as
ESCOs using performance contracting as financing structure. The PGF was expected to leverage
about US$ 39 million in debt financing for 390 EE projects.

The PGF aimed to incentivize private sector investments in EE in buildings by addressing
prevailing risk barriers in the financial market, including in particular the reluctance of
commercial banks to provide long-term financing for EE, the lack of adequate collaterals among
borrowers and the high risk perception for EE loans.

Component 2 - Capital Grant Facility (US$ 2 million): The Capital Grant Facility (CGF)
supported POE ESCO3 investments in bundled EE projects in buildings in the Krakow region,
which included high-cost measures with a payback higher than 10 years.4 The CGF provided 30
percent grants for EE projects larger than US$ 250,000. The CGF was expected to leverage
US$ 6.67 million, including US$ 4 million in commercial and POE ESCO financing and
US$ 670,000 co-financing by clients.

The component aimed to: (i) reduce the up-front costs of high-cost EE measures; (ii) demonstrate
the commercial viability of bundling high-cost measures with lower cost measures; and (iii)
support POE ESCO in increasing acceptance of the EPC models for buildings in the Krakow
region.

Component 3 – Technical Assistance (US$ 3.3 million): The technical assistance (TA) provided
under the Project focused on supporting EE barrier removal activities, including: support for the
deployment of the guarantee mechanism and capacity building of BGK for administering the
guarantee facility; support to POE ESCO in the development of the performance contracting
model in the Krakow region and to build its pipeline of potential investments; provision of
training to local banks; activities to increase awareness and demand for EE investments among
building owners, including municipalities; and collection of project monitoring data and broad
dissemination of results.



3
  POE ESCO was established under the Krakow Energy Efficiency Project as a subsidiary of MPEC, the
municipal district heating company in Krakow.
4
  A large share of the identified EE savings potential was expected to result from high-cost measures.
However, given their higher payback period, these investments were considered to be less attractive to
invest in. This explained the need for support from the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

In April 2011, the Project was restructured without changes to the GEO and key outcome targets.
The main reason for revising the PGF component was its limited progress towards achieving the
GEO. Notably, there had been virtually no demand from participating banks for partial credit
guarantees and by 2011 only one guarantee transaction supporting a loan of US$ 180,000 had
taken place. This corresponded to less than one percent of the expected output. After several
unsuccessful attempts to stimulate demand for the PGF, the World Bank Team concluded that the
partial guarantees offered under the GEF project were not an appropriate mechanism to overcome
risk barriers for EE investments in buildings. Factors affecting lack of progress under the PGF
component are further explained in Section 2.2 below.

Revised Partial Guarantee Facility Component. Uncommitted funds under the PGF (US$ 5.65
million) were returned to the Bank and then used to fund a new Thermo-Modernization (TM)
Investments Component. The PGF continued but the funds available were reduced to US$ 50,000
to only cover BGK’s liabilities related to the one guarantee that had been approved since the
Project became effective in March 2005. 5

New Thermo-Modernization (TM) Investments Component. A new TM Investments
Component was established with funds reallocated from the PGF and the TA Component
(totaling US$ 5.8 million). The component used the existing delivery mechanism of the national
TM Fund, which provided up to 20 percent TM Bonus (subsidy) for commercial EE loans in
residential buildings6 financed by selected partner banks. The TM Investments Component was
expected to leverage US$ 58.5 million investments in EE.

The other components (CGF and TA) were not revised, except for minor changes related to the
scope and allocated funds (further details are provided in Section 1.7 below).

1.7 Other significant changes

In addition to the above referenced revised components, the following changes were made:

Expanding scope of TA Component. As part of the restructuring in April 2011, the scope of the
TA Component was expanded to include activities for EE barrier removal at the national level.
This created synergy with the preparation of an EE and Renewable Energy Development Policy
Loan (DPL) for Poland. 7

Extension of closing date. Following Bank management approval, the closing date was extended
three times: (i) in May 2011, the Project was extended from June 30, 2011 to August 31, 2011;
(ii) in August 2011 (when the April 2011 restructuring became effective), it was extended until



5
  These funds had been disbursed to the Guarantee Facility Account in BGK upon signing of GFAs with
Participating Banks. Uncommitted funds were returned to the World Bank/GEF and re-disbursed for the
TM Investments Component under the amended Grant Agreement. This explains the Project’s unusual
disbursement pattern.
6
  TM Bonuses were provided for improvements in residential buildings, non-commercial buildings, public
buildings, local heating networks and local heating sources. Only EE Bonuses for residential buildings
were supported by the GEF grant.
7
  Approved by the Bank on June 7, 2011 and effective on July 5, 2011.

                                                   4
June 31, 2012; and (iii) in May 2012, the closing date was extended until October 31, 2012. The
first extension was necessary to provide sufficient time for the Government to countersign the
Grant Agreement Amendment necessary for the restructuring mentioned in Section 1.6 above.
The second and third extensions were necessary to allow enough time to implement the
restructured components and complete remaining TA activities.

Reallocation of funds. In April 2011, in accordance with the restructured components, US$ 5.8
million was reallocated to the TM Investments Component from the PGF (US$ 5.65 million) and
the TA Component (US$ 0.15 million). Additional funds were also reallocated to the supply and
installation of equipment category and the works category due to exchange rate fluctuations,
which affected costs under the POE ESCO Component. In May 2012, additional funds were
reallocated, including: reallocating US$ 200,000 from the consultant’s service category to the
goods category because the main part of one of the TA activities consisted in the purchase of
software;8 reallocating the remaining uncommitted funds from the consultant’s services category
to the TM Investments Component to finance additional TM investments; and small adjustments
related to supply and installation of equipment, goods and works categories.

Changes in the procurement methods and disbursement arrangements. In August 2005, the
procurement threshold for commercial practices under Component 2 was increased from
US$ 350,000 to US$ 750,000 in order to harmonize the threshold between the Krakow EE Project
and the GEF Project, and the Service Delivery Contractors method was included to hire Energy
Auditors. In April 2011, two additional procurement methods were included under the consultant
services to allow adequate sourcing of planned TA activities: (i) the Quality Based Selection; and
(ii) the Single Source Selection.

Based on the restructured Project, a new special category (Category 8) for the TM Investments
Component was created in April 2011 in order to reimburse the TM Fund for Bonuses paid to
Partner Banks. The funds were disbursed on a quarterly basis to the TM Fund account at BGK
against proof of payment of Bonuses from BGK to the Partner Banks. In order to ensure
continuity of the TM Program, the grant retroactively financed expenditures paid from January 1,
2011 until the countersigning of the restructured Grant Agreement Amendment on August 29,
2011, up to a limit of 20 percent (or US$ 1.16) of the grant amount for the TM Investments
Component. Retroactive reimbursements followed the same disbursement requirements as
outlined above.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis. The Project was prepared in conjunction with the IBRD-
financed Krakow EE Project (US$ 15 million) 9 in 1999-2002 and benefitted from the analysis
and preparatory work carried out under the IBRD project, as well as a GEF preparation grant. In
particular, different alternatives were considered for the design of the Project components10 and

procurement of software for the Registry.
9
  P065059; approved on May 9, 2001, effective on July 9, 2002.
10
   Alternatives considered included: a line-of-credit operation, guarantee mechanism limited to POE ESCO
operations, subsidy to end users for installation of specific measures or to secure financing.

                                                   5
studies were carried out to inform the operating modalities of the Partial Guarantee Component
and the Capital Grant Facility respectively. Surveys further substantiated the prevalence of
financial market barriers for EE lending and helped to identify interested commercial banks in
using the guarantee mechanism as credit enhancement for EE investments. However, there was a
considerable time gap11 between the start of preparatory work and Project effectiveness, which
impacted the relevance of some of the background analysis.

Assessment of Project Design. At appraisal, the GEO and key outcomes were relevant for
Poland’s energy sector. The design was based on innovative market-mechanisms and concepts for
increasing EE investments through risk mitigation instruments and performance contracting,
which, at the time of Project design, were not widely used outside Northern America and Western
Europe. Important efforts were made to incorporate lessons learned from national and
international experience gained in EE projects. Specifically, the design of the PGF incorporated
key lessons from IFC’s experience with risk mitigation instruments and leveraging GEF funds in
Hungary. The guarantee facility also took into account national experiences and aimed to
leverage synergies with the TM Program and the national guarantee fund, the Krajowy Fundusz
Poreczen Kredytowych (KFPK) 12 by: (i) using similar application procedures; (ii) targeting
commercial banks participating in the TM and/or the KFPK programs; (iii) building on the
experience of BGK as implementing agency of the programs; and (iv) ensuring complementarity
by offering a market-based product for reaching out to new market segments in the residential
and public buildings sector.

The preparation and design of the Capital Grant Facility was informed by lessons learned in
demand-side management programs in North America and Europe, as well as from technical
advice provided by international ESCO experts under the Krakow EE Project. The experience
from Northern America indicated that ESCOs can play a key role as project aggregators and
financiers to bundle projects and reduce transaction costs, in particular in the public sector. The
inclusion of a partial grant element was adequate, in particular to demonstrate: (i) the viability of
high-cost measures (e.g. windows and insulation), despite longer paybacks and higher up-front
costs; and (ii) the performance contracting model, which was not widely used and known in
Poland.

At restructuring, the choice of using the existing delivery mechanism of the TM Program to
design the TM Investments Component was well conceived for the following reasons: (i) while
the TM Program proved to be highly successful, severe budget constraints in the wake of the
economic crisis prevented the Government from allocating budget resources in 2010. In
conjunction with insufficient allocations expected in 2011, this situation risked to create
substantial market insecurities for EE investments. The total volume of EE investment
applications submitted and ‘on hold’ in 2010 were estimated at over US$ 50 million; and (iii)
using the existing delivery mechanism of the TM Program allowed the Project to tap into an
existing pipeline of economically and financially viable EE investments and improve the progress
towards achieving the GEO within the remaining timeframe until completion. However, the TM
Investments Component did not address systemic risk barriers or lead to a transition towards



11
   Project preparation started in early 1999 jointly with the Krakow EE Project, while the Project became
effective in 2005.
12
   The KFPK was a Government-funded guarantee program, established in 1996 and managed by BGK,
which at the time of appraisal was focused on providing guarantees for commercial loans to SMEs for a
broad range of capital investments, including purchase of equipment and materials.

                                                     6
market-based models for EE financing, which was deemed difficult due to the prevalence of grant
funded support to EE at the time.

Adequacy of Client Commitment at Entry. At the time of appraisal, the Project benefitted from
top-level support from the Ministry of Economy (MoE), as well as strong commitment from
MPEC, the owner of POE ESCO. Notably, MPEC provided a financial safety net to POE ESCO
by keeping its balance sheet associated with MPEC and providing guarantees to POE ESCO,
which facilitated its access to commercial financing.

Assessment of Risks. The Project was considered a moderate risk operation. Most of the
identified risks turned out to be lower than expected due an increase of available EE financing
with relaxed collateral requirements. As a result, the guarantees, potential risks and associated
mitigation measures were less relevant or redundant. However, the risk assessment framework
failed to recognize the risks of a lack of demand for guarantees, which impacted the Project’s
ability to meet its objective and intended outcomes. The risk assessment framework also fell short
in identifying risks occurring from subsidized government and donor-driven EE programs, which
accentuated the lack of demand for market-based guarantee instruments without subsidies for
beneficiaries. This was despite the fact that some of the competing government programs and the
impact of various subsidy mechanisms on market demand were highlighted in the PAD. The lack
of demand for guarantees offered under the PGF was ultimately addressed by restructuring the
Project.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation of the Partial Guarantee Facility. The PGF made only very limited progress
towards achieving the GEO and intended outcomes in 2004-2011: the three participating banks
had generated only one loan transaction (US$ 180,000) using the guarantee facility. This was
significantly below the target values set at 390 transactions supporting a total loan volume of
US$ 39 million. Key factors affecting the lack of progress in implementing the PGF included the
following market changes:

Increasing availability of commercial EE financing with relaxed collateral requirements in the
residential sector. The relevance of guarantees as risk-mitigation instruments to leverage
commercial financing significantly decreased during implementation due to the following
developments in the residential buildings market:
 Real estate prices had more than doubled between 2004 and 2007, which significantly
    increased the collateral base of home owners;
 Commercial banks were less reluctant and risk averse to lend to condominiums and housing
    cooperatives due to the improved collateral base and refined methods to determine
    creditworthiness of clients in the buildings market;
 Due to a number of changes, 13 the popularity of the TM Program significantly increased after
    2003, with the number of loan/bonus applications increasing from an average of 370 per year
    in 1999-2003 to 2,700 applications per year in 2004-2009. The volume of debt financing
    provided under the TM Program increased from US$ 210 million to more than US$ 2 billion
    in 2011. Residential sector applications accounted for more than 90 percent in that period.


13
  In line with suggestions provided by the World Bank the following adjustments were made to the TM
Program in 2003: application procedures were simplified, subsidy payments were provided upon project
implementation, administrative fees were reduced and promotional activities were significantly scaled up.

                                                    7
Increased competition from programs offering subsidies. The Project faced strong competition
from subsidized programs, primarily financed from EU funded programs or local environmental
funds, such as: (i) the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management,
which inter alia provided soft loans and grants for EE in the residential and public sector at the
national, regional and municipal level; (ii) the EcoFund Foundation, providing 10-15 percent
grants for EE in the private and public sector, including heat insulation in buildings; (iii) the EU
Cohesion Funds available for EE and RE (about Euro 54 million), which became available after
Poland’s accession to the EU in 2004 and supported projects with up to 85 percent subsidies; and
(iv) the EU Guarantee Fund, providing guarantees for projects, including EE, co-financed from
EU subsides. As a result, the Polish market became strongly conditioned by the possibility to
obtain financing on concessional terms. The availability of significant grant funding volumes
represented a key barrier for stimulating demand for more market-based financing products,
including guarantee instruments for EE investments.

Furthermore, the scope of the KFPK was expanded from initially targeting SMEs to cover all
market segments, including in particular residential buildings. Given the well-established network
of the KFPK, operating through 27 participating banks, simpler applications procedures and less
stringent reporting requirements, the KFPK appeared to adequately cover any remaining market
demand for guarantees to finance EE projects. Although application procedures and GFAs were
simplified under the PGF, these changes were not able to stimulate the demand for guarantees
under the GEF facility.

A mid-term review was conducted in August 2007, which emphasized the lack of progress in
implementing the PGF and identified remedial actions to improve progress towards achieving the
GEO. In order to address the lack of demand for the GEF guarantee, two options were pursued:
(i) refocus the PGF on the institutional buildings segment, especially hospitals, where guarantees
were still considered to be relevant credit enhancements due to the prevailing barriers in
accessing commercial financing. This included in particular insufficient collaterals and high
(perceived) risks, as demonstrated by the reluctance of the KFPK and municipal owners to
provide guarantees to hospitals for EE loans; and (ii) restructure the PGF into a line-of-credit for
EE in public buildings in low-income municipalities. 14 In both cases, scoping studies were
conducted, a potential project pipeline identified and preliminary agreements reached. However,
the refocusing of the PGF on hospitals, discussed in 2007-2008, failed when the financial crisis
changed priorities of the involved banks and increased their risk aversion.15 The line-of-credit
option, discussed in 2009-2010, eventually failed because the involved banks required a
substantial grant/concessional element in order to be competitive vis-à-vis the many subsidized
schemes (see examples referenced above), which was found not to be in compliance with the
World Bank requirements for financial intermediary lending (OP 8.30).

Preparation of a US$ 1.11 billion EE and Renewable Energy Development Policy Loan (DPL). In
2009-10 it started to become apparent that the policy framework for EE was inadequate and that
this was a contributing factor to the lack of market-driven/non-subsidized EE investments.
Initially, the Bank had informed the Government in April 2010 about its decision to close the


14
   This option was considered based on an official request from the Government (letter dated April 29,
2009).
15
   With the onset of the financial crisis, banks that earlier indicated that the PGF would enable them to
finance EE in hospitals changed their position so that they would only provide financing if offered full
guarantees, a notion that was rejected due to the moral hazard.

                                                      8
Project early and to cancel the remaining Grant funds of about US$ 5 million. At that time, the
Project had been rated moderately unsatisfactory over the past 3 years and actual disbursement
(where the disbursement into the Guarantee Facility Account did not count unless the funds were
committed on a loan) stood at around 32 percent. However, as the Bank and the Government
agreed to start preparation for a US$ 1.1 billion DPL focusing on EE, 16 this offered new
synergies for the GEF Project and influenced the decision of the Government and Bank
management to proceed with a restructuring despite the two failed attempts mentioned above

Implementation of the Capital Grant Facility. The CGF was fully disbursed by end 2008 and
supported implementation of 32 EE projects in public buildings with a total investment value of
US$ 8.67 million using simplified EPC-models with guaranteed savings (see Section 3.2).
Implementation progress under the CGF was facilitated by a two-year school rehabilitation
program of the City of Krakow. In the context of this program, POE ESCO upgraded 29 schools
in Krakow with the use of GEF funds. The school rehabilitation program was a positive factor in
supporting consistent outputs under the CGF with original target values and demonstrating
simplified EPC models. However, it also revealed that POE ESCO operated on a rather limited
market segment with the achievement of the GEO being dependent on the size of work
commissioned by the City of Krakow and POE’s success in bidding for it. The following other
key factors affected implementation of the Capital Grant Facility:

Competition with subsidies EE programs in the public buildings sector. Similar to the PGF, POE
ESCO was facing strong competition from highly subsidized EE Programs.17 While the partial
GEF grant helped POE ESCO to compete with these programs and stimulate the interest for
bundled EE project, the subsidized programs negatively affected the interest of potential clients
for EPC-mechanisms and limited opportunities to replicate the model.18

Lack of a conducive framework for ESCOs to operate in. The ESCO model faced a number of
barriers during implementation: (i) public procurement rules, along with the lack of recognition of
the ESCO model in the Polish law, were impeding the use of EPCs in the public sector; (ii) Polish
public budget rules are based on a three-year cycle, which created challenges related to the
‘ownership’ of energy savings for repayment purposes as well as EE incentives for public
facilities; and (iii) the revised public finance act hampered the conclusion of EPCs, since they
risked to be included in the public debt ceiling despite guaranteed energy savings. These
challenges affecting ESCOs were confirmed in several studies, which indicated that the number
of ESCO projects started decreasing in the early 2000s due to the competition from subsidized EE
programs as well as unfavorable legislative provisions that discouraged local governments from
implementing EPCs.19



16
   The Concept Review Meeting for the DPL was held in December 2010 and the Decision Meeting on
March 2011.
17
   For instance, public buildings were also eligible under the TM Program, the National Fund for
Environmental Protection, the EcoFund and the Norwegian Fund for EE and Renewable Energy (Euro 75
million), all providing grant support and/or soft loans to public sector buildings; ESCOs were not eligible
for some of these programs.

Implementation of the TM Investments Component. Implementation of the component started in
August 2011 (after the April restructuring became effective) and supported within 14 months 445
EE projects in multi-family buildings with a total investment volume of about US$ 49 million.
The speed of implementation of the TM Investments Component was affected by the backlog in
applications for EE investments under the government-driven TM Program, as explained in
Section 2.1. Due to the sharp tightening of fiscal conditions in the wake of the economic crisis,
the Government did not allocate any budget for the TM Program in 2010 in order to concentrate
on more pressing fiscal needs. As a result, participating banks stopped application procedures for
new projects and several hundred submitted projects were put on hold creating uncertainties in
the market for EE investments. Accordingly, the TM Investments Component was able to tap into
an existing pipeline of bankable EE investment projects, use the delivery mechanism of the TM
Program and help to avoid further bottlenecks by retroactively financing EE investments of about
US$ 7 million (US$ 1.16 million in grants).

Portfolio Flags (2009-2012). Given lack of progress towards achieving the GEO, overall
implementation progress was rated moderately unsatisfactory in 2007-2009 and unsatisfactory in
2010. In consequence, the Project was flagged in the country records (2009-2012) and as long
term risk (2011-2012).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The M&E framework was designed to focus on the achievements of project output
progress and included a total of 22 output and 4 outcome indicators (Annex 3 of the PAD). There
were several inconsistencies in the scope, number and target values of indicators within the PAD
as well as between the PAD and the Supplemental Letter. The outcome indicators were not all
clearly defined, some lacked baselines and not all could be clearly attributed to targeted outputs
under the Project. The Results framework was strengthened after the restructuring and selected
output indicators for the TM Investments Component were clearer defined.

M&E Implementation. An international M&E consultant was contracted in 2006 but due to
quality issues their contract was terminated in 2008. As a result, there were some inconsistencies
in reporting related to outcome and output targets. In anticipation of the restructuring, a local
consultant was contracted in 2010 with a focus on outcome indicators and the new TM
Investments Component, which helped to address main gaps in M&E implementation.

M&E Utilization. Output indicators of the PGF Component were used to emphasize the poor
performance and need to restructure the Project. However, given the obvious lack of progress
under the PGF, M&E utilization remained limited.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. In accordance with World Bank policy on Environmental Assessment (EA), the
Project was rated Category B. There were no major adverse environmental issues associated with
the Project, as it specifically targeted EE improvements that resulted in reduced energy
consumption and CO2 emissions. POE ESCO and participating banks under the guarantee facility
were responsible for screening sub-projects and to ensure that they complied with the Bank’s EA
and applicable regulations in Poland. During restructuring, the EMF was updated to include EE
investments supported under the TM Investments Component, which were limited to EA
Category C. There were no major safeguard issues during implementation and the impact of
construction activities were found to be minor (e.g. dust and noise) and short-lived.


                                               10
Financial Management. The overall financial management rating for the Project was satisfactory.
After a long preparatory and start-up period, including phases of organizational and managerial
changes with adverse impacts on project implementation and financial management, BGK
recruited highly qualified staff and reorganized the Project Management Unit (PMU). As a result,
the PMU became more effective and financial management capacity significantly increased.
Project financial monitoring reports generated by the IT system were submitted on a timely basis
and were acceptable. Annual audits of the project financial management statements were received
in due time and contained clean opinion with no accountability or internal control issues. The
World Bank implementation and support review resulted in satisfactory ratings and
recommendations were addressed.

Procurement. The overall rating of procurement during the Project cycle was satisfactory. The
overall risk for procurement was rated high at appraisal due to lack of experience of BGK.
Procurement by BGK faced some initial delays in terms of contracting, however, all planned
studies were commissioned and during the last part of implementation procurement went
smoothly. While there were several procurement staff changes in BGK over the course of the
project, they did not hamper Project implementation, since the replacements had sufficient
qualifications. The procurement capacity of POE ESCO, a subsidiary of MPEC Krakow, was
rated high due to procurement capacity already developed during the Krakow EE Project. The
procurement of sub-projects for EE measures under the CGF followed Commercial Practices and
did not face major difficulties. Even though the Project was restructured, the procurement
arrangements remained the same with some minor changes introduced to reflect the project's
specific needs.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The post-completion activities of the project are related to: (i) national level EE activities; and (ii)
continuation of POE ESCO activities.

At the national level, the TM Program will continue to be instrumental in meeting the national
energy savings target of 9 percent by 2016, with an expected contribution of 8,121 GWh. 20
Furthermore, the GEF TM Investments Component successfully demonstrated a new model for
using extra-budgetary resources for funding and sustaining TM Bonuses. According to
information from MoE/BGK, this model can be copied in the next budget cycle of EU Structural
Funds transfers, where such funds could be used to continue and expand the TM Program.

According to written commitments from the MoE, interest earnings accumulated on the PGF
account (about US$ 760,000) will be earmarked for support of educational campaigns for EE. As
funds become de-committed from the remaining guarantee under the reserve account (about
US$ 50,000) these will also be transferred from BGK to the MoE to support additional climate
change activities.

Continuation of POE ESCO activities. MPEC is committed to continue operating POE ESCO as
a subsidiary, in particular as it allows the company to support its clients in improving EE while
mitigating the impact of heat demand reductions on its core business. However, POE ESCO has
yet to demonstrate a viable business model for EE services, which is able to survive in a market
environment that is: (i) conditioned on receiving grant subsidies; and (ii) not yet conducive for

public procurement using EPC and turnkey services. Provisions under the EU Directive, targeting
increased use and removal of barriers for EPC in the public buildings segment, annual renovation
objectives and the establishment of a white certificate scheme are expected to help create a more
favorable environment for ESCOs in the future.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

Global Environment Objective. The GEO remains highly relevant to Poland’s economic
development and priorities in the energy sector, as reflected in the ‘Energy Policy of Poland until
2030’ (adopted on November 10, 2009). Improving EE is identified as one of the key priorities to
achieve the targeted zero-energy economic growth until 2030 and reduce the energy intensity of
Poland’s economy to the EU-15 level. More specifically, the long term energy strategy
recognizes EE as a key area to: (i) meet the EU climate change targets; (ii) achieve the national
energy savings target of 9 percent by 2016; 21 (iii) enhance energy security; (iv) avoid pollutant
emissions; and (v) stimulate investments in modern energy-savings technologies and products to
enhance innovation in the Polish economy. 22 Similarly, the GEO remains highly relevant and
consistent with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013 by contributing to: (i)
growth and competitiveness of the economy through targeting the increase in private sector
investments; and (ii) global and regional public goods by supporting climate change mitigation
through EE improvements. This also mirrors the relevance of the Project for global priorities on
climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability. Finally, the GEO remains closely
aligned with GEF’s Strategic Priorities for the Climate Change Focal Area.

Design and implementation. The project design and implementation (after restructuring) remains
relevant to the current energy sector needs. Specifically, the TM Program continues to be the key
vehicle in improving EE in residential buildings, while the relevance of EPC mechanisms for
public buildings is expected to increase in the future inter alia due to the strengthened obligations
under the new EU Directive on EE (2012/27/EU), to be transposed into national law by 2014 and
requiring member states to encourage the use of EPCs in the public sector. While the relevance of
a guarantee instrument to encourage private sector investments in EE turned out to be negligible,
this was addressed during implementation by restructuring the Project.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The achievement of the GEO to increase public and private sector investments in EE in buildings
is assessed based on the three expected outcomes as defined at Project approval.

Outcome 1: Overcoming the risk barriers in the financial markets inhibiting commercial bank
participation in EE project financing. The 14-fold increase in commercial lending for EE
between 2004 and 2012 indicates that commercial bank participation in EE project financing has

The GEF Project directly leveraged US$ 43.8 million in debt financing24 and about US$ 3.39
million co-financing from beneficiaries. Total EE investments supported under the GEF Project
amounted to US$ 57.8 million. While these achievements are close to the expected output targets
(see Annex 2), the overall increase in debt financing in Poland has not been achieved by
overcoming the original risk barriers the GEF Project aimed to address through its guarantee
instrument. The contribution of external factors was more relevant in incentivizing commercial
bank participation, as demonstrated by: (i) changing market conditions in the housing sector
which resulted in increased availability of financing and a general reduction of collateral
requirements for building owners and cooperatives, as explained in Section 2.2; and (ii) the
scaling-up and success of the TM Program, which was the key driver in increasing the volume of
debt financing for EE in Poland, as illustrated in Graph 1 above.

After the Project was restructured in 2011 to take the changed market circumstances into account,
the TM Investments Component aimed to gap fiscal constraints, which were expected to cause
significant market insecurities for EE investments in the residential buildings sector (see further
explanations in Section 2.1 and 2.2). Notably, the component helped to avoid delays in
implementing 445 EE projects in the residential sector and leveraged US$ 43 million in debt
financing. Reportedly, the GEF contribution helped to sustain a stable and predictable investment
environment for residential housing owners and participating banks under the TM Program in
2011-2012. However, there is no breakdown of additional data available to demonstrate the exact
impact of the contribution and the TM Investments Component did not stimulate a transition
towards more market-based models for EE financing.




23
   Based on the final M&E Report; data for 2005, 2006 and 2008 were not available. The total volume of
debt financing in 2012 is based on the last Implementation Status and Results Report.

                                                                    13
Outcome 2: Demonstrating the feasibility of packaged investments in higher-cost EE measures
in buildings and increasing acceptance of energy performance contracting mechanisms in
Poland. The total number of EE projects larger than US$ 250,000 in Poland increased from 151
Projects in 2004 to 1,830 Projects in 2012. The 12-fold increase indicates that the feasibility of
packaged investments in higher-cost EE measures has been successfully demonstrated in the
Polish market.

At the Project level, POE ESCO was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of packaged
investments in the public buildings sector by: (i) implementing 32 Projects, which all involved
30-70 percent high cost measures with an average payback above 10 years; (ii) no significant
delays in identifying and contracting bundled EE projects; and (iii) substantial equity
contributions of US$ 3.39 million by buildings owners, which was 5-times higher than expected
at appraisal. The 40 percent equity contribution of total investments demonstrates the demand for
bundled EE projects. Under the TM Investments Component, an additional 26 Projects were
supported with investment volumes exceeding US$ 250,000. However, given POE ESCO’s
limited geographical scope of operation and the lack of disaggregated data for Krakow, it is not
possible to demonstrate a causal linkage between the GEF Project and regional or national
outcome levels.

Increasing the acceptance of EPC mechanisms in Poland. At the national level, the number of in-
country commercial businesses that provide EE services increased from 452 companies in 2004
to about 1,415 companies in 2012. The number of ESCOs remained relatively small and is
estimated to 3-29 companies, depending on the source of information and definition of ESCOs.
The total annual value of ESCO projects implemented throughout Poland is estimated at Euro 5-
10 million. In the public sector, the annual volume of EPC projects is estimated to have decreased
since the Project appraisal due to: (i) unfavorable legislative provisions with few public tenders
for EPC (see further explanations in Section 2.2);25 and (ii) the fact that, at the time of appraisal,
most of the EPC projects in the public sector were concentrated on street lighting with shorter
payback periods and simpler contracting and implementation arrangements compared to building
retrofits. In conclusion, the acceptance of EPC mechanisms in Poland has remained below
expectations compared to the potential market size and the development in other EU member
states.

At the Project level, POE ESCO was successful in implementing 32 GEF supported EE projects
based on simplified EPC models26 using the ‘deemed savings’ approach, i.e. the contracts were
based on pre-determined savings estimates. When measured, actual savings almost always
exceeded estimates, which has helped to build confidence in EPC for beneficiaries. As a result,
POE ESCO helped to increase awareness of EPC mechanisms by: (i) successfully implementing
EPCs outside the street lighting segment as one of the very few companies; 27 and (ii)

   Traditionally, ECPs are characterized by the following attributes: (i) design, engineering, construction,
commissioning, performance measurement and verifications; (ii) arranging financing, often with a link
between EPC compensation and performance; (iii) performance guarantees, based on the level of energy or
energy cost savings for the entire project; and (iv) risk-taking of technical, financial, construction, and
performance risks; World Bank, 2012.
27
   A report concluded in 2006 cited POE ESCO as one of the only two companies developing EPC projects
in an active way (Market analysis of ESCO-type Services, Jaakko Pöyry Group, 2006).

                                                    14
demonstrating a simplified EPC model for public buildings, which helped to reduce transaction
costs and was used as a basis for EE projects in voidowship beyond Malapolskie (the region
around Krakow). However, overall POE ESCO’s EPC business was dependent on the GEF grants
as primary driver for sales and when the support ended, no new sources of concessional funding
were ready to plug the gap.

Outcome 3: Stimulating the demand for EE services in the buildings sector and increasing
awareness and capacity of commercial banks to originate and implement loan transactions for
EE investments. The number of EE projects implemented in Poland has increased by more than
8 times from 3,195 projects in 2004 to 28,115 projects in 2011. Again, the TM Program was the
                                                                                28
main driver in stimulating the demand for EE services in the buildings sector. The number of
projects financed under the TM Program accounted between 84 percent (2011) and almost 100
percent (2009) of total transactions in the residential sector. The growth in the volume of debt
financing for EE projects (figure 1 above) also indicates an increase in awareness and capacity of
commercial banks to originate and implement loan transactions for EE investments.

The Project supported implementation of a total of 478 EE projects, including 32 projects based
on EPC, provided capacity development and awareness raising to commercial banks and provided
technical assistance in support of EE financing. Whereas the guarantee facility failed to stimulate
demand for EE services, the substantial trainings provided to participating bank has increased
their capacity and awareness in implementing loan transactions for EE and thereby has helped the
market tap into a demand for EE services stimulated through the TM Program.


3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

At appraisal, an incremental cost analysis was carried out to assess the incremental costs per unit
of energy saving and CO2 abatement associated with the GEF project. At project completion, the
same analysis was carried out based on the actual project costs and outcomes. Moreover, to better
understand the economic and financial returns of the EE investments supported by the project, a
benefit-cost analysis was carried out at project completion to assess the payback period and the
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the EE investments. For the POE ESCO component
financed by the Capital Grant Facility, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) has also been
estimated.

Over the eight year of implementation, the Project supported 478 EE projects valued at US$ 57.8
million. Annual energy savings generated amount to about 68.4 GWh year and CO2 emissions
were reduced by 26,226 t per year (see Annex 3).

The Incremental Cost Analysis indicates project-related costs of CO2 abatement of US$ 27.96
per tCO2 compared with an estimated US$ 8 per tCO2 at appraisal (at zero percent discount rate).
Based on a discount rate of 10 percent, the cost of CO2 abatements increases to US$ 55.14 per
tCO2 compared with US$ 15.78 per tCO2 based on appraisal-stage assumptions.




28
  In addition to involvement through one of the participating banks, applicants were also required to carry
out an energy audit prior to submitting the application.

                                                    15
Leveraging and Replication. The GEF fund of US$ 11 million leveraged an additional US$ 46.8
million, translating to a leverage ratio of about 1-to-4.3, compared with an estimated 1-to-10.7 at
appraisal. The difference is primarily due to the considerable scale-down of the guarantee facility
(from US$ 5.7 million to US$ 50,000) and the redirection of the reserve funds to TM investments.

The Benefit-Cost Analysis indicates economic payback periods of 18.18 year at completion
compared with 5.56 years estimated at appraisal due to the type of investments supported, which
included a much higher proportion of window replacements and other high-pay-back measures
than assumed at appraisal. 29 Accordingly, annual energy cost savings amounted to US$ 3.2
million compared with an estimated US$ 11.6 million per year at appraisal. EIRR were analyzed
at the project and component level. Overall, the EIRR of the project is estimated at 0.2 percent.
Further details of the analysis are provided in the table below and Annex 3.

On the balance the efficiency is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to the lower than targeted
EIRR and pay-back periods. However, the lower investment efficiency is mostly due to a
conscious choice of including higher pay-back time measures in the investment packages in order
to achieve higher effectiveness in terms of savings achieved in each individual building. It is also
worth noting that although falling short of the stated targets the results achieved by this project
including the resulting abatement cost of $28 per tCO2 are quite acceptable compared to other EE
in buildings projects in Poland and the ECA region.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Project objective and implementation remain relevant to the national and sector priorities in
Poland. Based on above explanations, the Project was moderately unsatisfactory in achieving the
GEO and expected outcomes. While all the outcome targets had been achieved, the measurable
contribution of the GEF Project remained limited, and 5 out of 7 Project-specific outputs were
below their original/ revised target values. The slow and limited progress in achieving the GEO is
also mirrored in the moderately unsatisfactory rating of project performance between 2007 and
2011. Combined with the moderately unsatisfactory efficiency of the Project the Overall
Outcome is therefore rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.




29
  Even though this meant lower profitability it was more in line with the stated objective of supporting
“higher-cost EE measures in buildings? and the pay-back times are in general acceptable for building
components with technical lifetime extending far beyond the 15 years horizon used in the analysis.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The energy cost reductions have a direct impact on the affordability of energy services for end-
users, which were either public facilities or multi-family buildings. The support for EE retrofits in
the 32 public buildings (mostly schools) also provided social benefits in addition to the energy-
cost reduction benefits. These include improved working conditions due to comfortable indoor
temperatures during the winter season (in some cases classroom temperatures before the retrofits
were 16-17o C during the coldest months), as well as more aesthetic buildings with improved
functionality.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project strengthened POE ESCO’s operation in the Krakow region, as the GEF grant helped
the company to compete with subsidized EE programs in the public sector. However, POE ESCO
has yet to develop sustainable non-grant funded methods of developing and financing turnkey
energy retrofits in the long term. BGK has also gained important EE expertise, which can be
utilized in any future expansion of the TM Program, e.g. regarding the possible use of EU
Structural Funds to support EE retrofits in buildings.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Sustainability of EE measures implemented. The energy savings from the EE measures in
buildings financed by the project are expected to be sustained for the technical/economic lifetime
of the retrofitted component (more than 15 years). The measurement and verification activities
conducted by POE ESCO upon implementation of the EE measures demonstrated that actual
savings were achieved and exceeded deemed savings.

Continuation of the TM Program. The TM Act (adopted in November 2008) does not provide
for a specific timeline for the TM Program. However, given the national energy savings target of
9 percent by 2016, including a substantial contribution expected from the TM Program and taking
into account the reinforced requirements for EE in the buildings sector, the TM Program is
expected to continue at least until 2016.

Continuation of POE ESCO MPEC is committed to continue operating POE ESCO as a
subsidiary. Recently, ESCO-type pilot programs in public buildings and EE project based on
Public-Private Partnerships, which are repaid from energy savings, slowly started increasing in
several municipalities (e.g. in Radzionkow, Czestochowa and Bytom). While these developments
along with the provisions of the new EU Directive (see Section 2.5) create new opportunities for


                                                 17
POE ESCO, the company has yet to demonstrate a sustainable business model for EE services
without GEF grant incentives. Alternatively, if concessional/grant funding for ESCOs and/or
EPC-models become available from EU Structural Funds, as expected by POE ESCO and other
EE experts, this would significantly increase the EPC business in Poland.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the Project was
moderately satisfactory. During preparation, the Bank took into account the adequacy of Project
design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, institutional and
fiduciary arrangements. The Project was highly innovative in its design and was among the first
World Bank projects piloting guarantee instruments and EPCs mechanisms to improve EE in the
buildings sector. The design of these cutting edge instruments were backed up with thorough
preparatory work and incorporated lessons learned from other projects. In addition, a number of
alternatives were considered during preparation. However, given the novelty of the EE guarantee
instrument as well as the time gap between start of preparatory work and Project appraisal (see
Section 2.1), the risk assessment and quality at entry would have benefitted from: (i) updated
market surveys reconfirming interest for guarantee instruments; and (ii) a ready pipeline of
updated and bankable EE projects. In addition, the PAD and the supplemental letter presented a
monitoring and evaluation framework that contained many inconsistencies. The Task Team could
have done a better job in identifying fewer, more meaningful and consistent performance
indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank’s performance during the implementation of the Project was moderately unsatisfactory.
The Task Team conducted regular implementation support missions, including thorough
supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects. Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISR)
highlighted key issues arising during implementation, and realistically rated the performance of
the project both in terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation.
Remedial actions were identified and included in the Aide-Memoires and/or annual ISRs. The
Bank Team had a flexible approach and applied innovative and creative thinking to tackle the
implementation constraints.

However, the supervision team mostly consisted of two experts to cover both the broad energy
sector issues as well as specific EE, financial and institutional issues, which may raise the
question if the team was equipped with sufficient resources to react quickly and effectively to the
challenges experienced during Project implementation. In retrospect, the Bank team should have
responded earlier to the failure of the Guarantee Component and the need to adapt to the changes
in the EE market that became apparent during the first two years of implementation. The PGF
was rated moderately unsatisfactory one year after the Project became effective and was

                                                18
subsequently downgraded to unsatisfactory during the following 3.5 years until restructuring in
2011. There was also a certain equivocation as to whether to continue or close the project before
the restructuring finally took place. While the Bank eventually concluded that the Project’s value
for the preparation of the US$ 1.1 billion DPL on EE outweighed its poor performance, these
deliberations further delayed responsiveness of the Bank. In addition, some of the key remedial
actions identified in ISRs (e.g. revolving audit fund, intermediate facilitator platform on
performance basis) ended up being implemented with significant delays or not at all - without this
being properly explained in Project Aide-Memoires and ISRs. The Project would have also
benefited from updating and ensuring consistency of the M&E framework at Mid-term review
and/or restructuring to address the data availability gaps and inconsistencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The design was innovative but the choice of a guarantee instruments should have been better
vetted with participating banks and an updated project pipeline should have been established.
During implementation, the Bank repeatedly showed flexibility and willingness to make
adjustments (and restructure) either based on evidence on the ground, or in response to the
client’s requests and the broader energy sector dialogue. However, the lack of progress towards
the achievement of the GEO was ultimately only addressed six years after the Project became
effective. On balance, overall Bank performance is considered moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Recipient

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the Government confirmed its commitment to EE in buildings by sustaining the TM
Program and by continuing the gradual increase of energy tariffs, which enhanced the commercial
viability of EE projects. During implementation, the Government also helped to foster progress
towards the GEO by: (i) strengthening the legal and regulatory environment for EE in buildings
in accordance with the relevant EU Directives; and (ii) adopting a number of key strategies and
policies on EE, including the national EE Action Plans in 2007 and 2011 as well as the ‘Energy
Policy of Poland until 2030’, which recognized EE as a key priority in the energy sector.
However, the Project would have benefitted from a more specific and consistent policy support at
Government level for promoting ESCO business models, stronger leadership for EE in the public
sector and the timely adoption of the EE Law to build a comprehensive legal and regulatory
framework for EE.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The performance of the implementing agency, BGK, followed a learning curve during Project
implementation. During the first years of implementation, BGK faced significant challenges due
to the lack of experience with implementing World Bank Projects, organizational and managerial
changes, and the lack of progress under the guarantee component. BGK concentrated on the
administration and negotiation of GFAs, but it did not show active leadership in addressing the
low deal flow generation under the guarantee component by making use of the significant TA

                                               19
resources, and implementing remedial actions. Specifically, the mid-term review in 2007
concluded that interactions and targeted support to commercial banks for deal origination were
limited and not sufficient to address poor performance of the guarantee component. Performance
of BGK started to improve considerably after 2010. After some initial difficulties explained in
Section 2.3, compliance with Bank safeguard and fiduciary requirements also increased during
project implementation.

POE ESCO, responsible for implementing the Capital Grant Facility, operated in a difficult
environment for ESCOs as evidenced by the decreasing number of active ESCOs during the first
years of implementation and the limited increase of number of ESCOs and turnovers thereafter.
Despite a non-conducive policy framework, POE ESCO and its owner, MPEC, showed tenacity
and commitment to demonstrating the potential for EPC concepts in Poland. However, POE
ESCO was operating on a relatively narrow market segment with strong dependency on a single
client (Krakow City Government) and GEF grant contributions. It did not manage to produce a
fully sustainable ESCO with a strong business plan, independent from GEF grant support.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the explanations above, the rating for overall recipient performance is moderately
satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

Innovative instruments should be kept simple with low transaction costs. In a market
environment that is not familiar with innovative instruments, such as ESCOs and EPCs, it is can
be easier to start with simple ESCO-type models to get initial market traction. POE ESCO offered
simple contracts, including guaranteed ‘deemed savings’ to public building institutions, which
helped to reduce transaction costs and started building awareness among targeted public
institutions.

ESCOs need financial safety net in start-up phase. A financial safety net provided by a parent
utility can substantially facilitate access to commercial financing by a start-up ESCO and mitigate
risk aversion of new clients. For instance, guarantees provided using the balance sheet of its
owner, MPEC, were key for POE ESCO in accessing financing from commercial banks.

Strong project pipeline is essential. When introducing new market-based instruments, such as
guarantees, it is critical to have a strong, readily available pipeline of bankable EE projects in
order to reconfirm existing market demand for the product, allow a quick start and early
dissemination of success stories and address capacity constraints from financial intermediaries
early on and in a targeted manner.

Active government and state institution role needed for an enabling ESCO environment. The
state institutions have a leadership role to play in order to tap the benefits ESCOs can offer,
including project aggregations, reduction of transaction costs, turnkey services and off-budget
project financing; firstly, at the state level, a conducive policy and regulatory framework is key to
stimulating a competitive market of energy service providers and to encouraging public bids
based on ESCO-type contracts; secondly, at municipal level, bundling different EE sub-projects


                                                 20
and allowing for simple energy savings performance elements can be a key element to foster EPC
implementation at a certain scale compared to dispersed and/or single EPC type projects. The
bundled implementation of the Krakow school program was one of the first larger EPC-models
implemented in the public buildings sector in Poland.

Guarantee instruments often not critical for EE lending to happen. The performance of a
guarantee mechanism is strongly dependent on prevailing conditions in the credit market. While
the guarantee instrument aims to enhance lending to underserved market segments due to high
risk perceptions, lack of creditworthiness remains a key constraint to open access to a new client
base. The failed attempts to refocus the PCG into higher risk segments demonstrated that
commercial banks often require similar collaterals for guarantees as for loans, inter alia due to the
high transactions costs involved in calling guarantees and recovery at default. Thus, while
guarantees may be used as an additional safety layer for already creditworthy clients, they are not
perceived as a critical mean to tap into a new client base where commercial banks had previous
concerns related to collaterals.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Bank largely concurs with issues raised by MOE, BGK and other ministries in their
evaluation, which is presented unedited in Annex 7. BGK highlights as one of the reasons for low
demand for guarantees the lack of an external agent system for project development as well as the
need to include performance based elements for participating banks. Such elements were
proposed and discussed with BGK during implementation but by that time it had already become
clear that even such enhancements would have a limited effect on the demand for guarantees and
the guarantee component was dropped rather than further enhanced. The Bank also notes some
minor inconsistencies in numbers used in the implementing agencies’ assessment compared to
M&E reports provided.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

At appraisal, an incremental cost analysis was carried out to assess the incremental costs per unit
of energy saving and CO2 abatement associated with the GEF project. At project completion, the
same analysis was carried out based on the actual project costs and outcomes. Moreover, to
better understand the economic and financial returns of the EE investments supported by the
project, a benefit-cost analysis was carried out at project completion to assess the payback period
and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the EE investments. For the POE ESCO
component financed by the Capital Grant Facility, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) has
also been estimated.

Summary of Key Assumptions and Changes

GEF incremental costs and allocation. While the overall GEF contribution remained unchanged
at US$ 11 million, its allocation across various project components has changed substantially due
to project restructuring: (i) the guarantee facility was scaled down considerably from US$5.7
million to US$0.05 million; (ii) the technical assistance component was also scaled down from
US$3.3 million to US$ 2.25 million; (iii) the POE ESCO component financed by the Capital
Grant Facility remained at the planned scale; and (iv) the remaining GEF fund of US$6.65
million was redirected to TM investments. Table A3-1 provides a detailed breakdown of the GEF
fund allocation at project appraisal and completion:

Investment Levels
A baseline investment was estimated for building EE in Poland at appraisal. At project
completion, the baseline was not reassessed because the analysis focused primarily on assessing
the incremental impacts of the GEF project.

Incremental investments. At completion, a total of US$57.8 million 31 had been invested in
building EE as a result of the GEF project, compared with an estimated US$55.5 million at
appraisal.32 Of the total investments, approximately US$49 million was on TM investments, and
the remaining US$8.67 million by POE ESCO.




31
  Difference to table A3-2 is explained by rounding of numbers.
32
  US$ 53.5 million were assumed to be catalyzed if the US$ 2 million grant funds for POE ESCO are
deducted (Annex 9 of the PAD refers therefore to US$ 53.5 million).

Energy Savings and CO2 Abatement
TM Investment Component. The BGK database on the TM Program does not record energy
savings and emissions reductions achieved. The M&E Consultant hired for the GEF Project used
150 sample audits in order to estimate the total energy savings and emission reductions from EE
investments supported by the GEF TM Investments Component. The following key parameters
were used for the estimates:
     Based on the investments costs, the final energy savings were estimated using average
        investment cost per MWh energy savings per year (PLN 2,554/MWh per year);
     Emission reductions were calculated based on the energy audits and using specific
        calorific values and corresponding CO2 emission factors for different fuels/ energy
        sources; the values used34 were very similar to the key data values used at appraisal; final
        emission reductions were estimated based on the average investment cost per MgCO2 per
        year (PLN 6,637/ MgCO2 per year);

POE ESCOs calculated ‘deemed’ energy savings before project implementation, verified actual
savings on an annual basis, and adjusted them for the heating degree days. The data used for this
analysis are based on POE ESCO’s reports and include the following key parameters:
     Energy savings were calculated based on the values for 2011,35 adjusted for the heating
        degree days;
     Emission reductions were calculated based on the key data values used at appraisal for
        heat-only-boilers in the Krakow region based on end-use consumption (tCO2/GJ) at 0.104.

Table A3-3 provides a detailed summary of the estimated annual energy savings and CO2
abatement estimated at appraisal and completion.




33
   Including US$48.8 million in project direct costs and US$2.4 million in estimated guarantee loss claims.
34
   CO2 emission factors used were: power plants and CHP plants based on hard coal – 94.58 kg/GJ; heat
plants based on hard coal – 94.82 kg/GJ; local boilers based on hard coal – 92.71; lignite – 107.54 kg/GJ;
35
   The energy savings achieved in 2011 are very close to the average annual savings for the implementation
period of the projects (2006-2011), adjusted for the initial time to full implementation of individual EE
measures; therefore, 2011 data were used as a proxy; estimated energy savings only included thermal and
electricity saving projects, with thermal savings accounting for almost 100 percent; as a result, one project
implemented by POE ESCO resulting in 126,957 m3 gas savings in 2008-2011 was not included in the
analysis.

Unit cost of heat energy. At project completion, the economic cost of thermal energy supply was
estimated at around 4.65 US cents per kWh at the end user level, compared with an estimated
3.9737 US cents at appraisal. An annual increase of 2 percent in the cost of thermal energy supply
in real terms is assumed to reflect the upward pressure on the cost of coal-based energy
production in Poland due to EU policies. In 2012, the weighted average thermal tariff was at
around 6.05 US cents per kWh. Thermal tariff is assumed to remain flat in real terms over the
life of the project.

Global environmental benefit of GHG emissions reduction is taken into account in the economic
analysis at a conservative value of US$10 per ton of CO2.

A project life-cycle of 15 years was assumed for the outputs at completion without differentiation
between electric and thermal savings, as around 99 percent of the total savings were thermal
energy savings. At appraisal, the project life-cycles for thermal and electric savings were
differentiated and assumed at 15 and 8 years respectively. .

Economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK). The benefit-cost analysis carried out at project
completion assumed an EOCK of 10 percent.

Economic discount rate of energy savings and CO2 abatements. The incremental cost analysis
at appraisal used a simple summation the annual energy savings and CO2 abatements over the
time life of the project as the proxies for the lifetime impact of the project. This approach results
in overestimations of the lifetime energy savings and CO2 abatements, and consequently,
underestimations of the incremental costs. A modified and improved approach applies a discount
rate to the future energy savings and CO2 abatements. For the discounted approach, a discount
rate of 10 percent was assumed for energy savings and CO2 abatements.

Results of the Incremental Cost Analysis
To allow comparability of the analytical results at appraisal and completion, incremental costs
were estimated based on both the non-discounted and discounted estimates of the lifetime CO2
abatement values.

          Based on the simple summation (discount rate = 0%), the incremental global benefits
           attributed to the Project are 393,397 tons of avoided CO2 emissions compared with
           1,374,411 tons estimated at appraisal. The total cost of the GEF Project was

   Estimates of energy savings at appraisal included both thermal and electricity savings. At project
completion, only thermal savings was measured because electricity savings turned out to be negligible. To
ensure the comparability of the results, only thermal savings were considered in the analysis.

   Calculated based on the information provided in the PAD.

                                                   27
         US$ 11,000,000. Therefore, the GEF project-related cost of CO2 abatement is about
         US$ 27.96 per tCO2 compared with an estimated US$ 8.00 per tCO2 at appraisal.

        Based on the discount method and a discount rate of 10 percent, the incremental global
         benefits attributed to the Project are 199,481 tons of avoided CO2 emissions compared
         with 696,925 tons based on appraisal-stage assumptions. The total cost of the GEF
         Project remained at US$ 11,000,000. The GEF project-related cost of CO2 abatement is
         about US$ 55.14 per tCO2 compared with US$ 15.78 per tCO2 based on appraisal-stage
         assumptions.

Table A3-4 provides a summary of the estimated incremental costs under both approaches.

Leveraging and Replication
The GEF fund of US$11 million is leveraging an additional US$46.8 million, translating to a
leverage ratio of about 1-to-4.3, compared with an estimated 1-to-10.7 at appraisal.    The
difference is primarily due to the considerable scale-down of the guarantee facility and the
redirection of the reserve fund to TM investments.

Results of the Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA)
A BCA was carried out at project completion to assess the overall impact of the EE investments
associated with GEF Project.

        Economic payback periods were calculated using the upfront investment costs divided by
         the economic value of the annual energy savings. At the project level, the payback
         period was estimated at 18.18 years at completion compared with 5.56 years based on
         appraisal-stage assumptions. The difference is primarily due to the type of investments
         supported, which included a much higher proportion of high pay-back measures (such as
         replacing windows) and fewer low pay-back measures (such as boiler replacements and
         fuel switch) than assumed at appraisal. This has resulted in considerably lower energy
         savings realized at project completion, at about US$3.2 million per year compared with
         an estimated US$11.6 million per year at appraisal.

         EIRRs were estimated at the project and component levels. Based on appraisal-stage
         assumptions, the project associated EE investments would yield an EIRR of 20.7 percent.
         The investments associated with the guarantee facilities would yield an average EIRR of
         22.6 percent while POE ESCO investments would yield an average EIRR of 4.8 percent.
         At project completion, the EIRR of the project was estimated at around a 0.2 percent with
         the TM investment and POE ESCO components yield a 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent,
         respectively.

        FIRR. Based on the average tariff of heat energy paid by the ESCOs in 2012, and
         assuming that the tariff will grow at the rate of inflation (3.2 per cent in 2012), the EE
         investments by POE ESCOs are expected to yield an average FIRR of 4.5 percent over
         the lifetime of the project.

                    BGK input to the Implementation Completion Report

In 2004 Poland received a grant from the Global Environment Facility of USD 11 m. for an
Energy Efficiency Project. The GEF Energy Efficiency Project in Poland had the objective to
increase public and private sector investments in energy efficiency in buildings in the territory of
Poland. Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK) managed the project on a mandate from the Grant
recipient the Ministry of Economy (MoE).

A major part of the Project resources was designated to provide partial guarantees for the loans
awarded for energy efficiency investments implementation. Due to the low demand for partial
guarantees from the energy efficiency market, the World Bank (WB) in agreement with the MoE,
decided to restructure the Project.

As a result of two restructurings carried out in 2011 and 2012, Project resources uncommitted
under the Partial Credit Guarantee Facility have been reallocated to the new Thermo-
Modernization Grant Facility (TM Grant Facility, TM Grants) to be used for purposes of the
provision of the Thermo-Modernization and Refurbishment Fund (TM Fund).

The Project was closed on 31st October 2012 and the descriptive evaluation of its results is
presented below.

Partial Credit Guarantee Facility
The Partial Credit Guarantee Facility was established with GEF funds as a risk-sharing
mechanism providing commercial banks partial coverage of risk exposure against loans made for
energy efficiency projects for buildings throughout Poland. It was chosen as an appropriate
mechanism to overcome financial barriers in the Polish market for energy efficiency in buildings
such as the reluctance of commercial banks to provide long-term financing, lack of adequate
security among borrowers and perception of high risk by lenders. The amount allocated originally
under the Partial Credit Guarantee Facility to bring more commercial financing into the market
was USD 5.7 m.

The Guarantee Facility was anticipated to leverage USD 39 m. in total investment by commercial
banks participating in the program, for approximately 390 projects ranging in size from USD
0.025 m. to USD 0.5 m. In practice, only one partial guarantee in the amount of ca. USD 0.06 m.
was granted under the Project, supporting the investment financed with the loan of ca. USD
0.18 m.

Under this component of the Project, BGK concluded three Guarantee Framework Agreements
with three Participating Banks. These agreements – due to low demand from participating banks
– were all terminated by November 2009.

As a result of the Project restructuring carried out in 2011, the funds available under this
component of the Project were reduced to USD 0.05 m. to secure BGK’s liability established in



                                                34
connection with the one guarantee that has been awarded under the Project. The only awarded
partial guarantee will expire on 28 February 2018.

As the amount remaining at the Guarantee Account for the date of the Project closing was
significantly exceeding (interest accrued on the Partial Guarantee Account) the amount allocated
under this component, the surplus in the amount of ca. PLN 2.4 m. was transferred to the MoE to
cover the costs of educational campaign on rational use of energy and public sector exemplary
role in the area of energy efficiency according to the Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency.

The probable reasons for the low utilization of the Partial Guarantee Facility can be ascribed to
the:
    1) late product introduction in relation to changing market conditions – the agreements with
       participating banks were signed in the years 2005-2008, whereas already in 2007, the
       National Loan Guarantee Fund (Krajowy Fundusz Poręczeń Kredytowych - KFPK) was
       widely available in Poland covering the need for guarantees to the blockhouse market
       (at that time twenty seven banks cooperated with KFPK on the basis of the framework
       agreements signed).
    2) low competitiveness in comparison to the similar products then functioning on the Polish
       market. One of the strongest competitors was established as a governmental fund by the
       act on loan guarantees. The KFPK’s offer attractiveness resulted from: less reporting
       requirements, lower price, higher amount of collateral, applicability to all types of
       projects (offer applicable for all market segments), no access limitations for specific types
       of beneficiaries. One of the biggest competitors was also the European Union Guarantee
       Fund located in BGK, providing warranties and guarantees to entrepreneurs
       implementing in the territory of Poland projects co-financed from the EU funds.
    3) changes in the market conditions since the Project origination. The increasing
       competitiveness in the banking sector led to the increase in availability of energy
       efficiency financing and to the provision of loans without collaterals or with simplified
       securities. Therefore, the increasing competitiveness of the KFPK was achieved by on-
       going amendments of the procedures to changing market requirements – there were many
       changes as a reaction to market demands.
    4) restrictive procedures (i.e. reporting requirements), lack of qualified personnel in
       cooperating banks, necessity of implementation of special motivation system for the
       banks staff and for external agents, for example for energy auditors. The scale of the
       project comparing to requirements necessary to be fulfilled was too small for the
       participating banks (low expected profit comparing to expensive implementation of
       complicated procedures).



Capital Grant Facility
The Capital Grant Facility was intended to demonstrate the commercial viability and increase the
acceptance of bundling high-cost measures with lower cost measures. The Capital Grant was also
supposed to help POE ESCO to demonstrate the performance contracting model for buildings in

                                                35
the Krakow region, thus increasing acceptance of this financial model, which is little known and
used in Poland.

It was established to support investments of USD 6.67 m. in bundled EE projects in the Krakow
region consisting of between 30% and 75 % investment in high cost measures (with paybacks in
excess of 10 years). The Capital Grant Facility provided partial grants equivalent to 30 percent of
total project cost to POE ESCO. The flat cost-sharing structure required that higher-payback
projects (over 10 years) include some portion of end-user co-financing in order to make the
project economically attractive for ESCO and lenders. Local Banks and POE ESCO contributed
ca. USD 4 m. of this investment, and client co-financing is expected to equal USD 67 m. of total
project cost of the packaged investment.

POE ESCO was originally allocated with the Capital Grant Facility in the amount of USD 2.0 m.
to cover the costs of implementation of the energy efficiency investments. However, due to the
fact that the expenses incurred by POE ESCO in PLN amounted to USD equivalent of USD
2,047,139.10, as a result of the restructuring carried out in 2011, the amount allocated under the
Capital Grant Facility was increased to USD 2.1 m. This allocation was reduced to USD 2.05 m.
as a result of the second Project restructuring executed in 2012.

In reality, the total value of the ESCO Project (PLN 25,495,585.50) exceeded the planned volume
of investment support. The Grant in the amount of USD 2.05 m. supported investments
implemented in public schools, public health care units and other public and municipal buildings.

Evaluation of Project implementation aspects prepared by POE ESCO

(i)     Assessment of the operation’s objective, design, implementation, and operational
        experience; Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives

        The objectives were to be achieved by:

        1. Removal of the risk barriers on financial markets discouraging commercial banks to
           participate in the financing of energy efficiency projects.

            It is difficult to assess whether we managed to remove the risk barriers in financial
            markets discouraging banks to finance energy efficiency projects. The fact is that
            after utilization of the WB grant, the POE ESCO is successfully implementing energy
            efficiency projects both for the customers from public and private sector co-financed
            with multi-purpose credit lines from commercial banks (Deutsche Bank and Nordea
            Bank Poland SA). The DB PBC credit line volume is PLN 6.5 m., of which up to
            90% may be used as a long-term financing (up to 6-7 years). The involvement of the
            DB PBC bank in the financing of the projects will exceed the amount of PLN 4 m. by
            the end of the year 2012. A condition of this funding is, however, a provision of a
            guarantee given by the Miejske Przedsiębiorstwo Energetyki Cieplnej (Urban Entity
            of Thermal Power S.A. – MPEC) - the owner of the POE ESCO.

            In the case of Nordea Bank credit line, the exposure is lower. Currently, the contract
            with guarantee provided by MPEC for multitasking line with a value of PLN 0.4 m.

                                                 36
           is being prepared for signature. Last year Nordea granted the loan of PLN 0.6 m. with
           no guarantee from MPEC.

       2. Demonstration of the feasibility of bundled investments in more expensive energy-
          saving measures in buildings, as well as increase in acceptance of service contracting
          mechanisms to ensure the increase of the energy efficiency of buildings and facilities.

           The project was a success not yet repeated on such a scale. The POE ESCO’s
           experience in the implementation of the project was used by followers. The project
           implemented in Public-Private Partnership formula in Radzionków (Silesian
           voiwodship) on five educational buildings drew from the experience of the GEF
           Project within the scope of methodology of settlement of energy savings,
           beneficiaries motivating and funding. Several other cities are implementing the pilot
           projects (from over a dozen buildings in Częstochowa, Silesian voiwodship) or very
           large projects (couple tens of buildings in Bytom, the Lower Silesia voiwodship)
           financed from savings (unfortunately limited to the active management of energy by
           low cost resources - advanced automation and monitoring). A very large project of
           energy efficiency improvement using EPC is being prepared also in Wrocław, the
           Lower Silesia voiwodship.

           By the year 2010, several dozens of procurement proceedings were conducted for
           street lighting improvements financed by contractors and repaid from savings (the
           POE ESCO was selected as a contractor and completed 3 of the assignments).
           Among the procurements there were the proceedings using elements of contractors
           off-balance sheet financing through the use of factoring.

       3. Stimulation of the demand for services in energy savings in the building sector, as
          well as increase of awareness and opportunities for commercial banks to initiate and
          provide loans for the financing of energy efficient investments.

           Until recently, commercial banks approached with caution to financing companies
           using the ESCO formula. To date, there are problems with factoring of long-term
           receivables. Similar situation occurs with insuring receivables with maturity date
           longer than 12 months.

           The good practices and results of the Project implementation, however, allowed the
           POE ESCO to involve the EBRD, the KAPE (Polish National Energy Conservation
           Agency), the NFOŚiGW (National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water
           Management) and the MoE into the issues of program activity. Therefore, it is
           expected that interesting programs supporting ESCO formula development should be
           implemented shortly.

(ii)   Evaluation of the POE ESCO’s own performance during the preparation and
       implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
       helpful in the future



                                              37
        The construction works under the project were completed on all 32 sites. The experiences
        in drafting the EPC contracts was also used in other projects. The important positive
        element of the program were clear rules on the eligibility of objects to be supported with
        grant resources and smooth cooperation with BGK in this area.

        Among the negative experiences, which could be improved the following has to be
        pointed out:

        • Grant allocation in a currency other than the currency of contracts complicating
          settlement and generating currency exchange differences.

        • Within the EPC contracts, the ESCO customer should always have big part in the so-
          called extra-savings (exceeding the guaranteed savings). It has been observed that
          customers who have to transfer all extra-savings to the contractor are less motivated to
          save from those with whom the contractor has to share.

        • Technological part should allow ESCO on-line monitoring of energy use (annual
          reporting makes possible loss report coming too late to react). During the
          implementation of the programme technologies enabling such management were
          expensive, while today it is no longer the case.

(iii)   Evaluation of the performance of the MoE, WB and BGK during the preparation and
        implementation of the programme, including the effectiveness of their relationships, with
        special emphasis on lessons learned

        The POE ESCO had limited contact with the MoE, so it is difficult to issue an assessment
        of this institution. Undoubtedly, there have been delays in payment to the POE ESCO
        contractors and this was the area for improvement. The MoE also disappointed in being
        passive in the removal of barriers for ESCO formula in Poland – the National Energy
        Efficiency Action Plan for Poland prepared in 2007 based activities in the field of energy
        efficiency on ESCO formula, however, there were no actions in the wake of this.

        The WB undoubtedly played a key role in the project. The acceptance of the various
        construction tasks worked well and it certainly is thanks to Peter Johansen, who promptly
        wrote back to any correspondence in this regard. Unfortunately, that did not happen in the
        use of the Technical Assistance component. Each conference, training, study tour,
        preparation of expert opinions and studies required numerous and burdensome
        substantiations (despite the fact that they resulted in 100% from the objectives of the
        project). For this reason, most of these funds have not been spent. From POE ESCO’s
        perspective, part of the GEF funds could have been allocated to build the project of
        promoting ESCO services in Poland, to start the facilitator service, to remove legal
        barriers to the development of this formula. Such activities are currently conducted by the
        POE ESCO and KAPE and the Institute of Environmental Economics in Krakow (NGO)
        using its own resources as well as the European Climate Foundation, the EBRD and the
        NFOŚiGW.



                                                38
       The BGK very well filled the assigned functions in the use of Capital Grant and
       Technical Assistance resources. Contact with BGK employees was current, they served
       with the advice and support, carried out monitoring and inspections were factual and
       substantive in nature. Small delays were caused by frequent changes in project
       management. Some personal differences in co-operation with the WB were also noticed.

       The loan guarantee program, the terms of which were not accepted by the market, missed
       the target.

All parties should praise a moderate system of reporting and a small burden of such reporting to
the ESCO.

TM Grant Facility
The TM Grant Facility was established from the uncommitted funds reallocated from the Partial
Credit Guarantee Facility (ca. USD 5.65 m.) and other unutilized funds of the Project. The TM
Grant Facility reimbursed the TM Fund for thermo-modernization bonuses (TM Bonuses) paid,
using the TM Fund’s existing delivery mechanisms. The component allowed to support eligible
thermo-modernization investments (TM investments) in residential buildings for which
TM bonuses were disbursed by the TM Fund in the period between 1 January 2012 until 30 June
2012.

The component was expected to leverage ca. USD 36.5 m. in total investment by commercial
banks cooperating with BGK under TM Fund programme, for approximately 360 Projects
ranging in size from USD 30,000 to USD 400,000.

The first Project restructuring assuming provision of the TM Fund with uncommitted resources of
the Partial Guarantee Facility came in force on 18th July 2011. The amount allocated under the
new component amounted to USD 5.8 m. The amount was completely disbursed to the TM Fund
in the 4th quarter of 2011 supporting 390 TM investments with the total investment value of USD
43 m.

On 4th June 2012 the WB issued the restructuring letter increasing the amount of resources
available under the TM Grant Facility from USD 5.8 m. to USD 6.65 m. The additional provision
of the TM Fund with the amount of USD 0.85 m. followed in October 2012 and allowed to
support 55 TM investments with the total investment value exceeding USD 6 m.

To summarize, under the TM Grant Facility the TM Fund was provided with the total amount of
USD 6.65 m., making the PLN provision exceeding PLN 21 m. Thanks to this provision, 445 TM
investments with the total value exceeding USD 49 m. were supported. The projects supported by
the TM Grant ranged in size from USD 7,000 to USD 1,430,000.

Evaluation of restructuring implementation by BGK:

(i)   Assessment of the operation’s objective, design, implementation, and operational
      experience



                                              39
       The objective was to establish an instrument that would allow the utilization of the Project
       funds unutilized due to low demand for partial guarantees in accordance with the GEF
       Project objectives.

       The provision of the TM Fund operated by BGK since 1999 with the goal to support
       investors carrying thermo-modernization projects financed from the commercial loans was
       agreed as the best solution to increase energy efficiency in buildings.

       The TM Fund has been operating under the Act on Support of Thermo-modernization
       and Renovation Investments of 21 November 2008 to provide state financial aid to
       investors carrying out TM investments, where such investments are financed through
       commercial loans from certain commercial banks. The aid to investors is provided in the
       form of a TM Bonus disbursed by the TM Fund, payable in the amount of up to 20% of the
       contracted loan designated for partial repayment of the thermo-modernization loan.

       Despite the fact that the TM Fund proved to be a very popular instrument, it was not
       subsided by the State in the year 2010. Therefore, when the restructuring works aiming to
       create a new component allowing the TM Fund’s provision with GEF resources were
       undertaken (September 2010), the volume of registered applications for TM bonuses that
       could not be proceeded due to the lack of funds amounted to PLN 19 m. and it was
       estimated that by the end of the year the volume of the applications expecting TM Fund
       provision will reach PLN 25 m.

       From a perspective of time and considering the fact that although the support granted under
       the TM Fund’s activities is persistently popular, the draft State budget for 2013 assumes
       the provision for the TM Fund in the amount of only PLN 20 m., the objective of the TM
       Fund’s provision with GEF resources proves to be even more reasonable.

       BGK assesses the process of preparation and implementation of the restructuring
       assumptions as successful. In reference to the preparation of the restructuring, the most
       difficult issue was the agreement of the environmental requirements for investments
       supported under TM Grant Facility. However, considering the fact that the Restructuring
       Paper was approved six months after the objective of the TM Fund’s provision with GEF
       resources was elaborated, we can assess the restructuring process as effective.

(ii)   Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives
       The reallocation of GEF funds to the TM Grant Facility operating to reimburse the TM
       Fund for TM Bonuses paid by the TM Fund, allowed to effectively support investments
       resulting in energy savings and CO2 emission reductions.

       The component was expected to leverage ca. USD 36.5 m. in total investment by
       commercial banks cooperating with BGK under TM Fund programme, for approximately
       360 Projects ranging in size from USD 30,000 to USD 400,000. Factually, the component
       leveraged ca. USD 49 m. investments, for 445 projects ranging in size from USD 7,000 to
       USD 1,430,000. The outcome of the TM Fund’s provision can be assessed as successful.



                                                40
(iii)   Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during the preparation and implementation
        of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future
        The MoE’s engagement and cooperation on restructuring issues is assessed by BGK as
        satisfactory. Also, BGK is of the opinion that the PMU applied due care in order to utilize
        GEF Project resources in due time and effective manner.

(iv)    Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co-financiers, or of other partners during
        the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of their
        relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned
        The cooperation of BGK with the WB ensured efficient operation of the Project. The WB
        representatives offered support without undue delays and provided necessary guidance.

Technical Assistance

Technical Assistance (TA) was provided for several barrier removal activities, including: support
for the deployment of the guarantee mechanism and building the capacity of BGK, to administer
the guarantee; support to the POE ESCO in the development of the performance contracting
model in the Krakow region and to build its pipeline of potential investments; provision of
training to local banks; activities to increase awareness and demand for efficiency investments
among building owners including municipalities; and collection of project monitoring data and
broad dissemination of results. The component was also designed to finance several studies
linked to barrier removal for EE investments on a national level.

The purpose of the TA funds had to be adjusted to factual demands of the Grant Recipient within
the scope of energy efficiency improvement when it appeared that the partial guarantees are not
popular and TA funds shall be utilized to support measures different than the deployment of the
guarantee mechanism. The MoE in agreement with the WB decided that TA funds will be
partially utilized to finance several studies and assignments not related to the implementation of
the Project, but being of key importance to the increase of energy efficiency in Poland:

1)      In January 2012 MoE confirmed that BGK can start procurement procedure to purchase the
        study Macroeconomic Assessment and Fiscal Implication of Energy Efficiency Policies for
        Poland for the benefit of the Ministry of Finance (MoF).
        The study assigned under the SSS procurement procedure to Instytut Badań Strukturalnych
        (IBS) consisted in preparation of an analysis making a continuation and expansion of the
        analytical framework developed for the purpose of Poland County Economic Memorandum
        (Poland CEM) titled Transition to a Low-Emissions Economy in Poland, in particular on
        the dynamic macroeconomic modeling work set out in the CEM report.

        Under the Poland CEM, for the purpose of ex ante assessment of macroeconomic and fiscal
        implications of GHG mitigation policies for Poland 2020/2030, a suite of analytical tools
        for Poland were developed, building on work on GHG mitigation and low carbon growth in
        other countries. First, a bottom-up technical model helped identify cost-effective mitigation
        measures. This part of the analysis was performed, being partially financed by the WB, by
        McKinsey & Company. The results of the bottom-up sectoral analysis were presented in a

                                                 41
     widely acknowledged report Assessment of GHG mitigation opportunities in Poland by
     2030. Next, a large scale, multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
     model, the MEMO model, developed at IBS, focused on sectoral mitigation packages
     (groups of numerous specific carbon mitigation interventions), and was linked with the
     bottom up analysis. In addition, a multi-sector, multi-country computable general
     equilibrium model focused on the EU policy implementation was developed by Loch
     Alpine Inc. Both models yielded a series of insights on how Poland might best move
     towards a lower carbon future.

     The analytic work conducted under the Macroeconomic Assessment assignment was a
     follow-up work to the analysis performed by the IBS for the purpose of the Poland CEM. It
     included both the improvement and expansion of the methodology (eg. through adoption of
     longer time horizon), and provided new insights on the macroeconomic and sectoral
     implications related to the implementation of energy efficiency agenda in Poland.

2)   In February 2012, the MoE confirmed in its letter to the WB that it plans to finance the
     study on Home Area Networks (HANs) within Smart Grids for the benefit of Energy
     Regulatory Office (ERO).

     The study assigned under the SBCQ procurement procedure to A.T. Kearney Sp. z o.o.
     (ATK) included preparation of a concept of providing electricity end-users (especially
     households) with equipment allowing for effective management of electricity use and - in
     the case of prosumers - with electricity generation.

     Under the assignment, the consultant was expected to propose the equipment designed to
     achieve HANs working on the basis of data transferred from Advanced Metering
     Infrastructure (AMI) to the end user's meter (price signals and Demand Side Response
     (DSM) signals and commands). The solution was to equip the end-user with the ability to:

     a)   Individually determine the level of user sensitivity to energy price increases (e.g., the
          price level at which consumption reduction should activated);

     b)   Determine the hierarchy of electricity controls (the sequence of consumption
          limitations in response to the price signal and/or DSM signals);

     c)   Provide system overrides for those users who would not be willing to get involved;
          and

     d)   Equip communications to facilitate HANs to help customers execute choices.

     The purpose was to analyze the potential impact of equipment designed to achieve HANs
     to:

     a)   Improve demand responsiveness to price information, thus improving price flexibility
          of electricity demand;
     b)   Improve the access of distributed generation to the National Power System, especially
          small distributed generation (units with a capacity equivalent to 1 MW or less),


                                                42
      especially in consideration of distributed dispatching to enable balancing under
      normal and islanding conditions;
c)    Include distributed demand responsiveness with particular focus on peak periods and
      how DSM mechanisms could help decrease costs;
d)    Launch economic mechanisms to provide incentives for end-use energy efficiency
      investments.

The task was carried out in the form of four thematic reports (analysis of technical,
economic, social and legal issues associated with the implementation of HANs within
Smart Grids, drawing on international experiences and local conditions) and a summary
report pulling together the conclusions and suggestions arising from the thematic reports.

Evaluation of assignment implementation provided by ERO

(i)    Assessment of the report’s objective, design, implementation, and operational
       experience

       Main goals of the report preparation was to analyze potential influence of
       components making up the structure of HAN on:

       a)   disclosure of the actual price flexibility of demand for electricity,

       b)   the opening of the National Electroenergetic System (Krajowy System
            Elektroenergetyczny - KSE) on distributed generation, in particular generation
            of diffuse (units with power up to 1 MW or less), including the possibility of
            balancing energy in normal working conditions and the working conditions of
            the so-called „energetic island?,

       c)   enabling of distributed reception, currently responsible for the shaping of peak
            traffic, to the DSM mechanisms,

       d)   introduction of economic mechanisms encouraging the improvement of energy
            efficiency by energy final users.

       Report assumptions anticipated that created system should be customer friendly, that
       is:

           will be easy to understand, easy to use and effective in the development of
            consumer behavior in line with the public objectives; and

           will not create additional financial burden (more than absolutely necessary
            minimum); one of the methods of meeting this condition is the optimal use of
            the existing infrastructure, designed also to meet other needs, which is already
            in the possession of the end user.

       Above mentioned goals and assumptions related both to individual consumers in
       households and to SME sector.


                                           43
             In ERO opinion, during the preparation of the report the consultant showed a
             professional approach manifested by a wide knowledge of the discussed topics.

     (ii)    Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives

             The cooperation on the report has allowed ERO, in addition to meeting the above
             mentioned goals, primarily to expand knowledge of global experience in the field of
             HAN, to learn about positive as well as negative examples of HAN implementation,
             to learn about current level of knowledge about HAN in Poland among consumers,
             to discover potential price flexibility of the demand and also allowed to make
             decisions on key solutions for HAN infrastructure and its links with AMI.

             The report will be primarily used as a support for the ERO in the formation of a
             regulatory approach encouraging the development of Intelligent Network in Poland.
             The report will be the basic document useful in the preparation of the next step
             expected by the ERO President that is the development and the publication of the
             position of the ERO President on requirements for HAN and on the requirements for
             the communications system in the metering device necessary to communicate with
             HAN. These positions will be subsequent documents created by the ERO President
             aimed at guiding the development of the Intelligent Network in Poland.

     (iii)   Evaluation of the ATK performance during the preparation of report, with special
             emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future

             In ERO’s opinion, the tasks carried out by the ATK were done in an efficient and
             professional way. The consultant also conducted necessary consultations beyond the
             specified schedule necessary to complete the work on the report. At the same time, it
             should be noted, that the method of procurement ensured fast and efficient selection
             of the consultant that showed the utmost care in the preparation of assignment
             implementation offer. We have to emphasize that the proposed and carried out by the
             consultant form of workshops, in particular the selection of the participants in terms
             of business profile allowed us to develop constructive proposals carefully considered
             by the consultant in the final version of the report.

     (iv)    Evaluation of the performance of the MoE, the WB and BGK during the assignment
             of the report, including the effectiveness of their relationships, with special emphasis
             on lessons learned

             In ERO’s opinion the cooperation between all parties taking part in the assignment
             the performance of the report run smoothly and efficiently. The cooperation with the
             WB based on the active participation in specifying the scope of the assignment
             (ToR). Our cooperation with BGK during project realization run without any
             reservations.

3)   In the letter to the WB sent in February 2012, the MoE confirmed also that it plans to
     finance the purchase of IT application for buildings and energy certificates register for the
     Ministry of Transport Construction and Maritime Economy (MoT) under the TA

                                                44
component. Due to the fact that the purchase of IT application could be performed only
under the Goods category of expenditures, the restructuring carried out in 2012 resulted in
the increase of resources made available under the Goods category under Project
Management expenditures in order to be utilized for the purpose of IT application
purchase.

The IT application assigned under the NCB procurement procedure to Pentacomp Systemy
Informatyczne Sp. z o.o. (Pentacomp) included development of a central system for
recording and monitoring the energy performance of buildings certificates system in
Poland and the condition of public buildings with regard to energy efficiency. The system
will be used to manipulate data and perform functions such as performance reporting,
analysis, collation, and mining data based on specified criteria in order to efficiently
supervise buildings energy consumption.

Under the assignment, Pentacomp developed the internet-based knowledge-sharing system,
drawing on commercially available software recommended and provided to the MoT. The
system consists of five clear and user-friendly registries: 1) a registry of persons authorized
to issue energy performance of buildings certificates, 2) a registry of persons who have lost
the authority to issue energy performance of buildings certificates, 3) a registry of energy
performance of buildings certificates flexible to the extent enabling accommodation current
and future legal requirements in this regard, 4) a registry recording the results of the
inspection of boilers, hot water systems and forced air heating/cooling systems, and 5) a
registry of all public buildings.

Evaluation of assignment implementation provided by the MoT

The contract for the provision of services involving the design, creation, installation,
commissioning and implementation of Registry System (RS) for the MoT was realized
between June 28th and September 14th 2012 by Pentacomp Systemy Informatyczne S.A.
The RS will be maintained as an IT application covering the following lists:

- publicly available list of persons entitled to issue energy efficiency certificates,
  including those who are entitled to control the heating and air conditioning systems,
- list of energy efficiency certificates by which it will be possible to provide an
  independent control system for energy efficiency certificates,
- list of control protocols of heating and air conditioning systems, so that it will be
  possible to provide an independent control system on the checks of heating and air
  conditioning systems,
- publicly available registry of buildings used by public authorities.

The main objective of the creation of the above mentioned RS is the implementation of the
provisions of art. 18 of the EU Directive on the Energy Efficiency of Buildings. The RS
will allow to control the introduced documents such as energy efficiency certificates and
protocols on the checks, will provide public access to regularly updated lists of persons
entitled to issue energy efficiency certificates and protocols of the checks on heating and
air conditioning systems. The RS is a necessary tool for conducting the above control

                                          45
      system referred to in art. 18 of the above mentioned Directive, based on the contained in it
      checks and protocols concerning significant proportion of all certificates, thereby
      minimizing the number of people needed for its operation and maintenance. As a result of
      the work carried out, the product desired by the MoT has been achieved.

      In accordance with the provisions of the draft guidelines for the Law of Energy Efficiency
      of Buildings it is anticipated that the above mentioned RS will be based on the provisions
      of the Law of Energy Efficiency of Buildings and its provision for mandatory use by
      authorized persons will come into force by the date of entry into force of the Law of
      Energy Efficiency of Buildings. The vacatio legis period of approximately 6 months will
      be provided within the Law.

      Pentacomp Systemy Informatyczne S.A. has proved to be punctual and reliable with the
      execution of the particular stages of work.

      The MoT is positively assessing the cooperation with the parties involved in the project,
      both during the preparatory work, the implementation and the acceptance of separate stages
      of the project, as well as at the final acceptance. Special attention has to be paid to
      commitment, flexibility and good communication between the project partners at all stages
      of its implementation.

During the restructuring process, the amount allocated under TA Component to support POE
ESCO also had to be reduced to the amount factually utilized by the POE ESCO. The POE ESCO
assesses the TA utilization as unsatisfactory and claims that low utilization should be attributed to
the discouraging, complicated and long-lasting approval procedures.

BGK assesses the utilization of TA resources as successful. The WB procurement procedures
which are much more flexible than Polish Public Procurement Law provisions proven to be very
effective in engaging professional consultants that executed assigned tasks in a timely manner,
with due care and using their best professional knowledge and experience.

The IT application provided to the MoT under NCB procurement procedure will make a central
platform for the exchange of information on energy consumption in buildings based on energy
performance certificates. This will allow to undertake a number of actions improving energy
intensity in the area of energy consumption in the construction sector, responsible for about 30%
of total energy consumption. Consequently, the RS will be used to effectively reduce energy
consumption in one of the most energy-intensive sector of economy in accordance with the
National Energy Efficiency Action Plan developed by the Government of Poland to meet
significant obligations related to energy efficiency in the near to medium term arising from
Poland’s membership in the EU.

The HANs within Smart Grids analysis prepared for the benefit of ERO under SBCQ procurement
procedure, will support the power sector to meet the energy efficiency targets through preparation
of solutions (with a particular emphasis on Smart Grids) and policies facilitating improved
information flows to customers to enable them to better tailor the supply of energy and end-user
controls, to meet their needs and willingness to pay for reliability tailored to their needs. Proper


                                                 46
information, measurement and controls is planned to be provided to all end users, including the
most dispersed users in the service sector (SME) and in households, who – taking advantage of a
dynamically growing assortment of micro-generation options – will increasingly assume a dual
role of energy consumers and producers, i.e. prosumers. These tasks are expected to be
implemented by Smart Grid infrastructure, the solutions of which were assessed under the HANs
within Smart Grids analysis.

The Macroeconomic Assessment and Fiscal Implication of Energy Efficiency Policies for Poland
prepared for the benefit of the MoF under SSS procurement procedure will facilitate to the
Government the assessment and policy-making within the scope of introduction of policies
aiming at preserving natural environment and abate negative externalities (such as CO2).

GEF Project assessment provided by the MoE
In the MoE opinion, the Project implementation enabled to achieve the Project objective which
was to increase the public and private sector investments in energy efficiency of buildings.

Although the initial phase of the Project implementation was not going according to the plan, the
efficient restructuring process put in place in 2011 allowed for proficient and consistent with the
Project objective use of the full amount of the GEF grant awarded to Poland.

The Project restructuring was necessary, among the others due to the changes that have occurred
in the availability of energy efficiency financing mechanisms. This is because additional
opportunities for funding of thermo-modernization projects has become possible (i.e. not only
TM Fund, but also from the State Guarantee Fund and EU funds). Consequently, it may, to some
extent, affect the demand for support in the form of Partial Loan Guarantee Programme.

The provision of the TM Fund with unutilized resources of the Partial Guarantee Facility was in
line with the Project objectives and in the assessment of the MoE, was the most optimal solution,
which could be adopted in the contemporary situation, in particular taking into account the need
to achieve the Project objectives within the short period remaining for the Project restructuring.

The TM Fund is the main mechanism of energy efficiency support and the first provision of the
TM Fund by financial means other than funds subsided from the state budget, may be a good
practice in the field of supplying the TM Fund also with off-budgetary funds. Especially in the
context of limited budgetary resources allocated to support energy efficiency activities, such a
solution seems to be more and more necessary.

From the experiences of the project transformation following conclusions were drawn:

    -   projects concluded in Poland on the basis of international agreements, in particular long-
        term projects during implementation of which i.e. socio-economic conditions can change,
        should in appropriate situations be able to restructure without the need for
        implementation of an international treaty revision procedure under the Act on
        International Agreements of May 17, 2000,




                                                47
    -    the execution of the above mentioned international treaty revision procedure is time-
         consuming and, therefore, may in some cases limit the ability to restructure the project
         and thus affect the lower level of implementation of the project,

    -    as a good practice, it would take to add to international agreements a clause about the
         possibility to restructure projects in exceptional circumstances.

The implementation of the Capital Grant Facility component and the Technical Assistance
component in the MoE opinion proceeded as expected. The Capital Grant has enabled POE
ESCO to carry out demonstration projects in the field of thermo-modernization in the Małopolska
Voivodship. The experience of using elements of financial incentives should, in the MoE opinion,
be useful for POE ESCO and encourage this entity to participate in other instruments of
supporting energy efficiency, such as energy efficiency certificates system, which will be
launched in 2013 under the Energy Efficiency Law of May 10, 2011.

The results of the tasks carried out within the scope of Technical Assistance component, in
particular the establishment of the register of buildings and energy efficiency certificates, as well
as conducting the analysis on smart grids and smart meters should also contribute to a better
implementation of EU law in the field of energy efficiency in buildings. In particular, the
preparation of the central register of buildings is an important and crucial aspect that will allow
for ongoing monitoring of the level of energy demand in the Polish construction industry.

The MoE is positively assessing effectiveness of the cooperation between all parties involved in
the Project, especially BGK’s commitment in Project realization in the last, most difficult phase
of the Project’s life.

The good cooperation with representatives of the WB as well as the effort they made to extend
the closing date of the Project, has enabled the successful completion of the restructuring process
of the Project.

It has to be said that the Project realization made possible to achieve the development goal of the
Project and will contribute to fulfilling the goals of energy efficiency under the Directive
2004/32/UE on energy end-use and energy services and objectives of Polish Energy Policy until
2030.

Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of similar projects – BGK
recommendations
1)   Withdrawal applications currency. In the case of direct payments, withdrawal applications
     should be submitted to the WB and disbursed to the beneficiary in a currency in which the
     expenditures were factually incurred. The USD equivalent should be calculated by the WB
     using the currency rate of the date of the disbursement made by the WB.

        In the case of the TM Grant Facility disbursements, the applications for withdrawal were
        agreed to be submitted in USD although the TM Bonuses were disbursed by the TM Fund
        in PLN. In fact, the PMU had to calculate each of the 445 refinanced TM Bonuses
        separately from PLN to USD using the currency rate for the date of the disbursement of

                                                 48
     each TM Bonus by the TM Fund. This led to the situation in which the TM Fund provided
     the lists of TM Bonuses to be refinanced summing up to the total amounts of PLN and
     then, received the PLN amount different than requested to be refinanced. This resulted not
     only from the fact that the requested amount was calculated from PLN to USD at the stage
     of the preparation of the application for withdrawal, but also from the fact that the USD
     amount stated in the application for withdrawal had to be recalculated back to PLN when
     disbursed to the TM Fund in USD. In this case, also PLN disbursement would be
     recommended.

2)   Eligible expenditures. According to the procedure of withdrawal of the proceeds of the
     GEF Trust Fund Grant provided in the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund Grant
     Agreement, the proportion of eligible expenditures for local consulting firms and local
     individual consultants has been limited to 83,5% of expenditures. This limit was made on
     the assumption that VAT tax is not eligible to be financed under Grant proceeds. To better
     utilize available funds, this assumption shall be accompanied by the assumption that in the
     case of expenditure exempted from VAT, 100% of expenditures shall be eligible to be
     financed under the Grant proceeds.

     The limit of 83,5% not accompanied by the possibility to fund 100% when exempted from
     VAT, had the following disadvantages to the PMU:

     - although all of the contracts concluded with consultants/goods providers were registered
       as services/goods purchased for non-returnable foreign resources and, therefore, were
       exempted from VAT, the PMU could only utilize 83,5% of the allocated amount;

     - the PMU could not fully utilize the procurement limits (although procured
       goods/services were exempted from VAT, the amounts available to purchase procured
       goods/services were lower than allocated).
