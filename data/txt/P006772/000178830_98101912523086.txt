1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most
promising at some 93 GW of capacity and 400 TWh of annual energy capabil-
ity 1/. Colombia is also endowed with large coal and gas deposits. Since
1970 oil production has declined at an average annual rate of 6%. Over
the same period, consumption of petroleum products increased on average
5.4% annually until 1975 and declined to 3.5% since then. As a result,
Colombia has been a net importer of crude oil since 1976, with petroleum
having become the country's largest single import. Prospects are for oil
imports to rise sharply in the early 1980s unless additional reserves are
discovered and developed rapidly. Measures are being taken to deal with
this problem and to develop alternative energy sources. In the case of coal,
there have been various obstacles to more adequate utilization of the existing
potential: the competition of lower priced petroleum, fragmentation of
production among a large number of small mines with low output and productivity
levels, and lack of efficient transport infrastructure. However, the Govern-
ment has been taking action to address these problems (1.03).
1.02      Production of primary energy during 1965-78 (see table next page)
has not kept pace with overall economic expansion. It increased only 3.9%/a
during 1965-70, when it reached its peak at 661 x 1012 Btu in 1970, and
then declined to 582 x 1012 Btu by 1978, mainly due to falling crude oil
output. In contrast to the declining energy output, final energy consumption
grew by 10.9%/a during 1965-70, and 8.5%/a during 1971-73, when economic
growth was high and energy prices declined sharply in real terms. During
1974-78, the economic downturn and increase in real energy prices had a
dampening effect on consumption, which now has settled at a growth of about
4.5%/a compared with a real GDP growth of 5%/a in 1979-80.
1.03      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a more
favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use through increased
utilization of domestic sources which are in abundant supply, i.e., hydropower,
natural gas and coal and by developing high-value energy resources for export
to reduce the growing energy trade deficit. Toward this end, the Government
is planning a large-scale development of high grade coal deposits for export

by state entities in association with foreign investors. For this purpose, a
new enterprise, CARBOCOL, has recently been created and has emerged as the
Government's chief agency in coal-related matters. The Government attaches
high priority to developing, primarily for export, the coal deposits at El
Cerrejon (measured reserves in excess of 1 billion tons) near Riohacha in the
Department of La Guajira on the Atlantic Coast, under CARBOCOL's responsibility
in cooperation with foreign investment. A portion of the thermal deposits at
El Cerrejon is earmarked for domestic consumption in power plants and industry
in place of natural gas and fuel oil. The Government also intends to step up
surveys of identified coal fields in the departments of Santander and Antioquia
and to study the feasibility of using low grade coal for firing large thermal
plants required in the early 1990s when potential hydro sites are expected to
be increasingly more costly to develop (1.27). Small private firms which own
coal mines are pursuing plans to expand output and expand operations in order
to supply fuel for heat-intensive industrial processes and both in-plant and
public power generation. In order to expand potentially viable mines, a
well-coordinated Government program is needed to provide a rational price
structure, improvements in mine safety, credit facilities and support for
marketing and infrastructure. Such a program would need substantial technical
and capital assistance from abroad. The Bank has been providing guidance to
the Government in the preparation of the proposed El Cerrejon and the Railways
Improvement Projects.
1.04      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to stimulate
investment in exploration and field development, which had declined after 1971
because the prices paid to the producers for domestic sales were below economic
value. Currently, the prices paid for oil produced by increasing yields from
existing fields and from new fields have been raised, with the latter now at
world market levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for petroleum has
been eliminated. Moreover, the Government is encouraging foreign participation
in exploration and development on the basis of joint venture contracts with
ECOPETROL (the Government oil agency). As a result, interest among foreign
petroleum companies to expand or start operations in Colombia has been intensi-
fied and an upturn in exploration has taken place. Domestic petroleum product
prices have been increased substantially in line with the Government's objec-
tive of reaching international levels over a reasonable period of time. A
Bank petroleum project is being considered for secondary oil recovery, surveys
and follow-up discoveries. With respect to natural gas, a previous decline
in known reserves and output has been reversed with the discovery of large
deposits in the Atlantic Coast region. These reserves (estimated at over
4.5 x 1012 ft3) will provide energy and petrochemical feedstock to this
rapidly industrializing region. The Government has under consideration
several projects for natural gas utilization, including a fertilizer plant,
and the production of methanol as a fuel for vehicles. Nevertheless, the
feasibility of such projects has not yet been thoroughly assessed.
1.05      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential and
the Government has contracted with the French Minatome group for such explora-
tion. Uranium possibilities seem to exist in the Zapatoca, Caldas and



- 4 -
Santander Departments.  This potential would provide the country with another
long-term energy option.  Although the measures taken by the Government to
achieve a domestically based energy balance have already yielded positive
results, the Government recognizes that its planning and policy efforts have
been insufficiently coordinated among the various energy subsectors.  To
remedy this, in 1980 the Government initiated a study to evaluate the country's
options in developing domestic energy resources. The study will also focus on
the policy measures that can maximize the benefits to be derived from recommended
investments, based on least-cost solutions. The Bank is working closely with
the Government in this endeavor.
Power Sector Organization
1.06      Since 1970, electricity has been the fastest growing form of energy used
in Colombia (8.2%/a); its share in overall energy consumption grew from 6.5% in
1970 to 8.9% in 1978. This process has been assisted by the gradual consolida-
tion of isolated facilities into regional systems and the interconnection of
these systems to facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost hydro resources.
The main systems are the Central System, covering the interior and the Pacific
coast, and the Atlantic (or Northern) system covering the northern part of
the country. By 1982/83 a national grid will have been established with the
completion of a 500-kV line interconnecting the Atlantic and the Central systems,
for which a Bank loan of MUS$50 (1583-CO) was approved in 1978. The proposed
project of Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) is located in the Central
System. Also located in the Central System are the Mesitas (1628-CO),
Distribution (1807-CO), San Carlos I and II hydro projects (1582-CO and
1725-CO) and Guadalupe IV (1868-CO), for which Bank loans amounting to MUS$494
were approved between 1978 and 1980, i.e. about 55% of its total Bank lending
to the sector of MUS$894 (Annex 1.1). The Bank has closely coordinated its
assistance in the power sector with IDB, particularly since 1977 with respect
to the San Carlos I project, the jointly appraised Playas project (4.03)
presented herein, and the recently appraised Guavio project. IDB's lending
for Colombian power Development totals M-US$513 (Annex 1.1).
1.07      At present, public electricity service is provided by:
(a)  municipally owned companies, independent of the National
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), EPM, and Empresas Municipales
de Cali (EMCALI);
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), and Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA);
(c) a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
1/   In most cases, the ownership of these subsidiaries is shared with
local governments.



- 5 -
(d) a generating and transmission company, Interconexion Electrica
S.A. (ISA), the shareholders of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL
and CORELCA.
1.08      Colombia has a number of public entities known as Regional Autonomous
Corporations, with a range of functions related to development of the regions
under their jurisdiction, including legal capacity to generate, transmit and
distribute electricity. CVC is the largest of these entities. The Ministry
of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly through ICEL and CORELCA.
EEEB and EPM, currently the largest utilities, are controlled by autonomous
municipal governments. CVC reports to the National Planning Department (NPD)
as do some other regional development corporations. ISA was established in
1967 to provide a rational framework for sector development by interconnecting
the systems of its shareholders, thus creating a national grid capable of
sustaining large hydroelectric developments. By pooling their financial
resources through ISA (under the recent Bank loans mentioned in paragraph 1.06),
its shareholders have been able to share the costs and benefits of the country's
large hydropower resources, which tend to be geographically concentrated
principally in the areas of influence of Bogota (EEEB) and Medellin (EPM).
Regulation, Planning and Coordination
1.09      The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating national
policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
although it shares responsibility with NPD in defining investment priorities.
The Ministry, which is responsible for coordinating and supervising power
sector planning, discharges its functions through its Electric Energy Division.
This division is small and does not have the powers assigned to similar
agencies in other countries (issuance of licenses, regulation of tariffs,
approval of expansion programs) to enforce its policies and programs. Public
utility retail tariffs (including those for electricity) are regulated by the
Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos (JNT) which forms part of the
NPD.  JNT has customarily approved requests from the companies for rate
increases, but utilities are free to set tariffs at levels lower than those
approved by the Junta and have sometimes done so in the past. Although the
Government cannot enforce its policies directly on the municipally controlled
power companies, a mechanism for reaching agreement on major issues affecting
the sector is provided by ISA, in which the Government has a major although
not controlling interest.
1.10      Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly in recent
years, as illustrated by the following:
(a) in line with its bylaws, ISA defines the generation and transmission
expansion program for the interconnected system. On the basis of
studies carried out by it and its shareholders, ISA executes simula-
tion studies and ranks plants in order of economic merit. After
approval by its Board and NPD, this becomes the national expansion
program. ISA's bylaws specify that all plants requiring a joint
effort of all its shareholders will be constructed, owned and
operated by ISA. Plants of regional interest may be built by one



- 6 -
or several shareholders, subject to ISA's approval. Under these
arrangements, ISA is, in effect, responsible for an important part
of sector regulation and planning; only a small number of minor
utilities which do not participate directly in ISA and the national
enterprises, other than CVC, ICEL and CORELCA, are not covered by
its decisions. Voting arrangements in ISA have been restructured to
require the concurrence of four of its five major shareholders in
all important decisions, thus protecting the interests of the
municipal utilities and encouraging a positive participation in its
deliberations;
(b)  In conjunction with the San Carlos I loan, ISA and its shareholders
agreed to prepare and present to the Government and the Bank for
comments a Power Sector Development Master Plan, which has been
received and is under review by the Bank. This plan covers the
period 1980-1990 in detail and 1991-2000 in general terms and
consolidates the programs for generation and transmission expansion.
Similarly, ISA's shareholders undertook, under the coordination of
the Ministry of Mines and Energy, to prepare and present, as part
of ISA's Master Plan, to the Government and the Bank for comments
by December 31, 1979, a 1980-2000 Sector Development Master Plan
for Distribution, consolidating all existing and future programs
for distribution and covering the period 1980-85 in detail. I/
Overall, the Master Plan is expected to provide a valuable framework
for long-range decisions on sector-financing, pricing and rural
electrification which have in the past been based on partial and
uncoordinated information;
(c) as agreed under the San Carlos I loan, a tariff study based on
marginal costing is underway covering the most important supply
areas in the country. With Bank guidance, this study is being
carried out through a committee in which experts from the Govern-
ment, ISA and its shareholders participate; and although it has
required more time to complete than anticipated, it is expected
to be ready by end-1980.
1/   Completion of the distribution study will be delayed until mid-1981.
The Government has delegated management of the study to ISA, which
has engaged consultants to coordinate execution of the study and the
preparation of a consolidated report. CVC has completed a draft report,
but no information has reached the Bank from ICEL. CORELCA is expected
to have a draft report available soon. EPM has a distribution program
covering 10 years, which was defined in cooperation with Westinghouse;
this study will be expanded to cover the period up to the year 2000 with
the help of the consultants hired by ISA. EEEB will have the study
executed by the same consultants to be engaged under the recently
approved Distribution Project.



-7-
(d) also under the aegis of San Carlos I, a study was carried out
by consultants to assess the extent and causes of losses in the
main power systems down to the level of distribution with the
objective of identifying and carrying out actions to minimize
such losses. The Bank has reviewed and commented upon this study,
and recommended that an action committee be set up, representing all
the shareholders, to prepare a work program. A second phase of the
study, which deals with meter errors, is underway; and
(e) as agreed under the San Carlos II loan, a study on a uniform
system of accounts and financial planning for the sector is
underway by consultants, with full-time participation by at
least one professional from ISA and each of its shareholders.
The results of this study are expected by June 30, 1981.
Present Developments
1.11      In recognition of the power sector's important role in Colombia's
development process, the Government and the main power companies established
in the mid-1970s a framework, the "Sochagota" Agreement, for orderly and
efficient sector expansion. To enable equitable sharing among the regions
of the financial burden of the large investments contemplated, to foster
least-cost development of high priority generating plants, and to assure
that adequate supply from these plants would reach all regions, the Agreement
envisaged that ISA would be responsible for planning, building and owning
all plants of national interest. Since then, ISA has functioned on this
basis. However, in 1979, the shareholders of ISA expressed reservations about
the concentration of almost 70% of planned expansion in generating facilities
through 1985 in the national company and the associated loss of parity among
themselves in relative generating capacity. Another worrisome aspect was
that ISA's construction capacity is nearly fully committed over the next few
years with works in progress (1,910 MW of hydro plant, numerous 230-kV lines
and a 500-kV line). These reservations have given rise to a proposal that the
four plants in ISA's 1984-88 Investment Program (Betania 500 MW, Guavio
1,000 MW, Playas 200 MW and Urra 1,050 MW) be constructed, owned and operated
by individual shareholders. Although these plants represent less than 1% of
the hydroelectric resources that Colombia will develop over the next 20 to 30
years, the Government and the Bank feel that a sound pattern of development
and use of the country's electric energy resources should be maintained. In
accordance with this, the Government and ISA's Board have confirmed that:
(a) as a long-term principle, ISA will own sufficient plants to
give it direct control of at least 33% of overall sector capa-
city and power. In line with this, plant ownership under the
expansion program subsequent to the current 1984-88 Program
(discussed below) will be allocated in a manner to ensure
that ISA will have this share. Moreover, ISA will acquire
and maintain ownership of all trunk transmission lines in
the interconnected system. These arrangements will assure
ISA a predominant role in directing sector development and
operation, while avoiding problems attendant upon overconcen-
tration of sector responsibilities in ISA;



(b) with respect to ownership of four hydro facilities in the
1984-88 Program, individual ISA shareholders would, subject
to presentation of viable financing plans (expected this month),
build and own the Guavio (1,000 MW), Betania (500 MW) and Playas
(200 MW) plants. The two Urra plants (310 MW and 740 MW respec-
tively) would be owned jointly by CORELCA and ISA. On this basis,
ISA's direct control of the interconnected system (currently about
20%) would increase to about 30% by 1988. As stated above, the
policy of 33% ownership will determine the allocation among ISA and
its shareholders of plants to be selected for the 1989-93 Expansion
Program and subsequent ones;
(c)  further, ISA will invest in the Guavio and Betania plants
in exchange for 40% of the capacity and energy of the former
and 50% of the latter, which ISA will sell to its other share-
holders under long-term contracts. These rights to plant output
represent an additional 6% of the national system, thus bringing
ISA's overall participation (direct ownership plus sharing in
Guavio and Betania investments) in the sector's generating capacity
to 35% by 1988; and
(d)  ISA, as the future national dispatch agency (facilities are
being constructed), will operate the interconnected systen
at minimum cost. This objective has been fully endorsed by
ISA's Board; the means by which it would be achieved would be
based upon the results of a dispatch study (under San Carlos II)
scheduled for completion by end-1981.
1.12      Another matter which has been under discussion has been the growth
in overdue accounts owed to ISA by its shareholders (except EPM) for capital
contributions and energy purchases. During the last two months, the Government
and the sector have taken actions designed to overcome this problem by year-end
for the entities involved (EEEB, CORELCA and ICEL) except for ICEL, which is
a holding company for 13 mostly rural-based local power companies (electri-
ficadoras). ICEL's capital contributions to ISA, which are normally paid by
the Government, have been brought up to date, but its electrificadoras' energy
accounts have not yet improved. The electrificadoras themselves have started
taking action to improve their finances, with some of them having increased
rates by 3.3% per month. Further, the National Social and Economic Council
(CONPES) has approved proposals formulated by NPD and ISA's Board, which would
eliminate the electrificadoras' arrears to ISA. Their financial debt would be
refinanced which, in turn, would free resources and allow them to pay their
overdue accounts to ISA. CONPES has also decided that a 15% surcharge would
be added to the electrificadoras' tariffs (as in the CORELCA system). Finally
CONPES has resolved that national budgetary funds earmarked for public entities
that did not settle their accounts with the power utilities would not receive
the amounts equivalent to their outstanding accounts. These amounts would
instead be used to cancel the arrears. These measures would overcome the
immediate financial problems. Ilith a view towards a long term solution, i.e.,
to become financially viable and operationally efficient, the electrificadoras
would need to be grouped into larger market companies. In line with this, the
Bank has been encouraging the Government and the sector to consider alternative



- 9 -
institutional arrangements for these small companies. In response, some ISA
shareholders have already begun to buy, or are contemplating buying ownership
of electrificadoras in geographic proximity to them. For example, Empresa de
Energia Electrica de Bogota has ratified a proposal to obtain, as a first
step, a 25% share of ownership of the Electrificadoras of Cundinamarca and
Meta, and EPM's Board is considering acquisition of the Electrificadoras of
Antioquia and Choco. In support of this development, which took place after
the Playas appraisal, the project includes funds for a study to be executed
by EPM as a first step, to assess the implications of doing so (4.17). The
Bank envisages continued support of this needed sectoral reorganization, and
future lending to the sector will include appropriate programs with this aim.
It should be recognized, however, that the reorganization will necessarily be
achieved only gradually over a period of years.
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.13      Since 1950, the Bank has made 24 loans to Golombia's power sector,
totalling US$894 million (Annex 1.1). In addition, the Bank is currently
supporting rural electrification under the Integrated Rural Development
Project (1532-CO, 1977).
1.14      Between 1973 and 1978 the Bank was unable to participate in sector
development through lending because of institutional and financial difficul-
ties.  The municipal utilities were reluctant to relinquish their independent
role in generation and also experienced severe financial constraints (because
of the Government's reluctance to press for rate increases under inflationary
conditionis) which reduced the availability of funds to ISA. Decisions on
system expansion required protracted negotiations among the shareholders and
the Government.  These negotiations were further complicated by the original
shareholders' reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA.
Because of the time required for resolution of these fundamental issues, Bank
consideration of San Carlos I, the 500-kV Interconnection and EEEB's Mesitas
hydroelectric project, all of them urgently needed to avoid power rationing
in Colombia (such rationing is currently in effect and expected to be intensi-
fied in 1981, assuming average hydrological conditions), suffered considerable
delays. Subsequently, six loans were made, three in 1978 (San Carlos I,
1582-CO; 500-kV Interconnection, 1583-CO; and Mesitas, 1628-CO), one in 1979
(San Carlos II, 1725-CO) and two in 1980 (Bogota Distribution, 1807-CO; and
Guadalupe IV Hydro Power Project, 1868-CO).
1.15      Overall Bank operations through 1970 have been reviewed by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in two reports 1/, which concluded
that Bank financing had been successful in assisting the power companies to
develop hydroelectric plants at lower unit cost than otherwise possible. This
permitted greater urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable electri-
city supply to industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in the establishment
of the central interconnected system which facilitated further power sector
1/   "lOperations Evaluation Report:  Electric Power" (Report No. Z-17, dated
March 10, 1972) and "Bank Operations in Colombia - An Evaluation" (Report
No. Z-18 dat'- MU.y [)q  ^

development. In addition, OED identified as important considerations for
possible future loans in the sector: the need to give greater attention to
improving power distribution, financial recording and financial planning
capabilities, and tariff structures.
1.16      OED additionally reviewed four individual projects 1/.  The most
recent report (575-CO/681-CO), which pertains to ISA, discusses the engineer-
ing, physical, financial and institutional difficulties encountered, partic-
ularly in connection with the Chivor Hydro Power Project, ISA's first generation
facility and the largest hydroelectric project undertaken in Colombia until
then. The appraisal estimates of ISA's operational and investment requirements
accounted for only about half of the funds that became necessary for these
purposes, mainly because there was no provision for price contingencies in
an inflationary environment. Because, at that time, ISA was so financially
dependent upon its shareholders, who themselves were experiencing severe cash
shortages, this resulted in severe financial difficulties for ISA. These
difficulties, together with the aforementioned reshaping of the shareholders'
roles in the sector, contributed to delays in the Chivor works. Nevertheless
both projects were successfully implemented and the report also concluded that
the experience gained under these projects has had a considerable impact on
the shaping of Bank policy for further lending in Colombia. Adequate provisic.
for price contingencies have been introduced; local financing is being secure"
through long-term financial commitments of the shareholders to ISA; and
improved financial planning was instituted by ISA and its shareholders, as
well as continuous monitoring of their financial performance.
1.17      Recent developments in the sector (1.10) indicate that a rea-
3onable balance between regional and national interest will be maintained,
crus providing a sound basis for continued Bank participation. Further
objectives are, in general: coordinated sector planning, efficient organ-
ization and operation, and sound financial management; within the general
scope of these objectives, specific attention in the short term should be
given to: least-cost operations, strengthening of the operating efficiency
and financial viability of the electrificadoras, rational urban and rural
distribution developments, enhancing financial recording and financial planning
capabilities and development of improved tariff structures and levels based on
common concepts throughout the country.
Power Market and Supply
1.18      In 1979 electricity requirements in Colombia totalled about 19.1
TWh. Electricity generation increased by an average of 9.5%/a over the period
1/   - Third Medellin Power Project - Loan 639-CO (1964; Report No. 450,
May 24, 1974).
- Third (EEEB) Power Expansion Program - Loan 537-CO (1968;
Report No. 536, June 29, 1977).
- Power Interconnection Project (1968) - Loan 575-CO; and Chivor
Hydroelectric Project (1970) - Loan 681-CO (Report No. 2720,
October 29, 1979).

1960-70 and about 9.9% on average over the period 1972-79. Per capita elec-
tricity generation in 1979 was about 735 kWh/a (assuming 25.2 million inhabi-
tants in 1979). Installed capacity at the end of 1978 was 3,930 MW, including
self-production. Hydro stations accounted for 69% of total electric energy
generation. The following table summarizes installed capacity and energy
generated in Colombia in 1978:

Public utilities accounted for 94% of total electricity supply; the rest
was provided by self-production. EEEB generated 18%, EPM 19%, CORELCA 14%,
CVC 12%, ICEL 13%, and ISA 18% of total supply. Self-suppliers (mainly oil
refineries, petro-chemical plants, steel mills and cement works) owned 6.2% of
the country's installed capacity; most of these plants are also connected to
the public electricity service. The public-service labor force totalled
13,445 at the end of 1977 when installed capacity was 3,552 MW, including
6,690 manual workers; the implied productivity is 2S2 kWieueployee and 162
subscribers/employee for that year.
1.19      In 1978, Colombia had about 2.3 million electricity subscribers
with an average of 7 beneficiaries per subscriber in an estimated total
population of 26.7 million; 88% of these subscribers were residential, and
electricity service reached 62% of the population. Studies by the Bank's
Development Policy Staff indicate that Colombia has been able to provide
electricity service to a very high proportion of its urban population (with
the connection rate exceeding 90% in the larger cities). However, only 36% of
the families in small towns (500-2,500 inhabitants) and 16% of other rural
families had service in 1976. Of the electrified municipalities, about 90%
have continuous service, while the remaining have service only during certain
hours of the day. In many towns the quality of the service is unsatisfactory
because of lack of funds, which results in poor maintenance (and large arrears
in payments to the supply companies).
1.20      Residential consumers were responsible for the largest share of
electricity sales by the public utilities in 1979, followed by industry:

During 1972-79 gross production of electricity increased at an annual average
rate of about 9.6% compared with a GNP growth rate of 5.7%. Growth of sales,
which averaged 9.3%/a, ranged from 7.7%/a for the EPM system to 12% for
ICEL's system EMP's historical growth is shown in paragraph 3.02.
Interconnected System Forecasts
1.22      Demand and Energy.  Projected 1980-90 demand and gross energy
requirements are based on ISA and its stareholders' analysis of past con-
sump.ion and on a study of the correlation between power sector growth and
growth of GNP. Gross energy requirements in the interconnected system are
expected to increase at an average annual rate of about 11.3%.

Rural Electrification
1.24      About 36% of the population lives in areas classified as rural.
Although most of the rural villages with electricity service are close to the
urban centers, connection density is modest (1.19). The lack of comprehensive
data with respect to ongoing and expected rural electrification efforts is
expected to be remedied through preparation of the Master Plan (1.10).
1.25      Nevertheless, substantial rural electrification programs are currently
underway in a number of regions in the country. Among the most important are:
(a) the ongoing electrification subproject of an Integrated Rural
Development Program supported by IDB, Canadian International
Development Agency and Bank financing (Loan 1352-CO) through
which an estimated 15,000 rural families will acquire electricity
service;
(b) the electrification program in the department of Choco, financed
by the Netherlands Government;
(c) the electrification program in the coffee-growing areas, financed
by coffee sector resources;



- 14 -
(d) a recently approved IDB rural electrification project for ICEL,
which will provide service to about 130,000 households by 1982; and
(e) finally, CORELCA has prepared a village electrification program
covering the North Atlantic region for which a proposed Bank
loan is under consideration.
Sector Investment Program and Studies
1.26      The total 1978-85 investment program of ISA and its shareholders
(except for ICEL for which reliable information is not available), excluding
interest during construction, was estimated in mid-1979 to amount to about
Col$340 billion in current prices (about US$4.2 billion in mid-1979 prices),
with a foreign component of about 60%. Some 70-75% of total investments would
pertain to generation, which is extremely high (a range of some 40-60% would
be the norm). Because the new generating capacity would be of little use
without a network path to the consumers, increases in investments for sub-
transmission and distribution can be expected and it is therefore probable
that the estimated cost of Col$340 billion is understated. The Master Plan
for power development being prepared by ISA and its shareholders (1.10) is
expected to provide a basis for firmer total investment estimates.
1.27      The introduction of large thermal plants later in the century is
expected to play an important role in ISA's planning for the sector in the
next few years (lead time for mine development and power station construction
may aggregate some 10 years). Even the large hydro potential of some 93 GW
(1.01) would be completely utilized by about year 2020 and the use of the
country's large coal reserves for firing thermal plants may become more
economic than hydro before that time. The Government is aware of this
scenario 1/, and the Government agencies involved, together with the Bank,
are addressing it. The use of coal for thermal plant firing and the substi-
tution of coal for gas and oil would be the primary objectives.
1.28      The generation investment program is imposing a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects are
undertaken, assurances were obtained under the San Carlos loans that, except
for plants in the agreed National Expansion Program, ISA and its shareholders
would not undertake construction of any generating plants of more than 200 MW
(ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders) capacity prior to completion of San Carlos
unless satisfactory evidence has been presented to the Bank that it is eco-
nomically justified and that adequate financing is available to carry it out,
as well as to meet other financial obligations.
Finances and Tariffs
1.29      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM operate low-cost
1/   Disponibilidad de capacidad hidroelectrica y su influencia en la
generacion termica en el futuro (DNP, noviembre 1978).



- 15 -
systems and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have, there-
fore, been able to finance their investments with an appropriate balance
of borrowings and cash generation while charging relatively low rates.
CVC, previously dependent in part upon Government transfers, has strengthened
its financial position considerably in recent years. Because there has been
no mechanism to obtain financial transfers within the sector from the more
affluent areas to the less affluent, ICEL and CORELCA, which operate high-cost
systems in lower income areas than EEEB and EPM, have had to rely on budgetary
contributions from the Government and fuel subsidies. In recent years,
however, the opportunity of sharing in low-cost investments through ISA has
provided an indirect transfer mechanism. In future, the re-structuring of
ICEL and the interconnection of CORELCA with the central system are expected
to strengthen further the sector's overall financial capability.
1.30      Between 1971 and 1974 rate adjustments lagged considerably behind
yearly inflation. The developments were the following:

1/  For the relevant information on EPM, see paragraph 2.13.
2/   On the basis of the consumer price index.
The positive trend in rate setting which began in 1977 is expected to continue
as a result of the agreements reached under the San Carlos I and II, Mesitas
and the Bogota Distribution loans and under Guadalupe IV and the proposed loan
to EPM. In view of the importance to economic growth of adequate electricity
service, the Government has adopted a policy calling for adequate rates in
order to ensure that the sector generates internally a reasonable portion of
the funds required.
1.31      In view of the considerable imbalances that exist in the structure
of tariffs and rates in the power sector, the Government and ISA's shareholders,
under San Carlos I (Loan 1582-CO), are executing a country-wide tariff study
with a view toward assessing the cost of supply to each consumer category
(1.10). The study has suffered delays because of the time necessary for the
Colombians, who are carrying out the study, to become familiar with the
principles of marginal costing. On the basis of preliminary findings, a



- 16 -
successful seminar on electricity pricing in Latin America (75 participants
representing 21 countries and 3 international institutions) was held in
Medellin in October/November 1979 and a follow-up seminar in Brazil in July
1980, both under the aegis of the Bank. Preliminary draft reports are avail-
able and are being reviewed in the Bank for further discussion and finalization
of the report during 1981.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.32      In the past, the large number of entities associated with the
power sector, the lack of adequate regulation, coordination and planning at
the national level and low electricity rates constrained the sector's ability
to make rational use of Colombia's abundant hydroelectric resources. The
regionalized nature of the sector, reflecting the political and economic
decentralization of Colombia, engendered difficulties in coordinating invest-
ment allocation; decisions were made on a local basis without due regard to
overall country planning for power development. This situation, together with
the lack of funds, resulted in recurring power shortages. The most recent
developments (1.11) highlight the difficulties of effecting basic changes in a
strong historical pattern in response to the requirements of an increasingly
sophisticated and rapidly developing economic situation.
1.33      The successful long-term execution of Colombia's power development
is contingent upon the availability of sufficient cash generation by the
individual entities and domestic and external sources of financing. Detailed
discussions on this subject are the focus of considerable Government attention
at this time, particularly in relation to ICEL's financial situation (1.12).
Earlier this year, the Government reestablished the Electricity Development
Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo Electrico, FDE) in order to overcome the constraint
on investments represented by the insufficient availability of local commercial
financing. This Fund has been made available to the utilities on the condition
that their financial obligations to ISA are duly attended to. Furthermore, in
view of the high priority the Government attached to planned power investments,
authorization for significant foreign borrowings to be monetized was given,
even though Government policy normally precludes this. Moreover, the Government
is in the process of establishing of permanent financing facility for the sector;
funding for this facility is to come from the Government, the power companies
and public bond issues.
1.34      The Government has recently taken a number of positive measures
to address the sector's institutional constraints. In 1975, it eliminated
the jurisdictional overlap between ICEL and CORELCA on the Atlantic Coast by
transferring control over the electricity distribution companies in that
region to CORELCA. Another positive measure was the reorientation of ICEL,
which basically is responsible for electricity development in rural and
semi-rural areas, where the Government has been subsidizing the service
since ICEL cannot be financially self-supporting in those areas. Currently
under study by the Government are proposals to restructure the entity (1.12)
and to improve tariff authorization procedures (so that, for example, local



- 17 -
companies that buy power in bulk will automatically be empowered to charge
rates sufficient to cover such purchases as well as to attend to other finan-
cial obligations). CONPES has recently approved the establishment of a
surcharge on power consumption by the electrificadoras in order to reduce the
substantial national budgetary transfers to the ICEL affiliates (similar to
the system used in the CORELCA group). In addition, ICEL has been assigned
primary responsibility for monitoring the adequacy of tariff levels in these
companies, and for requesting the necessary authorization from JNT for
tariff increases.
1.35      With the addition of CORELCA as an ISA shareholder, most of the
sector is represented directly or indirectly in ISA's Board, and coordination
of power sector planning in Colombia has improved. ISA's effectiveness in
maintaining this coordination, however, will depend on its ability to sustain
a sound consensus among its shareholders.

2. THE BORROWER
General
2.01      In 1955 the Government of Colombia authorized the municipality of
Medellin to organize Medellin's municipal services as administratively autono-
mous units, with the objective of providing energy, telephone, water and
sewerage services to Medellin and to other municipalities which requested
such provision from Medellin. By Municipal Order No. 58 of 1955, Empresas
Publicas de Medellin (EPM) was established and assets related to the afore-
mentioned public services were transferred from the municipality to EPM. The
three branches of EPM are operated as financially independent departments with
separate accounts. EPM operates power facilities in Antioquia, and provides
electricity service to Medellin and to numerous other adjacent urban and rural
areas under the jurisdiction of their respective municipalities and to the
Electrificadora de Antioquia, an ICEL subsidiary, in the remaining territory
of the province.
Previous Bank Lending
2.02      The Bank has made 5 loans, totalling MUS$260, to EPM for generation
(250-CO in 1959, 282-CO in 1961, 369-CO in 1964, 874-CO in 1973 and 1868-CO
in 1980), four of which assisted in financing about two-thirds of EPM's
generating capacity of 979 MW. The fourth loan helped to finance the expansion
of the Guatape hydro facilities, which raised the dam of the Santa Rita
reservoir (to increase EPM's generation and also to allow optimum design of
the downstream San Carlos hydro plant) and added 4 units to the Guatape I
power station (financed by Loan 369-CO). The Guatape II project was delayed
by about 2 years due to resettlement problems of the village of El Penol,
geological difficulties in tunnelling, welding problems in the penstock lining
and design problems in the turbine and generators. All of these problems were
resolved and the plant has been commissioned satisfactorily. The fifth loan
will help EPM expand its capacity by a further 213 MW in 1984. In early 1980,
the Bank also extended a loan (MUS$44) to EPM for part of its telecommunica-
tions expansion and improvement program.
Organization
2.03      EPM is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors appointed at
the same time for a renewable term of 2 years, with the Mayor of Medellin as
Chairman. A ruling was passed on October 31, 1979, by the Consejo del
Estado, that the Mayor of Medellin (rather than the Mayor and the Municipal
Council) has the authority to appoint and dismiss, without limitation as to
his prerogatives of doing so, all Board members of municipal entities, in-
cluding EPM. The ruling became effective in March 1980, and the Mayor is
expected to proceed to select new Board members before the term of the present
members expires. Prior to this change, the municipality dominated EPM's
Board, and voting in this Board on decisions already taken in the Municipal
Council was a mere formality. This led to some actions which appear not to
have been in the best interests of EPM; however, appropriate safe-guards have
been incorporated into Loan 1868-CO which would be repeated under this



- 19 -
loan. The loan agreement for 1868-CO provides also that a change in EPM's
statutes or new legislation adopted by the Municipal Council which would
adversely affect the management and operations of EPM would be an event of
default; this covenant, too, has been repeated for the proposed loan.
2.04      The General Manager, who is appointed by the Board and has a term
renewable each year, is responsible for EPM's day-to-day management. He
oversees directly the work of (a) the four managers responsible for technical
matters, operations, finance and adminstration; (b) the secretary general in
charge of legal affairs and archives; and (c) the planning director in charge
of planning and coordination. Below the level of the managers, the organiza-
tion is, to the extent possible, separated administratively into EMP's 3
branches of service: Water and Sewerage, Telephone, and Power. Each branch
works fairly independently of the others, and separate financial statements
are prepared. EPM's Board of Directors receives a consolidated financial
statement for all of EPM's services. EPM's organizational chart is shown in
Annex 2.1.
2.05      The organizational arrangements for the power branch are generally
satisfactory, except that the financial responsibilities of the Planning
Construction and Supervision Divisions appear to be too limited. This is in
part due to computerization in the Financial Department of cost accounting
and financial forecasts, which tends to shift some financial responsibilities
from the engineer to the accountant. EPM is aware of the problem and is
studying methods to redefine responsibilities more efficiently.
Personnel
2.06      EPM, as of May 1980, had 4,120 employees of which 1,950 pertain to
power. Personnel working directly for power numbered 1,040 (79 in planning
and design, 60 in power station construction, 535 in power stations and
substation operation, 366 in distribution). In addition, about 900 employees
can be assumed to work principally for power in finance, administration and
general services. By the end of 1979, EPM had a generating capacity of 1,059
MW (including Guatape II and rights in ISA), its own plant generating some
3,974 GWh for about 282,446 consumers of electricity; the power station
personnel ratio, therefore, is about 2 MW/employee, the overall staff produc-
tion ratio is 2.15 GWh/employee and there are 6.5 employees for 1,000 connec-
tions, which is considered reasonable. Turnover also appears reasonable; in
the first 11 months of 1979, 348 people terminated employment, including 27
who retired on pension; on this basis average employment is about 10 years per
person. The pay scales are the most attractive in the sector and range from
Col$7,000-8,000/m (US$166-190/m) for the lowest graded workers to Col$16,000-
37,000/m (US$380-880/m) for professionals, to which almost 3 months in pay is
added in fringe benefits. This does not take into account EMP's contributions
toward the retirement plan. The forecast increase in personnel directly
employed in power through the 1980s is estimated at some 300, of which about
130 would be required for plant operation (Guadalupe IV, Playas) and the
remaining for transmission and distribution and general power services. The
overall manpower efficiency for EPM's power services is expected to remain
about equal to the present figures.



- 20 -
2.07      EPM has a stable and capable leadership under the present General
Manager who has held this position for six years. The company's engineering
and planning staff is well qualified and competent, and has considerable
experience in project management and operation. This would enable EPM to
manage and operate efficiently the considerable expansion of power facilities
during 1980s, including the project.  EPM's management and financial staff
is also generally well qualified and capable.
Training
2.08      EPM is constructing a new training center for all of its administra-
tive and operational personnel. Building construction is well advanced and
the center is expected to be in operation by end-1981.  Regular courses will
be given to train new staff and existing staff will receive refresher courses.
At present, EPM trains existing and new plant maintenance staff.  The 1979
training program provided about 60 hours of instruction to each of the 950
participants. The company's training arrangements are satisfactory. However,
EPM's professional staff requires some post-graduate work in highly specialized
areas, for which assistance was included under 1868-CO.
Accounting and Auditing
2.09      EPM has an accrual accounting system which is appropriate and,
until 1979, tabulations and reporting were carried out with only minor defi-
ciencies through the aid of a small computer. The installation of a Burrough
6800 in early 1980 has enabled EPM to improve considerably the effectiveness
of its accounting and reporting systems. Monthly financial statements and
budget reports are available promptly and, apart from minor inconsistencies
expected to be eliminated as a result of the ongoing sector study to identify
a uniform system of accounts (1.10), contain the information necessary for
management review. Inventory management and control procedures are currently
being reviewed with the aim of introducing improvements recommended by EPM's
auditors by end-1980. EPM's internal audit is also adequate. The auditor,
appointed by the Municipal Council of Medellin, reports directly to EPM's
Board and the Municipality; the annual internal audit report is issued within
three months after the end of the fiscal year. In accordance with agreements
reached under Loans 874-CO (Guatape II) and 1868-CO, EPM engages independent
external auditors acceptable to the Bank for all its operations, and their
reports have been satisfactory. The existing covenant related to accounting
and auditing, including the requirement to submit the audited accounts and the
auditors' report to the Bank not later than 5 months after end of each fiscal
year, has been repeated under the proposed loan.
Billing and Collections
2.10      EPM's billing and collection procedures are satisfactory.  Billing
is computerized and subscribers are billed monthly. Bills become due about
10 days after being received by the subscriber. While a consolidated bill
for water and sewerage, electricity and telephone services is prepared, the
charge for each service is shown separately. If the subscriber does not
settle the account within three months, all utility services to the subscriber
are disconnected. As a result of this rigid disconnection policy, the level
of outstanding and overdue accounts is generally low (5.05).



- 21 -
Insurance
2.11      EPM has recently made arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for
adequate insurance of its power assets. The company also plans to seek expert
advice on the insurance of large civil works under construction in relation to
the Guadalupe IV and Playas projects. The existing insurance covenant has
been repeated for the proposed loan.
Tariffs and Rates
2.12      EPM historic costs, particularly capital costs, have been low and,
as a result, its average rate is one of the lowest in the country, if not in
the world: 82.3 centavos/kWh (USi1.93/kWh) average during 1979. Nevertheless,
revenues were sufficient to enable EPM to exceed the rates of return on
revalued assets of 7% in 1978 and 6% in 1979 covenanted under the San Carlos
loans. EPM's 1980 return is expected to be 8% (5.05).
2.13      EPM's tariff structure became seriously imbalanced since 1973, with
residential and block rates (to other municipalities and the ICEL subsidiary)
significantly lower than industrial and commercial rates. Over recent years,
this gap has been widening as can be illustrated by comparing average 1973 and
1979 rates, expressed in USJ per kWh, after inflating 1973 average rates by
the cost of living index (using 1973 as a base) and using the average 1979
rate of exchange:
Average Rate Per kWh            Increase
1973             1979          (Decrease)
US$ c/kWh                     %
Residential                        1.61             1.46             (9.3)
Commercial                         2.76             4.17             51.1
Industry                           1.86             2.78             49.5
Block                              0.95             0.84            (11.6)
Other 1/                           0.95             1.42             49.5
Total                              1.69             1.93             14.2
1/   Together representing about 3.5% of revenue and some 5% of sales.
While the cost of supply in low voltage networks, (i.e. largely for supply
to households) in general exceeds the cost of supply in the high voltage
networks (i.e. to most industrial consumers), industry paid about 16% more
than residential consumers in 1973, but 90% more in 1979. Residential rates,
in real terms, decreased by 9%, while industrial rates increased by 50%.



- 22 -
2.14      The ongoing tariff study under San Carlos I (1.10) is expected to
identify for the main supply centers in Colombia, the marginal cost of supply
to the major categories of consumers at the various points of supply and in
time of the season, week and day. This study is expected to assist the sector
and the Government in coming to grips with the problem of unbalanced tariff
structures and seeking corrective actions through gradual adjustments.
Although the study has suffered delays, it is expected to be completed during
1981. Awaiting the outcome of the study, EEEB agreed (Loan 1807-C0) to
prepare and institute an interim program which would gradually adjust rates
during a two year period by apportioning future rate increases among the major
categories of consumers in such a way as to reduce gradually the imbalance;
recently enacted tariff increases in EEEB were allocated among the major
consumer categories in line with this agreement. Likewise under 1868-CO, EPM
agreed to prepare by March 31, 1981, a program, satisfactory to the Bank, of
gradual revisions of its tariff structure and rates for its power services,
taking into account the conclusions of the ongoing tariff study, and to put
the program into effect by May 31, 1981. In the event, however, that EPM
would be unable to prepare such a program because of possible further delays
in completing the tariff study, it agreed to prepare by March 31, 1981,
an interim program, satisfactory to the Bank, covering the period from Mav 31,
1981 through May 31, 1983, for the same purpose as the above program and to
institute the interim program by May 31, 1981. When the tariff study becomes
available, EPM would then prepare a full program in place of the interim
program. The rate structure adjustments would take into account the social
welfare policies of the Government regarding the lowest income consumers, as
well as EPM's investment needs.

3. EPM'S MARKET
Supply Area, Access to Electricity
3.01      EPM's statutory service area is the municipality of Medellin.
However, service can be given under separate contracts to any area in the
Department of Antioquia. Accordingly, EPM supplies directly 15 small muni-
cipalities (i.e., it owns the networks in the villages and bills for the
service), sells in block to 10 other municipalities having their own distri-
bution services, and sells indirectly (through supply to the Electrificadora
de Antioquia, an ICEL subsidiary) to 73 municipalities. Thus, of the 116
municipalities in the province, 98--or about 85%--are directly or indirectly
supplied with electricity by EPM. The total population of Antioquia is
estimated at 3.9 million, of which an estimated 2.3 million--or 60%--have
access to electricity. EPM supplies directly to about 280,000 (1979) consumers
of which about 90% are residential. The Electrificadora de Antioquia has
about 100,000 consumers. Antioquia accounted for about 22% of national gross
electric energy requirements in 1977/78.
Market Development
3.02      Historic.  The 1975-79 consumption and supply data are shown in
Annex 3.1, including the energy EPM purchased from and supplied to ISA.
EPM's consumer data for 1968, 1975 and 1979 is the following:

- 24 -
The major change in the consumers' share of the market over the 11-year
period was in the block sales to municipalities and the electrificadora,
which increased an average of 21.1%/a and accounted for 5% of sales in
1968 and 15% in 1979. Excluding this supply from the comparison indicates
that the consumption pattern for the other classes of consumers decreased
fractionally for residential consumers and commensurately increased for
commerce and industry, i.e., the overall pattern remained about the same.
The residential consumers showed the lowest growth rate, which is surprising
(saturation is not apparent, since 1970 consumption per residential connec-
tion increased from 419 kWh/m by about 1.1%/a to 461 kWh/m and the number of
consumers rose by 6.4%/a) in view of the fact that the rates for these consum-
ers are very low, US¢1.46/kWh in 1979 at the then current average rate of
exchange. The rapid increase in block supply may in part be due to the
extremely low rate charged by EPM for this service, in 1979 amounting to
USVO.84/kWh equivalent.  Overall growth in sales during the period was 9.3%/a,
but it should be noted that average growth was considerably lower during the
last four years (7.7%/a) than the previous 7 years (10.3%/a).  Growth of total
energy requirements and maximum demand was substantially lower due to the
decrease in losses from 28% in 1968 to 18% in 1979.  Losses, however, are
still relatively high for EPM's 100% hydro system (unaccounted losses including
thefts, are probably in the order of 7%).  This problem is presently being
studied throughout the sector (1.10) and remedial action is expected to be
instituted as a result. Gross per capita consumption in EPM's supply area
in 1979 was in the order of 1,000 kWh, probably the highest area consumption
in the country (in Bogota, annual per capita consumption is in the order of
850 kWh).
3.03      Captive Plant.  The total installed self generating capacity in
factories in Antioquia is about 70 MW, or 10% of EPM's installed capacity.
About 35 MW pertains to two large textile factories, 18 MWI to two cement
plants, 13 MW to a mining company and the remainder to various small factories.
Only one of the cement plants and the mining company are not connected to
EPM's supply facilities. Supply figures (i.e., GWh. for self-use) are not
available.
3.04      Forecasts.  EPM's sales are expected to grow at an average of
8.7%/a over 1979-88 and gross energy requirements in its system by 8.3%/a
(Annex 3.1). This forecast was prepared essentially on the basis of historic
trends. EPM uses simple exponential models for both energy consumption (for
the various consumer categories and totals) and demand, deriving trend curves
for forecasting requirements. Because the historic results compared with
forecasts made with these simple models were generally in agreement, EPf did
not study alternative models (however, ISA is presently studying the appli-
cability of socio-economic multi-regression models throughout the sector).
The present forecasts are considered adequate. The following table summarizes
the results:



Annual
1979       1984         1988   Growth

Maximum EPM demand (MW)    745        1,135       1,547
3.05      The consumption pattern would remain substantially the same,
with residential and industrial sales declining commensurately with any
increases in block supplies (i.e., to areas outside Medellin) which would
continue to increase its share and constitute, by 1988, about one-fourth of
EPM's market, reflecting the increasing electrification in the rural areas.
(-rowth rates for the various categories, although on average slightly lower,
are substantially in agreement with the growth rates since 1975. The decrease
for block supplies from 19.6% during 1975-79 to 15.4% during 1979-88, appears
appropriate in the light of the necessity to adjust the block charges together
with all other rates in the near future (2.14). It appears possible (dis-
cussions are underway) that EPM will take over several networks from independ-
ent municipalities and bill consumers directly because these municipalities
are unable to maintain or improve the networks and to pay EPM for the supply.
The number of EPM consumers is expected to increase by about 4%/a to about
390,000 by 1988. Total energy requirements would grow less than sales in view
of the expected lower losses due to the actions to be taken against thefts
(3.02). The load factor is expected to remain about 60% during the period.



- 26 -
3.06      The generation forecast has been based on the average water
availability in the rivers on which EPM's plants are located. Additionally,
by investing in ISA plants (Chivor, San Carlos, Jaguas), EPM has obtained
rights to a portion of the generation capabilities and capacities of these
plants. The energy rights are shown in the above table, together with the
average surplus that could be generated by EPM plants. The total surplus
would be available in the interconnected system for sales to other share-
holders. For purposes of revenue forecasts, EPM, on the basis of a simulation
study prepared by ISA, has made assumptions for the portion of the energy and
commensurate capacity surplus that, on average, is expected to be purchased
from and sold to the interconnected system as firm and secondary energy during
the period to other shareholders which cannot meet their own requirements and
depend on ISA and its other shareholders having surpluses (presently only
EPM).

4.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      EPM's 1980-88 power development program has been designed to meet
gross energy requirements, expected to grow at 8.3% from 3,974 GWh in 1979
to 8,130 GWh in 1988 (3.04); the number of consumers would increase from
about 270,000 in 1979 to about 390,000 in 1988, at an annual growth rate
of 4% (3.05). The expansion pertains mainly to the urban area of Medellin
and the Aburra valley in which this city is located. Modest expansion is
planned in the remaining area of the province of Antioquia (largely the
supply area of the Electrificadora de Antioquia, an ICEL subsidiary), mainly
in transmission lines and substations. EPM also assists the Electrificadora
by constructing some distribution networks which, upon completion, are trans-
ferred to the Electrificadora as an equity contribution, for which it obtains
shares in the company.
4.02      EPM's 1980-88 development program (Annex 4.1), excluding contribu-
tions to ISA and interest during construction, is estimated to cost MUS$888 at
current prices, with a foreign component of MUS$493 (56%). Its main components
are:
(a)  ongoing works in generation, i.e., the almost completed Guatape
II hydro plant (Loan 874-CO), a small hydro plant (19 MW) at
Ayura, the diversion of three small rivers to the Troneras reservoir
which supplies the Troneras, Guadalupe I-III and future Guadalupe IV
(Loan 1868-CO) plants; and the Playas hydro plant to be financed by
the proposed loan;
(b)  some ongoing works in transmission and substations and a
substantial expansion program to be financed by EPM, from a
recently obtained loan of MUS$32 from the Bank of America and by
the 1868-CO loan; and
(c)  future expansion, as yet undefined, in generating plants and
networks (constituting about 23% of total cost of the 1981-88
program).
The Project
4.03      Background.  The medium-term sector expansion and financing program
assumed, until recently, that IDB would finance the Playas project. However,
the Government and EPM proposed that the Bank participate in the financing,
thus continuing a trend that developed in connection with the San Carlos
project, when both institutions closely coordinated their financing, technical
and institutional objectives. Because of the experience gained, for the first
time in Colombian projects, a combined rather than parallel effort was made
and a joint appraisal mission visited the country in September/October 1980.
The mission comprised five IDB staff and an IBRD financial analyst, while
supervision was provided by the respective Division Chiefs during the critical
stage of the mission. Thus, the technical part of this report reflects the
IDB input in this respect and the financial part, the IBRD input. Both
institutions have reviewed the resulting documents and adapted them to take
account of the presentation requirement of each institution.



- 28 -
4.04      Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to continue to
assist EPM to meet incremental power requirements in the rapidly expanding
urban area of Medellin and the province of Antioquia, while supplying
excess energy, expected to be available for several years, to the inter-
connected system. This would assist in making hydro-based energy available
to the North Atlantic coast (once the interconnection is completed) which now
depends entirely on costly thermal generation. The project would also encourage
EPM to assist in the restructuring of ICEL by taking steps precedent to
absorbing ICEL subsidiaries in geographic proximity to EPM. Additionally the
objective would be to maintain EPM rates needed to ensure sufficient internal
cash generation for investment.
4.05      Description.  The project has two main components:  the Playas
hydro plant and consulting services.
(a) The Playas hydro plant. The plant, the construction cost of which
is estimated at about MUS$311 (US$1,500/kW) at current prices,
would be located 16 km upstream from the San Carlos station on the
Guatape river, and downstream from the points where the Nare river
is diverted through EPM's existing Guatape plant (Loans 369-CO and
874-CO) and ISA's Jaguas plant under construction (assisted by IDB
financing). It constitutes an essential link in the Nare, Guatape,
Samana river development as shown in Annex 4.2. It would operate
under a gross head of 190 m and generate an average of 1,450 GWh/a.
The main works would be as follows:
-    infrastructure, including 40 km of roads to replace roads to be
inundated, 4 km of access roads, a bridge over the Guatape river
and a two-lane, concrete-paved access tunnel to the underground
power station, 475 m long and with a cross section of 44 m2;
-    a reservoir with a storage capacity of about 85 Mm3 of which
47 Mm3 live, and a surface area of about 1,000 ha;
-    a compacted earth and rockfill dam with a volume of about
19 Mm3, 65 m high and a crestlength of 456 m at elevation
985 m, with a concrete spillway on the right embankment adjacent
to the dam, 280 m long with an ungated opening 60 m wide,
dimensioned for a discharge of 2,800 m3/s;
-    a concrete-lined diversion tunnel about 1 km long and dimensioned
for a maximum of 1,572 m3/s (25 year flood) together with a
diversion dam which would later be incorporated in the main dam;
about 700 m of the diversion tunnel would be used as part of the
main power tunnel and as a bypass for shedding waters (80 m3/s)
in the event Playas has to be taken out of operation;



- 29 -
an intake of the morning-glory type leading into the diversion/
power tunnel in which the main sliding gates are located about 600 m
from the intake in a circular well in the 82 m overburden; about
100 m downstream from this point, the power tunnel would continue in
a 70 m deep well and a concrete-lined tunnel of about 3,600 m (both
with a diameter of 6.4 m), ending in a 90 m long steel lined tunnel
and the distributor to the turbines. A 230 m high surge tank of
the restricted orifice type would be located at the transition point;
three caverns: one for the turbine-generators, 55.5 m long and
with a cross section of 630 m2; one for the transformers in the
axis of the turbine-generators cavern, 65.5 m long and a cross
section of 195 m2; and one tailrace surge tank 40 m long and a
cross section of 468 mi2;
a tailrace tunnel, 500 m long (8.8 m diameter) and a discharge
channel 450 m long;
three vertical-shaft 67 MW Francis turbines, 360 rpm, directly
coupled to 60 Hz generators, rated 77 MVA at 13.8 kV;
three 3-phase banks of single-phase step-up transformers, each
29.3 MVA (230 V secondary voltage), and one reserve transformer;
and
a substation and control building adjacent to the entrance of the
access tunnel; 230-kV oil-insulated cables would connect the power
station to the substation.
(b) Consulting services. Consulting services would be provided for
the final design, engineering and supervision of the works, a Board
of Consultants for general assistance and supervision of the works,
preparation of the terms of reference for a study for environmental
protection of the basin, a study to help minimize the cost of power
curtailments in the EPM system (paras. 1.14 and 4.18), and a study
to define the steps necessary to absorb the Electrificadoras of
Antioquia and Choco into the EPM system and a related plan of
action.
4.06      Transmission.  The Playas 230-kV substation would be located at a
distance of only 1 km from the Guatape-San Carlos line under construction (Loan
1583-CO), to which it will be connected by EPM by means of a double circuit
transmission line, using available equipment and materials, assumed to be in
stock by that time. At a later date the substation is also expected to be
connected to the San Carlos-Ancon Sur (Medellin) line, construction of which
has not yet started (Loan 1725-CO). The recent loan for EPM's Guadalupe
IV hydro station (1868-CO) would finance EPM's dispatch center in Medellin
as an integral control component in ISA's national dispatch system.

Project Cost
4.07      The total cost of the project, excluding interest during construction
is estimated at MUS$311 (about US$1,500/kW), with a foreign component of
MUS$177, equivalent to about 57% of project cost. Project costs, which are
shown in detail in Annex 4.3, are summarized as follows:
Local  Foreign  Total    Local  Foreign  Total
--    MCol$      ----    --------MUS$---------
Infrastructure                   619       218    837    14.0      5.0      19.0

Total Project Cost            10,414   13,919 24,333   134.6   176.8    311.4
4.08      The estimated costs are based on December 1979 prices following
from recent contracts and offers for hydro stations in the vicinity (San
Carlos, Jaguas) and elsewhere in the country, the results of the geological
surveys made, and the opinion and recommendation of an IDB-financed consultant
who assessed the readiness of the project for execution (4.13). The project
cost is considered reasonable. EPM is exempt from custom duties on imported
goods. The physical contingencies correspond to the risks intrinsic to the
various project components. In view of the status of final design (4.10), the
physical contingencies for local construction cost average about 15%, reflecting a
spread between about 10% for well defined surface works and 20% for-major underground
works. A contingency of 20% of base local cost and of 15% of foreign cost was
assumed for equipment. At the time of appraisal, the installed capacity of
240 MW was decreased to 200 MW (4.12) and, in consultation between EPM, ISA,
IDB and the Bank, it was considered prudent to increase the physical contin-
gency to 15% in view of the necessary design changes. A price contingency
has been added as follows: local cost inflation was assumed to range from
25% in 1980 to 14% in 1986 and subsequent years; foreign cost 10.5% in 1980,
9% in 1981, 8% in 1982, 7% through 1985 and 6% thereafter.

4.09      Financing.  To take account of the different procurement arrange-
ments of IDB and IBRD, proposed financing by both institutions would be along
physical lines that allow separate bid documents. A Bank loan of MUS$85 is
proposed, representing about 48% of the foreign construction cost of the
project (MUS$177), parallel to an IDB loan of MUS$85 which includes MUS$4.0
million oJ local cost financing and MUS$14 for financing interest during
construction on the loan, i.e., IDB would finance about 38% of the foreign
construction cost of the project. Suppliers' credits and commercial borrowing
would cover the remaining foreign cost. The financing plan of the foreign
construction cost would be the following:
MUS$
IBRD (MUS$85)  River diversion and dam                     57.2
Hydro, mechanical, electrical equipment  17.6
Consultants                                10.2
IDB  (MUS$67)  Underground works                           66.6
Consultants                                 0.4
Suppliers
(MUS$21)  Turbines and Generators                     21.0
EPM (MUS$3.8)  Commercial borrowings                         3.8
Total foreign construction cost            176.8
EPM would finance the local cost (MUS$130.6), excluding IDB financing, from
its own resources, mainly internally generated funds. Interest during construc-
tion, amounting to an estimated US$35 million, would be financed by commercial
borrowings, except for the US$14 million financed by IDB. Thus of the total
foreign element related to the investment, the proposed Bank loan represents
40%, IDB 38%, and external commercial sources (suppliers and banks) 22%.
Engineering, Studies, Training
4.10      Playas Engineering.  The hydro plant was first identified in 1964 in
the general development study for the Nare, Guatape and Samana Rivers.
The feasibility studies were completed in 1973 (general basin development)
and in 1976 (San Carlos) by Integral Ltd. (Colombia). In February 1979
ISA engaged the services (subsequently transferred to EPM) of Servicios de
Ingenieria de Consulta Ltda. (SEDIC) of Colombia for executing complementary
surveys and studies for Playas, the final feasibility study and all subsequent
services through completion of the project.
4.11      The consultants have largely completed the additional surveys, and
updated accordingly the preliminary design drawings. Final drawings and
preparation of bid documents is estimated to have advanced an average of
about 35% and the following program has been defined for the completion of
bid documents:

Target Date      Estimated %
for         completion
Activity                                  Completion   as of December 1980
Village, camps (EPM)                             12-1980            100
Roads (EPM); access tunnel (IDB)                  2-1981             20
River diversion (IBRD)                            5-1981             15
Dam and spillway (IBRD)                          10-1981             20
Underground works, substation (IDB)              10-1981             30
Turbines and generators (Suppliers)               5-1981             70
Gates, valves (IBRD)                              7-1981             40
4.12      Although final design and bid documents have not yet been completed,
with the experience obtained in the execution of other projects in the area
(Guatape, San Carlos, Jaguas) with the same geological characteristics (under-
ground works are substantially located in the so-called Antioquian batholite),
no significant problems are expected. The project would be executed in
accordance with an agreed completion schedule (4.21).
4.13      The plant was originally designed for an installed capacity of
240 MW, but recent studies have indicated that the optimum capacity would
be 200 MW. Incremental cost per kW for installing the additional 40 MW,
(which would be small in comparison with possible future capacity requirements
in the interconnected system), would be high in comparison with the incremental
cost of additional capacity in the large plants under construction (e.g.,
San Carlos) and being planned (e.g., Urra, San Juan, Canafisto, etc). Thus,
the plant factor of Playas would be extremely high (0.83). Because its
water regime is largely dictated by the releases from the Guatape and San
Lorenzo (Jaguas) reservoirs and the requirements at San Carlos, the high
utilization factor is economically fully justified.
4.14      IDB engaged the services of an expert geologist (Mr. W. L. Swiger
of the US) to assess the project's readiness and the correctness of unit
prices. He expressed two items of concern requiring particular attention:
additional drainage is required in both abutments of the dam; and the discharge
tunnel, portal and canal, the access tunnel portals and the substation should
be relocated in order to avoid an old landslide in which the design would have
located them. This would not cause any substantial changes in the cost esti-
mate, which is considered reasonable and conservative.
4.15      EPM would continue the services of SEDIC Ltd. through completion of
the works, under a contract acceptable to the Bank. In view of the joint
interests of IDB and the Bank, the procedures for selection of engineering
consultants and their conditions of employment (including terms of reference)
would be acceptable to both institutions. IDB would finance a Board of
Consultants comprising three highly qualified experts to be engaged indivi-
dually by EPM. Such Boards have been very effective in Chivor, San Carlos and
Jaguas, where they provided useful guidance in execution of the projects
(including Bank financed portions) and rapidly solved problems that arose.
The Boards meet at the sites every 3-6 months for a period of 1-2 weeks.



- 33 -
Additionally, the project consultants would engage the services of independent
engineers in the event a particular problem arises (e.g. gas accumulation in
tunnels, overcoming water hazards during tunnelling). The latter consultants
would also be financed by the proposed loan.
4.16      The estimated base cost of the consulting services and of EPM's
own administration would be about MUS$21.3 of which about MUS$1.5 would
pertain to outside expertise for the Board of Consultants and other experts
required during execution of the project. About 20% of the remaining cost
is expected to be required for additional surveys, drilling, tests, and
the like. As is usual in Colombia, design and supervision of the project
would largely be the responsibility of the consultants, with modest input
by the owner, except at the top supervisory level. The consultant costs are
estimated to range from US$12-13 million. The consultants are paid on a
man-month basis for all personnel assigned from time-to-time to the project,
including salary costs, social benefits and profit margin. Their present
average monthly salaries are about US$1,200 equivalent and it is estimated
that some 9,000-11,000 m.m. of such services would be required during the
5 year construction period. EPM's internal cost for overall supervision is
expected to range from US$3-4 million, representing some 3,000 m.m.
4.17      Studies.  The proposed loan would finance a feasibility study to
provide EPM with the basis needed to determine whether or not it will obtain
ownership of Electrificadoras of Antioquia and Choco and the works needed to
bring their power systems up to adequate standards. The consultants for this
study - which is estimated to cost about MUS$0.l - would be engaged by EPM no
later than December 31, 1981 under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. The study would be completed by June 20, 1982 and submitted to the Bank
for review and comment by September 30, 1982, together with any proposed plan
for action. The final version of the report, satisfactory to the Bank, would
be submitted to the Bank no later than December 31, 1982.
4.18      IDB would finance two studies.  The first would have the objective
of protecting the Playas reservoir against siltation and polution caused by
the increasing population and industrialization along the Guatape River. It
would identify the causes and make recommendations to alleviate the problems,
while providing terms of reference for implementing the recommendations
and for follow-up studies to be completed, e.g., actions to be taken to
protect the health of the population and to rehabilitate deforested areas and
areas unsuitable for agriculture which are nevertheless used at marginal
profit for this and at great damage to the environment. The second study
would investigate the possible effect of power rationing in the EPM area.
In view of construction delays in the interconnected system, several emergency
programs have been instituted, but these are not expected to alleviate
substantially the possibility of curtailments during dry years. The study
would assess the cost to the consumers of curtailments in the EPM supply
area and lead to the preparation of an efficient and equitable set of regula-
tions for actions to be taken at various levels of curtailment at least cost
to the public and the economy.



- 34 -
4.19      Training.  No provision of funds for training is envisioned under
the present loan because the recent Guadalupe IV provides for necessary
assistance in this respect.
Execution
4.20      Implementation Schedule.  The implementation schedule, of which
the key dates are shown in Annex 4.4, would be used to monitor project
progress during the construction period. The Playas hydro station is
expected to be completed in the early months of 1986, and June 30, 1986 has
been assumed as the date of full commercial operation.
4.21      Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed by
the proposed loan (other than consulting services) would be through inter-
national competitive bidding under Bank guidelines for procurement. Colombian
manufacturers would receive a preference of 15%, or applicable duties, which-
ever is lower, for purposes of bid evaluation. Local manufacturers are not
expected to be able to supply items required for the project in excess of a
cost of MUS$2. The ex-factory cost (net of taxes) of such items would be
financed by the loan.
4.22      Disbursements.  Funds from the proposed loan would finance the
foreign cost of the project as follows: (a) 56% of total expenditures for
the civil works for river diversion and construction of the dam and spillway;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and 100%
of ex-factory cost, net of taxes, of locally produced materials and equipment
for hydro, mechanical and electrical equipment required for the power station
and substation, except turbines and generators; and (c) 100% of foreign
expenditures for foreign consultants and 50% of local expenditures for local
consultants, except the Board of Consultants and the studies to be financed by
IDB. All disbursement requests would be fully documented. Annex 4.5 shows
the estimated loan disbursements. The closing date would be June 30, 1987.
4.23      Retroactive Financing.  No contracts are expected to be signed
prior to loan signing. In the interest of continuity, it is proposed that
the proposed loan would retroactively finance the cost of consulting services
as of January 1, 1981, not expected to exceed MUS$0.5.
4.24      Environmental Aspects.  Because the Playas hydro plant would be
largely underground, the environmental impact would principally originate
in the reservoir, the captation and tailrace facilities, the substation
and the connecting line. The area to be affected is in the order of 1,400
ha, of which 1,000 ha would constitute the surface of the reservoir. The
area is unsuitable for agriculture and is owned substantially by absentee
landlords. About 50 families would have to be displaced. About 250 ha would
be required for the construction of Playas facilities. ISA, before the
responsibilities for executing Playas were transferred to EPM, had already
acquired about 250 ha in the area, which would be transferred to EPM. The
arrangements are normally made directly between the utility and the land
owners and the small farmers living in the area. Only in cases where no
agreement can be reached are expropriation procedures initiated as provided
for under Colombia law.



- 35 -
4.25      Although it is expected that land acquisition would be largely
completed in early 1981, IDB, as a condition for making its first disburse-
ment from its proposed loan, would receive from EPM, satisfactory information
on the number of persons to be displaced and their indemnification and on the
program for acquiring the remaining land. For this reason EPM would provide
to the Bank the information required by IDB and acquire all lands required by
the project no later than December 31, 1981.
4.26      The undertakings, agreed to under the Guadalupe IV project, with
respect to environmental projection and the periodical inspection of dams
and waterworks, have been repeated for the new loan.
4.27      Project Risks.  The Playas hydro plant is subject to risks normally
associated with civil works in difficult terrain and heavy rain during the
wet season, which may cause landslides in disturbed earth and cause temporary
work stoppage. The critical point in the construction is the completion of
the diversion tunnel and cofferdam (as part of the main dam) by the end
of 1983 before the start of the wet season. If this target is not met, a
delay of up to one year may occur. Because the underground work would
be located almost totally in the Antioquian batholite (similarly to Guatape,
San Carlos and Jaguas), no undue difficulties are expected during tunneling
and excavation of the caverns.
4.28      Studies have been underway since 1976 to identify all potential
faults in the area, and the present conclusion is that the project is located
in a seismic area of low intensity. No earthquake of any importance has
occurred in the area but the studies continue in order to assess the possible
adverse effects of activity of the Balseado fault, the most important fault
identified in the area. The study is expected to be completed by the end of
1981. There are no indications that any design changes could be called
for.
4.29      The procurement and construction schedule for the project is
reasonable; no unusual delays are expected.
4.30      Project File.  Annex 4.6 lists the contents of the Project File.

5. FINANCES
Summary
5.01      Except for 1974 and 1975, EPM has maintained a satisfactory financial
position throughout its 21-year relationship with the Bank. The extra-fiscal
measures taken under recent agreements with the Bank, including revaluation of
assets for monitoring financial performance, have considerably strengthened
EPM's financial structure. The investments of EPM's Power Department for the
period 1980-1988, including investments in ISA, are forecast at MCol$138,221,
of which MCol$24,333 (18%) corresponds to the proposed Playas Hydro Power
Project. Net internal cash generation would finance MCol$103,207 (75% of
total) and the remaining MCol$35,014 (25%) would be covered by loans. The
proposed loan amounts to MCol$6,597 (MUS$85). The present financial projec-
tions are based on a plan of tariff increases and on external and domestic
inflation assumptions. The net operating income with the above plan is
expected to produce annual rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging
from 7.0% in 1980 to 18.3% 1/ in 1986, and the company is expected to maintain
an adequate financial position throughout the projection period.
Historical Financial Analysis
5.02      EPM's consolidated financial position as well as the financial
position of each of its various departments (Power, Telephone, and Water and
Sewerage) have been satisfactory. During 1977-1979, the consolidated annual
debt service coverage ratio exceeded 2.0. The following table summarizes
EPM's consolidated financial performance during this period (Annex 5.1).

5.03      The projected flow of funds of each department (Telephone, Water and
Sewerage, Power) through 1984 has been reviewed and, on this basis, EPM's
forecast future finances have been found satisfactory; annual debt service
coverage for each of these departments will not be less than 1.5 during
1980-84 (Annexes 5.2 and 5.7). Each department is operated financially
1/   EPM's high rate of return is caused by the fact that its rate base is
modest in comparison with its requirements for expansion which, in
addition to its own investments, also include part of ISA's investments
(5.10).

independently of the other. EPM's current projections show that the future
development program of each department will not impose any financial constraints
on the other departments. However, the implications of a possible deterior-
ation of the financial situation of any department on EPM's uverall financial
situation as a whole or on the Power Department have been examined and, where
necessary, appropriately covered by covenants under previous loan agreements
(874-CO, 1825-CO and 1868-CO) to ensure financial independence. The same
covenants have been repeated in the proposed loan agreement (5.19 through
5.21). EPM retains all its profits because, statutorily, it is not required
to pay dividends. Instead, each department pays an annual contribution to the
Municipality of Medellin based on the following percentages (fixed since 1955)
of sales: Power, 4.425%; Telephone, 3.420; Water, 1.993%; and Sewerage,
2.473%. Since EPM's accounts and budgets are maintained and audited separately
for each department, a detailed analysis has been made only for the Power
Department. Unless otherwise indicated, the following paragraphs relate only
to the Power Department.
Earnings History
5.04      Except for 1974 and 1975, EPM's Power Department has had a history of
satisfactory financial performance. Since 1976, its internal cash generation
has complemented adequately its financial requirements, fluctuating from 29%
of its investment needs in 1976 to 59% in 1979, including substantial recent
contributions to ISA. This may be attributed in large part to the high density
of its market and low-cost facilities, given the area's geographic advantages
for hydro generation. The balance of the company's investment funds has been
obtained through borrowings, generally at reasonable cost; no subsidized
government funding has ever been required.
5.05      Over 1973-79, EPM's average rate increased in real terms by 14%.
Due to a program of fixed monthly increases instituted in 1978, rates are
estimated to have averaged USJ2.11/kWh equivalent in 1980. The rates of
return of 7.4% and 7.5% achieved in 1978 and 1979 respectively are higher
than the agreed rates of return of 7% and 6%. As a result of higher-than-
anticipated domestic inflation in 1980 (25% v. 20%) and a lower volume of
energy sales than expected (mainly because of lower sales to ISA; 1980 was a
dry year), the estimated rate of return for 1980 is 1% lower than the 9%
called for under the Guadalupe IV loan (1868-CO). Nevertheless, EPM's 1980
self-financing ratio for this year is estimated to be virtually 100% instead
of the previously estimated 47% because of some delays beyond EPM's control in
the Guadalupe IV works and in some ISA projects (requiring lower investment by
EPM in ISA's equity). Thus, revenues in addition to those presently expected
for 1980 are not needed and would, in fact, have resulted in excess liquidity.
Consequently, the Bank has waived the 9% rate of return for 1980; it is
expected that EPM would increase its rates as needed (5.19) to provide neces-
sary internal resources for investment. At the end of 1979, EPM's debt/equity
ratio was 35/65, calculated on the basis of revalued assets, and the debt
service coverage ratio (including investments in ISA) was 1.6. The company's
cash and working capital have been adequate in recent years; the current ratio
has exceeded 1.5 since 1976 and was 3.3 in 1979. On average, accounts receiv-
able as a percentage of annual sales have not exceeded 19.2%.

Rate Base
5.06      For public accounting purposes, Colombia's public utility regulatory
law does not allow full revaluation of fixed assets but only adjustments to
match the revaluation of outstanding foreign debt. To reflect international
and domestic inflation, a fixed value of EPM's assets and accumulated deprecia-
tion as of December 31, 1976 was estimated and agreed with the Bank (under
Loan 1582-CO). From this date, EPM revalues its assets quarterly by the
Colombian cost of living index as a means of monitoring its financial perfor-
mance, including rate of return.
Tariff Structure
5.07      Although EPM's average rate is expected to continue to improve, its
tariff structure has lacked appropriate balance among various major categories
of consumers. The spread between average residential and average industrial/
commercial charges widened further because in 1979 the 2.2% across-the-board
monthly rate increases, in effect since 1978, was reduced to 1.5% for residen-
tial and 1.8 for all other consumer categories. Reinstatement of the 2.2%
across-the-board increase became effective in April 1980, and a program of
tariff structure adjustments would be implemented (2.14).
Financial Structure
5.08      The extra-fiscal measures taken by EPM as one of the shareholders
under the San Carlos loans, including revaluation of assets for monitoring
financial performance, have strengthened its financial structure. As of
December 31, 1979, the capitalization of EPM's Power Department was:
MCol$              %
Capital                                                43               _
Donations                                             240               1
Accumulated Surplus                                 4,286              17
Capital Revaluation                                11,481              46
Total Equity                                       16,050              64
Long-Term Debt                                      7,698              31
Pension and Other Liabilities Reserves                713               3
Total Long-Term Liabilities                         8,411              34
Current Liabilities                                   409               2
Total                                              24,870             100
5.09      The principal creditor of EPM's Power Department is the Bank; in
1979, debt under its first three loans from the Bank amounted to MCol$5,472
equivalent to 72% of the total long-term debt.  The second largest creditor is
the Government of Colombia with 4.6% followed by the Chase Manhattan Bank with



- 39 -
4.4%, KfW, Banco de Bogota and the Municipality of Medellin with 2.5% each,
and Brown Boveri with 1.7%. The remaining 9.8% is composed of debt from
various local financial institutions. Audited figures for 1979 are given in
Annex 5.3. The pension and other liability reserves (noncurrent and contingent
liabilities) amounted to MCol$713 (3% of total capitalization).
Investment and Financing Plan
5.10      EPM's 1980-1988 investment program, including construction and
studies for future projects and investments in ISA, interest during construc-
tion, and requirements for working capital, amounts to MCol$138,221. The proposed
project is the largest single component of EPM's construction program, requiring
MCol$24,333 (18% of total). The capital and bonds contributions to ISA amount
to MCol$49,742 (36% of total). The proposed financing plan for EPM's invest-
ment program is summarized on the next page.
5.11      EPM's net internal cash generation would finance MCol$103,207 (75%
of total) and the remaining MCol$35,014 (25%) would be covered by loans (Annex
5.5). The proposed loans for the Playas Hydro Power Project would amount to
MCol$6,597 equivalent (MUS$85) from the Bank and the balance of MCol$11,161 is
planned to be covered by: (a) a proposed loan of MCol$6,704 equivalent from
IDB (b) MCol$1,892 from suppliers' credits; and (c) MCol$2,565 from commercial
banks. Most of the borrowings required for projects under construction,
aggregating MCol$13,644, have already been contracted with the Bank (Guatape
II, Loan 874-CO, and Guadalupe IV, Loan 1868-CO) and the Bank of America, or
are being negotiated with other commercial banks.
5.12      The remaining MCol$3,612 of required borrowings is planned to be
covered by MCol$126 of Government and municipal loans for local components
of the construction program; MCol$476 from FONADE to finance studies for
future generation projects; and MCol$2,700 of Government-approved short-term
loans from FDE through local commercial banks to finance part of EPM's debt
service payable during 1981-83, in order to increase local currency avail-
ability. In view of its satisfactory financial position, expected rate
increases (5.18), and the interest that domestic and external commercial
lenders are showing in EPM operations, it is reasonable to expect that EPM,
after Government authorization, would be able to obtain the above-mentioned
financing directly from international commercial banks.
5.13      To assist the sector in obtaining such needed financing, the
Government has recently reestablished the Fondo de Desarrollo Electrico
(1.33), and, in view of the rapidly growing financial requirements of the
sector, it is setting up a permanent financing facility to provide necessary
local cost financing. Effectiveness of the proposed loan would be conditional
upon receiving evidence that EPM has made satisfactory arrangements for
financing the balance of its requirements for 1981-83.



- 41 -
5.14      The proposed Bank loan is assumed at an interest rate of 9.6% per
year plus a commitment charge of 3/4 of 1% with a repayment period of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace. The assumed terms of other foreign and local borrow-
ing related to the proposed and future projects (Annex 5.3) are in line with
the general terms for EPM's current external and domestic borrowings. Disburse-
ment and debt service schedules of existing and future loans are given in
Annexes 5.8 through 5.10.
5.15      In line with Colombian legislation, EPM maintains reserve accounts
for its pension and severance liabilities, and pays directly from these
accounts to employees who leave the company. Annual provisions for these
reserves are determined on the basis of an actuarial study carried out in
1978. Other liability reserves are EPM's self-insurance fund, and a yearly
reserve of MCol$100 to cover most of the MCol$850 balloon payment on local
loans maturing in 1983 (5.20); since estimated cash generation in 1983 is
sufficient to cover such payments, this yearly reserve would be used to cover
EPM's 1981-83 cash requirements. The 1980-88 net increase in these reserves,
together with the income recovered from the sale of the remaining housing
units built at El Penol (2.02), and recovery of investment expenditures in
distribution facilities made on behalf of consumers, (network donations)
amounts to 3% of total financing sources. A cash surplus amounting to
MCol$14,444 is accumulated by the end of 1988 because Playas, which is due for
commissioning in 1986, is the last large component in EPM's current (1980-86)
investment program for generation facilities and, during 1986-88. These
projections only contemplate investments in ISA, in general plant, and small,
as yet unidentified, generation, transmission and distribution projects.
5.16      In addition to low-cost housing loans which EPM provides for its
employees, individual shares in the severance funds can be used by employees
for purchasing residential housing. These features apply to all EPM's depart-
ments. As required by law, EPM pays interest on the severance reserve in line
with rates charged for similar arrangements in other companies.
5.17      Forecast financial statements and performance indicators for 1980-88
are presented in Annexes 5.4 through 5.7. A summary of financial indicators
until 1986 is given below.

Tariff Program
5.18      The projection assumptions provide for the effects of expected local and
external inflation, exchange rate devaluation (increasing from Col$47.30 in 1980
to Col$125.05 per US$ in 1988. Thus, projected revenues are based on the following
tariff program:
(a) continuation of the 2.2% monthly rate increase, and three additional
increases to achieve rates of return of 7.1% in 1981, and 9.7% in 1982,
and 14% in 1983. Based on the present forecast, such increases would
amount to 12% before June 19.81, 12% before June 1982, and 12% before
June 1983. These increases would decrease EPM's local cash deficits
during 1981 through 1983 down to MCol$2,70Q0 (about MUS$42 equivalent,
expected to be covered by short-term loans); without these increases
local cash deficits would accumulate to some MCol$7,600 (about
MUS$115). Although EPM's present debt/equity ratio and repayment
potential would allow it to incur most of this debt, the sum is
considered excessive for the local capital market, which is already
hard-pressed to finance cash shortfalls for the other power sector
utilities;



- 43 -
(b) continuation through 1984 of monthly rate increases of up to 2A'2%;
and
(c) Starting in January 1984, the monthly increases could be adjusted
downward to give minimum yearly rates of return of 12%.
5.19      Under Guadalupe IV, EPM had confirmed that, in addition to 2.2%
monthly rate increases through 1983, it would increase its rates by 10% before
June 1981. This undertaking has been modified under the proposed loan as
follows: the 2.2% monthly rate increase would continue through 1984 and the
10% rate increase was changed to three 12% increases, the first before June
1981, the second before June 1982 and the third before June 1983.
5.20      EPM's net operating income with the above plan is expected to
produce annual rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 7.1% in
1981 to 14.2% in 1984, compared with no less than 10.5% in 1981, 13% in 1982
and 1983 and 10% in 1984 and thereafter, called for under the Guadalupe IV
Loan. The rate of return covenant has been amended for the proposed loan to
be no less than 7% in 1981, 10% in 1982, 14% in 1983 and 1984 and 12% in 1985
and thereafter, in line with the present internal cash generation requirements
to maintain acceptable levels of debt service coverage, debt/equity, and
current ratios. The rates of return required for 1980-81 are lower than those
called for under Guadalupe IV in response to inflation higher than estimated
at the time, lower hydrology, and lower cash generation requirements than
anticipated for 1980 (5.05).
Other Loan Conditions
5.21      Except for the amendment of the rate of return covenant and related
undertakings, no other financial agreement, under the Guadalupe IV loan (1860-CO)
require revision, i.e., the following main provisions have been repeated for the
proposed loan:
(a) Departmental Reporting. EPM is to furnish to the Bank, no later
than three months after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports
for each of its departments, on their financial performance during
that year and the forecasts for the next year;
(b) Debt Service Coverage. The indicator would not be less than 1.5
for each of EPM's departments individually;
(c) Rate of Return Monitoring. A quarterly report is to be issued to
the Government and the Bank showing EPM's latest and forecast
12 months performance with respect to tariffs and rates, including
proposals for any adjustments;
(d) Departmental Tariffs. Each Department of EPM shall have sufficient
tariff levels so as to obtain adequate rates of return and make
reasonable contributions to their own investment programs;



44
(e) Investment Limitations. Except as the Bank may otnren4dse agree
EPM would not undertake investments, in its power operations
not included in its 1980-88 power investment prograity., which
exceed 1% of revalued fixed assets in operation 1/. or for
investments unrelated to the operations of its thre  departments;
(f)  Funds Transfer Limitation.  Only operational and i-?-estment
surplus funds can be transferred from the power 6epartment
to EFM's other departments and only as a loan under commercial
terms and conditions.
1/   As agreed under Guadalupe IV, it is not necessary to place an additional
investment limitation on operational investments to be used in common by
two or more departments because (i) of the similar litmitation (MUS$2
instead of 1% of revalued net fixed assets in operation) called for under
the Bank Fifth Telecommunication Project loan to EPM; and (ii) any invest-
ments made by ER'4 for the common use of its departments, has to be
allocated to each department in proportion to said use0

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      ISA annually defines the least cost development program for the
sector 1/, which, after approval by NPD, then becomes the national devel-
opment program for generation and 500-kV and 230-kV transmission. In this
program, the least-cost sequence until about 1988, is Guadalupe IV (Loan
1868-CO), Betania (being constructed by ICEL), Playas, Guavio (recently
appraised) and Urra.
6.02      EPM's transmission, subtransmission and distribution program was
designed on the basis of the 1980-88 load forecast by the Westinghouse Study
which optimized substation and main conductor loading using the discounted
cash flow method. Since the objective is to provide electric service to some
12,000-14,000 new consumers each year and to improve service coverage and
quality through improving and expanding the existing system, reasonable
alternatives for the secondary network are limited to EPM's standard design,
which is simple and satisfactory.
Return on Investment
6.03      The return on investment was calculated as the discount rate equal-
izing the present values of the streams of benefits and costs associated with
EPM's 1979-88 development program of which the Bank project is a part and
cannot be reasonably segregated. The cost streams comprise the capital costs
of this program and incremental operational and maintenance cost related to
the incremental sales associated with the program. These costs were converted
to border prices by means of weighted average conversion factors based on
conversion factors for individual local cost components (materials, machinery,
equipment, labor, consumables and such). As a proxy for benefits, revenues
were used, derived from incremental sales associated with the program and
average annual rates, deflated for adjustment to 1979 and adjusted to border
prices by the standard conversion factor.
6.04      On this basis, the return on investment is 15.5% (Annex 6.1),
compared with the opportunity cost of capital for Colombia, estimated to be
11%.

6.05      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact of
major uncertainties underlying the return calculation. The analysis shows
the following:
Rate of Return; Sensitivity
…---…Change from Base (%)----
-20     -10   Base   +10   +20
------Rate of Return (%)------
Parameters
Benefit.s (Sales or rates)      1n.p   13.2  15.6   17.7   19.5
Capital Cost                    18.7   17.0  15.6   14.2   12.8
Operation and M4aintenance.     Ih.2   15.9  15.6   1f.4   15.1
The rate of return is nq n,ti-c    a change in operational cost (including
purchases from ISA).  'I'lle if- .;it'  t-. capital cost changes is rather high
and slightly exponential vi.e.  a ..;e..rease in cost bv 20% increases the rate
of return by abol.lt 3.1 p)ercentage porints. but an increase of 20% decreases the
rate of return bv 2.8 percentage points). The sensitivity of the rate of
return to changes in benefits (sales or rates) is practically linear within a
reasonable range at about 2.4 percentage point per 10% change in benefits from
the base - i.e., the return on investment would be 10% for a real term increase
resulting ir. only about 80% of the target levels.

directly related to any of its Departments (Loan Agreement, Section
5.09) and investment limitation covenant (Loan Agreement, Section
5.10) (5.21).
(i) Limitation of transfer of funds from the Power Department to the
other Departments (Loan Agreement, Section 5.11) (5.21).
(j) Change in EPM's statutes, adversely by affecting management and
operations, would be an event of default (Loan Agreement, Section
7.01(a)) (2.03).
Condition of Effectiveness
7.03      Prior to loan effectiveness, evidence would be available that
EPM has made satisfactory arrangemert for financing the balance of financial
requirements for the period 1981-82 (5.13).
Recommendation
7.04      Given the above assurances, the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of MUS$85 equivalent to be made to EPM with the guarantee of the Government
of Colombia. The loan would have a repayment period of 17 years, including
four years of grace.

Maintenance cost         0.91
Standard (for power
supplies)             0.92
Residual Values
- No residual values were assumed in view of number of years to be discounted (49)
- Generating facilities assumed to be reconditioned after 30 years at 20% of original cost.
- Useful life of general plant assumed at 5 years.

Operation and Maintenance
EPM's forecast incremental total operational cost (excluding interests, depreciation and ISA sales/purchases) were
deflated using the annual deflators for local cost.
1/ Assumed. Interconnected purchases and sales (1979) where at average prices of MCol$0.400/GWh and MCol$1,500/MW.
No pattern of load factor, however, has developed and MCol$0.5/GWh has been assumed which, probably
is understated.
2/ Secondary energy sales in the interconnected system is at 50% of normal prices.
