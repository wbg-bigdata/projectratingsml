APPRAISAL OF COPEL DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA PARANAFNSE DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (COPEL)
BRAZIL
Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project forming part of the
1976-1979 expansion program of Companhia Paranaense de Energia ELetrica (COPEL),
a joint-stock corporation whose principal owner is the state of Parana.
ii.       The propcsed loan would be the first by the Bank to COPEL, which
recently assumed Loan 476-BR approved in 1966 for a distribution project of
Companhia Forca e Luz do Parana, since absorbed by COPEL.
iii.      The project canprises most of COPEL's distribution expansion program
for the period mentioned above as it consists of facilities to be initiated by
July 1, 1976 and to be completed by June 30, 1979. It includes investments in
subtransmission and distribution needed to meet increased demands on the
utility's system; related inspection and training; and acquisition of laboratory,
maintenance and system operation equipment.
iv.       In addition to the above, the project would lead to the extension of
service to about 20,000 low-income households. The project's estimated cost
amounts to US$188 million of which US$52 million represents the foreign exchange
component to be financed by the proposed loan. The remaining costs would be
covered by COPELts net internal cash generation and reinvestment of power sales
taxes.
v.        The rate of return on COPEL's entire investment program (including
the project) is estimated at 19.5%. A sensitivity analysis shows that this
return would be reduced to 17 % if sales are assumed to be 10 % lower and project
costs 10 % higher.  These rates of return are sufficiently high to suggest that
consumers will be requested to pay a price for power considerably in excess of
incremental system costs. This in turn means that wasteful use of electricity
should be avoided. In view of the complexity of the systems effects and of the
difficulty in interpretation, a rate of return on the project has not been
calculated.
vi.       COPEL's present local consultants would assist the utility's engineering
and procurement staff in preparing all contract documents for procurement. All
other engineering (designs, specifications and construction supervision) will
be performed by COPEL's staff. Local firms would construct the project's
facilities and equipment installation will be carried out mainly by suppliers.
Some construction and equipment installation will also be performed by COPEL's
own forces.
vii.      Procurement of Bank-financed items would be through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines for procurement uader its loans, with



- ii -
suppliers whose bids contain components manufactured in Brazil eual to at least 50%
of the value of the bid being granted a preference of 15% or the applicable custom dhty,
whichever is lower. Up to US$1.8 million of the proposed loan would be allocac-ed
for direct purchases of special imported metering and protection equipment not
suitable for ICB because of standardization requirements. Approximately US$0.8
million of the proposed loan would be used for direct purchase of imported
equipment which is required in small quantities throughout the execution of the
project, making IOB impractical. No retroactive financing or financing of
interest during construction is proposed.
viii.     COPEL is a suitable recipient for the proposed Bank loan.  It is well
managed, enjoys the benefits of favorable tariff legislation and the financial
support of ELETROBRAS and the state of Parana. Its present and prospective
financial performance is good. It will cover 28% of its total expansion program
during the project period with funds provided directly by its customers.
ix.       The project provides a suitable basis for a Banlk loan to COPEL of
Us$52 million with a term of 20 years including 3-1/2 years of grace. The
loan would be guaranteed by the Federative Republic of Brazil. A project
agreement between the state of Parana and the Bank would cover pertinent
obligations by the state.



APPRAISAL OF COPEL DISTRIBUIION PROJECT
COMPANHIA PARANAENSE DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (COPEL)
BRAZIL
1. Introduction
1.01      Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica (COPEL) a joint-stock'
corporation whose principal owner is the state of Parana, has asked the Bank
for financial assistance to carry out its distribution expansion program.
1.02      The project consists of urgent subtransmission and distribution works
to be carried out in the state over the period 1976-79.  These works are a
part of a large construction program being undertaken by COPEL to provide the
power facilities needed to support a continuation of the rapid expansion of
Parana's industrial sector in recent years as well as an accompanying rise in
commercial and residential consumers. The industrial growth has been concen-
trated in the agricultural processing and forestry industries and has been
accompanied by rapid urbanization and immigration from other regions of Brazil.
By eliminating a potential constraint on the continuation of this growth, the
project (estimated to cost US$188 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$52 million) would support the Brazilian Government's efforts
to create growth poles outside the country's traditional industrialized areas.
1.03      The proposed loan of US$52 million would finance the project's foreign
cost. It would complement foreign financing of US$79 million which COPEL is
arranging for its 1976-79 construction program. Included in this foreign
financing are US$56 million to be disbursed from a US$74 million loan approved
--n December 1975 by the Inter-American Development Bane for COPEL's Foz do
Areia hydroelectric project and suppliers' credits. COPEL may also succeed
in obtaining additional financing from foreign private financial institutions.
The Bank would be prepared to assist COPEL in obtaining better terms from
the private sources through appropriate co-financing arrangements.
1.04      As noted above, the main thrust of the project would be support of
resource-based industries in the state of Parana. However, the project would
also allow the connection of some 20,000 low-income households which have not
been able to afford the customary connection fee. To enable these households
to be connected, COPEL would finance the fee on a 36-month deferred payment
plan.
1.05      The proposed loan would be the first by the Bank to COPEL, although
recently COPEL assumed Loan 476-BR made in 1966, to Companhia Forca e Luz do
Parana (since absorbed by COPEL), for a distribution project.
1.06      This report is based on a feasibility study of COPEL's 1975-1980
distribution expansion program prepared by the utility and on the findings
of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. Jaime Acevedo-havas, Pierre Biraben
and Carlos F. Mena, who visited Brazil in October 1975 and a mission by Mr. Bernard
Montfort to discuss power tariff structures with the Brazilian authorities in
March 1976.



2. The Power Sector
Energy Resources
2.01      The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil in 1975
was 107,880 M.T.o.e. (0.99 T.o.e. per capita)!  and it is expected to grow at
about 8% p.a. in the next 5 years, reaching about 1.26 T.o.es per capita in
1980. Oil products account for about 50% of the rational energy consumption,
wood products and wastes 27% and hydroelectricity 20% (see Annex 1).
2.02     Brazilfs proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic production
of crude covers only 18% of the country's requirements and is concentrated in
the Northeast. To increase domestic production, the Government intends to
accelerate prospection. To this end it has recently authorized the contracting
of the services of foreign firms for exploration and exploitation in certain
areas; putting an end to the policy of government monopoly. Bituminous and sub-
bituminous coal reserves, which are located in the South are estimated at 3200
million tons. Coal extraction is rather costly because shaft mining is predom-
inantly required. Brazil is well endowed with hydroelectric resources with a
potential of about 100,000 MW of which less than 15% has been utilized so far.
Further economic utilization of these resources would require installation of
a proportion of non-hydro generating capacity to firm up hydroelectric generation
and to this end 3,000 MW of nuclear generating capacity are expected to be in
operation in the Southeast region by 1985. Gross consumptian of electric energy
in 1 975 was 80,200 GWh (25% of total energy consumption) and has increased at a
rate of 12.31 p.a. during the last 5 years, reaching a per capita gross consump-
tion of 739 kWh.
2.03      The Southern region, with 18'% of Brazil's population, accounted for
about 15% of the total energy consumption of the country in 1975, with a per
capita consumption of about 0.6 T.oe., almost half of which comes from wood
products and wastes. In 1970 the consumption of oil products accounted for 292,
coal 13% and hydroelectricity 10% of the total Southern region consumption
(see Annex 1).
2.04      Electric energy consumption in the Southern region has grown at a rate
of 14.5% p.a. in the last 5 years, reaching a consumption per capita of 404 kWh
in 1975 and it is expected to reach about 618 kWh by 1980.
Power Sector Organization
2.05      The legal, technical and admi.nistrative structure of the electric power
sector is established by Decree No. 68,024 of June 7, 1967, which defines the
structure as consisting of the National Department of Water and Electric Energy
(INAEE), ELETROBRAS and the various federal, state, municipal and private
concessionaires, all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry.of Mines and Energy
(MME). INAEE performs regulatory functions including the granting of licenses
j9, T.o.e.:  tons of oil equivalent, approximately 107 Kcal.
M.T.o.e. = 1000 T.o.e.

for hydroelectric sites, assignment of cmncession areas, setting of tariffs and
approving expansion plans. ELETROBRASJ Which operates as an executing agency
under the jurisdiction of the MME and in coordination with INAEE, performs the
functions of (a) holding company for those utilities where the Government has
acquired financial control, (b) financial institution administering and allocating
public funds among its subsidiaries and electric utilities owned by state govemn-
ments and coordinating sector borrowings from abroad, and (c) coordinating and
assisting the development of the country's electrification programs including
the rendering of technical, managerial and training services.
2.06      In accordance with Government policy, the power generation function
and related high voltage taansmission is reserved largely to four of ELETROBRAS'
subsidiaries which cover Brazil's five natural regions. They are Centrais
Eletricas do Norte do Brasil (ELTrRCNORTE) covering the North and part of the
Center-West, Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) covering the
Northeast, Furnas - Centrais El6tricas (FURNAS) covering the Southeast and part
of the Center-West, and Centrais El6tricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETROSUL) covering
the South.        ELETROBRAS is the major source of funds for generation and
major transmission projects in Brazil, which are derived from a series of levies
discussed in Annex 10. This has allowed it to influence the activities of
utilities in which it does not hold a controlling share of the equity.
2.07      Also in accordance with Government policy, the power distribution
function at the state level is carried out mainly by utilities controlled by
the state governments. In line with this policy, there have been in recent
years a number of acquisitions and mergers of smaller municipally-and-privately-
owned distribution companies by state-owned utilities as well as transfers to
them of some of ELErROBRAS' subsidiaries engaged in distribution.  Today, with
the exception of the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo areas which are served
principally by Light-Servicos de Eletricidade, S.A. (LIGHT), a privately-owned
enterprise, most of the power distribution is made through one company in each
state. ELETROBRAS is a minority shareholder in most of these state utilities.
COPEL in one of the largest of these affiliated utilities and its concessions
are located within the state of Parana, in the southern region.
2.08      Sector planning and development is carried out b  ELETROBRAS, which
has been issuing multiannual budgets for the sector (OPE_/) which cover 5-year
periods and are revised and updated annually, since 1968. These budgets enable
ELETROBRAS and the Government to select projects to meet anticipated demand
and to provide for them adequate financial support. Because the OPEs contain
information regarding equipment requirements, they also afford manufacturers
of electrical equipment opportunities for better planning of their activities.
2.09      In order to properly operate the interconnected system, the Coordinating
Qroups for Interconnected Operation (GCOI)_/ were established by law of July 5,
1973. Their principal objective is to provide for the rational operation of
existing and future generating and transmission facilities in the interconnected
south-southeastern regions. COPEL_, ELETROSUL and FURNAS are members of the
Executive Committee of GCOI.

South-Southeast Power Market and Expansion Program
2.10      The 1968 market study prepared by ELETROBRAS for the south-southeastern
region forecast an average 9% rate of growth from 1968 to 1974. The actual
growth in electric energy consumption has been 12% on average, due mainly to
higher than expected GNP growth in the regions. The combined sales in the two
regicns in 1975 amounted to about 60,000 GWh.
2.11     In connection with Loan 923-BR (Itumbiara Hydroelectric Project) the
Brazilian Government agreed in 1973 to prepare and submit to the Bank for
comment plans for expanding generation and major transmission facilities in
the southeast and south regions in two stages: the first covering the period
through 1981 and the second through 1990. The least-cost generation and
transmission program for the first of these periods includes 14,460 MW of hydro,
1,040 MW of conventional thermal and 600 MW of nuclear capacity.  The hydro
capacity includes two projects currently under construction in the south region:
ELETROSUL's Salto Santiago project (first stage 1,330 MW, ultimate capacity
1,995 MW) and COPEL's Foz do Areia project (first stage 1,125 MW, ultimate
capacity 2,250 MW).  The Inter-American Bank (IDB) has approved loans to
ELTROSUL and COPEL to finance a part of the foreign cost of these projects.
2.12      A program for expanding generation and major transmission in the two
regions after 1981 was presented to the Bank in 1975. Considerable uncertainty
exists at present about some of the basic assumptions underlying this program,
which is the subject of a continuing dialogue between the Bank and the Brazilian
authorities. These uncertain factors include the impact on power demand of the
slowdown in the growth of GNP (which appears to have been much greater in the
southeast region than in the south); the timing of operation of the Itaipu
hydroelectric project; and the degree of substitution of petroleum by electricity.
A review of the Brazilian energy sector by the Bank which is currently in
preparation will1address these and other related issues.
2.13     The uncertainties noted above would not affect the justification of
the projects which is part of a program designed to meet the immediate needs
for power in COPEL's service area (see paragraph 5.05). They will, however,
affect projectsthat have not yet been started, such as the proposed high-voltage
system linking the southeast and south regions with 500 kV transmission lines
to be built by ELETROSUUL and 750 kV lines by FURNAS. The Bank has been requested
to finance ELETROSULfs portion of the proposed high-voltage system and will
therefore have an opportunity to review its timing and justification in this
context.
State Sub-Sector
2.14      In 1975, the population of the state of Parana was about nine million
people. Of these 30% lived in cities of more than 10,000 inhabitants, the
largest of which is Curitiba, the state capital (population 1,000,000).
Consumption of electric energy amounted to 2,982 GWh (331 kWh/capita)
of which 83.8% was supplied by COPEL, 15.6% by captive plants and o.U by small
public utilities. The latter are expected to be absorbed by COPEL in the not-
too-distant future. The development of the power market in the state is
summarized in paragraphs 3.06-8.



-5-
Electric Power Tariffs
2.15      Since 1964 Brazilian electric power tariffs have been based on a
service-at-cost system, whereby customer's rates have been set at the levels
required to produce sufficient revenues to ?oqver operating expenses (excluding
financial charges), depreciation, reversion_J and a reasonable return on
investment.  Since 1966 the annual revaluation of assets has been mandatory,
and since 1971 a statutory rate of return2/ of 10% to 12% (at INAEEtIs discretion)
has been in effect. This system, which is consistent with sound financial and
public utility practices, has been the cornerstone to the development of the
sector, which since its inception increased installed capacity at an average
annual rate of 10.1% reaching about 20,100 MW in 1975, to keep pace with an
average annual growth in gross consumption of 9.2% and improve reserve margins.
2.16      1NAEE has in recent years used its discretiomry powers to acbLeve
progressive equalization of customer rates throughout   Brazil, a government
policy enacted into law in 1974. While the social objectives of this policy
are appreciated, the possibility of economic demerit arising from it should be
investigated further (para. 2.20). Because the rate equalization was effected
by granting lower tariff increases to the comparatively higher cost utilities,
it resulted in some erosion of tariffs in real terms and adversely affected
their rates of return. It should be noted, however, that the more efficient
utilities, such as COPEL, continued to achieve rates of return on average
revalued net fixed assets in operation well in excess of those curreitin other
countries (see Annex 12). Although the shortfalls were carried forward in
the utilities' accounts to be offset over time against future surplus returns,
this practice was somewhat incongruent with the service-at-cost system.
2.17      With the establishment in 1975 of the Global Guarantee Funa/3, a cross-
subsidization mechanism intended to assure qualifying utilities a statutory
return of up to 10%, the technical incongruence mentioned in the previous para-
graph has been mitigated. This mechanism is funded by an increase of up to
2% in reversion charges and the proceeds used to supplement the tariff revenues
of qualifying utilities. Along with thts redistributive mechanism, whereby
greater sums are collected from the regions where the comparatively more finan-
cially efficient utilities operate to be reallocated to the less developed regions
where the comparatively higher cost utilities operate, BNAEE put into effect a
number of measures to control the latter utilities' operating efficiency with a
view to increasing their productivity. In substance, these measures restrict the
utilities benefitting from this mechanism from increasing their operating costs,
undertaking investments and expanding their markets without ]N1AKE's prior approval.
In addition, to qualify for the benefits of this mechanism, a utility must submit
to DNAEE evidence that it has (a) signed an agreement with its respective state
providing for the settlement of any overdue accounts, and (b) entered into an
agreement with the majority government shareholder providing for the reinvestment
in share capital of all its future dividends. COPEL received a small transfer
from the Global Guarantee And in 1975, but its financing plan is based on the
assumption that it will not require any further transfers from the Fund prior
/ A special electric power sector tax. Refer to Annex 10 for details.
Because of the inclusion of reversion in its calculation and the use of year-

to project completion. However, the need for such transfers cannot be entirely
ruled out and they are therefore referred to in the agreements described in
paragraph 2.18.
2.18      COPEL agreed to maintain its earnings (ncluding transfers from the
Global Guarantee Fund) at levels consistent with sound financial and public
utility practices and in accordance with existing legislation.  COPEL also agreed
that, in the event it was necessary for it to receive transfers from the Fund, it
would maintain its eligibility for such transfers. The Federal Government agreed
that INAEE will take a timely action on COPEL 's applications for tariff and adjustments
or transfers.  Finally, the Federal Government has agreed to canfirm the Bank's
understanding that DNAEE will exercise its discretionary powers to allow COPEL a
statutoryireturn of at least 10%. Any change in legislation which wouid materially
and adversely affect COPEL's financial position, would be an event of default.
Tariff Structures
2.19      The tariffs applied to COPEL's consumers are
shown in Table 1 of Annex 10. To appreciate the relative prices of energy
charged to the consumers, the average unit price for some typical cansumer
levels of the main categories have been calculated and shown in Table 2 of
Annex 10. Tariffs charged to large industrial ccnsamers oonsist of a sizeable
(approximately 58% of the revenue from medium and high-voltage supply) capacity
charge and a relatively low energy charge, reflecting the cost structure of
Brazil's predominantly hydroelectric generating capacity. Tariffs charged to
medium and large-scale urban residential and commercial consumers are among
the highest in the world (after considering the sole tax which these customers
must pay) and should discourage any non-essential consumption. Small urban
consumers and rural consumers are given a discount. The levels of charges to
all important consumer categories would appear to be well above long-run marginal
cost. This should help prevent the adoption of labor-saving processes in cases
in which they are not economically justified, a frequent occurrence in countries
which subsidize industrial electricity consumption.
2.20      The present tariff schedule seems basically rational and simple, and
it should result in a high level of resource mobilization while discouraging
non-essential use of electricity. There are, though, some important aspects
that should be investigated and a recent mission to Brazil in March 1976
initiated discussions on this subject with INAEE and ELETROBRAS. Both organiza-
tions appeared receptive to the idea of a study covering electricity tariffs
throughout Brazil to ensure that their general level as well as their structure
achieved an appropriate balance    in pursuing the various sector objectives,
namely financial, social and economical. They acknowledged that while the
Government had focused primarily on financial objectives and, more recently on social
objectives as well, economic aspects had not been adequately considered. It was
agreed that nNAEE would develop terms of reference for the study for discussion
with ELETROBRAS and the Bank. This discussion will allow the Government to
benefit from the experience acquired by the Bank in its extensive research
into power tariff structures in other member countries. The Federal Government
has agreed to present the terms of reference and the results of the study to the
Bank as soon as they are available.

3. The Borrower
3.01      The borrower would be Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica
(COPEL), the major public-service electric utility in the state of Parana.
COPEL was formed in 1954 as a joint-stock corporation for the purpose of
planning, building and developing systems of production, transmission,
transformation, distribution and sale of electric power.  Its concessions
are in the state of Parana. Approximately 90% of voting stock is owned by
the Parana state government and its agencies and the balance by ELETROBRAS.
COPEL's utility plant in 1975 was valued at US$346 million and construction
in progress about US$101 million. It has 4,850 employees and its facilities
include installed generating capacity of 432 NW (hydro 398 NW, thermal 20 HW
and diesel 14 NW). A detailed description of COPEL's installations appears
in Annex 4.
Organization, Management and Staff
3.02      COPEL is well organized (Annex 13 shows the organization chart) and
its management is composed of competent professionals promoted within the
utility (average age 42, average stay 12 years) who have acquired sound
managerial experience and have the ability to successfully execute the project.
COPEL is administered by a six-member Board of Directors which establishes
policy and through the President, who is a board member, directs and supervises
the corporation's business. A three-member Fiscal Council advises on the
corporationts accounts and proposed increases in capital.
3.03      COPEL is organized into the following five departments, each headed
by a directort Administration, Financial, Operations, Engineering and
Construction and Distribution. The latter is organized into the following five
regional offices (see Map), each headed by a superintendent:  Curitiba,
Ponta-Grossa, Londrina, Maringa and Cascavel.
3.04      At year-end 1975, the number of customers per employee was U15.
This figure has improved considerably over time (in 1970 it was 43), despite
the recent merger into COPEL of private utilities with siseable personnel.
The customer-employee ratio should continue to increase during the project
period through CO0E's retiiining and selection program.  This ratio would
be monitored during project execution (para. 3.10).
Management Information Systems and Audit
3.05      COPEL's internal management information system is very good:  operating
and financial reports are prepared quite accurately and promptly; and customer
records and accounting systems are computerized. Its financial statements
have been certified by Arthur Andersen and Company. Their work appears satisfactory.
COPEL has agreed to continue appointing independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank and to send to the Bank audited financial statements and auditor's report
within four months of the end of COPEL's fiscal year, each year for the duration
of the loan.

State Power Market
3.06      Electric energy consumption in Parana (84% served by COPEL) increased
from 1,056 GWh in 1965 to about 3,000 l}Wh in 1975, a growth rate of 11.5% p.a.
Over the same period, the number of consumers increased from 255,000 to about
562,000. The main factor contributing to the high growth rates has been the
substantial development of the industrial sectorwhich in 1975 accounted for
54% 1/ of the total power consumption, while residential consumption amounted
to 18% and commercial consumption to 14%. The remainder was absorbed in rural
electrification, and public lighting. The relative market share of the
industrial sector is expected to continue to grow during the project period,
as shown below:

3.07      By 1979 the total number of consumers is expected to increase to
746,000. The quality of service in Curitiba, Maringa and Cascavel is good
but in Ponta Grossa and Londrina, the ]evel is much lower. This is due to
the relatively low standards of service provided by the investor-owned
utilities recently absorbed by COPEL which used to serve these regions. An
important project component covers rehabilitation and substantial improvements
of existing distribution circuits. The largest share of this component will
be applied to these two regions.
3.08      About 60% of the population of Parana is rural, dedicated to
agriculture and utilizing about 80% of the usable land. The sector is the
most important in the state and contributes about 15%.in value of the Brazilian
agricultural sector. It also provides the base for the state's important
agricultural processing and wood products industries. The Brazilian Government
is currently implementing (with IDB financing) a national rural electrification
progr*m in which COPEL is acting as implementing agency for the State of Parana.
The Bank has to date only financed rural electrification in Brazil through
integrated rux-1 de-welopment projects.
.  Includes captive plants.



-9-
3.09      Of the 141,00O new residential consumers, expected to be served by
COPEL during the period 1976-1979, about 20,000 (14%) would be "low-income"
consumers, who would be connected under a special program prepared by COPEL in
consultation with the Bank. For purposes of this program, "low-income" consumers are
defined as those households within COPELts concession area which, though located near
existing feeders or distribution circuits, are not served because of their
inability to pay for connection fees (approximately US$100). In order to provide
electrical service to these households, COPEL will finance the connection charges
without interest, for a period of 36 months. This program will be coordinated
with state government urban development agencies and COPEL and the state government
agreed that it would be initiated no later than October 1, 1976.
Performance Indicators
3.10      Annex 9 shows representative indicators of COPEL's marketing and oper-
ating performance through the year of project completion. Implementation of the
project should improve efficiency through a reduction in system losses and outages
and improved voltage regulation. COFEL has prepared a program to monitor the effects
of the project on losses and outages. Indicators showing expected progress under
this program are among those listed in Annex 9. COPEL will report on actual results
in meeting those objectives during project execution.

4. Trhe Project
The Program
4.01      COPEL's construction program during the period 1976-79 consists of
the following works:
a)   Generation:           the bulk of the Foz do Areia hydroelectric
project (see paragraph 2.11) will be carried
out in this period;
b)   Transmission (230
kV-138 kV):          448 circuit-klm at 230 kV, and 585 km at 138 iV
including additional transformer capacity of
950 MVA at 230 kV, and 410 MVA at 138 kV;
c)   Subtransmission
and Distribution
(69 kV or less):     38.3 circuit-km at 69 kV, 1070 km at 34.5 kV and
13.$ kV, 390 MVA at 69 kV, 80 MVA at 34.5 kV, and
low voltage distribution expansion;
d)   Communications and
Control              extension of communications and telemetering
system facilities and equipment; and
e)   Buildings:            including a new headquarters and dispatching
complex to be initiated in late 1978.
4.02      For financial planning purposes, the above works, estimated to cost
Cr$7120 billion (US$785 million) during the period, have been grouped into
two packages. The most important is (a), which accounts for 53 of 1976-79
expenditures, and which was the subject of a detailed appraisal by the Inter-
American Development Ban" in September 1975. A summary description of the project
is given in Annex 4. The second group of works (including the proposed Bank
project) consists of the items under (b) through (e). While the works other
than the proposed Bank project (see Annex 5) have not been appraised in detail,
they constitute a rational and well-balanced program to meet the expected growth
in demand in COPEL's service area as described in paragraphs 5.03-5.
The Project
4.03      The project proposed fo- Bank financing (consisting of urgent distribu-
tion works to be initiated prior to 1978 for which alternative financing has not
been arranged) would account for '25% of 1976-79 construction expenditures.  It
would consist of the followi.ng facilities, described in detail in Annex 6:
a)   Subtransmission:
i)   50 circuit-k,m of 138 kV tie lines-;
ii)   construction, expansion and/or improvements of nine 138 kV
substations, including addition of 305 MVA transformer capacity;
iii)   installation of about 300 MVA in transformer capacity at 69 kV; and



- 11 -
iv)   installation of about 80 MVA in transformer capacity at 34.5 kV.
b)   Distribution:
i)   166 circuit-km of 69 kV line extensions;
ii)   installation of about 4,560 transformers (13.8 kV/220 - 120 V)
and 200 transformers (34.5 kV/220-120V) with an aggregate
capacity of about 260 MVA;
iii)   installation of about 130 lm of 13.8 kV feeders;
iv)   installation of about 1,900 km of line extensions (1 ,040 km
at 34.5 kV and 860 km at 13.8 kV);
v)  installation of about 3,100 new 34.5 kV and 13.8 WV circuits
(340 m average length);
vi)  improvement of about 1,630 existing 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV circuits
(340 m average length);
vii)   installation of about 145,000 watt hour meters (124,700 single
phase, 20,300 polyphase);
viii)   replacement of about 85,000 meters (75,000 single phase,
10,000 polyphase);
ix)   installation of about 135,000 street lights.
c)   Auxiliary services:
i)   expansion of meter laboratory facilities and equipment;
ii)   supplementary transmission and subtransmission maintenance
and system protection and operation equipment, including
energized-line maintenance equipment;
d)   Consultant services and training:
equipment fabrication inspections outside of Brazil by COPEL's
consultants (60 man-months) plus training of COPEL's staff which
would take place during these inspections.
4.04      The project's estimated cost is US$188.4 million with a US$52.0
million foreign component, which would be financed by the proposed loan. The
project costs were estimated by COPEL's engineering and procurement personnel
using as a basis recent equipment quotations and current civil works contracts.
These costs which are detailed in Annexes 6 and 7 and suwmarized below, appear
reasonable.

4.05      A physical contingency allowance of 5% was assumed for all electrical
equipment and materials. The allowance for civil works and equipment erection
varied from 10% to 15% depending on the state of preparation of final designs
of individual components, and it averaged 11 .5%. The values assumed are considered
reasonable for this type of project.
4.06      The costs shown above are based on price levels as of December 1975, to
which adequate price contingencies have been added to cover actual and expected
foreign and local price increases, as follows:

While the local price increases shown above (which are expressed in US$) appear
high, COPEL has adopted them in view of recent experience with prices of civil works,
structural fabrication and erection in Southern Brazil-which make up a substantial
part of the costs concerned. These local price contingencies do not affect the size
of the proposed Bank loan, which is related to the project's foreign cost.



_  3_
Engineering
4.07      COFEL's own staff will be responsible for engineering designs, specifi-
cations and construction supervision for the whole project. This staff is
competent and is expected to carry out these tasks satisfactorily. COPEL will
use the services of its consultant, Companhia Auxiliar de Eapresas Eletricas
Brasileiras (CAEEB) in the preparation of bidding documents for procurement
through international competitive bidding and in equipment fabrication inspections.
It has been estimated (para. 4.03(d)) that 60 man-months will be required for
equipment fabrication inspections outside Brazil. The average cost, excluding
travel expenses and subsistence,has been estimated at US$4,700 per man-month,
as shown in Annex 6.
Project Execution
4.08      The project will be executed as follows:
(a) COFEL will obtain bids for electrical equipment, materials and
instruments and, as it has been its practice in transmission
and distribution, will contract with local firms construction
of most of the project works. Equipment installations will be
done in most instances by the suppliers. Some construction and
equipment installation will also be performed by COPEL's own forces.
A sufficient number of qualified local firms are available to handle
the job satisfactorily and on schedule.
(b) COPEL will assign the inspection of the fabrication of all electrical
equipment and instruments in Brazil and abroad to CAEEB, who will
also train COPEL's engineering personnel in these activities.
The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1979. Annex 11 contains a
project implementation schedule which was reviewed with COPEL during
negotiations and will serve as a basis for project progress reporting.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      Procurement of the bulk of the electrical equipment, materials and
instruments to be financed by the Bank will be through international competitive
bidding (ICB) and in accordance with guidelines for procurement under Bank
loans. Special imported metering and protection equipment that is not suitable
for ICB because of the need to maintain standardization will be purchased
directly at an estimated cost of US$1.8 million. A similar procedure would
be followed with miscellaneous items of imported equipment aggregating up to
US$0.8 million which are required in small quantities throughout the execution
of the project, making ICB impractical. No retroactive financing or financing
of interest during construction with Bank funds is contemplated. Suppliers
whose bids contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of
the value of the bid would be given a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable
custom duties, whichever is lower. Brazilian suppliers of the items included in the
project are reasonably competitive. Project cost estimates have been based on the



_ 14-
assumption that they would be awarded up to two-thirds of the value of
contracts placed through ICB. Project items not financed by the Bank will
be procured through COFEL's normal procedures, which are satisfactory.
COPEL maintains a roster of qualified local contractors and suppliers, and
invites an appropriate number to submit detailed quotations for each supply
or construction contract. Brazilian legislation effectively precludes ICB
for project items not financed by long-term foreign loans. However, as noted
above, locally produced items are reasonably competitive in price with
international products and project costs should not increase significantly
as a result of such restrictions.
4.10      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made for:
(a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment and materials,
or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured goods;
(b) 100% of the cost incurred outside of Brazil by consultants and
COEEL personnel during equipment fabrication inspections.
Estimated loan disbursements appear in Annex 8. Because of the on-going nature
of investments in distribution, any funds remaining undisbursed at the completion
of the project could be applied, after agreement with the Bank, to other works
of similar naturei
Environment
4.11      COPEL has carried out its previous projects with due regard to
environmental factors. Under the proposed project, utility poles for feeders
in Londrina and Ponta Grossa will be relocated to improve traffic safety in
congested areas. In Curitiba, the second stage of the underground distribution
network will contribute substantially toward improvement in system losses and
service reliability. COPEL will give special attention to reducing the network's
adverse visual effect in the most congested zone of the state's capital.

5. Justification of the Project
Project Objectives
5.01      The project is a part of a large construction progran being undertaken
by COPEL to provide the power facilities needed to support a continuation of
the rapid expansion of Parana's industrial sector in recent years. This indus-
trial growth has been especially notable in the years 1972-75 and has been
linked to the development of Parana's agricultural and forestry sectors. The
processing industries for these sectors account for 60% of industrial power
consumption in the state. While the largest industrial enterprises could
continue to meet their needs for electric power through captive generation,
medium- and small-scale industries would in many cases find this alternative
to be excessively costly. Failure to expand these industries would affect the
prospects for further development of agriculture.
5.02      The main thrust of the project would be the provision of the essential
transmission and distribution infrastructure needed to support the growth of
industry and the accompanying needs for increased commercial and residential
service in the state. Parana has received considerable immigration in recent
years and is developing into an alternative growth pole outside Brazil's
traditional industrial areas. The project would also improve efficiency and
reliability through reduced losses and outages and better voltage regulation
and provide service to low-income households.
Load Forecast
5.03     In order to determine its market requirements, COPEL prepared projections
for the whole state of Parana broken down by consumer category. Normal indus-
trial energy requirements were forecast based on trends in the Parana industrial
sector taking into account the growth in number of employees and investments
in the sector.  In addition, known short-term industrial loads were included.
Residential consumption was forecast on the basis of:
(a) volume and distribution of urban population at the municipality
level during 1960-1980;
(b) the number of households;
(c) past trends in the level of residential energy consumption, adjusted
to growth in (MP.
5.04      Commercial cansumption was estimated by correlation with residential
figures. Public lighting requirements were estimated through correlation with
residential consumption adjusted in accordance with existing municipal public
sector investment programs. Rural consumption was forecast on the basis of
existing government programs.
5.05      Based on the above, COPEL is projecting an average growth in the
Parana state power market of 13.5% p.a. for the period 1975-80 (compared to
15.-3 p.a. in 1972-74). This projection, which is detailed in Annex 2, is



. 16 -
reasonable. Industrial consumption is expected to continue to be the fastest-
growing category (16.9w p.a. in 1975-80 vs. 17.3% p.a. in 1972-74). This high
expected growth of industrial ccnsumiption reflrects the rapid development of
agricultural processing (about 60% of industrial consumption) and other
industries in the state. COPEL has recently received service requests from
existing and future industrial consumers totalling about 370 MW for the period
1976-1980 which would account for the total growth of industrial sales projected
during this period. The main thrust of COPEL's investment program is to provide
the necessary generation, transmission and distribution facilities to meet
this load and the growth in commercial and residential consumption which will
accompany it. COPEL's energy balance is shown in Annex 3. After 1980, the
Foz do Areia hydroelectric project, under execution, by COPEL, will provide
incremental generation needed in the Parana state market. Since transmission
facilities of this project (500 kV) are under the jurisdiction and would be
built by ELETROSUL, assurances were obtained from ELETROBRAS for the timely
ccnstruction of the line from the plant to Curitiba, COPEL's main load center.
Least-Cost Solution
5.o6      As noted in paragraph 2.11, Foz do Areia is part of the least-cost
generation expansion program for the South-Southeast interconnected system.
5.07      In routing transmission lines and siting substations, COPEL has
selected the least-cost solution compatible with applicable zoning and other
regulations in all cases in which alternatives existed. The 1976-79 transmis-
sion and distribution program should enable COPEL to meet the expected load
growth without reduction in the quality of service. The transformer/demand
ratio at 138/69 kV would be maintained at an adequate level of 1.15.
Return on Investment
5.08     In view of the complexity cf the systems effects, and ot the difficulty
in interpretation, an internal rate of return on the project has not been calcu-
lated. However, a rate of return on the overall investment program has been
estimated. This return has been evaluated as shown in Annex 14, by equalizing
the present worth of the revenues derived from incremental output and the present
worth of costs, defined to include not only those costs directly related to the
distribution project itself, but also incremental generation and transmission
costs.  Under these assumptions, the rate of return amounts to 19.5%, which
suggests that on average the price that consumers will be requested to pay for
power will be considerably in excess of incremental system costs.  This in turn
suggests that wasteful use of electricity will be avoided. A sensitivity analysis
was also carried out to determine the effect of reduction in sales of 10%. The
resulting rate of return would be 18:b.  Furthermore, if the cost of the pro ject
were to increase by 10% and sales followed the low forecast, the return (J7A
would remain higher than the opportunity cost of capital in Brazil.

6. Finances
Summary
6.01      COPEL's financial performance has been satisfactory and is expected
to continue to be strong. During the project construction years (1976-79)
COPEL would finance a satisfactory28 % of its overall long-term investment
requirements with funds contributed directly by its customers through tariffs
and sales taxes. Annex 12 contains actual and forecast financial statements
for the period 1972-80, together with details on COPEL's finances which sup-
plement the analysis presented below.
Past and Present Financial Performance
6.02      During the period 1972-75 COPEL's financial performance has been
satisfactory and its present capital structure is strong. Since 1972 it
has achieved an average rate of return on its revalued "remunerable assets"
(see Annex 10), of 10.5%. The rate of return on average net fixed assets
in operation averaged 1i.9% over the same period.
6.03      COPEL's cash management is good.  Cash balances are kept at a
minimum while temporary excess cash is invested in short-term securities.
On December 31, 1975, COPEL had a comfortable debt-to equity ratio of 37/63
which is indicative of an ample borrowing capacity.
6.04      At year-end 1974 accounts receivable from customers were excessive.
This was due almostexclusively to temporarily overdue receivables from state
government agencies and from a construction firm experiencing financial
difficulties. During 1975, however, a clearing mechanism for official
customer accounts was instituted to ensure their timely settlement. As a
result, overdue receivables from official customers have declined significantly.
Although it is reasonable to expect that in the future the level of accounts
receivable would not exceed significantly the amount of the normal collection
lag, COPEL's collection performance will be monitored in the course of loan
supervision. The ratio of receivables to billings has therefore been included
in the project performance indicators listed in Annex 9.
Capital Investment and Financing Plan
6.o5      COPEL's capital investment program during the construction of the
Bank project (1976-79) and the respective financing plan are detailed in Annex
12 and summarized below:

6.o6      A satisfactory proportion (28%) of COPEL's capital requirements during
the project construction period, would. be covered by resources contributed directly
by its customers (net internal cash generation and reinvestment of the proceeds
of the sole tax). Capital contributions (mainly in the form of equity subscrip-
tions by the State of Parana in connection with the Foz do Areia project) would
cover11% of requirements and borrowings the remaining 61%.



_ 19 _
6.07      The largestedement in COPEL's future borrowings is the financing
required for the Foz do Areia project. As explained in paragraph 6 of Annex
12, about 18% of the total financial requirements of this project are
presently planned to be covered by foreign borrowings (including a loan
of US$74 million from IDB and suppliers' credits). Another 52% of the
requirements will be met through borrowings from ELETROBRAS and other Federal
financing agencies. Equity contributions from the State of Parana and COPEL's
own internal cash generation would meet 30% of the project's requirements.
6.08      The borrowing required for works other than Foz do Areia includes
the proposed Bank loan (see para 6.10) and other borrowings of Cr$797 million
(US$88 million) detailed in paragraph 7 of Annex 12. As noted in that para-
graph, COPEL presently expects to secure those funds from Brazilian sources.
COPEL is also considering borrowing a part of this amount for
foreign exchange expenditures (other than those financed by the proposed IBRD
loan) from foreign financial institutions. The Bank would be prepared to assist
COPEL in securing better terms for these borrowings than would otherwise be
available, through suitable co-financing arrangements.  The form of these
arrangements would be similar to those entered into in connection with the
recent Brazilian steel project.
6.o9      The table in paragraph 6.05 is based on COPEL's financial projections
which, like those of other power utilities in Brazil financed by the Bank, are
based on constant (December 1975) cruzeiros. This means that capital investment
figures as well as the Bank and other loans do not include price contingencies.
The reconciliation between the distribution project expenditures and proposed
Bank loan figures shown in paragraph 6.05 with the cost estimate presented
in paragraph 4.04 (which includes price contingencies) is as follows:

6.10      The proposed US$52 million Bank loan would be made to COPEL for a term
of 20 years including 3-1/2 years of grace. The financial projections are based
on an interest rate for the Bank loan of 8.5% p.a.
Financial Outlook
6.11      COPEL's financial projections are reasonable and'indicate a satisfactory



- 20 -
financial outlook. The rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation is expected to average 15.E% during the project construction period
(1976-79) and debt service coverage to exceed 1.6 times.  This favorable out-
look depends on the continued application of the existing power sector tariff
legislation described in para.2.16, and on receipt of the resources from
Federal agencies and the State government included in the financing plan.
To this end, the State of Parana has agreed: (i) to reinvest in the capital
stock of COPEL all dividends received from the utility up to December 31, 1979;
and (ii) in the event that COPEL has insufficient funds, to provide all funds
which may be required for the carrying out of the IBRD project and to ensure the timey
completion of the Foz do Areia project. The Federal Government has undertaken that,
in the event that the funds provided by the State are inadequate for the carrying
out of the IBRD project, it will makE arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
for the provision of these funds. The Federal government has entered into
a similar undertaking with the IDB fcr the Foz do Areia project.
6.12      COPEL is expected to maintain a sound capital structure, with a long-
term debt to equity ratio which would not exceed W5/56 during the project
construction period (1976-79). COPEL agreed not to incur debt without the
Bank's consent if by such incurrence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of its total
fixed assets; and not to incur debt with an original term of less than 8 years
without the Bank's consent if by so doing the total outstanding principal
of such debt would exceed 5% of its total fixed assets.
6.13      As in the case of similar Bank loans to the Brazilian electric power
sector, COPEL agreed not to carry out any major program of expansion of its
facilities other than the program described in paragraph 4.01, without giving
the Bank evidence that such expansion is economically justified, that
adequate financial resources are available and that it conforms to the power
expansion program for the South/Southeast prepared by ELETROBRAS. For this
purpose, a major expansion is one whose cost exceeds 2% of the gross fixed assets
in operation plus work in progress in the case of generation and transmission
projects, and 1% in the case of distribution projects.

7. Agreements Reached and Recommendations
7.01      In the proposed loan agreement COPEL would agree:
(a)  to maintain its earnings (including transfers from the Global Guarantee
Fund) at levels consistent with sound financial and public utility
practices and in accordance with current legislation; to
maintain its eligibility for transfers from the Fund (should they be
required); anx  changes in legislaticn which would mat.erially
and adversely affect COPEL's financial position wiald be an event of
default (paragraph 2.18);
(b)  to continue to have its financial statements audited by independent
accountants satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 3.05);
(c) to carry out a program to provide electric power to low-income households
(paragraph 3.09);
(d)  not tr. incur debt wit.hout the Bani-Is concurrence if by
such incurrence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of its total net fixed
assets; and not to incur debt with an original term of less than 8
years if by so doing the total outstanding principal of such debt
would exceed 5% of its total net fixed assets (paragraph 6.12); and
(e)  not to carry out any major expansions without giving the Ban" evidence
that such expansion is economically justified, that adequate financial
resources are available, and that it is in accordance with plans for
the south-southeastern regions approved by ELETROBRAS (paragraph 6.13).
7.02      In the proposed project agreement the Government of the state of Parana
would agree:
(.a) to reinvest in the capital stock of COPEL all the dividends received
from the utility up to December 31, 1979 (paragraph 6.11); and
(b)  zn Wile event that COPEL has insufficient funds, to provide all the
funds which may be required for the carrying out of the IBRD project
and for the timely completion of the Foz do Areia hydroelectric project
(paragraph 6.11).
7.03      Ir. the proposed guarantee agreement the Federal Government would agree:
(a)  to cause UNAIE to take timely action on COPEL's applications for power
tariff adjustments or transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund
(paragraph 2.18);
(b)  to present to the Ban' the terms of reference and the results of the
tariff structure study (paragraph 2.20);
(c) in the event that the funds available to COPEL, including those
provided by the state government,are insufficient to complete the
IBRD project, to make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
provision of those funds (paragraph 6.11).



7.04      In the proposed supplementary letter, COPEI and the Federal Government
would confirm the Banlts understanding that COPEL's revenues (together with
transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund, if required) should be sufficient
to earn a statutory return of 10i on its remuperable investment (paragraph 2.18).
7.05      The project would constitute a suitable basis for a Ban', loan of
US$52 million for a term of 20 years including 3-1/2 years of grace.

FOZ DO AREIf HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        Project description
The project consists of the construction of a dam, powerhouse and
step-up substation on the Iguassu River, a shat distance dowTnstream from its
confluence with the Areia River.  The dam will, be concrete-face roclrfill,
800 m long and 15~ m high, and will create a reservoir 110 1m long with a
surface of 197 'km and a volume of 7.3 billion m3. The powerhouse will be
built to contain six 375 MW turbine and generator units (final capacity 2,250
wd t.h three units being installed initially (1,125 M4).  Two of these
umi t.s are scheduled to begin operation in 1980 annl the thiri in 1981

CONSULTANT SERVICES AND TRAINING PROGRAM
1. Consultant Services
1.01      On the basis of a fabrication period of 2 years (January 1, 1977
to December 31, 1978), consulting services for fabrication inspections out-
side Brazil were estimated as follows:
-Consultants based outside Brazil:
Salary and overhead              US$4,715
Living allowance at US$70/day   US$2,129
US$6,8)4/man-month
48 man-months (2 consultants)                              US$328,512
-Consultants based in Brazil (foreign costs only)
Living expenses at US$70/day    US$2,129/man-month
12 man-months                                              US$ 25,548
Travel:  4 round trips at US$1,000                         US$  4,000
Sub-total                 US$358,o60
Contingencies             US$ 11 940
Total           US$370O000
1.02      The total cost for these consulting services represent 2.1% of the
costs in contracts for equipment and materials expected to go to foreign
suppliers. The amount allocated is reasonable since the cost of these ser-
vices normally range between 1% and 3% of the contract price of the equipment
and materials.
2. Training Program
2.01      COFEL has prepared a training program for its personnel in con-
junction with the activities of its consultant (CAEEB) to allow them to
achieve experience in the preparation of bidding documents and in equipment
fabrication inspections. The costs of the training program outside Brazil
appear below:
Living expenses at US$70/day    US$2,129/man-month
- Fabrication inspections (96 man--months)                   US$204,384
- Designs and manufacturing processes at manufacturer's
plants (32 man-months)                                     US$ 68,128
- Travel, 12 round-trips at US$1,000                         US$ 12,000
Sub-total                 US$284,512
Contingencies             US$ 15,488
Total            US$300,000

ELECTRICIT'Y TARIFFS
1 .       Conswners of electricity in Brazil are subject to the following
charges:
A - the basic tariffs
B - The sole tax
C - The compulsory loan
D - A social security tax
A.   The  Basic Tariffs
Background
2.        Electricity charges in Brazil have been governed for over :forty years
by the Water Code as amended from time to time.  Regulatory p  ers have been
vested in the M4inistry of Mines and Energy, which since 1969 has been exercising
its authority through the National Department of Water and Electric Energy (fNAEE).
Since the adoption of the water Code in 1934, electricity tariffs have
been based on a service-at-cost principle.  Noteworthy amendments have been:
the introduction in  9X11 (Decreto--Lei tic.. 31 28) of a rate of return on assets
olf up to 10(; the introduction in 1957 (Decre-to No. 41019) of the concept of a
"guarantood. rate of return on the historic asset cost; the authorization in
1964 (Decreto No. 54938) to revalue assets to reflect price level changes; the
ma'-ing in 1966 (Lei No. 5073) of such asset revaluation mandatory; the raising
in 1971 (Lei No. 5655) of the allowed rate of return on revalued "remunerable
assets" (see paragraph 12) from 10% to 12o~ at UlAEE's discretion; the introduction in
1973 (Lei 5899) of the concept of cross-subsidization; and the enactment into la.w in
197L (Decreto-Lei 1383) of the objective of tariff equalization.
4.        The guiding force in the evolution of Brazilian tariff legislation
has been recognition of the need to mobil.ize massive financial resources through
conswrvser charges to support sector growth.  A noteworthy departure was in
1959-1 963--the period of rampant inflation--when tariff levels were allowed
to lag substmnti.al- behind soaring price levels, wlth the result that sector
expansion caime to   virtual halt, particularly the extension of the distribution
networ'ks.  With the implementation of asset revaluation in 196L;-1966, sector
developfrent gatherei theimomentum whicl-i produced the impressive 10.1:. average
innual growth in installedI capacity over the last decade to l'eep abreast of
growth in gross electric-ity consuwption of 9.2Z  over the period--12.3  annually
over the last five years.
In 1 973 the tariff authorities began implenmenting a government poilcy
intendeti to reduce regional inequalities and to promote, over the longer run,



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 7
a more geographically balanced economic growth.  To achieve this objective,
tariffs are being set collectively within regions rather than by utility as had been
done heretofore. This collective rate setting was also designed to induce
gains in operating efficiency.  When the rate unification effort was well
underway, however, Brazil was canfronted with the energy crisis and the
attending generalized price inflation and tightening of world financial
markets. Rekindled domestic inflation together with the fact that electricity
tariff levels in any given year reflect asset revaluation coefficients for
the proceding year, caused  tariff   increases   in 1973 and 1974 to again
lag substantially behind the general price increases. The reference price for
l4h for the whole of Brazil excluding surcharges (tarifa fiscal - see para. 14)
decreased from about US3.6 cents in 1972 to US2.9 cents in 1974. The lower
revenues together with rapidly increasing operating costs brought about a
liquidity squeeze, which became particularly acute in those utilities engaged
in the construction of large generation projects characterized by long
gestation periods and which faced substantial project cost overruns. This
also caused returns on remunerable assets for the comparativelyv higher cost/
financially less efficient utilities well below the 10iS minimum. Although
tariff legislation provides that the shortfalls may be carried forward to
be offset over time against future surplus eturns, the magnitude of the short-
falls and their widespread occurrence rendered this practice incongruent with
the service-at-cost system.
6.        Sector finances  were  also  affected  since,  as will  be
seen later, overall sector revenues vary in direct proportion to changes in
the average price per kWh. Sector revenues decreased at the time when they
were most needed and when it became increasingly difficult to secure borrowings
on suitable terms. Overall sector revenues decreased from Cr.8.2 billion in
1973 to Cr.7.5 billion in 1974, both expressed in 1974 cruzeiros.
7.        Faced with (a) an expected growth in electricity consumption at an
even higher rate (13% p.a.) than in the last decade and (b) little prospects
of favorable changes in the world panorama in the foreseeable future, and
convinced that the most appropriate means of achieving an orderly, increasing
utilization of Brazil's vast hydroelectric potential is through the maintenance
of a realistic pricing policy assuring the sector an adequate supply of long-
term resources commensurate with its massive investment requirements, the
Brazilian authorities adopted the following principal measures:
(i)  the granting of gradual tariff increases at higher rates than those
affecting the domestic general price level, and which in 1975 caused
the reference price per KWh to adevelop as follows:
Cr cents     U.S. cents
1st Quarter                    21 .0          2.71
2nd Quarter                    23.5           2.91
3rd Quarter                    28.0           3.29
4th Quarter                    30.3           3.34



ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 7
(ii)  the granting, beginning July 1, 1975, of discounts equivalent to
20% for residential consumers within the 30 kWh/month minimum
consumption, and to 10% for low tension rural consumers.
(iii) the freezing until 1983 at the 1974 level (32.5%) of the compulsory
loan (see paragraph 15) rate applicable to industrial consumers,
which was on an annually declining scale until its elimination in
1984.
(iv) the establishment of a cross-subsidization mechanism, the "Guarantee
Fund", to harmonize the rate equalization effort with the service-
at-cost principle. This is accomplished by the funding of the
"Guarantee Fund" through a surcharge of up to 26 on assets in operation
and using the proceeds to supplement tariff revenues to increase
the returns of qualifying utilities earning less than the 10% minimum.
(v)  the adoption by nIAEE of a number of strict measures aimed at
controlling the operating efficiency of those concessionaires benefit-
ting from the cross-subsidization mechanism, including the rationaliza-
tion of their investments and the maximization of the use of sector
revenues to meet sector expansion requirements. Utilities falling
under these measures, mostly distribution companies, are restricted
from increasing their operating costs, undertaking investments and
expanding their markets without INAEE s prior approval, and their
majority governmental shareholders must maintain their service accounts
current and reinvest their dividends.
(vi) the standardization of straight line depreciation at mandatory rates
of year-end gross fixed assets of 5% (up to 5% previously) for thermal
installations and 3% (up to 3%) for hydro installations and other
equipment.
8.        In addition, ELETROBRAS is seeking that it be permitted to continue
to utilize a high proportion of the federal government's share of the sole tax,
which according to present legislation is to be transferred in annually increasing
proportions to other sectors through the recently created National Development
Fund (paragraph 14).
9.        This is the first time that INAEE has set out to exercise its
controlling powers in a comprehensive manner. In preparation for this tasLr
DNAEE has been strengthening its staff with tariff specialists drawn mainly
from the concessionaires' ranks.
The Present Tariff Level System
10.       The law provides that tariffs should be set at such levels as to cover:
(a) operating, maintenance and administrative expenses;
(b) taxes other than on income (mainly property taxes);



ANIN EX 10
Page S of 7
(c) foreign exchange losses arising from the service of borrowings in
foreign exchange;
(d) straight line depreciation of estimated year-end gross fixed assets
in operation (land excluded) at the mandatory rates already mentioned
(point vi, paragraph 7);
(e)  reversion (defined in paragraph 11) of between 3% and 5% of the
estimated year-end utility plant in service, less the sum of
accumulated advances, contributions and grants ("investimento
reversivel"); and
(f)  a legal return ("remuneragao legal") of up to 12% of remunerable
investment ("investimento remuneravel", defined in paragraph 12), at
DNAEE's discretion.
11.       Beginning January 1975, (Decreto-Lei 1383) reversion ("Reserva Global
de Reversao") consists of:
(a) a tax levied by the Federal Government tD secure funds to compensate
private concessionaires for their assets when their concessions revert
to, or are taken over by, the Government. This tax currently amounts
to % of the corresponding asset base ("investimento reversivel",
defined in the previous paragraph). Its proceeds are administered by
ELETROBRAS, which channel the funds to support investments by the
public concessionaires, mostly by the large, federally-owned genera-
tion concessionaires; and
(b) thte contributions to the Guarantee Fund (mentioned in point (iv) of
paragraph 7), a redistributive mechanism made necessary by the rate
equalization effort, whereby tariff revenues are channelled from the
more financially efficient utilities to those which achieve a return
(before this transfer) below the 10% minimum. All utilities are
subject to this contribution, which may be of up to 2% of the reversion
base at ENAkE's discretion. Monthly transfers from this fund are
only authorized to those qualifying utilities which, on a month-to-
month basis, submit evidence satisfactory to ENAEE of their adherence
to the controlling measures mentioned in point (v) of paragraph 7.
12.       Remunerable investment ("investimento remuneravel") is calcuAed as
the difference between:
(a)   the sum of:
(i)  the revalued gross book value of the utility plant in service!/;
/ Up to 1975 DNAEE had accepted year-end values, but it is now adjusting them
to reflect the period of time plant added during the year has been in operation.



ANNEX 1 0
Page 5 of 7
(ii) an allowance for inventory;
(iii) an allowance for other net working capital items; and
(b)  (i)  accumulated (revalued) depreciation and amortization l;
(ii) the year-end surplus/(deficit) arising from the difference of
prior year's actual returns and the allowed legal returns;
(iii)  the year-end sum of advances, contributions and grants.
13.       Sector legislation provides that concessionaires should apply to
IIAEE every three years for a revision of their tariff level.  Up through 1974,
revisions were made annually on the basis of applications prepared by the
concessionaires using asset revaluation coefficients prepared by Government
authorities, reflecting price level changes during the preceding year. Con-
cessionaires were authorized to add interim surcharges  to the basic tariff
approved by INAEE to compensate for increases in wages,social benefits, fuel
costs, cost of purchased power and increases in foreign exchange debt service
arising from fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates. Beginning in 1975,
tariff level adjustments are made entirely at DNAEE's initiative, based not
on the concessionaires' actual tariff calculations as before, but on selected
cost and investment data which all concessionaires must now submit on a
monthly basis to INAEE.  In 1975 four general tariff increases were authorized
by IINAEE (January, June, September and December).
Other Charges
B. The Sole Tax (Imposto Unico, IUEE)
14.       This is i;ax originally imposed to provide additional financial resources
for the sector.  Since 1972 (Lei 5655) this tax applies to canmercial and
residential consumers only. The rates applicable are 60% (commercial consumers)
and 50% (residential consumers) of the "tarifa fiscal", a country-wide reference
electricity tariff calculated every three months by INAEE. Consumers not
reaching the minimum 30 kWh/month level are exempt for this tax. The proceeds
from this tax are distributed 40% to Federal agencies, 50% to the States and
10% to the municipalities. The funds returned to the States are prorated among
them on the basis of their area (20%), their population (60%), their electric
power generation (2%), their electricity consumption (15%) and their total
flooded areas (reservoirs) (3%). Through 1973, the funds allocated to Federal
agencis were distributed as follows:  ELETROBRAS (37%), DNAEE (2%) and Ministry
of Mines and Energy - MME (1%).  Beginning in 1974, the funds allocated to the
sector are on the following declining scale ():
1/ Amortization was charged instead of reversion before 1971. Its accumulated
value as of that year, as revalued, is kept on utilities' books and treated
as a deduction from plant in source. Reversion is not treated in this way.

Thus, the share of the sector in the portion allocated to the Federa.l. Goverrunert
is to be reduced by 50% over a five-year period.
C.   The Compulsory Loan (Emnprestimo Compulsorio)
15.       This forced investment scheme was also established to supplement sector
resources and, like the sole tax, is based on the "tarifa fiscal" mentioned in
the previous paragraph.  It applies to industrial consumers only, at the rate
of 32.5% from 1975 to 1983 as currently established by Law (previously at 35%
until 1974 and on an annually declining scale until its elimination in 1984,
point (iii) of paragraph 7). The law requires that industrial consumers take
20-year, 6% interest bearing bonds issued by ELETROBRAS, and which are subject
to monetary correcticai. Compulsory loan proceeds are to be allocated by
ELETTROBRAS as follows:
(a)  50, h for investment in hydroelectric plants in the Parana lRiver basin,
mainly Itaipui.
(b)  15% for investment. in hydroelectric plants in the Sao Francisco River
basin.
(c)  10%' for additional, capital subscription in ELETRONORTE, and
(d) 25,' for the construction of regional transmission systems in extra
highi voltage and in the development of the nuclear power plant program.
(Previously, 50% of the funds collected from each State had to be invested in
the respective state-owned power distribution concessionaire).
D.   Social Security Tax
1C.       Al] consumers are required to pay this tax at the rate of 1% of their
power bills (% before June 1973).
Financial Impact

1974:

18.         The concessionairest average revenue(US2.94 cents/kWh) is comparable
to that experienced in advanced industrialized countries. The consurrer contribu-
tions (US1 .20 cents/kIWIl or 41%) over and above the cost of service results from
the Government policy of having sector finances rely on stable, internally
generated long-term funds, rather than depend to any sizeable extent on govern-
ment budget allocations or capital market resources.  The following table
summarizes the sectors' sources and applications of funds in 1974 and those

FINANCES
Introduction
1.       This Annex contains details on COPEL's finances which supplement the
analysis in Section 6 of the text, together with the foIlowing financial tables:
Table 1 - Key Financial Indicators 1971-80
Table 2 - Cost of Service 1975-80
Table 3 - Income Statements 1971-80
Table 4 - Balance Sheets 1971-80
Table 5 - Long-term Debt, 12/31/74
Table 6 - Sources and Applications of Funds 1975-80
Table 7- Debt Service 1975-80
2.       Attachment 8 contains notes on the financial statements and the
assumptions underlying the forecasts.
Financial Performance
3.       COPEL's financial performance is reflected in the financial indicators
shown in Table 1. The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation
averaged 14.90/o in the period 1972-75. COPEL did not charge adequate deprecia-
tion on its fixed assets in operation prior to 1975 (Table 1). However, DNAEE
has now standardized depreciation rates for all Brazilian utilities at a satis-
factory level (30/o p.a. of year-end assets, except for thermal plant, which is
depreciated at 5/o p.a.) and future depreciation charges should be adequate.
The rates of return shown in Table 1 have been calculated using a notional
depreciatiori rate of 30/0 of average gross fixed assets in operation, in order
to make them comparable to those of other utilities in developing countries.
jrti.ation and Reversior, eserves and i.eversion Payments
4.       Up to January 1972, Brazilian legislation required power utilities to
provide, in addition to depreciation, for an amortization reserve calculated as
a percentage of gross operating assets. Such reserve was then replaced by monthly
"reversion" contributions to an inter-utility fund administered by ELETROBRAS.
Such "Global Reversion Fund" provides ELETROBRAS with resources to support and
coordinate sector investments of national interest.  Since January 1975, ELETROBRAS
allocates a portion of the "reversion" receipts into an inter-utility compensatory
scheme called "Global Guarantee Fund"  (Reserva Global de Garantia).  Eligible
power companies not reaching the legal 100/o return on remunerable assets are
compensated out of this Guarantee Reserve. D(ring 1975 COPEL received 36 million
cruzeiros out of the reserve. See Annex 10, para. ll.

Accounts Receivable - Customers
5.       As explained in para. 6.'04 of the text, there has been a significant
improvement in collections from official customers. The amount overdue has
fallen from 530/o of accounts receivable from these customers in August to
210/o in December.
The balance of this account, as of August 31, 1975 was the following:

The amount of overdue receivables from all customers, Cr$19,8 million, is equivalent
to 2.1/o of annual sales revenues, which is reasonable.
Financing Plan - Foz do Areia
6.       The financing plan for the Foz do Areia project is based on IDB Report
PRlt-7114-A dated November 25, 1975, adjusted to reflect December 1975 prices. The
key elements of the financing plan are reflected in the following table:

An additional US$183 million (Cr$1,660 million), of which US$141 million (Cr$1,279)
is required in 1976-79, will be needed to finance price contingencies.  These -re
expected to be covered in 1976-79 by the ID3 loan: US$10 million (Cr$91 million);
net internal cash generation: US$7 million (Cr$63 million); and equity contributions:
iTjq.On ml11ion (Cr$ch44 minllijon) and loans .'rom ELETROMRAS and other federal agencies:
US$64 million (Cr$581 million).



ANNEX 12
Page 4 of 5 pages
The IDB loan would be used to finance turbines and regulators and
miscellaneous electrical equipment. The suppliers/bilateral credits would cover
generators and auxiliary equipment. Loans from specialized Brazilian federal
financing agencies will finance local currency expenditures such as engineering
and supervision, miscellaneous equipment procured in Brazil and field housing.
The ELETR03RAS loan will cover local purchases, civil works and financial changes
during construction (including interest on other domestic loans which do not cover
interest). As explained in Annex 10, ELETROBRAS' resources are derived largely
from power consumers. The assumed terms and conditions on all these borrowings
are in line with those currently applied by the respective lenders to power
utilities in Brazil.
COPEL's contribution from its own resources (8% of total project
cost) and the State of Parana's capital contribution would cover the balance
of the local currency requirements and foreign exchange expenditures not covered
by external sources. About half of COPEL's contribution would be to cover costs
of engineering and administration, largely by its own staff. COPEL recently
completed (as ELETROSULts agent) the construction of another large hydroelectric
project on the Iguassu River - Salto Osorio, which was partly financed by
loan 728-BR.
Most (92%) of the project's financing will be provided by sources
external to COPEL. This is appropriate since under the Brazilian power sector
legislation (see Annex 10) generation projects which, like Foz do Areia, are
of interest to more than one state are financed with resources collected from
all power consumers by ELETROBRAS (i.e., the reversion charge, the compulsory
loan, and the sole tax).
IDB estimates that COPEL will have to charge a bulk rate of approximately
USJ2.4/kWh for power sold from Foz do Areia to earn a 12% rate of return on
average net fixed assets in operation, and a slightly lower price to cover cash
operating expenses and debt service.
Financing Plan - Proposed Project and Other Works
7.       In addition to the US$144 million (Cr$1,310 million) required for the
proposed distribution project (Annex 6), COPEL's 1976-79 construction expenditures
for works other than Foz do Areia total US$124 million (Cr$1,123 million). The
financing plan for these works in constant December 1975 prices is as follows:

In addition to the proposed Bank loan and the draw down of an
existing loan from the US Eximbank (made through E RETROBRkS) COPEL needs
to borrow US$83 million (Cr$751 million) for these works. The terms assumed
for these borrowings are those normally applicable to local financing for the
power sector: interest of 11% p.a. (including a 1% administration fee) and
maturity of 9 years, including 3 years of grace. COPEL may borrow a part
of this amount from foreign sources to cover foreign exchange requirements
not financed by the proposed Bank loan, if more favorable terms can be secured.
For the proposed project and other works planned by COPEL, an
additional US$87 million (Cr$790 million) will be required to cover price
contingencies during the 1976-79 period. The provisions of the Brazilian
tariff legislation (Annex 10) should enable COPEL to increase its internal
cash generation including contributions in line with inflation to cover
approximately USW47 million of these expenditures. The IBRD loan would cover
an additional US$3 million of price escalation of the foreign exchange
component of the proposed project.  The balance of US$32 million equivalent,
moatly in local currency, would have to be borrowed from other sources.
COPEL foresees no difficulty in arranging these borrowings.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS
1. General
Financial statements for the 1972-1975 period are based on COPEL's
audited reports.
2.        As it is customary for Brazilian utilities, forecast statements for
the 1976-1980 period are in constant December 31, 1975, Cruzeiros. This is
acceptable since current tariff legislation (see Annex 10) allows for tariff
increases to compensate for inflation.
3.        Gross Fixed Assets include monetary correction, and, in 1975, Cr$67
million on account of exchange adjustments. The amounts allowed by DNAEE
for calculation of remunerable assets are slightly lower than those shown on
the balance sheet, though the difference is not material. See note 9 below.
4.        Depreciation and amortization includes monetary correction.  This
account includes accummulated amortization. See Annex 10, para. 12(b)(i)
and note 9 below.
5.        See Annex 10, para. 12 (b)(ii).
6.        The allowance for working capital is set annually by DNAEE.  In 1975
it was calculated as the sum of the monthly average of inventories and of other
net working capital items (excluding the current portion of long-term debt),
less the year-end cash balance.
7.        See Annex 10, para 12(b)(iii).  This item  is included in "other
liabilities" in the balance sheet.
8.        In 1972-73 DNAEE  deducted from remunerable assets certain assets
which were not being fully utilized.
9.        Fixed asset accounts are forecast as follows:

10.       Accounts receivable were projected based on forecast increases
in sales revenues. They include one month of unbilled sales and approximately
40 days of outstanding billings.
11.       Inventories were projected to increase in line with the increase iA
gross fixed assets in operation.
12.       COPEL pays income tax at a rate of 17% of net income other than that
in which state and municipal shareholders have a proprietary interest (see
note 15).
13. Dividends
COPEL dividends are 6% on common shares and 8% on preferred stock.
As shown in the table below most dividend payments are expected to be re-
invested in COPEL.

23.       See Table 3 for detail  of operating cost.
2)l.      There were large increases in labor expense in 1971-74 largely as a
result of the absorption by COPEL of the other large public power companies
in the state. These utilities, (as noted in para. 3.05) were overstaffed and
COPEL is now conducting a training and redundancy program to eliminate un-
qualified staff. As a result, increases in labor expenses levelled off in
1975. The projection of labor expenses is based on expected increases in
staff (including operating personnel for Foz do Areia from 1980) and assumes
that the labor cost per employee (including salaries and social benefits),
expressed in December 1975 Cr$, will increase by 2.5; p.a. This forecast is
reasonable.

APPRAISAL OF COPEI, DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA PARANAENSE DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (COPEL)
Return on Investment
Introduction
1.       The distribution projezt consists of a segment of COPEL's distribution
expansion. Due to the complexity' of the power generation transmission and
distribution system with which the project would be interconnected, an
economic evaluation of an isolated segment cannot be readily effected. Con-
sequently, the return on investnent was calculated on COPEL's total expansion
program during the period of project execution (July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1979)
by equalizing the present worth of the revenues derived from incremental
output and the present worth of costs, defined to include not only those costs
directly related to the distribution project itself, but also incremental
generation and transmission costs.
2.       Costs are based on values prevailing in December 1975, and benefits
at the electricity tariffs applicable during the third quarter of 1975. For
the nurnose of determining the rate of return a shadow price of Cr$10.9O/US$i/
has been used for the foreign exchange component.
Incremental Energy Expected to be Sold During the Project Period
3.       The expansion of the distribution system to be achieved with the project
would provide the canacity required to meet the load during the period between
July 1, 1976 and June 30, 1979, while maintaining acceptable standards of service.
In accordance with the load forecast appearing in Annex 3, the incremental
cunulatire sales are shown below:
Year                                GWh
1975 (actual)                  2499
mid-1976       :               1/2 (2971+2499)=2735
1976                           2971-2735       =         236
1977                           3351h-2735 )              619
1973                           3858-2735       =        1123
mid-1979                        1/2 (L298+3858)-273 - 1343
Benefits
14.      It has  been assumed that the benefits obtained from the expansion
program would correspond to the value of the, electric energy used by the final
consumer and distributed through COPELts system. The average total cost per
kWh naid hbr th- consumer apnears below and is based on the average price plus
the "sole tax" (Annex 10)
20o higher than thr financial rate, as recommended in "Analise Gubernamental
de Projetos de Investimento no Brasil (Rio de Janeiro, 1972)".

Average price of energy at market price (Cr$/kWh)   0.371
Sole tax at market price (Cr$/kWh)                   0.055
Total unit benefit at market price (Cr$/kWh)         0.426
Total economic unit benefit  US$/kWh                 0.043
Io determine the project's share of the incremental load during the period
July 1976 through June 1979, it was assumed that it would be 70% in 1976,
80% during 1977 and 1978, and 100% thereafter.
The total benefits at the end of each year would then be:
Year                     GWh                  Million US$
1976                   0.70 x 236                 7.1

1979-on                1.00 x 1343               57.7
Costs
5.       The marginal costs of generating capacity (peak) is based on
COPEL's Fbz do Areia hydroelectric project, under construction, described
in Annex h (page 2), and transmission marginal costs are based on the estimate
of the program appearing in Annex 5. Operation and maintenance costs were
computed on the basis of COPEL's past experience for similar facilities.
These calculations are summarized below:

Return and Sensitivity Analysis
6.        The discount rate which equalizes the streams of benefits and costs
shown in paragraphs 4 and 5 is 19.5%. On the assumption that COPELs future
sales were 10 lower than forecast the rate of return would be 18%. If in
addition, the project costs were to increase by 10%, the corresponding rate
of return would be 17%. Since these discount rates exceed the probable
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil, they suggest that wasteful use of
electricity and premature expansion of the system should be avoided, as consumers
will on average be requested to pay a price higher than incremental system
costs.
