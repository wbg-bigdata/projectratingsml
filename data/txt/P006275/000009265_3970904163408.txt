PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (COPEL)
(LOAN 1257-BR)
PREFACE
The Project consisted of a variety of subtransmission/distribution
works, plus pole transformers, public lighting, meters, consultunt services,
and training. To support this Project, the Bank made Loan 1257-BR (US$52.0
million) in May 1975 to Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL), the
state-owned power company serving the state of Parana. This was the second of
three Bank loans benefitting COPEL.
The Loan Agreement became effective in August 1976; the final closing
date was February 1981, about 14 months after the original closing date. The
delay was primarily due to inexperience on the part of the borrower's
consultant with the procurement procedures specified in the Bank's guidelines.
There were some changes to the Project, deletions and additions consequent to
greater-than-expected demand and variation in the rate of growth of the
different load centers. The Bank agreed to these changes.
The Latin American and Caribbean Region/Energy I prepared the Project
Completion Report (PCR), based on the Appraisal and President's Reports,
supervision and consultant's reports, other documents in the Bank's files, a
final project report prepared by COPEL, and conversations with staff of the
Bank and COPEL. The PCR sets forth main points with respect to the
preparation, appraisal, and Implementation of the Project, which was completed
successfully.
The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the Bank did not audit
this Project.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report to
the Government and COPEL for commnts. COPEL sent comments (Attachment 1)
which have been taken into account.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (COPEL)
LOAN 1257-BR)
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1257-BR (US$52.0 million) helped to finance expansion of
distribution facilities, including subtransmission and distribution lines and
substations, pole transformers, public lighting, meters and their installation,
consultant services, and training.  The Project was successful In meeting its
objective of providing facilities to meet the growing electricity demand of
commercial and industrial customers.
Because of higher-than-expected demand, especially during the first
two years of project execution (1976-1978), and also because of variations of
demand growth at different load ceuters, COPEL, with Bank agreement, changed
the Project by adding and deleting, as necessary, such item  as substations,
subtransmission lines, feeders, circuits, etc. The net effect of these changes
was to increase the physical volume of items constituting the Project
(paras.3.3-3.5). These changes led to a modest increase (4Z) in the cost of
the Project (paras.3.15); but lower-than-expected costs for materials led to a
cancellation of US$5.8 million from the loan (para. 3.16). COPEL supplied
revised cost data on the Project which is shown in Attachment 1. The revised
cost data was developed using accounting criteria which are not consistent with
those employed by the Bank (para. 3.13), and it was therefore considered not
advisable to revise the Bank's final project cost estimates.
COPEL's financial performance deteriorated in the years 1978-1980, as
a result of the Government's policy of not increasing tariffs in line with
inflation (para.5.1). Following a series of meetings held between September
1980 and September 1981, the Bank and the Government agreed on a program of
tariff Increases to restore the financial health of the sector. There have
been additional discussions and new tariff agreements since 1981. Compliance
with these new financial agreements has been satisfactory. Based on final
investment costs and existing tariffs, the internal rate of return on the
Project is calculated at 16% as compared with the forecast level of 22%.
As expected at appraisal, the institutional performance of COPEL was
good (para.6.1).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL: POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (COPEL)
(LOAN 1257-BR)
r. BACKGROUND
Bank Participation in Sector Financing
1.1       Since 1948, the Bank has made 36 loans to the power sector in
Brazil, amounting to US$1.8 billion equivalent. The Bank has made three
loans amounting to US$163.3 million (Annex 1), to Companhia Paranaense de
Ener3ia (COPEL). The Bank loans to COPEL have helped to finance the
expansion of distribution facilities and there is an active loan (1721-BR)
with the same objective. The first loan (476-BR), was actually made to
Companhia Forca e Luz do Parana which was absorbed by COPEL. Therefore, Loan
1257-BR is, in reality, the first loan from the Bank to COPEL. The project
was completed in 1981.
LAC Regional    1.2       COPEL is a mixed economy corporation wbose principal owner is the
Note:           State of Parana.  It was created in 1954 primarily to'supply electricity
See comments   power within Parana. As of December 1982, the Company had an installed
of Borrower     capacity of 2,100 MW approximately and generated 5,102 GWh, which in
(Attach. 1).   equivalent to some 80% of the total energy needed to serve its market.  The
capacity will be increased to 3,359 MW on completion of Segredo Hydro Plant
scheduled for 1990 (Annex 2).
Sector Organization
1.3       The Government controls the power sector through two agencies under
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy:
(a) National Department of Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE) which
performs regulatory functions including the granting of licenses
for hydroelectric sites, assigning concession areas, setting
tariffs and approving expansion plans. However, it has to be
pointed out that since 1981, DNAEE's responsibility for setting
tariffs has been reduced by effectively transferring the authority
for tariff approval to the Secretary of Planning (SEPLAN), which
reviews proposals within a broader policy context; and
(b) Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), which performs
the functions of a holding company. It allocates public funds for
use by its operating subsidiaries and state-owned utilities; and
coordinates their external borrowings, expansion plans for major
generating and transmission facilities and interconnected system
operatlon (through chair--maship of the Coordinating Group for
Interconnected Operation - GCOI).
1.4       In accordance with the Government policy, the power generation
function and related high voltage transmission are reserved largely to four
ELETROBRAS Subsidiaries: ELETRONORTE, CHESF, FURNAS and ELETROSUL. The
distribution function at the State level is carried out mainly by state
utilities, such as COPEL.

II. PROJECT ORIGIN, APPRAISAL, EXPANSION PROGRAM,
PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND NEGOTIATIONS
Project Origin
2.1       COPEL made the initial contact with the Bank in March 1975 with a
letter asking IBRD to consider the financing of 40% of its distribution
expansion plan for 1976-1980.
2.2       COPEL was simultaneously arranging financing from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for the Foz do Areia hydroelectric
project and wanted IBRD financing (US$30 million) for the transmission lines
from Foz do Areia. The Bank decided to study the possibility of combining in
a single operation the financing of certain elements of the Foz do Areia
project and associated transmission works, with the proposed distribution
project.
2.3       A preparation mission (June 1975) concluded that the Foz do Areia
hydroelectric project was ready for appraisal and that the distribution
expansion component for the period 1976-1978 was almost at the same stage.
The mission also concluded that COPEL was in a strong financial position and
that its ample borrowing capacity would permit it to incur substantial
additional indebtedness to finance its large 1976-79 expansion program
(US$658 million, at December 1975 prices), while remaining within a sound
capital structure. In order to appraise the project in September 1975, the
mission asked COPEL to prepare the following information:
(a) a comprehensive study to provide more conclusive basis for final
selection of the dam i.e. concrete upstream face vs. impervious
core;
Cb) a program for resettlement of the people living in the area;
(c) a report on the ecological aspects of the Foz do Areia Project; and
(d) updated financial projections.
2.4 In August 1975, ELETROBRAS decided that the 500 kV line from Foz do
Areia to Curitiba would be owned by ELETROSUL. COPEL had proposed to build
and operate this line itself. The line was the principal component of the
project that the Bank would finance. Due to ELETROBRAS' decision, the Bank
concentrated its efforts on the distribution project.
Appraisal
2.5 The appraisal mission went to Curitiba in October 1975 to appraise
COPEL's distribution expansion project.  The estimated cost was US$188.4
million and the Bank's loan was US$52 million. It was expected to serve
about 130,000 new consumers of which 80% would be residential, and
approximately 20,000 would be low-income conmsumers.
COPEL's Expansion Program 1976-79
2.6 According to the appraisal report, COPEL's expansion program during the
period 1976-79 would consist of the following works:
(a) Generation: the Foz do Areia hydroelectric project;



- 3 -
(b) Transmission (230 and 138 kV): 448 circuit-km at 230 kV, and 585 km
at 138 kV including additional transformer capacity of 950 MVA at
230 kV and 410 MVA at 138 kV,
(c)  Subtransmission and distribution (69 kV or less): 383 circuit-km at
69 kV, 1070 km at 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV, 390 NVA at 69 kV, 80 MVA at
34.5 kV a-id low voltage distribution expansion;
(d)  Communication and control: extension of communication and
telemetering system facilities and equipment; and
(e)  Buildings: new headquarters and dispatching complex to be initiated
in late 1978.
Project Description
2.7       The appraisal report defined the project as follows:
(a)  Subtransmission:
Mi)  50 circuit-km of 138 kV tie lines;
(ii)  construction, expansion and/or improvements of nine 138 kV
substations, including addition of 305 MVA transformer
capacity;
Ciii)  installation of about 390 MVA in transformer capacity at 69
kV; and
(iv)  installation of about 80 MVA in transformer capacity at 34.5
kV.
cb) Distribution:
(i)  166 circuit-km of 69 kV line extensions;
(ii)  installation of about 4,560 transformers (13.8 kV/220-120 V)
and 200 transformers (34.5 kV/220-120 V) with an aggregate
capacity of about 260 MVA;
(iii)  installation of about 130 km of 13.8 kV feeders;
(iv)  installation of about 1,900 km of line extensions (1,040 km at
34.5 kV and 860 km at 13.8 kV);
(v)  installation of about 3,100 new 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV circuits
(340 m average length);
(vi)  improvement of about 1,630 existing 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV
circuits (340 m average length);
(vii)  installation of about 145,000 watt hour meters (124,700 single
phase, 20,300 polyphase);
(viii)  replacement of about 85,000 meters (75,000 single phase,
10,000 polyphase);



-4-
(ix) installation of about 135,000 street lights.
(c) Auxiliary services:
(i) expansion of ueter laboratory facilities and equipment;
(ii) supplementary transmission and subtransuiseion maintenance and
system protection and operation equipment, including
energized-line maintenance equipment;
(d) Consultant services and training:
(i) equipment fabrication inspections outside of Brazil by COPEL's
consultants (60 man-months) plus training of COPEL's staff
which would take place during these inspections.
LAC         2.8       All engineering phases of the project wouldc be carried out by
Regional    COPEL's experienced engineering staff, with the exceptiou of preparation of
Note:       documents for internatlonal competitive bidding and inspection of the
See         fabrication of equipment which would be the responsibility of Coupanhia
comments   Auxiliar de Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB). Up to US$2.0 million of
of          the proposed loan would be allocated to direct purchases since
Borrower    standardization requirements would make it more economical to use this type
(Attach.1). of purchase.
Negotiations
2.9       Negotiations took place on March 15-18, 1976 without any problems.
The loan was signed on May 19, 1976 for a term of 20 years including 3-1/2
year of grace and a rate of interest of 8.5Z p.a.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Beginning of the Works
3.1       The Loan Agreement established as conditions of effectiveness that:
(a) the execution of the Project Agreement on behalf of the State had
been authorized or ratified by all necessary governmental action;
and
(b)  the Loan Agreement had been registered by Banco Central do Brasil.
The date for effectiveness established was August 19, 1976. The
Loan, as was expected, became effective on August 17, 1976,
without any problem.
3.2       The works began as planned, except for some procurement problems
(para. 3.12) that delayed the acquisitions of some of the material and
equipment.
Changes in the Project
3.3       The changes in the project were mainly due to higher demand than
projected, especially in the first two years of the project, and variation in
the rate of growth of the different load centers. The project included the
construction of 107 substations at 138 kV, 69 kV and 34.5 kV. COPEL excluded
27 substations from the original project and added 41, giving a total of 121



-5-
substations. The substations actually constructed as of April 1981 were 112
(Annex 3). The additional works were possible because of savings in project
costs (para 3.16).
3.4       The original project included the construction of 16 lines of 69 kV
and 138 kV with a total length of 216 km. Three lines were excluded from the
project and 9 lines were added, giving a total of 22 lines constructed, of
which 13 were of 69 kV and 9 of 138 kV. The total length was 485.6 km or
125Z higher than the original project (see Annex 3).
3.5       The project included distribution components such as feeders,
circuits, transformers, public lighting and the works were carried out
setisfactorily. Due to the higher than projected rate of growth of the COPEL
m&rket observed in 1976 and 1977 of 14.5% and 18.8%, respectively, it was
necessary to increase the physical quantities of new distribution works.
The actual figures showed that the new feeders were 30% and the new circuits,
43% higher than the level established at appraisal, while the other items
were below this level (Annex 4). The reasons for these shortfalls are that:
(a) some areas did not demand the service as expected, and
(b) in the case of public lighting, the increment in new services
depended on the municipal governments, who are responsible for the
payments of the monthly bills of the communities' electric services
and were unable to provide the necessary funds.
Project Timetable
3.6       About 95% of the components of the project plus the additions made
during the implementation period were finished by April 30, 1981, or
approximately one and a half years later than the target completion date.
The delay was mainly due to lack of experience that CAEEB (COPEL's Brazilian
consultant - para 2.8) had in handling procurement procedures under IBRD
guidelines, delayed deliveries and defects in some parts and equipment
(para. 3.12 and 3.19).
3.7       The components of the project not completed as cf April 30, 1981,
when COPEL prepared the PCR, were 9 substations, out of which 6 were
scheduled to be completed by the end of 1981 and the rest were postponed or
cancelled due to changes in load growth. It has to be borne in mind that
COPEL was able to build 5 more substations than the total originally planned
and also to install a larger transformer capacity (1,313 MVA compared with
835 MVA).
3.8       The underground distribution works in downtown Curitiba were
completed in February 1981, one and a half years later than expected at
appraisal. The delay was caused by political considerations in the State
Government that delayed releasing downtown areas of Curitiba for the civil
works. This delay required the Bank to address its complaints to the
Governor of Parana. After that things moved quickly. Beside that, COPEL
found that the low voltage connectors supplied by a Brazilian Company
presented serious defects that inhibited the installation of them and it was
necessary to return the connectors to the manufacturer (para.3.19).
3.9       The training program was carried out satisfactorily.  Some 56
engineers participated in the program that involved inspections (in



combination with the consultants) and receipt of equipment and material at
manufacturing site, courses and on-the-job training. In addition the
technical library was strengthened with the acquisition of books and other
technical publications.
3.10      The project gave special attention to electricity service to low-
income consumers, and the SAR established a goal of connections of 20,000 for
these consumers. The actual number of new connections was of 21,000
approximately (Annex 5). One of the elements that helped in the success of
this program was the feature of financing the connection fee for repayment
over a period of 36 months, free of interest and other charges. COPEL is at
the moment engaged in a second stage of this program, under Loan 1721-BR, and
has planned to connect 45,000 new low-income consumers or 125Z more than the
first program. Another by-product of the low income consumer program was the
preparation by COPEL of the system of safety regulations for residences that
did not exist previous to the loan.
Procurement
3.11      According to the Loan Agreement, US$48.7 million of the loan would
be used to procure goods under international competitive bidding; US$2.6
million, through direct purchases, and US$0.7 million would be used through
direct arrangements for consulting services and training. In the direct
purchases, COPEL would include special standardized metering and system
protection equipment. The results were close to the forecast made: US$43.6
million were used under international competitive bidding; US$2.1 million,
through direct purchases and US$0.5 million, through direct arrangements for
consulting services and training. About US$5.8 million was cancelled from
the loan.
3.12        At the beginning, some problems arose with the preparation of the
bidding documents that produced delay in the procurements. This was because
COPEL was, for all intents, a new Borrower and CAEEB, COPEL's Brazilian
consultant who dealt with the procurement, was not familiar with the recent
changes in the Bank's guidelines for procurement. There was frequent
correspondence between COPEL and the Bank, regarding the appropriate
application of escalation formulas, and the lack of adequate evaluation and
award reports also caused delays. After resolution of these initial
problems, procurement of goods proceeded without further difficulties.
Project Cost
3.13      Bank staff estimated that the cost of the project was US$196.2
million compared with US$188.4 million forecasted. This is a tentative
estimate because COPEL was not able to provide the cost of each project
component, and even the aggregate costs which they supplied are
underestimated, because COPEL values its inventories at average cost (which
is often significantly lower than the value of the last purchase, due to
inflation). As a result, COPEL's cost figures underestimate the cost of the
project. Bank staff adjusted COPEL's foreign cost data based on the Bank's
disbursement records, but it was not possible to apply a similar correction
to the local costs and therefore the estimated total cost of the project is
underestimated (Annex 3).
3.14      COPEL is aware of the problems that have been caused by its cost
accounting procedures. To address these, starting in January 1984 COPEL is
revaluing its inventories by an appropriate price index and this should lead
to better project cost estimates in the future.



Bank Disbursements and other Financial Sources
3.15      The project cost was of US$196.2 million and Its actual and
forecasted sources of financing are shown below:

3.16      Annex 6 shows that the actual and forecast loan allocation by
categories were close.   Annex 7 shows that the disbursements by semester
were lower than the appraisal estimates, due to: (a) procurement delays In
the early stages of the project (para. 3.12); (b) lower prices in materials
and equipment in comparison with SAR's estimates. Those savings were applied
to new works but still COPEL was unable to disburse the total amount of the
loan, leaving a balance of US$5.8 million, which was cancelled.
3.17      To cover its financial requirements, COPEL negotiated In 1978 a
loan of US$20 million with the Bank of Nova Scotia, 10 years repayment period
including three years of grace; rate of interest, 1-3/4Z per annum over
LIBOR; management fee, 1X on the total loan amount; Guardntor, Federative
Republic of Brazil. The IBRD agreed to amend the Loan Agreement to include a
cross-default clause in it and to enter into an agreement with the Bank of
Nova Scotia under whlch IBRD would act as billing agent for the service
payment on the above-mentioned loan and both banks would exchange
information. The operation was successful. COPEL negotiated and obtained
this loan efficiently. COPEL agreed that the Bank's assistance allowed it to
obtain better terms and conditions on this loan than would have been offered
without Bank assistance.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.18      COPEL's staff carried out the project engineering design and
construction supervision, and hired a consultant firm, Companhia Auxiliar de
Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB), to handle the procurement procedures
and inspections of equipment and materials. The arrangement and the
performance of the parties involved were adequate. CAEEB contracted four
consulting foreign firms to undertake the fabrication inspections outside
Brazil.
3.19      The contractors and suppliers, in general, had a satisfactory
performance. The only problems worth mentioning are those related to the
transformers supplied by a foreign Company and the low voltage connectors
supplied by a Brazilian Company. Part of the project time overrun can be
attributed to these problems. The foreign Company experienced a considerable



- 8 -
delay in the delivery of the 10 power transformers (138/69 kV) and one of
them was still not shipped when COPEL prepared its PCR. In addition, the
insulating oil supplied by the foreign Company did not meet the
specifications and had to be treated in Brazil at the supplier's expense.
The other problem was found with the connectors supplied by a Brazilian
Company, which were used in rhe underground distribution system of downtown
Curitiba, which had irregularities in the insulation that caused
short-circuiting and required that these pieces be removed and returned to
the manufacturer. The irregularities were solved adequately.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
COPEL's load Growth
4.1       The main project objectives were to provide COPEL with the
subtransmission and distribution facilities needed to support the rapid
expansion of Parana's industrial sector that had taken place in recent years,
as well as to support an accompanying rise in commercial and residential
consumers. The project was adequate in meeting its objectives, because even
though the sales to the industrial sector were lower than those forecasted
(20Z), the sales to the other sectors compensated for this decline. Total
actual sales for the period 1976-80 were 3X higher than the forecasted
levels. The actual level of energy losses, which showed an improving trend,
were lower than the levels estimated at appraisal.
Connections of Low-Income Consumers
4.2      In addition to the above objective, it was established as an
important goal of the project to increase by 20,000 the connections of
low-income consumers located near the distribution circuits. The program was
successful because It accomplished the goal (para. 3.10).
Internal Economic Rate of Return
4.3      The appraisal report indicated an internal rate of return of 19.5Z.
This value has been recalculated using the same data and estimated at 22%
(see Annex 8). On the basis of actual investment and operation and
maintenance costs (Annex 8), a similar analysis shows a return of 16%
approximately. The difference should be attributed to higher investment
costs than those forecasted in the appraisal report, lower tariffs (US$3.5
cents compared with US$4.3 cents per kWh) and the delay in the completion of
the works. To allow for the possibility that project costs may be
understated, a sensitivity analysis was carried out and it shows that with an
increase in cost of 15% and a decrease in benefits of the samP percentage,
the minimum economic rate of return would be 11%, which is similar to the
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Comparison of Actual and Forecast Data
5.1       COPEL's financial performance during the period 1976-78 was
adequate (Annexes 10, 11 and 12), but some of its key financial indicators
deteriorated in the period 1979-80 (Annex 5). Energy sales were higher than
those forecasted and energy losses showed an improving trend, but the rate of



-9-
return on remunerable investment, debt-service coverage and debt-equity ratio
deteriorated. The rate of return was similar to that covenanted of IOZ for
the years 1976 and 1977, but declined to 8Z in 1978, 7Z in 1979 and to 5Z in
1980. The debt service coverage and the debt-equity ratios were similar to
those forecasted for the years 1976 through 1978, but deteriorated in 1979
and 1980. In the latter year the debt-service coverage ratio was 1.1 and the
debt-equity ratio 52/48. The deterioration of these indicators was caused by
the failure of the Government to increase tariffs adequately. In real terms
(December 1975 prices) tariffs decreased from Cr$0.37lkWh in 1975 to
Cr$0.27fkWh in 1980. The Bank expressed its deep concern about this
situation to COPEL and the Brazilian Governmunt. In a series of meetings
held between September 1980 and September 1981, the Bank discussed with
Brazil's Government officials the financial problems of the electric sector
and a program of tariff increases to restore the sectorts financial health
over the long run was agreed-on. The implementation of the tariff
adjustments initially met some delays which the Brazilian Government offset
by augmenting the amount of the tariff increases. The Bank reviewed the
finances of the power sector in the context of a new loan (Eletrobras II
Power Distribution Project), and a new tariff agreement was agreed upon on
December 1983, which is expected to produce long-term improvements of the
finances of the power sector.
5.2       The construction expenditures in the period 1976-1980 were 3Z
higher than those projected in the SAR (Cr$7,113 compared with Cr$6,906
million); and due to a large decline in the internal cash generation in
relation with the forecast, it was financed by increasing the equity
contribution and borrowings. This can be seen In the table presented below.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATION
The Government and the Borrower
6.1       COPEL has enjoyed a history of good management and organization.
With respect to the Project, its performance was satisfactory, except for
initial procurement problems (Para.3.6), which were overcome.
6.2       COPEL maintained basically the same organization during the project
period, but it is worth mentioning that at the end of 1979 the name of the
company was changed to Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL) and its
responsibilities broadened to include the research, study and exploration of
any source of energy. Even though in the short-term its organization is
basically the same, it is expected that these new responsibilities my lead
to changes in its orgauization in the future.
6.3       By holding down tariffs, the Government has tended to weaken the
financial strength of COPEL. This situation did not represent a major
problem during most of the period of the project construction, but became a
major concern by the end of this period. The Bank and the Brazilian
Government agreed on a program of tariff increases to restore the financial
health of the sector over the long run (para. 5.1).
6.4       Annex 13 describes the major covenants of the Loan, Guarantee and
Project Agreements for Loan 1257-BR. Compliance with these Agreements on the
part of the Federal and State Government and COPEL was generally
satisfactory, except with respect to the tariff covenants.
VII. LESSON TO BE LEARNED
7.1       The lesson to be learned from the COPEL project is that
distribution projects have to be defined in more generalized terms, because
these kinds of projects are dynamic in nature, requiring substantial
modification during implementation to adapt them to the varying condition of
the rate of growth of the different load centers of the electric system.
These projects should be defined basically in terms of kilometers of lines
and volt-ampers of tranFformer capacity. A more generalized project
description could avoid wasting resources of the Bank and the Borrower on
agreements related to project modification.

Re: loan no. 1257-BR
CCPEL Pcwer Distribution Project
Project Ccxpleticn aport
Dear W. Moremo
As per our conversation in Washington n April 27, 1984, and as
requsted in a letter dated February 22, 1984 frmn Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
of Operations Evaluatimn of the Bank, please find enclosed for your
records and use our detailed breakdom, on a work-by-scirk basis, of the
project costs of our Pcoaer Distribution Project, financed in part by
Loan no. 1257-BR.
We agree with your opinin that our cost aconting prxodure at that
tine tended to underestimate the costs of the project. As well, we confirm
the commnts in paragraph 3.14 (page 6) of the PCR, that we are nzw
revaluig our inventories by an apropriate price index (CM  - Brazilian
National Treasury Bcnds price variaticns), which should lead to izproved
project cost estimates uader our Bank Joan (2365-BR. Part B) for oLw Raral
Electrificatim Project.
As menticned with you in Washington, we have only two other acments
regarding the draft of the Project Coxpletimn eport as presented with
the February 22nd letter fron Mr. Iapur:
LAC Req4onal       a) in paragraph 1.2, which refers to CCa  as a joint-stock ccepany,
Note:                 we woud prefer to use the term "mrxed economy" cipany, since
Paras. 1.2 6          it is not made up of individuals and the mel-'z shareholders
2.8 reflect           (individuals in a joint-stock   pany, as we understand it)are not
COPEL comuents.       liable forthe debts of the cpany. The term "mixed econcmy", we
feel, reflects nore accurately the public-private naure of our
capital structure; and
b) in paragrah 2.8, we would prefer that the expressim "which would
be doe by...CAPEE" on the fourth and fifth line, read "wrild be
the responsibility of.. .CIOEEB", since documents were revised from
tin  to tine by our staff and Inspection of equipzet fabrication
was perfonied by coasultant firm overseas.
We definitely agree with your section con the "lesson to be learned"
and sincerely hope that this  hilkscphy is well knar at the Bank.
