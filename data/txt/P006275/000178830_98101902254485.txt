REPORI AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO COMPANHIA PARANAENSE DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (COPEL)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF
BRA2IL FOR A POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica (COPEL) with the guarantee of the
Federative Republic of lirazil for the equivalent of US$52.0 million to help
finance a power distribution project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 3-1/2 years oi grace, with interest at 8-112% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report, entltled "Economic Memorandum on Brazil" (812-BR), dated
July 7, 1975, was distrlbuted to the Executive Directors on July 21, 1975.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        During 1967-74 the combination of excellent domestic economic manage-
ment and buoyant world economic environment produced a period of high and sus-
tained income growth, strong balance of payments performance and gradually
decelerating inflation. Brazil's average annual rate of growth of about 10%
over this period resulted in a.60% increase in per capita income, a 130% in-
crease in manufacturing output and a 380% increase in the US dollar value of
exports. However, international economic events in 1974 and 1975 have forced
at least a temporary slowdown in the pace of economic growth. With the sharp
deterioration of the country's terms of trade and the disruption of the world
capital market, the balance of payments is proving to be a severe constraint
on Brazil's growth. As a result, the pace of growth has dropped sharply, into
the 4-5% range during 1975-76.
4.        The fourfold increase in the price of crude oil (adding some US$2
billion to the import bill), the steep rise in the price of most imported raw
materials, as well as the hardening of terms of external financial credits,
made management of external sector difficult in 1974-75. These factors caught
Brazil at the time when its economy was overheated and growth of import demand
was very high, because after a prolonged period of rapid growth some key indus-
trial sectors were approaching capacity levels of output. The current account
deficit, which averaged just US$1 billion in 1969-73, or 2% of GDP, widened to
about US$7 billion or 7% of GDP in 1974, reflecting the sizeable differential
between import growth (about 100%) and export growth (roughly 30%) and the
increasing level of interest payments on debt. The bulk of the deficit was
financed by a large increase In the inflow of external financial credits of
considerably shorter maturity than was generally available during 1971-73.
5.        The Government attempted to narrow the balance-of-payments current
account defict in 1975. It was successful in keeping imports somewhat below
1/   This section is reprinted from the President's Report on the Agricul-
tural Research project for Brazil (No. P-1813-BR), dated April 13,
1976.

the level in 1974 in nominal terms by maintaining a balanced budget, continu-
ing the crawling peg exchange rate policy and by introducing direct import
controls. This implied a substantial reduction in the real level of imports
and was accompanied by a decline in the rate of GDP growth to 4%. Export
growth of about 9% was somewhat disappointing, largely due to the frost in
southern Brazil in July 1975, which adversely affected production of some key
crops, including coffee and sugar, and a slowdown in manufactured export growth
as a consequence of the recession in the consuming countries. Nevertheless,
because of import restraint the trade deficit declined from US$4.7 billion in
1974 to US$3.5 billion in 1975. However, improvement in the trade account was
virtually offset by a large increase in interest payments reflecting the growth
of the external debt and higher Eurodollar interest rates.
6.        The Government monitored the balance-of-payments situation very
closely and in the second half of 1975 adopted several new measures designed
to produce a further contraction of imports in 1976. The new measures estab-
lished advance import deposit requirements on approximately 40% of merchandise
imports, further increased import duties, increased gasoline prices 25% and
continued restriction of public sector imports. In addition, as a longer term
measure, the Government has given the state petroleum monopoly, PETROBRAS,
permission to undertake service contracts with foreign oil companies. It is
clear, however, that despite these measures 1976 will be another difficult year
for balance of payments management as prospects are for a relatively small
gain in exports and, as a result, economic growth can again be expected to be
in the 4% range.
7.        Adverse development during 1975-76 reflect the fact that in recent
years, Brazil has become more closely integrated into the world economy and its
growth has become more dependent upon and vulnerable to changes in the world
economic situation. The slowdown in the rate of growth of the world economy
has, with some lag, had an adverse impact on prices of Brazil's primary ex-
ports and on the rate of growth of its exports of manufactures, and, through
the balance of payments, on the overall growth of the economy. It now appears
that world economic conditions will not permit Brazil to grow during 1975-80
at the 10% pace attained in the preceding years. However, despite the re-
duced pace of growth in 1975-76 a growth path averaging 6% per annum is still
feasible for 1975-80 as a whole. It is estimated that to attain such a growth
path, the average annual net inflow of medium- and long-term capital (that is,
capital other than direct investments and financial credits) required for the
1975-80 period will be substantial, about US$1.8 billion, or three times the
average for the 1970-74 period.
8.        At the end of 1975, Brazil's public external debt reached about
US$11 billion. The public debt service ratio for 1975 is estimated at around
16.7% which is in line with that of other countries at a similar stage of devel-
opment. Brazil's total (public and private) external debt reached about US$22
billion at the end of 1975, of which about two-thirds, or US$15 billion was in
the form of financial credits. The debt service ratio during 1975 on this to-
tal external debt was about 38%, or about the same as the average for 1969-73.



However, it should be noted that net foreign exchange reserves at the end of
1975 were still large, about US$4.6 billion, equivalent to some four months of
the 1975 imports of goocs and non-factor services. While total debt service
ratio can be expected to rise somewhat in 1976, if an export growth rate of
around 17% per year in collar terms (compared to 30% in 1970-74) can be main-
tained over the 1975-80 period and if average maturities of new financial
credits gradually improve from six to eight years, the debt service ratio in
1980 can be expected to return to the level prevailing in the 1969-73 period.
Despite Brazil's heavy debt service burden, the large foreign exchange reserves
accumulated over the past several years ensure that the country will have the
liquidity to meet its debt service obligations in the short term, while the
country's record of high caliber financial management provides grounds for
confidence in the maintenance of creditworthiness over the longer run.
9.        Despite its recent growth and vast potential, Brazil is still a
country with a very unequal distribution of income and extensive absolute
poverty. The present Government acknowledges the gravity of the country's
income distribution problem and accepts the responsiblity for its alleviation.
While like the previous Government it believes that a high rate of growth is
necessary to increase the income of the poor, it does not believe that the
"trickle down" effects of rapid growth are enough and is shaping a new posi-
tive policy which could be labeled as "redistribution along with growth". To
this end, in addition to pursuing some of the social programs initiated by
its predecessor, the Government is also working on new measures for improving
income distribution. These can be classified into three broad areas: (a)
regional development; (b) provision of social services; and (c) wage policy.
In addition, recent tax changes have tended to have a favorable, although
marginal, impact on income distribution.
10.       As one of its measures to help promote development in poorer regions,
the Government has formulated a program known as POLONORDESTE for rural devel-
opment in the Northeast. The program envisages investment expenditures of
about US$2.5 billion during 1975-79 and is designed to raise the productivity
and incomes of small farmers through, inter alia, formulation and execution of
integrated rural development projects, which are likely in some cases to include
changes in land tenure. POLONORDESTE is based on the assumption that the rural
Northeast cannot be regarded as a homogeneous whole and, therefore, standard-
ized programs are inadequate. The Government identified 28 sub-regions cover-
ing large portions of the Northeast on which POLONORDESTE funds would be used
initially. The recently approved Rio Grande do Norte project is one of the
first under POLONORDESIE, and the Government intends to present additional
similar projects for Bank consideration in the future. Active consideration
is being given to a major modification in the state value added tax system
to redistribute fiscal resources from the richer to the poorer states, in
order to give the latter the fiscal resources which they badly need to accel-
erate social programs, particularly in education. In the area of social
services, the GovernmerLt has created a new Ministry of Social Security in
order to consolidate its social benefit programs and to extend these programs
to a larger share of the population. In 1975 it allowed under the Social
Integration Program (P]S, a social security fund), the lowest paid workers



- 4 -
covered by PIS, with incomes previously between about US$60 and US$300 monthly,
to withdraw up to one month's minimum wage (about US$60) from their PIS
accounts. The Government is also strengthening the nutrition program which,
under the previous Government, got off to a slow start. Greater emphasis is
being given by BNH (the National Housing Bank) to low-income housing, whose
beneficiaries will enjoy better financial terms than in the past. BNH is also
developing a site and services program to reach parts of the population even
lower down the income scale. In agriculture, the recently reorganized rural
extension agency (EMBRATER) will expand and strengthen its activities directed
specifically toward the small-scale farmer; and the new federal agriculture
research institution (EMBRAPA) is defining its program to include a selection
of crops and farming-systems which will ensure that small-scale farms benefit
from research efforts. Overall, the Government's recently approved public
investment program for 1975-77 gives high priority to education, health,
agriculture and regional development, which account for about 30% of total
public investment. Finally, the Government intends to use a wage policy to
improve income distribution. It has already revised the formula governing the
adjustment of the union wage scale and has introduced an 8-10% increase in the
real minimum wage.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Bank Operations
11.       By March 31, 1976, the Bank had approved 60 loans for Brazil,
amounting to US$2,563.2 million, of which 36 had not been fully disbursed.
During FY65-69, disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increas-
ing to an average of US$136 milion per year during FY70-74, reaching US$225
million in FY74, US$248 million in FY75, and US$127 million in the first
half of FY76. Disbursements will continue to increase during the next few
years. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of March 31,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven loans
were approved totalling US$437 million, including three loans totalling US$192
million for the Stage II expansion of the steel industry. In FY73, six loans
amounting to US$187.7 million; in FY74 three loans totalling US$242 million
and in FY75, five loans totalling US$426.5 million were approved. So far in
FY76, six loans totalling US$327 million have been approved: US$60 million
for the COSIPA Stage III steel expansion program; US$75 million for the FEPASA
railway rehabilitation and expansion program; US$12 million for the Rio Grande
do Norte rural development project; US$85 million for a development banking
project for small and medium-sized industries; US$55 million for a'secondary
and feeder roads project; and US$40 million for an agricultural research
project. We are working actively with the Brazilians on the preparation of a
nutrition project, two ammonia/urea fertilizer projects, a project in support
of electric power distribution in the Northeast, a power transmission project
in the South, a water and sewerage project in the State of Minas Gerais and a
rural development project in the same state.



- 5 -
13.       Of Brazil's external public debt outstanding and disbursed at the
end of 1975, amounting to US$11 billion, the Bank held about 10%. The Bank's
share of the service on this debt was about 4.5%. If present trends continue
as expected, the Bank's share in total external public debt outstanding would
increase to 12% by 1980. The Bank's share of public debt service would rise
to about 6% while its share of Brazil's total (public and private) external
debt service would remain at the present level of 2.7%.
14.       IFC has commit:ted more financial resources to Brazil than to any
other country.  As of March 31, 1976, IFC had made 27 commitments to Brazil,
totalling US$262.9 million, of which US$32.6 million has been cancelled,
US$20.4 million repaid and US$126.9 million sold. Of the balance of US$83.0
million, US$60.6 million represents loans and US$22.4 million equity. A
summary of IFC's investments up to March 31, 1976 is given in Annex II.
Lending Strategy
15.       In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has sought to help the Government
achieve a number of important development objectives, which are interdependent
and complementary. One of these objectives is to support institutional develop-
ment and policy reform, designed inter alia to help maximize public savings and
ensure that they are used economically. The proposed project will improve
COPEL's operation and reduce energy losses by effecting, among other things,
better inspection and maintenance of the distribution network. Support for
institutional improvement has also been the central objective of the recently
approved development banking and agricultural research projects. The develop-
ment banking project wi:ll assist in the project appraisal and selection ability
of 22 state and regional development banks. The recently approved agricul-
tural research project will assist the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corpor-
ation, EMBRAPA, to improve the coordination and intensify the production
orientation of Brazil's agricultural research efforts in the Northeast, North
and Center-West of the country. The institution-building objective has also
been Important in our assistance to the transportation sector, where emphasis
has been given to the rational selection of investments, the strengthening of
railway operations and the improvement of their financial performance.
16.       A second Bank lending objective in Brazil is to support the growing
effort of the Government: to identify and develop projects designed to increase
productivity and incomes of the lowest income segments of the population, to
broaden the economic opportunities open to those groups, and to alleviate
poverty. The proposed electric power distribution project will enable COPEL
to increase the number of consumers served from 562,000 to 746,000, an increase
of 33% in 3 years. The project would be instrumental in providing service to
20,000 low-income residential households which cannot at present afford to
obtain electrical connection. A similar goal is included In the proposed
Northeast Power Distribution project now in the final stages of preparation.
The Bank is also particLpating in other important development efforts in
Brazil's urban areas, and the recently approved development banking project,
by focusing on small and medium-sized industries, will give special support



- 6 -
to a segment of the industrial sector that has significant labor absorption
prospects and should result in the creation of a sizeable number of new jobs
in many urban areas in the country. In the agricultural sector, the agricul-
tural research project, the Lower Sao Francisco polders project and the Rio
Grande do Norte rural development project, will help develop the range of
rural services necessary to ensure that improved technology is made available
to small farmers. With the collaboration of Bank staff, the Government is
preparing additional integrated rural development projects to increase the
productivity of the small farmer and we expect to present in the future an
increasing number of projects of this type. The proposed project would faci-
litate the continued rapid growth of agricultural processing and forestry in-
dustries in the State of Parana and would support the Brazilian Government's
efforts to create growth poles outside the country's traditional industrial-
ized areas. We are also actively associated with the preparation of new proj-
ects in the fields of water supply and sewerage, site and services, nutrition,
and rural education.
17.       Another important lending objective for the Bank has been to help
Brazil ease the foreign exchange constraint on its development, a constraint
that has become more critical since the increase in petroleum prices, by
supporting projects designed to increase Brazil's export capacity and, where
economical, to substitute domestic production for imports. The balance of
payments would be aided by the agricultural research project as well as by the
fertilizer projects and a second agro-industries project now under prepara-
tion. These projects would help Brazil reduce imports of essential foodstuffs
and fertilizer or enable Brazil to export additional quantities of foodstuffs
to the rest of the world. Much of the investment which the Bank has helped
finance in Brazil's transport sector--railways, ports, and highways--is
designed to facilitate the smooth and economical flow of exports. Also,
support of the steel expansion program is helping Brazil develop output of a
commodity which can be produced efficiently in Brazil owing to the country's
bountiful supply of high-grade iron ore and the scale of its internal markets.
18.       A final objective which applies to all Bank lending to Brazil is to
provide part of the very large volume of medium- and long-term capital inflows
that Brazil has needed and will continue for some years to need in order to
sustain rapid growth and achieve its employment creation and regional develop-
ment objectives. In some sectors, such as steel and electric power generation
and transmission, the Bank's participation has helped Brazil to obtain addi-
tional bilateral suppliers' and financial credits in greater amounts and on
more favorable terms than would otherwise have been possible.



PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
19.       The proposed loan to COPEL for the power distribution project would
be the Bank's twenty-eighth for the development of the power sector in Brazil.
In 1966, the Bank assisted Companhia Forca e Luz do Parana (CFLP) to finance
a power distribution prcject (Ln. 476-BR). CFLP was merged into COPEL on
August 31, 1973, and COE'EL has assumed responsibility for the loan.
Energy Resources
20.       Brazil has one of the largest hydroelectric potentials in the world,
estimated at about 100,000 MW of which less than 15% has been utilized so far,
with most of the plants located in the south and southeast regions. Coal and
oil resources are not as abundant; proven reserves consist of about 3,200 mil-
lion tons of bituminous and sub-bituminous coal and about 780 million barrels
of petroLeum.   Total domestic production of crude oil was 177,000 barrels per
day in 1975 representing about 18% of the country's needs. The estimated to-
tal energy consumption in 1975 was about 108 million tons of oil equivalent
and is expected to grow at a rate of about 7.5% per annum during the next five
years. Oil products represent about 51% of total energy consumption, coal 2%,
hydroelectricity about 20%, and other fuels such as firewood, charcoal and
sugarcane begasse about 27%. The consumption of these other fuels is expected
to remain stable, and thieir relative importance to fall steadily in the future.
No economically exploitable deposit of uranium has been found so far but
thorium resources in the country are among the largest in the world and in the
long term may contribute to the development of nuclear power.
The Power Sector
21.       The power sector is operated by a number of federal- and state-owned
companies, and one large private company (LIGHT-Servicos de Eletricidade S.A.).
The sector is administered by the Ministry of Mines and Energy through its
Department of Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE) which performs regulatory func-
tions, including granting licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigning conces-
sion areas, setting tar:iffs and approving expansion plans.
22.       Centrais Electricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS) is a Government
enterprise under the Ministry of Mines and Energy in charge of planning,
technical coordination, financing and administration of the electric power
sector. Through its four regional companies, CHESF, ELETRONORTE, ELETROSUL
and FURNAS, it is also responsible for power generation plants serving more
than one state, transmiSsion systems in high and extra-high voltage aimed at
the integration of state systems, and transmission systems related to bina-
tional power projects, in particular, the Itaipu project which is now under
construction on the Parana River between Paraguay and Brazil. For planning
purposes, the power sector is divided into five regions: Southeast, Central-
West, Northeast and North. When the loan for the Itumbiara hydroelectric
project (Ln. 923-BR) was made, the Bank and the Government agreed on the
need to coordinate the planning of electric power generation and transmission



- 8 -
in the South and Southeast regions which account for 87% of the total power
consumption of the country. Since then, an up-to-date study of the power
generation and transmission requirements for these regions up to 1990 was
prepared by ELETROBRAS and submitted through the Government to the Bank.
23.       ELETROBRAS is also the main source of funds for generation and
major transmission projects in Brazil and this has permitted it to influence
the activities of utilities, such as COPEL, in which individual states are the
major shareholders. In the 1972-74 period, US$1,748 million equivalent, or
95% of the investment funds of ELETROBRAS, derived from taxes charged to the
utilities and the final consumers, while about US$100 million or 5%, derived
from foreign loans.
Power Market
24.       Between 1968 and 1974, the growth in electric energy consumption was
12% per annum. The combined sales in the south and southeast regions amounted
to about 60,000 GWh in 1975. As mentioned above, ELETROBRAS prepared a market
study for these two regions and prepared two plans, the first covering 1975-
81, and the second 1982-90, for the expansion of generating and transmission
facilities. The least-cost generation and tranmission expansion program for
the period 1975-81 provides for 14,460 MW of hydro, 1,040 MW of thermal, and
600 MW of nuclear capacity. The program contains two hydroelectric projects
for the south region scheduled for commercial operation by 1981; Salto Santiago
(1,300 MW), to be built by ELETROSUL, and Foz do Areia (1,125 MW) by COPEL.
Both facilities will be partially financed with recently approved loans of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and bilateral credits for certain major
equipment.
25.       Considerable uncertainty exists about the 1982-90 program, due to
such factors as the impact on power demand of the slowdown in the growth in
GNP, the timing of operation of the Itaipu hydroelectric project and the
degree of substitution of petroleum by electricity. A Bank mission carried
out a review of the Brazilian energy sector addressed to these issues in
March 1976, and its report is in preparation. However, the uncertainties
referred to above would not affect the justification of the proposed project
which is addressed to immediate needs for electricity in COPEL's service area.
26.       In order to assure the rational operation of existing and future
generating and transmission facilities in the interconnected south and south-
east regional systems, the Coordinating Groups for Interconnected Operation
(GCOI) was established in 1973. COPEL, ELETROSUL and FURNAS are among the
members of the Executive Committee of GCOI.
Electric Power Tariffs
27.       Brazilian legislation concerning the electric power sector assures
that electric utilities receive sufficient funds to cover their operating



- 9 -
expenses (excluding financial charges), depreciation, "reversion quota," 1/
and a reasonable return Dn investment. Since 1966, annual revaluation of
assets against which tariffs are calculated has been mandatory, and the
tariff law of 1971 required that utilities earn a rate of return of not less
than 10% and not more than 12%. In addition to the tariff, the residential
and commercial consumers pay the "sole tax" (imposto unico) which, since
1972, has been assessed at the rate of about 25% and 30% of their respective
tariffs (industrial consumers are exempted). As a result, the electric bill
paid by the Brazilian residential and commercial consumers is among the high-
est in the world. The proceeds from the imposto unico are used mostly for
sector investments and are distributed as follows: 37% to ELETROBRAS, 2% to
DNAEE, 1% to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, 50% to the states and 10% to
the municipalities. Industrial consumers are required to make a compulsory
loan to ELETROBRAS by purchasing 20-year 6% ELETROBRAS bonds (which are sub-
ject to monetary correction). The amount of the compulsory loan is equivalent
to about 50% of the tariff for small industrial consumers and to 58% of the
tariff for large industrial consumers. Tariffs in the sector, which are con-
sistent with sound financial and public utility practices, together with
charges such as the "sole tax", enabled the sector to increase installed capa-
city at an average rate of 10.1% per year since 1964, reaching about 20,100 MW
in 1975, and to keep pace with an average annual growth in gross consumption
of 9.2% while improving reserve margins.
28.        In 1974, DNAEE began to use its discretionary powers to effect pro-
gressive equalization of customer rates throughout Brazil. The result of this
action was that rates of return for the comparatively higher cost utilities
fell below 10%. To meet this problem, a Global Guarantee Fund (GGF) was
created in December 1974, as a mechanism intended to assure qualifying utili-
ties a return of up to 10%. At the same time, in order to increase the pro-
ductivity of those utilities supported by GGF, DNAEE put into effect a number
of measures which restri.ct the utilities from increasing their operating costs,
undertaking investments, and expanding markets without DNAEE's prior approval.
29.       Agreements prior to 1975 between the Bank and several Brazilian elec-
tric utilities provided that tariff rates would be set at a level that would
provide the return stated in Brazilian legislation, i.e., between 10% and 12%.
In recognition of the efforts of the Brazilian Government to equalize electric
charges throughout the nation, it has been agreed that, if transfers from the
GGF are required, they will be sufficient to bring COPEL's return up to 10%
(Sections 3.02 (b) of the draft Guarantee Agreement and 5.06 (c) and 6.01 (c)
of the draft Loan Agreement and the draft supplementary letter).
1/   The "reversion quota" is assessed at a rate of up to 5% on the value of
gross utility plant: in service less accumulated advances, contributions
and grants; of this, 3% is lent by Government to ELETROBRAS which uses
the funds to finance investments in the sector and the balance comprises
the sole source of funds for the Global Guarantee Fund.

30.       The present electricity tariff system results in a high level of
resource mobilization while discouraging nonessential use of electricity.
There are, however, some important aspects of the structure (as distinct
from the level) of tariffs, that should be investigated. The Brazilian
Government plans to undertake a study of the tariff structure shortly, and
would present to the Bank the terms of reference and the results of the
study (Section 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
State Sub-Sector
31.       In 1975, the population of the State of Parana was nine million
people. Of these, 30% lived in cities of more than 10,000 inhabitants, the
largest of which is Curitiba, the state capital with a population estimated
at 1,000,000. Consumption of electric energy increased from 1,056 GWh in
1965 to about 2,982 GWh or 331 kWh/capita in 1975, of which 84% was supplied
by COPEL, 15.6% by captive plants and the remainder by small public utilities
which are expected to be absorbed by COPEL in the foreseeable future. The
number of consumers increased from 255,000 in 1965 to about 562,000 in 1975.
Consumption increased at the rate of 11.5% per annum during the same period
due mainly to the substantial development of the industrial sector. In 1975,
the relative share of the market was: industrial 54%, residential 18%, and
commercial 14%, with the rest shared by public lighting, rural electrification
and others. The share of the industrial consumer is expected to increase to
60% by 1979 as a consequence of continued rapid development, especially of
agro-industries, while the total number of consumers is expected to increase
to 746,000.
32.       Of the 141,000 new residential consumers to be connected by 1979,
about 20,000 (14%) would be "low-income" consumers, defined as those households
within COPEL's concession area and near existing distribution circuits which
are not served because of their inability to pay connection fees, presently
about US$100. COPEL has developed, in consultation with the Bank, a program
to provide electrical service to low-income consumers which includes a scheme
to finance the connection charges without interest, over a period of 36 months.
The choice of areas for implementing this program will be coordinated with
state government urban development agencies (Section 3.06 of the draft
Loan Agreement and 6 of the draft Project Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Appraisal of COPEL Distribution Project"
(No. 1028b-BR dated April 22, 1976) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. The main features of the proposed project and loan are
summarized in Annex III. The project was appraised in October 1975. Nego-
tiations with COPEL, the Government, and the State of Parana were held in
Washington from March 15, 1976 to April 8, 1976. COPEL was represented by a
team headed by Mr. Edson Guimaraes, Financial Director.



The Borrower
34.       COPEL was formed in 1954 as a joint-stock corporation for the pur-
pose of planning, building and developing systems of production, transmis-
sion, distribution and sales of electric power within the State of Parana.
Approximately 90% of the voting stock is owned by the state government and
its agencies, and the balance by ELETROBRAS. COPEL's utility plant was
valued at US$346 million in 1975 and construction in progress at about US$101
million. It has 4,850 employees and its facilities include installed gene-
rating capacity of 432 MW (hydro 398 MW, thermal 20 MW and diesel 14 MW).
35.       COPEL's management is composed of competent professionals promoted
within the utility (average age 42, average service 12 years) who have ac-
quired sound managerial experience and have the ability to successfully exe-
cute the project. The Corporation is administered by a six-member Board of
Directors which establishes policy and through the President, who is board
member, directs and supervises the Corporation's business. COPEL is organ-
ized into five departments, each headed by a director: Administration, Fi-
nance, Operations, Engineering and Construction, and Distribution. The
Distribution Department is organized into five regional offices, each headed
by a superintendent: Curitiba, Ponta Grossa, Londrina, Maringa and Cascavel.
36.       At year-end 1975, the number of customers per employee was 115 com-
pared to 43 in 1970, despite the recent merger into COPEL of private utilities
with large numbers of personnel. The customer/employee ratio should continue
to increase during the project period through COPEL's retraining and selection
program which is based on performance evaluations.
37.       COPEL's financial performance has been satisfactory, with financial
rates of return of 18%, 16% and 15% on its average net fixed assets in opera-
tion in 1973, 1974 and 1975, respectively. Almost all earnings have been re-
invested. COPEL's cash management is good. Cash balances are kept at a mini-
mum while temporary excEss cash is invested in short-term securities.    On
December 31, 1975, COPEI, had a comfortable debt/equity ratio of 37:63 which
is indicative of an ample borrowing capacity.
38.       COPEL's internal management information system is very good.    Oper-
ating and financial reports are prepared accurately and promptly, and custom-
er records and accounting systems are computerized. Its financial statements
are audited and certified by Arthur Andersen and Company.
Project Description
39.       The project consists of the construction, installation and improve-
ment of subtransmission, distribution and auxiliary service facilities, and
consultant services and training. The main features of the project are:
(i) installation of 216 circuit-km of 138 kV and 69 kV lines; 2,030 km of 34.5
kV and 13.8 kV lines; 775 MVA of transformer capacity at 138 kV, 69 kV, and
34.5 kV; 4,760 transformers with a total of 260 MVA capacity; 220,000 house-
hold electric meters and 135,000 street lights; (ii) acquisition and utiliza-
tion of energized-line maintenance and system protection and operation equip-
ment; and (iii) inspect.on of equipment fabrication through the utilization of



- 12 -
consultants' services, and training of staff during such inspection. Further
details of the project components are provided in Annex III. The project is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1979.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
40.       The total cost of the project, as estimated in April 1976, is
US$188.4 million equivalent with an estimated foreign exchange component of
US$52.0 million equivalent. The cost estimates are based on recent equip-
ment quotations and the cost of current civil works contracts for installa-
tion. An allowance for physical contingencies of 5% is assumed for all
electrical equipment and materials. For civil works and equipment erection,
the allowance for physical contingencies varied from 10% to 15% depending on
the state of preparation of final designs of individual components,and ave-
rages 11.5%. Allowances for price contingencies are 9% for 1976, and 8% per
annum for foreign costs; and 20% for 1976, 15% for 1977 and 1978, and 14% for
1979 for local costs. The allowances for foreign costs are reasonable. The
allowances for local costs appear high, but COPEL has adopted them on the
basis of its recent experience with similar works; these allowances do not
affect the size of the proposed Bank loan, which is equal to the project's
estimated foreign cost.

41.       COPEL's capital investment and financing plan during the project
period (1976-79), in constant December 1975 prices, can be summarized as
follows:

42.       Resources contributed directly by COPEL's consumers (net internal
cash generation and reinvestment of the proceeds of the "sole tax") would
cover a satisfactory prcportion--28%--of capital requirements. As noted In
paragraph 23, the resources contributed by ELETROBRAS (US$172 million or 26%
of the total capital recluirements) are also derived from sector consumers,
through taxes and obligation loans.



- 14 -
43.       COPEL's financing plan for the project period includes US$88
million equivalent of borrowing yet to be arranged for future works. COPEL
is considering the possibility of obtaining the foreign exchange component
of this amount (about US$30 million) through a loan from external private
lenders which would be associated with the proposed Bank loan, in a manner
similar to that employed in connection with the recent Brazilian steel
project (R75-103/2).
44.       Construction of the Foz do Areia hydroelectric project will extend
beyond 1979. It is currently estimated that, when completed in 1981, Foz do
Areia will have cost US$666.5 million at current prices (US$483 at December
1975 prices), including interest during construction. To date, COPEL has
arranged US$74.0 million equivalent in foreign financing for this project
from IDB and US$23.0 million from bilateral credit agencies. The remainder
of the cost will be financed from COPEL's cash generation and domestic loan.
45.       The cost estimates and financing plans shown in paragraph 41 do
not include an allowance for price contingencies. COPEL estimates that it
will need an additional US$228 million during the project period to meet
price contingencies. Funds for these contingencies would come principally
from future tariff increases and from additional domestic borrowing. In addi-
tion, both the proposed Bank loan and the IDB loan for Foz do Areia include
amounts to cover price contingencies.
46.       The State Governemnt would reinvest dividends received from COPEL
through 1979 in the form of additional share capital of COPEL (Section 5 of
the draft Project Agreement). COPEL's financing plan as shown above is
reasonable, particularly with the support of the Federal Government through
ELETROBRAS. In the event that COPEL did not have sufficient funds to assure
the timely completion of the project, the State of Parana (Section 3 of the
draft Project Agreement), and ultimately the Federal Government (Section 2.02
of the draft Guarantee Agreement), would be committed to provide them.
47.       COPEL's financial outlook is satisfactory.    It is expected that
even when work-in-progress reaches the highest proportion to total assets,
internal cash generation would cover debt service payments at least 1.8
times, partly because the debt/equity ratio will remain below 46:54 level
and overall indebtedness is not expected to exceed 55% of COPEL's total net
fixed assets. COPEL would not incur new debt if by such incurrence, total
debt were to exceed 66-2/3% of COPEL's total fixed assets less depreciation.
It would alw not incur new debt with an original term of less than 8 years,
if by so doing the total outstanding principal amount of such debt were to
exceed 5% of its total fixed assets (Section 5.07 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment).
Engineering and Project Execution
48.       COPEL's own staff is expected to carry out satisfactorily the
engineering designs, specifications and construction supervision of the



- 1 5 -
project. For the preparation of bidding documents for procurement through
international competitive bidding and for equipment fabrication inspections,
COPEL would use the services of a consulting firm, Companhia Auxiliar de
Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB). COPEL would contract with local
firms for construction of most of the project works. Equipment installation
would be done in most instances by the suppliers. Some construction and
equipment installation would also be performed by COPEL's own forces. A
sufficient number of qualified local firms are available to handle the job
satisfactorily and on schedule.
Procurement and Disbursement
49.       Procurement of the equipment to be financed by the Bank would
follow the Bank's Guidelines. Manufacturers whose bids contain components
manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the bid would
be given a margin of preference equal to 15% or the applicable import duty,
whichever is less. Brazilian firms are expected to win about two-thirds of
the total bids because cf the domestic capability to supply at competitive
prices the type of equipment and materials used in the project. Special im-
ported metering and system protection equipment estimated to cost about US$1.8
million will be purchasEd directly, without international competitive bidding
because of the need for standardization. Likewise, miscellaneous imported
equipment aggregating up, to US$0.8 million, required in small quantitities
throughout project execution, will be purchaced directly. Procurement of
project items not financed by the Bank will be through COPEL's normal pro-
cedures, which are satisfactory.
50.       Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made against appropriate
documentation for 100% of foreign expenditures on imported goods or 100% of
the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured goods and for 100% of foreign
expenditures on equipment inspection and training abroad.
Environment
51.       COPEL will carry out the project with due regard to environmental
factors. In the cities of Londrina and Ponta Grossa, for example, utility
poles for feeder lines -!n congested areas will be relocated to improve traffic
safety. In Curitiba, the underground distribution network will contribute
substantially toward improvement in system losses and service reliability and
will also improve the appearance of the most congested zone in the state's
capital.
Project Benefits and Rat:e of Return
52.       The project would enable COPEL to meet growing service requirements
in its concession area, while improving efficiency and reliability through
reduction in losses and outages and better voltage regulation. The project
would connect about 141,000 new consumers, including 20,000 low-income



- 16 -
households in the main cities of Parana. In view of the complexity of the
systems effects, and of the difficulty in interpretation, an internal rate
of return on the project has not been calculated. However, the rate of return
on the overall investment program has been estimated to be 20%. A sensitivity
analysis indicates that a reduction in sales of 10% and an increase in cost of
10% would result in a return of 17%. This indicates that the average price
that consumers will pay for power will be considerably in excess of incremental
system costs, and that wasteful use of electricity and unnecessary investment
will be avoided.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Companhia Paranaense
de Energia Eletrica (COPEL), the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federa-
tive Republic of Brazil and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the
State of Parana and the Bank, the draft supplementary letter on COPEL's rate
of return, the draft Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Features of the draft Loan, Guarantee, and Project
Agreements of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 29, 30, 32, 46
and 47 of this report.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
(As of March 31, 1976)
There are now 31 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/474   Estreito Hydroelectric Project:    US$57 and US$39 million loans
of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Effective Dates:
July 8, 1965 and June 1, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is completed and the loan is almost fully disbursed.
Equipment costs were substantially below estimates. The original
Closing Date was April 1, 1971.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:    US$22.3 million loan of
October 23, 1968; Effective Date: February 18, 1969; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975. Changes in the project layout and
design have increased substantially the local cost, which will
be covered by ELETROBRAS, without, however, significantly affect-
ing the economic justification for the project. Construction
work is completed. The Closing Date of the project was postponed
from March 31, 1975, the original date, to December 31, 1975, to
allow for disbursement of retention payments.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:    US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1968; Effective Date: February 27, 1969; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976. The project was delayed six months by
spillway foundation difficulties but progress has since been
satisfactory. The project was completed in September 1975 with
a cost overrun of US$138 million due to foundation problems and
cost increases in equipment. However, the resulting unit cost
of generating capacity is still attractive. The Closing Date of
the Loan was postponed a second time to June 30, 1976, to permit
payments to continue on several purchases already placed. The
original Closing Date was January 31, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:   US$80 million loan of May 25,
1970; Effective Date: September 29, 1970; Closing Date: May 31,
1977. Construction work is proceeding on schedule. The cost of
the project has increased by US$42 million, or 15% over the
original estimate, because of increased excavation and concrete
work, resulting from poor rock foundation, and increased equipment
prices. This has not significantly affected the economic justi-
fication of the project.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of April 5,
1971; Effective Date: July 19, 1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977.
The construction of the Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant is progress-
ing satisfactorily and the first two of the planned four generating
units are now in commercial operation. A cost overrun of about
US$127 million, due to increased equipment and construction costs,
is foreseen, but this does not significantly affect the economic
justification of the project. The cost overrun is being financed
by loans from ELETROBRAS and a commercial bank. The construction
of the transmission system, delayed to allow required modifications,
is proceeding satisfactorily.
755       Education Project:   US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971; Effective
Date:  October 28, 1971; Closing Date:   December 31, 1977.    Prog-
ress on the construction and equipping of the project schools is
now proceeding satisfactorily. However, the project implementation
is behind the original schedule due to initial delays in establish-
ing and staffing the project unit and because of subsequent changes
in project content. The original Closing Date was December 31, 1975
756       Santos Port Project:   US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971; Effective
Date: October 29, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1979. Execution of
the project is now proceeding satisfactorily, although there have
been further delays and cost overruns which will be financed by the
Borrower. The Government has approved legislation which converted
DNPVN from a government agency to a public corporation, PORTOBRAS.
PORTOBRAS, with the assistance of management consultants, has been
improving port operations in Santos. The National Port Development
Study financed under the project is now completed.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:   US$22 million loan of June 21,
1971; Effective Date: January 13, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1976. The project suffered initial delays caused by the State of
Sao Paulo not furnishing the required counterpart funds, which are
now included in the state budget. The Government has consolidated
all the water and sewerage companies in the state into a single
company, SABESP, and a loan assumption agreement with the new
company was conzluded on December 18, 1974. Progress of the project
is expected to improve with new management of the company which took
office recently. The original Closing Date was June 30,
1975.

Loan No.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:   US$15 million loan of June 21,
1971; Effective Date: January 13, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
A review of the original design resulted in its modification to ex-
clude the discharge of raw sewage and a related treatment facility.
As a result of the modifications in the project, the loan amount was
reduced to US$12 million. The Government has consolidated all the
water and sewerage companies in the State into a single company,
SABESP, and a loan assumption agreement with the new company was
concluded December 18, 1974. Progress of the project is expected
to improve with new management which took office recently. The
original Closing Date was June 30, 1975.
786       Railway Project - MBR:   US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Effective Date: February 4, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
The project is now completed, except for the construction and equip-
ping of the Borrower's main workshop at Jaceaba. The purchase of
equipment for this workshop was delayed because of a change in the
location of the workshop resulting from the Government's decision to
build a new railway line between the cities of Belo Horizonte and
Volta Redonda. To allow additional time required for the purchase
of this equipment, the Closing Date, originally September 30, 1975,
was postponed to March 31, 1978.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project, Stage II:   US$64.5 million loan of
February 8, 1972; Effective Date: August 31, 1972; Closing Date:
July 1, 1976. The latest cost estimate is US$653 million, an in-
crease of about 65% over the appraisal estimate due to design
evolution, unforeseen site works and increases in local construc-
tion costs. This cost increase will not significantly affect the
economic justification of the project. The project is now 75%
complete and is about ten months behind the appraisal schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Project, Stage II:    US$63 million loan
of April 11, 1972; Effective Date: July 28, 1972; Closing Date:
June 1, 1977. The latest cost estimate is US$952 million, an
increase of about 67% from the appraisal estimate due primarily
to design evolution and increases in local construction costs.
This cost increase will not significantly affect the economic
justification of the project. The project is 80% complete and is
about nine months behind the original schedule. Implementation of
Stage III, which is not being financed by the Bank, is well under-
way. The original Closing Date was June 1, 1976.
813       Third Highway Construction Project:    US$89 million loan of
April 11, 1972; Effective Date: December 4, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976. Construction works are more than 98% completed
but are slightly behind schedule; the estimated total contract
cost is about 2% above the appraisal estimate. The feasibility
studies and detailed engineering financed under the loan were

started later than planned, but are now completed at a cost
substantially below the appraisal estimate. Disbursements are
lagging behind the appraisal forecast, but have improved during
the past year.
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project, Stage II:   US$64.5 million loan
of June 14, 1972; Effective Date: October 5, 1972; Closing
Date: January 15, 1977. The latest cost estimate is US$733
million, an increase of about 55% over the appraisal estimate
due primarily to increased local construction costs. This will
not significantly affect the economic justification of the project.
The project is now 70% complete and is about nine months behind
the original schedule.
829       Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project:   US$60 million loan of June 14,
1972; Effective Date: September 20, 1972; Closing Date:
September 30, 1979. Construction of the project is proceeding
according to schedule. An anticipated 50% cost overrun is being
covered by local and foreign borrowing.
853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:   US$6.7 million loan of July 24,
1972; Effective Date:  February 15, 1973; Closing Date:   December 1,
1978. COLONE has prepared revised farm development plans whose
credit component, to be financed by public financial institutions,
will be significantly higher than originally estimated, although
still low in comparison to other settlement projects. Administra-
tive delays in the release of public funds for farm credit and
COLONE working capital requirements and difficulties in recruiting
project staff delayed the start of project execution. Settlement,
however, has now begun and the project should be completed in 1978
as envisaged.
854       Fourth Highway Construction Project:   US$51 million loan of
August 4, 1972; Effective Date: March 21, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976. Construction is more than 75% completed but
behind schedule. However, disbursement is expected to be com-
pleted by the Closing Date. The estimated total contract cost
is 11% above the appraisal estimate.
857       Grain Storage Project:   US$30 million loan of September 27, 1972;
Effective Date: January 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
After some initial difficulties with the appraisal of subprojects,
the project had been progressing satisfactorily. However, in April
1975 the Government adopted a national grain storage financing
program involving subsidized interest rates. Therefore, on
October 28, 1975, the Bank and the Borrower agreed to cancel the
uncommitted balance (about 20%) of the loan. Disbursement of the
loan is proceeding as scheduled.

868       Interim Second Livestock Project:   US$26 million loan of December 19,
1972; Effective Date: May 24, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project is proceeding normally. The loan has been fully com-
mitted and is expected to be disbursed as scheduled.
887       Power Distribution Project:   US$20 million loan of April 16, 1973;
Effective Date: July 31, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Prin-
cipally due to difficulties encountered in preparing bidding docu-
ments and delays in deliveries of equipment and materials, the
project is about two years behind schedule. Complete delivery and
installation of equipment and materials to be financed by the loan
will probably take until July 1977 and a postponement of the Closing
Date will be required.
923       Itumbiara Hydroelectric Project:   US$125 million loan of August 1,
1973; Effective Date: October 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1982. Contracts for penstocks, turbines, and concrete and earth
works have been awarded. Commissioning of the first generating
unit is scheduled for March 1980, four months behind original
schedule due to delay in awarding of the civil works contracts.
924       Agro-Industries Credit Project:   US$54 million loan of August 1,
1973; Effective Date: March 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978. The Central Bank expects to complete commitment of project
funds by mid-1976.
1008      Paulo Afonso IV Hydroelectric Power Project:   US$81 million loan of
June 17, 1974; Effective Date: April 15, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978. A Bank mission recently reviewed the progress
of the preparation and implementation of plans for resettlement of
the 9,700 families to be displaced by the Sobradinho reservoir.
Execution of these plans is underway, and construction of new
towns to house the urban portion of the population has begun. The
rural population is being offered the opportunity of resettlement
in a promising new agricultural area in the Corrente River region
in the western part of the State of Bahia. Those who prefer to
remain near their present houses will be resettled in new villages
on the edge of the future reservoir. The construction of the
underground power station and Sobradinho Dam is proceeding on
schedule.
1009      Minas Gerais Water Supply Project:   US$36 million loan of June 17,
1974; Effective Date: January 9, 1975; Closing Date: August 15,
1977. The State Water Supply Company changed its name from Companhia
Mineira de Agua e Esgotos (COMAG) to Companhia de Saneamento de Minas
Gerais (COPASA-MG). The project is progressing on schedule and the
loan has been fully committed.

1067      Second Education Project:   US$23.5 million loan of December 27,
1974; Effective Date: April 17, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1979. Project execution has started reasonably well, and is expected
to be completed by the target date. Project implementation units have
been established in all eight project states and these, together with
the main project unit, PREMEN, are working well. The pre-investment
studies in the Northeast, financed under the loan, are underway and
are expected to yield useful information for future sector investment
planning.
1074      Second Railway Project:   US$175 million loan of January 17, 1975;
Effective Date: June 17, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Project execution is progressing reasonably well and appropriate
steps are being taken to strengthen project management and control.
Cost estimates for the Investment Plan, of which the project is a
part, have increased substantially on several items. The Borrower
is therefore preparing a revised Plan in which items with low prior-
ity will be postponed or scaled-down. This revision is not expected
to affect the project items. Tendering for Bank-financed items is
on schedule.
1075      Fifth Highway Project:   US$110 million loan of January 17, 1975;
Effective Date: May 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. Contracts for
civil works for all 21 lots have now been awarded and construction
works are proceeding according to schedule.    Implementation of the
road maintenance component of the project is slightly delayed due
to protracted negotiations for the hiring of consultants.
1152      COSIPA Steel EKpansion Project - Stage III:     US$60.0 million loan
of August 4, 1975; Effective Date:    March 4, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980. Project is proceeding according to
schedule. Bidding for equipment is underway.
1153      Lower Sao Francisco Polders Project:    US$23.0 million loan of
August 4, 1975; Effective Date: November 25, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979. Construction of dikes and the
irrigation and drainage system for the Betume varzea has begun.
Bidding for most of the other civil works and equipment procure-
ment is underway. Preliminary estimates, prior to bid evalua-
tion, are that project costs might increase considerably over
the appraisal estimate due to partial design changes and more
rapid than expected increases in equipment and construction
prices and in costs of land expropriation. The emergency works

remain the least cost way to offset the effects on the project
area population of the hydroelectric developments upstream.
Nevertheless, further possible modifications in the design of
emergency and irrigation works are being studied by CODEVASF and
its consultants with a view to limiting cost increases.
1171      Third Railway Project (FEPASA):   US$75.0 million loan of November 12,
1975; Effective Date: March 24, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily.
