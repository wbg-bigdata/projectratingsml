               MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT


                    Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Construction Program


          Iam pleased to submit to you the performance assessment report o f the Chad-Cameroon
          Petroleum Development and Pipeline Construction Program which IEG undertook in
          response to interest expressed by members o f the Board o f Directors.

          This evaluation embodies two novel features. First, it assesses the performance o f a
          program o f five IBRD and IDA financed projects, two I F C loans and three I F C advisory
           services in a cluster, thereby combining an evaluation o f the development effectiveness
          o f the program as a whole with an assessment o f the performance o f each individual
          operation. Second, this i s the first project based performance assessment which has been
          jointly undertaken by IEG-World Bank and IEG-IFC.

          The evaluation finds that the program's fundamental development objective o f reducing
          poverty and improving governance in Chad through the best possible use o f o i l revenues
          in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner was not achieved. I t therefore
          rates overall program outcome unsatisfactory despite the technical and financial success
          o f the main pipeline project. While the program suffered from some design flaws and
          supervision shortcomings, the principal reason for i t s overall disappointing outcome was
          the lack o f government ownership.

          The disappointing development outcome notwithstanding, the evaluation also finds
          that World Bank Group involvement resulted in stronger environmental and social
          protection and in higher expenditure allocations to priority sectors than would have been
          the case otherwise. It concludes that the Chad-Cameroon experience should not lead
          the World Bank Group to avoid appropriate involvement in extractive industries, but in
          designing such future involvement the World Bank Group should be mindful o f the
          important lessons o f this complex experience.

          In accordance with IEG's Disclosure Policy Statement Outline (R2003-0223) that was
          approved by the Executive Directors on January 8,2004, this evaluation will be made
          publicly available unless Executive Directors decide not to disclose. IEG plans on
          disclosing the report on October 8, 2009, unless Executive Directors request a
          postponement.
                                                              1




      IEG Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

     This is a joint evaluation by IEG-WB and IEG-IFC. The structure and ratings generally follow IEG-WB practice,
which is explained below. Nevertheless,the findings, conclusions and ratings were arrived at jointly and by
consensus of the two institutions. The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the
World Bank for two purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks
work is producingthe expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or WBG management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important
lessons.
     To prepare a Program Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and
other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local
offices as appropriate.
     Each report is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the report is commented on by the responsibleWBG departments, and comments are incorporated as
relevant. The completed report then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the
document that is sent to the Board of Executive Directors, after which it is disclosed to the public.

About the Rating System

      The IFC rating system for Advisory Service projects is substantively comparable to the IEG-WB system, which is
 mainly used in this evaluation. Use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to
 adapt to lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to
 arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
 information is available on the IEG-WB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
 of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are
 consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
 strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,
 Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is
 consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are
 expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project
 achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost
 compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
 Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
 Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This report evaluates the World Bank Group's program o f support for o i l development and
pipeline construction in Chad and Cameroon, comprising the Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Development projects for Chad and Cameroon (substantially the same project,
supported by separate loans from the IFC and the IBRD), and three capacity-building IDA-
supported projects. One, to Cameroon, was for building the capacity to monitor the
petroleum sector; a second, for Chad, aimed at strengthening the capacity to manage o i l
development in an environmentally and socially sound manner; and the third, also for Chad,
supported the arrangements for managing the o i l revenue and improving public expenditure.
All were approved in 2000 and became effective in 2001. Moreover, IFC had a number o f
advisory activities complementing these efforts. Together, these projects and activities were
viewed as an integrated cluster (hereafter "the program").

The report combines an evaluation o f the program, in i t s main text, with an evaluation o f
each individual project, in the annexes. The lessons identified in the text are those generally
applicable to the program, with project-specific lessons included in the corresponding annex.

The evaluation i s based on the documentation o f the projects, Implementation Completion
Reports (ICRs), Inspection Panel Reports, other World Bank and I F C documents and various
internal memoranda, reports by the pipeline operators and by Esso Exploration and
Production Chad, Inc. (EEPCI), and the relevant external literature. (See the Selected
References.) In addition, the evaluation benefited from extensive interviews with some 100
interlocutors in the Bank, IFC, IMF, all major development partners, the two governments,
and civil society organizations, and a mission to Cameroon and Chad, including site visits, in
February 2009.

The cooperation o f all interlocutors, and particularly those o f the two governments in
welcoming the IEG mission and sharing their views and time, was invaluable. IEG also
gratefully acknowledges the cooperation o f the Bank's country and sector teams and the
assistance o f country office staff in Cameroon and Chad. Finally, the team benefited from
information and exchange o f views with the two external advisory groups for the program,
the External Compliance Monitoring Group and the International Advisory Group.

Following standard IEG procedure, the report was sent to the two governments and
comments received are attached in Annex H.

Executive Summary

1.       The fundamental development objective o f WBG support for the Chad-Cameroon o i l
development and pipeline construction program begun in 2000 was to reduce poverty in
Chad and improve governance through the best possible use o f the o i l revenue, in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner. Despite the technical and financial success
o f the pipeline project, linked largely to the high price o f oil, this fundamental objective has
not been achieved. Indeed, the o i l revenue windfall was associated with a resurgence o f civil
conflict and a worsening o f governance. The evaluation concludes that the principal reason
for this disappointing outcome was the lack o f government ownership, with repeated
violations o f the basic agreements. Actual outcomes might have been better with a more
flexible program design, suited to the fluid circumstances and political economy o f Chad.
However, no alternative program design or closer supervision would have allowed to achieve
the program's development objectives in the absence o f government commitment.

2.       The overall development outcome was disappointing, but the evaluation also finds
that WBG involvement resulted in stronger environmental and social protections, and in
higher expenditure allocations to priority sectors, than would have been the case otherwise.
The report concludes that the WBG was right to support the program in 2000 and did so in
full cognizance o f the risks involved. Views among various stakeholders differ on the
decision and manner o f World Bank exit in 2008. The Chad-Cameroon program experience
should not lead the WBG to avoid appropriate involvement in extractive industries --however
risky it may be-with a view to helping to bring about more sustainable outcomes, but in
designing such involvement it should be keenly mindful o f the important lessons o f this
complex and controversial experience.

PROGRAM GENESISAND STRUCTURE

3.      In 2000, after an intense internal debate dating back to 1994, under external pressures,
and fully recognizing the risks, the World Bank Group (WBG) embarked on an ambitious
program o f support for the development o f o i l in southern Chad and its export via a pipeline
through Cameroon and an offshore o i l export terminal. Chad would gain royalties and
dividends from the o i l export revenue (and eventually taxes) and Cameroon a transit fee from
the pipeline (as well as income tax and dividends from the pipeline operator). WBG support
comprised the main oil development and pipeline construction project, financed in part by I F C
and IBRD loans and managed by a Consortium o f o i l companies led by ExxonMobil. It also
included IDA projects in each o f the countries to build their capacity to manage the o i l sector,
and an IDA project to help manage the o i l revenue and improve public expenditure and
budgeting systems in Chad, where I F C also conducted advisory activities (Table ES-1). Over
90 percent o f the financing was provided by the Consortium and a group o f commercial banks.

OBJECTIVES
4.      The objectives o f the individual projects were subsidiary to the main development
objective o f the whole program, which related to Chad. Except for the important
environmental and social aspects, the involvement o f Cameroon was ancillary, required to
get the o i l from landlocked Chad to the market.

5.        As stated in the Chad Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) and confirmed by
internal documentation and stakeholder interviews, the main objective o f the program was to
achieve progress in governance and poverty reduction by means o f the o i l revenue. Thus, the
o i l revenue management arrangements were the core o f the entire program. As a senior
manager put it at the time, the success o f the program would be measured not in dollars but
in h o w many Chadians it would lift out o f poverty. In the 2001 CAS this objective was
formulated as helping Chad use the petroleum resources to attempt to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals. The 2003 CAS defined "the overarching objective" as
making "the best possible" developmental use o f the new o i l revenues2 That CAS went

2. The 1996 CAS for Chad, before serious consideration o f WBG involvement in the o i l development and
pipeline construction, lists the three strategic objectives as restoring public sector capacity, focusing public
expenditure on poverty reduction, and creating an enabling environment for the private sector.
                                               xii


further, and identified the two pillars as "strengthening governance, including institutional
arrangements for public resource management and service delivery [and] the r u l e o f law.. ."
and "enhancing non-oil economic opportunities while reducing sources o f vulnerability."

6.       Accordingly, while the outcomes o f the individual projects are assessed in this report
against their stated project development objectives (PDOs), the outcomes o f the program are
assessed against the main objective o f improving governance and reducing poverty in Chad,
through the use o f the o i l revenue and in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
The program encompasses the participation o f both the World Bank (IDA and IBRD) and the
I F C as integral parts o f the World Bank Group, with the evaluative considerations o f
development impact referring to the I F C as much as to the Bank.

RISKS

7.     The WBG was clear that the project should meet the highest standards o f
environmental and social protection, and-after rounds o f review and comments by the
WBG on earlier drafts-a thorough Environmental Action Plan and provisions for addressing
the social implications o f the project were approved and an independent External Compliance
Management Group (EMCG) was put in place. This answered some o f the concerns
expressed by international and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

8.      For Chad, however, NGOs and others (including within the WBG) were particularly
worried that the o i l revenue would not be allocated to pro-poor and pro-development
expenditure, owing to the governance weaknesses in the country-indeed, that the o i l
revenue itself could aggravate these weaknesses and possibly lead to renewed conflict after
several years o f comparative stability.

9.       The Bank recognized these risks and attempted to address them through an unusually
detailed and complex set o f arrangements. The core o f the program was the 1999 Petroleum
Revenue Management Law, which set aside 10 percent o f future o i l royalties and dividends
for a Future Generations Fund, 5 percent o f royalties for expenditure in the oil-producing
region, and about 85 percent o f the remainder for expenditure in agreed priority sectors. The
arrangement was backed by an escrow account in London into which the Consortium would
deposit the o i l export revenue-both in order to ensure repayment o f the IBRD loan (required
in view o f Chad's insufficient creditworthiness) and to underpin the pro-development
allocation o f the o i l revenue and other key features o f the agreement. A novel institution with
civil society participation-the CollBge de ContrGle et de Surveillance des Ressources
Pe`troliBres (Oil Revenue Monitoring and Oversight Committee)-was           set up to review and
advise the government on the programs to be financed with the o i l revenue. And, covering
both countries, an International Advisory Group composed o f eminent persons was
established to counsel the two governments and the WBG on implementation o f the program.

10.      Other major risks were also recognized at an early stage, namely, a possible spillover
from the crisis in Darfur; waning government commitment as soon as the o i l would begin to
flow; and social unrest if the o i l revenue were not used for pro-poor, pro-development
activities. To an extent, both a Darfur spillover and social resentment may in fact be
associated with the internal violence experienced in Chad since 2003, and the CAS also
proved correct in singling out the risk o f waning government commitment.

   EVENTS
MAIN              APPROVAL
        AFTER BOARD

1 1.     With the o i l revenue coming on stream in late 2003-much earlier than anticipated
and in the far greater amounts associated with the increase in world o i l price-the government
o f Chad unsuccessfully pressed the Bank during 2005 to agree to modify the 1999 Law, and
on December 29 amended it unilaterally in major ways, including by eliminating the Future
Generations Fund. The Bank responded one week later by suspending disbursements on all
Bank operations and freezing government withdrawals from the escrow account. After
resumption o f the dialogue, a new agreement was reached in July 2006, by which the
government promised to allocate to the priority sectors 70 percent o f all budgetary resources
(a much greater amount than the earlier 85 percent o f direct o i l revenue only), and the Bank
removed the hold on the escrow account and resumed disbursements.

12.       The new agreed allocation target was missed by a significant margin. In August 2008
(after initial unsuccessful informal demarches), the Bank persuaded Chad to voluntarily repay
not only the outstanding balance o n the IBRD loan but also the balances o n the two IDA
credits (for the first time in Bank history). Chad repaid the total o f $65.7 million in
September, and the World Bank's involvement in Chad's o i l sector came to a close. However,
I F C has continued to monitor the environmental and social aspects o f the petroleum and
pipeline project and to help Chadian companies secure contracts from EEPCI.

OUTCOMES
13.       The main petroleum and pipeline project was a physical, technical, and financial
success, with the pipeline completed and o i l flowing ahead o f time. The distribution o f
benefits differed greatly between the two countries, as a result o f their different situations and
roles in the program.

  14.      Cameroon. Cameroon's involvement was mainly as a means to help achieve the key
. objective o f the program, i.e., to help Chad reduce poverty and improve governance through the
  best possible use o f the oil revenue. However, important issues were nevertheless at stake, and
  significant gains accrued to Cameroon. The major issues related to the handling o f the high risks
  to the environment associated with the construction o f an oil pipeline and, to a lesser extent
because o f the comparatively small number o f people, addressing the social impact o f pipeline
construction. In both respects, the arrangements put in place for compliance with environmental
specifications at the project level (especially the Environmental Management Plan) and
addressing the social implications, and their monitoring through an independent entity, may be
regarded as among the best in extractive industries projects in Africa.

 15.     The program also aimed at strengthening Cameroon's own capacity to manage and
monitor the o i l sector, including environmental risks, through an IDA-supported project. In
this respect, the outcome was unsatisfactory, owing to modest relevance and efficacy.

16.      For Cameroon, the pipeline project objective was to augment the financial resources
available for development and pro-poor expenditure. The project achieved this objective,
although to a lesser degree than aimed for because o f lower production o f oil. The gains to the
                                                 xiv


country included the revenue to the government from the pipeline transit fees as well as the
income taxes and dividends from the pipeline operator. Although the pipeline-related revenue
added up to about 1.5 percent o f total government revenue, it was less than originally estimated
owing to the lower amounts o f o i l passing through the pipeline. Since the pipeline maintenance
and repair was ensured by the Consortium, and in light o f the small fraction o f total revenue
accounted for by the pipeline-related resources, no provision was or could be made for the
specific use o f those resources-which thus accrued to the general government budget.

17.      There were other gains as well, in the form o f contributions to the local economy and
stimulus to private sector activity through provision o f jobs, skill-formation, supplier
development, and infrastructure improvements in connection with the building o f the pipeline,
in addition to direct community donations by the Consortium.

18.     Nevertheless, both the expectations and the outcomes o f the overall program were
comparatively minor for Cameroon, and no macro-level development, governance, or poverty
impact could be expected from the program, let alone tracked or measured.

 19.     Chad. By contrast, the program led to a remarkable increase in financial resources
available to the Chad government, from an annual revenue o f about $1 12 million in 2000 to
over $2 billion in 2008, almost 90 percent o f it from oil. The broad macro-level outcomes,
therefore, can only be assessed with reference to Chad.

20.      The revenue to Chad was much larger than had been envisaged owing to the much
higher o i l price. As in Cameroon, the project also generated direct benefits in the form o f
employment, training, and other contributions to the local economy, and IFC's Linkage
programs have supported small and medium enterprises through EEPCI's purchase o f goods
and services and the development o f long-term supplier relationships.

21.      The handling o f the environmental and social impact at the project level before and
during pipeline construction was satisfactory in Chad as well. However, problems have
emerged on the social side after completion o f the pipeline and with the expansion beyond the
original three o i l fields, and the outcome o f the capacity-building efforts was as unsatisfactory
as in Cameroon, again due to modest relevance and efficacy.

22.      The macroeconomic, development, poverty reduction, governance, and institutional
development outcomes were disappointing and there i s as yet no evidence o f the hoped-for
positive improvements. W h i l e major improvements in poverty reduction, human development
or governance are unlikely to appear in a few years, it would not be unrealistic to expect some
movement in a positive direction. O n the contrary, various indicators o f governance show a
deterioration.

23.      The broad outcomes in Chad during the period o f the program can be summarized as
follows:

        The fiscal position has become weaker over the period, with the non-oil primary
        deficit worsening from a modest 4 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 28 percent in 2008-a
        level the IMF has termed unsustainable. (The concern is not an increase in non-oil
                                                 xv


        primary deficit, per se, but its rapid acceleration, associated with much higher current
        expenditure and combined with issues o f expenditure composition and efficiency.)
        The economic composition o f expenditure has worsened, with current expenditure
        rising f i o m some 10 percent o f non-oil GDP in 2001-04 to 21 percent in 2005-08, and
        a wage bill rising to 9 percent o f non-oil GDP.
        The functional composition o f expenditure, the central focus o f the program, did
        improve toward sectors important for development and poverty reduction-ven               ifby
        less than had been agreed. The largest increase was accounted for by investment in
        infrastructure, which, however, exhibited substantial inefficiencies.
        The efficiency o f expenditure has been very low, from violations o f fundamental
        procurement and financial management rules, much higher unit construction costs
        than international or regional norms, and, most damaging, neglect o f the balance
        between investment and recurrent cost, which resulted in new facilities unable to
        operate for lack o f the requisite current inputs. However, although comparatively
        small, the expenditures in the oil-producing region financed by the 5 percent o f o i l
        royalties were comparatively well allocated.)
        Data o n human development are few and the picture is mixed, with an increase in
        access to clean water and a reduction in incidence o f HIV/AIDS, but a rise in infant
        and child mortality; an increase in primary education enrollment but a deterioration o f
        educational quality. Poverty developments were not adequately monitored, a serious
        shortcoming for a program whose main objective was poverty reduction through the
        use o f o i l revenue.
        The developments in governance are not mixed. Between 2000 and 2007, while
        Africa as a whole showed a slight improvement, Chad experienced a marked
        deterioration against all major governance indicators-with the decline especially
        sharp in r u l e o f law, control o f corruption, and government effectiveness.
        In government effectiveness, the main problems are in public financial management
        and procurement. Although budget preparation improved somewhat, budget execution
        deteriorated, and government effectiveness in public expenditure management i s
        currently worse than in 2000-with financial controls frequently bypassed during
        budget execution; disregard o f procurement regulations and increasing recourse to sole-
        source contracts; virtually inoperative institutions o f financial accountability; and the
        rise o f a culture o f rule violation in public sector management.

         DIMENSIONS CROSSCUTTING ISSUES
EVALUATION        AND

24.     The main oil development and pipeline construction project was a physical, technical,
and financial success. The o i l revenue accruing much sooner and in higher amounts than
anticipated was a major factor underlying the program's failure to achieve i t s development
objectives in Chad. The management arrangements devised for a comparatively limited
amount o f o i l revenue cracked under the weight o f the much larger revenue that materialized.
The larger revenue also generated temptations and competing claims that were in part
associated with the re-emergence o f political instability and violent rebellion. The slow efforts
at capacity building were undercut by the more rapid inflow o f oil money. And the o i l revenue
much greater than the total o f foreign aid sharply altered the initial leverage calculus o f the
program. Despite notable isolated achievements, mainly in road construction and access to
water, the World Bank Group's broad objective o f helping Chad reduce poverty and improve
                                                xvi


governance was not met. Measured against this objective, the overall program outcome was
unsatisfactory.

25.     However, given the complexity o f this program and the diversity o f outcomes, the
standard evaluation approach o f assessing outcomes against the stated objectives needs to be
qualified by considering the possible counterfactuals. With the rapid increase in o i l price
after 2000, it i s virtually certain that the o i l would have been developed and the pipeline
constructed even without any WBG involvement, albeit perhaps one or two years later. If so,
the environmental and social provisions and the external monitoring arrangements would not
have been as thorough as those under the program. Also, it is probable that the revenue
allocations to the priority sectors would have been lower than they have actually been, and it
is certain that the support institutions such as the Collbge and the advisory groups would not
have been put in place. In this sense, WBG involvement made a positive contribution.

26.      Relevance. The relevance o f the program was adversely affected by weaknesses in
the design o f the capacity-building interventions as well as the main o i l revenue management
arrangements. Concerning the former, a major external criticism was that the program was
premature, in that it would have been necessary to f i r s t build the country's capacity to
manage the petroleum sector and the o i l revenue, and to improve governance. However, a
short delay could not have achieved those long-gestation objectives, and there were clear
signs that the o i l would be developed and the pipeline built in the very near future with or
without WBG involvement. The more pertinent timing issue i s instead retrospective. After its
first foray in Chad's o i l sector in 1994 the Bank did not succeed during the subsequent years
in helping Chad to achieve a sustainable improvement in budgeting, financial controls and o i l
sector management capacity, and the attempt to support capacity-building activities
concurrently with the main project proved unsuccessful.

27.      Concerning the o i l revenue management arrangement subtending the management o f
the petroleum economy project--which was the core o f the program--the design was
prescriptive, overly detailed, and rigid. The earmarking o f the o i l revenue, combined with the
complex management arrangements, led to fragmentation o f the budget, neglect o f the quality
o f expenditure, and insufficient attention to budget execution. The design was understandably
motivated by the goal to assure the best possible use o f the o i l revenue for pro-poor and pro-
development expenditure. In reality, no prescriptive legal provision could compensate for weak
government commitment and thus the approach eventually showed the disadvantages o f
rigidity without its advantages for clarity and enforcement o f agreements. The disappointing
program outcomes have resulted from a complex o f economic and political circumstances,
including particularly lack o f government ownership, severe security threats o n the government
from the Dark crisis, and other factors. Even under these circumstances, alternative designs
focused o n agreements o n expenditure and i t s quality rather than specifically oil revenue
(based, for example, o n soft targets within a band triggering progressively stronger review and
correction provisions) might have provided a middle ground between a negotiating
straightjacket and the excessively discretionary criterion "satisfactory to the Bank." In the end,
a more flexible approach might also have facilitated the flow o f resources to priority activities
and their more efficient use, without short-circuiting capacity building in public financial
management. Overall, the relevance o f the program was modest.
                                                       xvii


28.      Concerning efficiency and efficacy, the pipeline project was very efficient in technical
and financial terms, but the efficiency o f the overall program was affected by modest efficiency
o f the capacity building projects and the overall less than efficient use o f o i l revenues. The
program's overall efficacy was modest at best, as seen in the outcomes described earlier.

29.   Risk to development outcome is high. The external environment remains very challenging,
with uncertain prospects for a resolution o f the crisis in D&    and the spillover o f problems into
Chad. Internal political tensions are high and likely to remain so. Institutional capacity i s s t i l l very
weak at all levels. Fiscal sustainability is already injeopardy, and with the price o f o i l lower than
had been anticipated for 2009 and 2010, fiduciary risk i s likely t o increase and development
expenditure will be under pressure from the priority given by the government to regime
maintenance and security spending. Public management systems and skills remain insufficient for
minimal government effectiveness. And motivation and integrity have been weakened by the
spreading disregard for the rules without ensuing consequences.

30. World Bank Group performance was moderately unsatisfactory for the program as a
whole. The WBG got involved for the right reasons and in full recognition o f the probable
alternatives and the risks, including reputational risks. However, the flaws in the design o f the
o i l revenue and expenditure management arrangements adversely affected the impact o f the
whole program, and capacity building was unsuccessful owing to the weak design and
supervision o f the three IDA-supported projects. For the pipeline project itself, WBG
performance was moderately satisfactory. For the program, supervision was hampered by the
excessive rotation o f task managers in the revenue management project and, in the Chad
capacity-building project, from the reliance for many years o n external petroleum consultants
without in-house specialists to supervise them. The tireless efforts, competence and personal
commitments o f operational managers and staff engaged in program supervision were not able to
overcome these shortcomings, nor those associated with design weaknesses.

 3 1. Questions have been raised internally and externally by staff, government officials, NGOs,
 and development partners concerning the decision and manner o f Bank exit in 2008. A s noted,
the WBG embarked o n the program in 2000 for the right reasons and with the strong support o f
the international donor community. It exited in 2008 with weaker consensus than it had enjoyed
 at entry. Some stakeholders have viewed the decision as unnecessary and untimely, or lacking
 full consideration o f all the implications and adequate external consultation. The decision's
justification lay in the repeated government violations o f its commitments and was reached after
extensive consideration at higher management levels.

32. Cooperation between IFC and the World Bank was a strong feature o f the program.
Cooperation between WB-IFC, rested o n a division o f labor suitable to the different mandates and
comparative advantages. Thus, the Bank focused primarily on implementation o f the revenue
arrangements and expenditure understandings, and o n the three IDA-supported projects to help
build capacity to monitor the o i l sector and manage the o i l revenue, while I F C dealt with the
technical and contractual aspects and with the environmental and social dimensions o f the o i l
development and pipeline project, with Bank contributions as warranted Also, the Bank handled
relations with the governments and the I F C handled relations with the Consortium and the lenders.
With the Bank exit from Chad's o i l sector, I F C continued to monitor the environmental and social
aspects o f the main project.

33.     All that said, it i s the borrower'~performancethat was the key factor for the
unsuccessful outcomes o f the program. W h i l e some o f the implementing entities performed
creditably, the strong assertions o f ownership and commitment o f the Government o f Chad at
the start o f the program proved inoperative when the o i l revenue started flowing. Absent a
firm commitment by the country's authorities at the highest level, it i s unlikely that the
outcomes would have been appreciably different under any alternative program design and
performance o f the Bank during implementation. Conversely, steady government
commitment to implementing the agreed program would probably have made it successful
despite i t s design flaws. The Government, however, views the security problems as primarily
responsible for the outcomes.

34.      Thus, with substantial o i l revenue expected to continue in the foreseeable future even
if at prices lower than in 2005-08, it is still possible for Chad to escape the resource curse.
The Bank can cooperate with the IMF in monitoring fiscal and expenditure outcomes and
make a useful contribution by providing advice in public sector management-focused on
the basics, recognizing capacity realities, and buttressed by constructive and assertive
cooperation o f certain major bilateral partners. But the most important factor would be a new
and genuine determination by Chad's government to use the o i l resources for development
and poverty reduction, and do so responsively and efficiently.

RATINGS
35.     Based on all the evidence, as well as on the broad outcomes summarized earlier and
other data, the relevance, efficiency, and efficacy o f the program as a whole, against the
stated objectives, are all rated modest, and the program outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The
ratings o f the program are not an average o f the ratings o f the component projects, nor are
they weighted by loan amounts, but flow from a combined assessment o f the developmental
importance o f each project-with the revenue management arrangements at the core o f the
program. See Table ES-2.

(*) The IFC rating system for advisory services, broadly similar to the WB, i s described in Annex E.
(**) The ratings apply primarily to Chad. While similar conclusions can be drawn for Cameroon, they are mainly associated
with the evaluation of the Capacity Enhancement project, since expectations and outcomes from the overall program were
comparatively minor for Cameroon and no broad macro-level development, governance or poverty impact could be
expected from the small addition to government revenue, let alone rated.


36.     The evaluation was done jointly by IEG-IFC and IEG-WB. It highlights the coexistence
        '



o f a moderately satisfactory rating for the main infrastructure project and an unsatisfactory
rating for the program o f which the project i s a part. Because the World Bank Group has a
development mandate, one might argue that if the whole program i s unsatisfactory due to a
development failure, a component project should not be considered satisfactory because o f its
technical and financial success. This evaluation has concluded that there i s no inconsistency
between viewing one set o f outcomes favorably even though the weight o f other unfavorable
outcomes has led to a negative conclusion overall. At the same time, the evaluation illustrates
the basic point that a part o f a program, however well carried out, cannot be separated from the
overall program and the broader setting within which its impact i s being assessed: a project or a
subproject cannot be ring-fenced in the assessment.

LESSONS
37.     The well-known lesson that government commitment i s the major influence on the
effectiveness o f projects and programs is underlined by the experience o f the Chad-
Cameroon program. Other key lessons from this rich and complex experience include:

        If the WBG decides to risk involvement in ambiguous and fluid situations, it pays not
        to do so in overly detailed and rigid ways. Clarity is needed on the objectives and
        principles, but the design and implementation modalities should be as fluid as the
        situation itself, rather than rely on binary choices and numerical rules.
        The temptation to put in place special mechanisms to protect specific resources and
        accomplish results i s understandable in a weak capacity and governance environment,
        but institutional enclaves are generally not successful beyond the short term and even
       when successful in the short term they tend to undermine the already weak local
       systems and thus long-term development.
       I t is imperative to design projects in light o f the institutional and administrative
       capacity realities. In countries with weak capacity, it is important to focus on
       addressing the basic problems rather than attempting to introduce sophisticated
       practices. Paradoxically, major components o f the program in effect assumed the
       existence o f the very capacity they aimed to build.
       An innovative design, even if unsuccessful in practice, may contain novel elements
       worth consideration and replication (in this case, the environmental and social
       safeguard arrangements, the CoZZJge, and the two independent advisory bodies).
       Whether the World Bank or the I F C is involved, the concern with development
       effectiveness goes beyond the gates o f individual projects, however well they may be
       technically done, to the results o f the overall program.
       In large, complex WBG projects with multiple stakeholders, good WB-IFC
       cooperation is important to improve the chances o f positive results, and I F C Advisory
       Activities can complement the projects by their impact o n local private sector
       development.

3 8.      The Chad-Cameroon o i l development and pipeline construction program exemplifies
the inherent tension between the limits o f the World Bank as an international organization
and i t s mandate to foster development and poverty reduction. The WBG did not succeed in
protecting Chad's people from the o i l curse, but it did try. One should not draw as a lesson
from this experience that the WBG should refrain from supporting extractive industries with
a view to helping to bring about more sustainable outcomes because doing so carries
reputational risks and success i s unlikely. Indeed, despite the disappointing overall outcomes
o n the development and governance side, the WBG involvement contributed to a notable
increase in expenditures in social sectors and to the assurance o f environmental and social
protections within the confines o f the project better than they would have been otherwise.

1. From Entry to Exit

1.1     This section describes the key events in the preparation, implementation, and closure
o f the World Bank Group's support o f and involvement in the Chad-Cameroon o i l
development and pipeline construction pr~gram.~

THECONTEXT AT ENTRY
1.2     Cameroon has had political stability since independence in 1960, despite governance
weaknesses after the 1970s. Also, fertile land and abundant o i l led to good agricultural
production and substantial government revenue, bringing the country up to middle-income
level by the early 1980s. Subsequently, the country experienced macroeconomic difficulties,
which were alleviated from the mid-1990s onward by implementation o f economic reforms
with Bank and IMF support.

1.3      Chad has also had governance problems and, in addition, has experienced severe
political instability and internal conflict at least since 1979. When the World Bank Group
embarked on support for o i l development in Chad and the building o f the pipeline, Chad was
one o f the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita GDP o f about $ l/day and a
population o f around 8.5 million spread over a large landlocked territory o f half a million
square miles (most o f it semidesertic).

 1.4     After the worst years o f internal conflict in the late 1980s (aggravated by external
intervention), Chad's politics became less volatile with the rise to power o f President Idriss
Deby in 1991. A period o f attempts at national reconciliation ensued, culminating in 1993 in
a new constitution that legalized opposition political parties' and set presidential term limits,
which President Deby repeatedly asserted would be respected. The understanding lasted for
about a decade and produced a modicum o f political stability, particularly from 1996, when
the President was re-elected and multiparty elections were held. The political situation thus
appeared o n the mend by the time o f the WBG decision to support the o i l development and
pipeline construction. Moreover, by then the government had established a modestly
satisfactory record o f economic reforms (supported by a series o f structural adjustment
credits); although institutional and administrative capacity remained very weak.

1.5     Accordingly, the WBG decided in 2000 to help elaborate the program and support it
with IFC, IBRD, and IDA resources, with the objective o f improving governance and
reducing poverty through the best possible developmental use o f the o i l revenue. Major
cofinancing was also granted by the European Investment Bank. Subsequently, political and
security problems re-emerged. In 2003, the start o f the Darfur rebellion in Sudan and the

memoranda, and interviews with about 100 WBG decision makers, government officials, and NGOs.
5. Until then, Chad was a one-party state under the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS).
                                                        2


ensuing influx o f refugees began to affect events in Chad. A second major event was
President Deby's endorsement o f a constitutional change removing the presidential t e r m
limits and the holding o f a referendum to that effect in 2005. The referendum was criticized
by human rights organizations and boycotted by opposition parties, which also boycotted the
subsequent presidential elections in 2006 with which President Deby obtained a third term.
Major rebel attacks on the capital Ndjamena took place in 2006 and again in February 2008.
The third major contributor to post-2003 instability was the large flow o f money from
petroleum development - "pouring o i l on smoldering fire" in the words o f one interlocutor.
Government priorities have been heavily affected by the security problems, with increasing
attention given to security expenditures and comparatively less to other national needs. 6

1.6      The existence o f petroleum in Chad has been known for almost 40 years, but i t s
exploitation was prevented by political instability and l o w world o i l prices. In 1988, the
government granted a 30-year lease to a consortium o f o i l companies (hereafter "the
consortium") to develop three o i l fields in the south. A feasibility study in 1994 demonstrated
that the only viable option to export the o i l from landlocked Chad was to build a pipeline
through Cameroon to an offshore platform in Kribi (south o f Douala), and the two countries
signed a treaty to that effect in 1996. The pipeline treaty set out the framework for land
acquisition, environmental and social safeguards, and the governments' equity shares in the
companies that were set up to build and operate the pipeline in the two countries: the Tchad
O i l Transportation Company (TOTCO), in which the Chad government would have 15
percent equity, and the Cameroon O i l Transportation Company (COTCO), in which
Cameroon and Chad would have respectively 10 and 5 percent. (The consortium did not
agree to Chad government equity participation in the exploitation o f the oil fields themselves.
The two parties agreed instead on a structure o f royalties and dividends, discussed later.)                 '
1.7     The legal framework, too, required major modernization. The inadequacy o f the o i l
legislation adopted in 1962 had forced the Chad government into bilateral agreements and ad
hoc contracts. For this among other reasons, as the centerpiece o f the preparations for oil
development and WBG support, a new Petroleum Revenue Management Law was approved
in 1999, as described later.

1.8     The consortium and the participating banks stated that their development o f the oil
fields and construction o f the pipeline would be contingent on partnership with a multilateral
development agency. The WBG was the obvious candidate and agreed as early as 1994 to
begin working with the consortium and the two governments to help develop the project-
beginning with preparation o f some capacity-building activities. Thus, while the main

by end-2009 (which will likely be delayed). A new ``unity" government was appointed by the President i n
August 2008; some observers are optimistic that this signals a hopeful change; others are not.
7. The consortium consisted originally o f Exxon (the operator, with a 40 percent stake), Shell, and Elf. In 1999,
Shell and Elf withdrew-Elf reportedly because it had been purchasedby Total, and Shell because o f emerging
issues with share prices-and were replaced by Petronas (Malaysia's state oil company) and Chevron, with a 35
and 25 percent stake, respectively.

pipeline project and the other associated projects and activities were approved by the Board
in 2000, some cautious WBG involvement had in actuality begun six years earlier.8

PUTTING I T TOGETHER

WBG Financial and Technical Support
1.9      Initially, the WBG had envisaged limiting its involvement to I F C participation but, in
light o f the policy aspects, and at the urging o f the consortium, it decided to include Bank
direct involvement as well. I F C participation consisted o f loans to the consortium o f $27.8
million in Chad and $172.2 million in Cameroon (where most o f the 1,040 kilometers o f
pipeline i s located). World Bank participation included two IBRD "enclave" loans to finance
the governments' acquisition o f their minority equity share in the pipeline, in the amounts o f
$37.2 million and $53.4 to Chad and Cameroon respectively, as well as three IDA credits-
one to each country for capacity building to manage the o i l sector and monitor the
environmental and social impact, and the third to Chad to strengthen the management o f the
petroleum economy. The total WBG financing o f $337.6 million amounted to around 9
percent o f the originally estimated project cost o f $3.7 billion (of which about two-thirds was
for the pipeline and o i l terminal and one-third for the o i l fields development in Chad), and 5
percent o f the actual cost o f $6.5 billion through 2008. In addition, European Investment
Bank cofinancing amounted to about $170 million equivalent (of which $62 million was lent
to the two governments and $108 million to the consortium). The bulk o f the cost was
financed by a number o f commercial banks and the consortium itself.

1.10 In addition, the Bank conducted a series o f Public Expenditure Reviews, and the I F C
financed some advisory activities. Table 1 summarizes the various WBG interventions in the
two countries, and Annexes (A-E) provide details on each project as well as the evaluations
and the ratings. (The complex o f projects and activities hereafter will be referred to as "the
program"; the pipeline project as "the project"; and the other interventions by their specific
names.)

Key Policy and Institutional Arrangements
1.1 1 With the major environmental risks known to attach to o i l development and pipeline
projects, environmental assessments were conducted, on the basis o f which an extensive
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was produced. After review and comments by the
WBG, the E M P was extensively revised based on broad public consultations and additional
studies. (See Section 2 for a summary o f the environmental and social dimensions o f the
program.)

1.12 Two independent external bodies were created to monitor the environmental and
social aspects and the development objectives o f the program in both Cameroon and Chad.
The I F C set up the External Compliance Monitoring Group (ECMG), to monitor compliance
with the E M P and provide ongoing advice for improving environmental and social
performance. The E C M G consulted widely with stakeholders including NGOs and
communities affected by the project. Also, a five-member International Advisory Group

8. Moreover, WBG involvement in the sector should be viewed alongside other major Bank support, consisting
o f a series o f structural adjustment credits, the last o f which was approved in 2003.

(IAG) chaired by a former Prime Minister o f Senegal was formed to advise the Bank and the
two governments on the achievement o f the broader Program objectives during the first six
years o f o i l revenue flows.'

1.13 In Cameroon, following the 1996 treaty on construction o f the pipeline, a decree in
1997 established an interministerial Pipeline Steering and Monitoring Committee (PSMC),
under the chairmanship o f the general manager o f the state hydrocarbon agency and with i t s
technical.and administrative support, as well as a Pipeline Inspection Service in the Ministry
o f Mines.

 1.14 In Chad, a similar body was set up-the National Technical Committee for
Monitoring and Control (CTNSC-hereafter, "the Technical Committee")-to oversee the
environmental and social monitoring activities, in cooperation with the Ministry o f
Environment and Water. In view o f the substantial financial resources expected from the
program, complex arrangements were designed to ensure revenue transparency and support
o f expenditure for development and poverty reduction. On the revenue side, the 1999
Petroleum Revenue Management Law set up an escrow account in London into which the
consortium would deposit the oil export revenues. The immediate purpose was to ensure
priority repayment o f the IBRD and European Investment Bank debt service-as required by
the country's insufficient creditworthiness for IBRD borrowing. The broader purpose was to
underpin the allocation o f the oil revenue for development and poverty reduction. Thus, o i l
revenues deposited into the escrow account were earmarked as follows: 10 percent o f
royalties and dividends set aside for a "Future Generations Fund"; o f the 90 percent, 5
percent o f royalties would go for expenditure in the oil-producing southern region, 80 percent
o f royalties and 85 percent o f dividends for expenditure in identified "priority sectors," and
the remaining royalties and dividends (as well as all non-oil revenue) to the general
government budget. "Priority" sectors in effect included the bulk o f economic and social
activity: transport, housing, civil works, health, social affairs, education, rural development,
mining and energy, justice, and post and telecommunications. To ensure additionality, this
allocation o f the o i l revenues would be assessed by reference to a baseline budget-defined
as the budget for the year preceding that o f the first o i l revenue. Figure 1 summarizes the
operation o f the system.

1.15 On the expenditure side, expenditure from the o i l revenue account was to be
authorized in accordance with integrated "sector expenditure programs" (presumably flowing
fiom sector strategies consistent with the priorities set out in the government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy, as well as with a medium-termexpenditure framework to guide the
annual budget), and would require endorsement by a special Committee on the Monitoring
and Oversight o f Petroleum Resources (CoZZ2ge de ContrGZe et Surveillance des Ressources
Pe`troZi2res-hereafter "the CoZZ2ge"). The CoZZ2ge was supported by i t s own technical staff
and consisted o f five statutory members (a supreme court judge as chair, the Director o f the
Regional Central Bank, the Director o f Treasury, and two members o f the National

9. The IAG conducted regular missions for t h i s purpose except when prevented by security difficulties. Its
mandate extended for six years after the first year's o i l revenue. With oil revenue coming on stream earlier than
expected in 2003, its final visit was in January 2009 and the fmal report was placed on the IAG's Web site
(www.gic-ian.orq) in April 2009.

expenditure authority, nor enforcement powers, it has the mandate to approve expenditure
proposals in line with the agreed allocations.

DEVELOPMENTS BOARD
          AFTER          THE2005-06 CONFRONTATIONAND THE 2006
                 APPROVAL:
AGREEMENT
1.16 Events during program implementation and through late 2008 led to a divergence
between expectations and actual developments. As discussed in section 2, the technical and
physical aspects o f the program proceeded better than expected, as did the financial
outcomes, owing largely to the sharp rise in o i l price. But difficulties emerged.

1.17 A first harbinger o f misunderstandings and doubtful government commitment had
come in August 2000, soon after Board approval, when a large part o f a $25 million initial
bonus from the consortium to the Chad government was used for purchase o f military
equipment. The government explained that not only was the bonus not included in the 2000
Program agreement but also that the military procurement had been concluded beforehand.
This was the case, but the use o f the bonus was nevertheless seen by the Bank (and others) as
                                                          7

directly contradicting the spirit o f the agreement to devote the bulk o f the o i l revenues to the
priority sectors. 10

1-18 In early 2005, shortly after the beginning o f significant o i l revenue flows, the
government began to push for amending the 1999 Petroleum Revenue Management L a w
(PRML) in order to expand the fiscal space for expenditure o n other than the agreed
"priority" sectors and also use the funds for general budget financing. Whether triggered by
the unexpectedly early inflow o f o i l revenue or the re-emerging security problem or both, the
request was an unwelcome surprise for the Bank and other development partners (although
not to those who had been critical o f Bank involvement from the start). The Bank urged the
government to give the agreed arrangements some time to work as designed. An increasingly
acrimonious exchange o f views followed, concluding in December 29 with a unilateral
decision by the government to amend the PRML-eliminating the Future Generations Fund,
using the $36 million in the fund to finance the deficit, and adding justice, territorial
administration, and security to the priority sectors (leaving almost no "non-priority"
sectors)." Already forewarned by the dialogue o f the previous months, the Bank responded
one week later by suspending disbursements on all Bank operations and freezing government
withdrawals from the revenue escrow account.

1.19 After a two-month hiatus, the dialogue resumed and an interim agreement was
reached, whereby the government agreed to revise the 2006 budget to allocate to "priority
sectors" (not including security) 70 percent o f all budgetary resources regardless o f source (a
much greater amount that the earlier 85 percent o f o i l royalties and dividends only), and the
Bank accepted the abolition o f the Future Generations Fund (FGF), lifted the suspension o f
disbursements, and effected a partial release o f funds from the escrow account. l2

1.20 The interim agreement was followed by a Memorandum o f Understanding in July
2006, negotiated with the direct involvement o f the WBG President's office and intended to
reshape a permanent arrangement. The M O U called for preparing the 2007 budget within a
medium-term expenditure framework to be agreed; set at 70 percent the minimum
expenditure to be allocated to the priority sectors; and reaffirmed the essential role o f the
CoZZbge and the need for strengthening its capacity. However the 70 percent figure may have

10. Tension with the Bank next started in late 2003, partly in connection with the capacity-building project. As
discussed in Annex C the government complained that expatriate consultants were not transferring knowledge,
and local counterparts resented them. With the project almost fully disbursed, when a new task team leader was
appointed a proposal was made for a follow-up project. Because the government had stated i t s opposition to
borrowing for technical assistance, the follow-up project was proposed as a grant. The government rejected it.
Some interlocutors believe that by that time the president was unhappy with the Bank and increasingly resentful
o f external scrutiny o f government dealings with the petroleum sector.
11. The government position i s that this action was not "unilateral," as it was taken at the behest o f civil society
organizations opposed to the Fund and by the Assembly rather than by the executive branch. This position i s not
supported by the timing and tone o f the letters sent to the Bank (and the IMF) in 2005.
12.The effectiveness o f the escrow account mechanism was weakened when the-Consortium suspended for a
period o f time payment into the escrow account at the request o f the Government o f Chad. The Consortium
requested and obtained a waiver from IBRD and EIB. There are unconfirmed reports o f a government
nationalization threat. From that point on, in the words o f one interlocutor, "the revenue lockbox turned out to
be made o f tissue paper."

been derived, l3 was a much more ambitious expenditure target than the original ones, since
                 it
it applied to revenue from all sources rather than only direct oil revenue.

1.21 In the meantime, in a critical development not recognized in the MOU, the
government had also attached to the Ministry o f Infrastructure the General Directorate of
Major Works and Presidential Projects (in December 2005), and in May 2006 entrusted to
that ministry all responsibility for roads and other surface transport, construction, water
works, and energy.14 The dominant position o f the Minister o f Infrastructure was further
signaled in the January 2007 decree restructuring the government, in which he i s listed
immediately after the Prime Minister and i s given the authority to "conceive, coordinate,
implement and monitor government policy in infrastructure and transport" [italics added],
including, among other things, "centralization o f the execution o f all public infrastructures
financed by the state's own resources." l5

CLOSURE IN 2008

1.22 The 2006 M O U also called for Bank-government consultations on the
implementation o f the agreed measures. For this purpose, a multidonor mission in July 2007
concluded that, although the 2007 budget had initially allocated the agreed 70 percent of
revenues to the priority sectors, deviations in budget execution in the first few months
indicated that less than 60 percent was likely to be achieved for the year. Moreover, the
financial management regulations were regularly flouted, and large procurements were
increasingly awarded on a sole-source basis. As foreseen by the July 2007 mission, actual
expenditures in 2007 did not meet the allocations agreed in the 2006 M O U and incorporated
in the budget, due primarily to sharp increases in military spending, and about 58 percent was
spent on the priority sectors instead o f the agreed 70 percent. (Recall that the "priority
sectors" include the bulk o f government economic and social activity.)

1.23 Wishing to bring i t s involvement to a close, the Bank first inquired indirectly and
informally in March 2008 whether Chad would voluntarily repay the outstanding IBRD loan
balance for the pipeline project as well as the balances on the two IDA projects, and then
more directly asked in August.16 These loan balances, totaling $65.7 million, were repaid in
full by Chad on September 5, and the event was publicly announced on September 12. World
Bank Group involvement did not cease, however, with IFC continuing to monitor the
environmental and social aspects o f the pipeline project.

1.24 Meanwhile, the Bank had closed the N'djamena office at end-January, as did other
donors, owing to an impending rebel attack. After the attack was repulsed, the other donors
reopened their offices. The Bank did not and reassigned the resident country manager. In

against it. The action was not taken on that occasion.

October-November, after an eight-month hiatus, a multisector mission to review the status of
Bank activities outside the petroleum sector visited Chad; on December 12,2008, the Bank
President authorized the reopening o f the Bank office in N'djamena; and the office reopened
in January 2009.



2. Program Objectives and Broad Outcomes

2.1      Other than the important environmental and social aspects, the focus o f the program
was o n Chad, and the involvement o f Cameroon was a corollary, required to get the o i l from
land-locked Chad to the market. In Cameroon, the program provided a small but significant
economic stimulus-both through the temporary employment and income generated by the
pipeline construction itself, and permanently through the pipeline revenue-both the transit
fees and the tax revenue-which has amounted to around 1.3 percent o f the government's
total revenue. The capacity-building outcomes were less favorable, as discussed in Annex B.
However, the WBG involvement was critical for the satisfactory handling o f the direct
environmental and social impact o f the o i l development and pipeline construction.

2.2     The broad impacts o f the program were almost entirely o n Chad-to which most o f
this section i s dedicated. The influence o f o i l production, export, and revenue proved
dominant on the country's economic performance and public finances during 2003-08. For
this reason, it would be quite inadequate to limit the assessment to the direct impact on fiscal
revenue and expenditure on the priority sectors, and this section discusses also the broad
macroeconomic, fiscal, poverty, governance, and institutional outcomes. Nevertheless, it
would not be methodologically justified to associate these broad outcomes directly and solely
with the o i l development and pipeline program-let alone to claim causation by association.
The data presented in this section are guideposts for informed inferences to be made by the
reader, based also on a variety o f other information (including the severe security difficulties
the government encountered after 2005, and the problems o f the cotton sector).

WBG STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
                          OBJECTIVES

Escaping the "Resource Curse"? The WBG Strategy
2.3     The Bank was keenly aware o f the "paradox o f plenty" and the risks o f the "resource
curse." l7 major workshop was organized in 1998 to review the experience o f the major
          A

 17. The "paradox o f plenty" refers to the coexistence o f mass poverty and valuable mineral resources. T h e
notion that abundant natural resources might be a curse rather than a blessing f i r s t emerged in the 1980s.
Although such abundance should help development by providing the government and the private sector with
capacity to finance productive investments and poverty reduction, most mineral-rich countries seemed to show
lower economic growth and weaker governance. T h i s "resource curse" has been attributed to the
misappropriation o f the revenue by an unaccountable ruling elite and to the exclusion o f most citizens from
political participation-through the use of the revenue to finance bribery and mechanisms o f repression. The
second major explanation is "Dutch disease," that is, the discouragement o f domestic production o f other
exportables and import-competing goods by the exchange rate appreciation caused by the abundant proceeds
from exports o f minerals. Finally, it i s also thought that abundant mineral resources are linked to civil conflict
through the violent competition for control over the resources. See Karl (1997) for an early statement o f the
                                                         10


extractive resource exporters and prepare the ground for recommendations on how to help
Chad escape the resource curse. The workshop showed that among developing countries only
a handful o f the major extractive resource exporters had managed to use the bulk of the
export revenue for productive purposes and avoid governance and corruption problems-
Botswana in Africa, Chile in Latin America, and to some extent Malaysia and Indonesia in
Asia.18 Although these exceptions were unrelated to external aid, the WBG concluded after
intense debate that its direct involvement could help increase the otherwise very l o w
probability that Chad's people would escape the o i l curse, and thus decided to support the
program and to do so beyond I F C participation-to include capacity-building activities as
well as devising the novel revenue management and institutional arrangements summarized
earlier.

2.4       The contrast between Chad's extreme poverty and the riches lying under its soil was
at the core o f the WBG motive to help tap those riches and find new ways to channel a large
part o f them to Chad's development and to the well-being o f poor Chadians. This strategic
rationale was strong and clear; i t s articulation into the specific project development
objectives was neither.

Program and Project Development Objectives
2.5      The specific objectives o f the individual projects, evaluated in the Annexes, were
subsidiary to the main development objective o f the program as a whole, which related to
Chad. As stated in the Chad Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) and confirmed by the
internal documentation and stakeholder interviews, this main objective was to achieve
progress in governance and poverty reduction by means o f the o i l revenue, and in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner. As a senior manager put it at the time, the
success o f the program would be measured not in dollars but in how many Chadians it would
lift out o f poverty. In the 2001 CAS this objective was formulated as helping Chad use the
petroleum resources to attempt to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the 2003
CAS stated "the overarching objective" as making the best possible developmental use o f the
new o i l r e v e n ~ e . That CAS went further, and identified the two "pillars" as "strengthening
                          '~
governance, including institutional arrangements for public resource management and service


"paradox o f plenty," and Sachs and Warner (1999) for the negative correlation between natural resources and
economic growth. For more recent treatments o f the resource curse, see Ghazvinian 2007, McFerson 2008 and
Shaxson 2007. On the hypothesis o f resource-driven conflict, see Bannon and Collier 2003. For an opposing
view, see Di John (2007), who argues that the premice o f the oil-conflict link (rent-seeking and the rentier state
model) do not explain why o i l economies are more vulnerable to civil war-nor indeed that there i s strong
empirical evidence that an oil-conflict link exists. The "resource curse" i s neither exclusively not inevitably
African, as demonstrated by the record o f Botswana with both good governance and abundant minerals (in this
case, diamonds).
18. W h i l e acknowledging that there i s no theoretical presumption on whether malgovernance produces mineral
resource misappropriation and conflict, or social peace and the quality o f governance are damaged by large
mineral resource revenues, McFerson (2008) argues that malgovernance comes f i r s t and resource revenue
misappropriation follows and further weakens governance.
19. The 1996 CAS for Chad, before serious consideration o f WBG involvement in the o i l development and
pipeline construction, lists the three strategic objectives as restoring public sector capacity, focusing public
expenditure on poverty reduction, and creating an enabling environment for the private sector.
                                                11


delivery [and] the r u l e o f law.. ."; and "enhancing non-oil economic opportunities while
reducing sources o f vulnerability."

2.6     Accordingly, while the outcomes o f each project are assessed against its stated PDOs,
the outcomes o f the program as a whole are assessed against the main objective o f improving
governance and reducing poverty in Chad through the use o f the o i l revenue-"to turn the o i l
curse into an o i l blessing" (in the motto o f Chad's own CollBge de ContrGle) in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner.

2.7    The PDOs o f the five projects, summarized in Table 1, are examined in the Annexes.
However, the PDOs o f the main o i l development and pipeline construction project should be
quoted here, owing to their influence on program design. As per the respective loan
agreements:

        For Cameroon, the objective is to "assist in the development and export through the
        Borrower's territory o f the petroleum reserves o f the Doba Basin Oil Fields [in Chad]
        in an environmentally and socially sound manner, and thereby, inter alia, increase the
        Borrower's fiscal revenues available for financing priority development expenditures
        in the context o f the Borrower's strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction."
        For Chad, the objective i s to "assist in the development and export through
        Cameroon o f the petroleum reserves o f the Doba Basin O i l Fields in an
        environmentally and socially sound manner and thereby, inter alia, increase the
        Borrower's resources and expenditures for poverty alleviation."

2.8     Clearly, production and export o f o i l are not, i n themselves, development objectives.
Indeed, the term "thereby" implies that the objective was to increase fiscal revenues (for
Cameroon) and expenditures for poverty reduction (for Chad). But even that objective was
inappropriately phrased for Chad, on two counts. First, the objective i s defined in terms o f
inputs, and it cannot be a development objective to spend more o n one activity or another.
Worse, defining the objective as "increasing expenditures" can be misinterpreted as an open
invitation to loosen expenditure controls and/or engage in wasteful expenditure-as
demonstrated by the experience with the typical recommendations o f the Public Expenditure
Reviews o f the 1980s. It is surprising to still find that approach at work in 1999, when the
need for some orientation toward the results o f public spending was already well understood
at the Bank.

2.9       The emphasis o n inputs affected project design in ways that proved ineffective. Also,
it risked putting the Bank in a decisional bind-if   the aggregate expenditure targets were met
but in wasteful or corrupt ways, or they were not met but the quality o f expenditure and
provision o f services actually improved nonetheless. A s it happened, the expenditure targets
were not met and the efficiency o f expenditure was wanting-partly from waste and abuse
and partly from a failure to integrate current and capital spending decisions. The PDOs
should have been defined in a way to foster positive rather than negative incentives to spend
the o i l money efficiently and effectively.

2.10 In the case o f Cameroon, while the objective "increasing fiscal revenue available for
financing priority development expenditures,. ." was also input-defined, it provided latitude
                                                        12


and i s less o f a simple urging to "spend more"-as it permitted an increase in development
expenditure but without mandating amounts and thus not embedding a disincentive to
efficiency. (Naturally, this was associated with the relatively minor proportion o f government
revenue accounted for by the pipeline transit fees and other revenues in Cameroon.)

Program and Project Risks
2.1 1 The WBG was fully cognizant o f the environmental and social impact risks o f o i l
development and pipeline construction, and assured that the project would meet the highest
standards o f environmental and social protection through a detailed and comprehensive
Environmental Management Plan and provisions for addressing the social implications o f the
project.

2.12 Foremost was the risk that Chad's o i l revenue would not be allocated to pro-poor and
pro-development expenditure, owing to the governance weaknesses in the country-indeed,
that the o i l revenue i t s e l f would aggravate these weaknesses and possibly lead to renewed
conflict after several years o f comparative stability. The mitigation strategy was to set up the
unusually detailed and prescriptive set o f revenue earmarking and institutional arrangements
embodied in the 1999 Petroleum Revenue Management Law.

2.13 Other major risks were also identified at an early stage, even though strong mitigation
measures were not possible. These were a spillover from the crisis in Darfur; waning
government commitment after the o i l would begin to flow; and social unrest if the o i l
revenue was not used for pro-poor, pro-development activities. To an extent, all three
occurred: a Darfur spillover and social resentment may be reflected in the internal violence
experienced in Chad since 2003, and government commitment indeed declined.

     RESULTS
DIRECT
Physical, Technical, and Financial Outcomes
2.14 The total project cost through end-2008 was $6.5 billion, compared to the original
estimate o f $3.7 billion, with the difference funded by the consortium. Also, owing to
unexpected geological reasons and poor well productivity, actual o i l production was below
the expected levels. However, the physical and technical aspects o f the program proceeded
better than expected, with strong environmental and social impact safeguards; the pipeline
constructed ahead o f schedule; and the o i l flowing earlier than anticipatedS2'Financially, too,
the outcomes for Chad were much better than expected. The original projections were that o i l
exports would begin at end-2004; direct revenue would total about $250 million in 2005-08;
and indirect revenues in the form o f taxes would start in 2014. In fact, as Table 2 shows, o i l
exports started in October 2003; direct revenues to Chad totaled $2.5 billion in the five years


20. Production levels were disappointing leading to an expansion from the initial three to six oil fields, earlier
than anticipated. EEPCI has started an infill drilling program, which could lead to the possibility that about
700-800 wells will be drilled in the OFDA, against the 300 planned originally (ECMG, April-May 2009).
There i s a difference in views between IFC and EEPCI on the timing o f the infill drilling program. Based on
information from the ECMG reports from 2005, among other sources, IFC considers that the infill drilling
began in 2005; EEPCI states that the infill drilling began in mid-2008, and the additional wells drilled between
2003 and 2008 were development wells within the original 40-acre well-spacing pattern.

2003-07 (and $1.9 billion in 2008 alone); and tax revenues began to accrue eight years earlier
than foreseen, in 2006. This large discrepancy was due mainly to the difference between the
projected o i l price o f $15.25/b1 and the actual average price o f $65/bl. in 2004-07. 21 In total,
during 2003-08, Chad's government revenue from o i l was almost $4.4 billion-1 7 times
what had been projected and almost twice as much as non-oil revenue from all sources. 22
Cameroon's revenue from the pipeline transit fees as well as dividends and taxes on COTCO
was also significant, totaling over $200 million in 2003-08 (about 1.5 percent o f total
government revenue), although lower than expected owing to the smaller level o f production
and thus o f direct and indirect pipeline revenue.

2.15 This record o f technical and financial success i s in stark contrast with the
implementation o f the poverty reduction, governance, expenditure management, and
institutional aspects o f the program, as explained next. Indeed, because the oil revenues
dwarfed total foreign aid, the basic "leverage calculus" o f the program was sharply altered.

2.16 On the other hand, the rapid rise in oil price makes it virtually certain, in hindsight,
that the consortium companies (or a competitor) would have proceeded with developing the
oil fields and building the pipeline with or without WBG involvement-albeit perhaps a
couple o f years later-and thus without the value added o f this involvement in terms o f
environmental and social protection as well as probably a greater amount o f resources
effectively allocated to development and poverty reduction than would otherwise have been
the case. If the WBG involvement were to be assessed against this counterfactual scenario, it
could be viewed as relatively successful.

Direct Benefitsfor Employment, the Local Economy, and the Private Sector
2.17 In addition to the revenue to the governments, the project generated direct benefits to
both Chad and Cameroon in the form o f employment, training, supplier development,
infrastructure improvements, and community donations by the consortium.

2.18 Employment o f nationals peaked during the pipeline construction phase. Currently,
project-related employment in Chad i s for the construction o f new wells and the production
operations and maintenance activities and, in Cameroon, for the maintenance or
improvement o f facilities. Through end-2008, a total o f over $19.7 million in individual
compensation (cash and in-kind) has been provided. The project has also undertaken
community compensation programs with in-kind micro-development programs and a number
o f community donations (such as classrooms and health clinics) in the two countries, totaling
$12.25 million so far.

2.19 The project has strengthened private sector activity in the two countries. As explained
in Annex E, IFC launched the Chad Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Initiative in June
2000 as a linkage project to support the pipeline project. The SME program received traction
from EEPCI during the operation phase o f the project, when there was a realignment o f
interests between EEPCI's need for local content and the revamped SME program. The SME
program currently focuses on four areas: entrepreneurshipcapacity building, business
linkages, access to finance, and business enabling environment. As part o f the linkages
component, IFC founded the Enterprise Center (EC) in partnershipwith the Chamber o f
Commerce in November 2005, to help Chadian companies access EEPCI's e-procurement
system and compete for contracts. The purchase o f goods and services in-country and
development o f long-term supplier relationships have supported the development o f the local
private sector. The project's local purchases o f goods and services totaled almost $1.9 billion
so far, o f which about $1.2 billion in Chad.23

MACROECONOMIC, FISCAL,             DEVELOPMENTS
                     AND EXPENDITURE

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Outturn
2.20 As noted, the expectation at entry was that Chad would make the best possible use o f
the o i l revenue to reduce poverty and improve governance. Moreover, the second pillar o f the
2003 CAS for Chad called for enhancing non-oil economic opportunities while reducing
sources o f vulnerability. So far, the objective o f strengthening the non-oil economy has not
been met, with a 2.2 percent average GDP growth rate in 2004-08 compared to 3.8 percent in
 1994-2000. (The post-oil performance would compare even more unfavorably to the 6.8
percent pre-oil average growth in 2001-03, but that high growth was affected by the

23. Figures for local spending by the consortium include purchases from three types o f businesses: purely local,
purely foreign, and joint ventures. In 2008, total expenditure by EEPCI in Chad was $400 million for foreign
supplies and $200 million for local purchases (of which half purely local and halfjoint ventures). However,
available evidence suggests that purchases from local suppliers account for a small portion o f EEPCI's annual
procurement in Chad. For example, the Enterprise Center which was created in December 2004 as a partnership
between IFC, the Chamber o f Commerce o f Chad, and EEPCI has so far helped 19 local and joint venture
companies get contracts worth $33.2 million. Given that EEPCIxxon's annual procurement in Chad i s currently
about $300 million, there i s significant untapped potential for Chadian SMEs. See Annex E for more
information.

temporary expenditures to develop the o i l fields and build the pipeline.) Also, fiscal
vulnerability has increased. Table 3 shows the major macroeconomic and fiscal outturns in
Chad, from 2000 through 2008. The data show how oil production in Chad has dominated
economic developments so far in this century, with ensuing fluctuations in GDP.24The
performance o f the non-oil economy has been somewhat less volatile but generally
disappointing, and overall GDP has stagnated after 2005.

2.21 The structural fiscal position has become weaker over the oil period, with the non-oil
primary deficit worsening from a modest 4 percent o f non-oil GDP in 2004 to about 28
percent in 2 0 0 8 4 u e to higher spending in all areas, but especially in security. With the
wage bill alone absorbing the entirety o f non-oil tax revenue, the IMF estimates that Chad's
fiscal sustainability i s injeopardy in both the medium and the long term, absent major
adjustments by the government. 25 The concern i s not with an increase in the non-oil primary
deficit, per se, but with the rapid increase in current expenditure in the past three years and
the composition o f expenditure, discussed next.

24. Indeed, it can be argued that i Chad GNP i s a better measure of economic activity, as GDP includes the
substantial contribution from the Consortium. Focusing on non-oil GDP, of course, obviates this difficulty.
25. See I M F 2009. With the sharp fall in the price of o i l and thus much lower-than-expected government
revenues, 2009 will require particularly difficult adjustments with an impact on the real economy and social
development, the magnitude of which will depend on those choices and on the manner in which they are
implemented.

2.22 It i s conceivable that the additional government spending o f 2005-08 may have
served to expand the economic base and thus improve both the fiscal and the macroeconomic
picture in the long term. For this to be credible, one would expect to see an improved
economic and functional composition o f expenditure, as well as evidence o f greater
efficiency-particularly in investment. The evidence does not support this hypothesis, rather
the reverse.

Expenditure Composition and Efficiency
2.23 Economic composition o expenditure. The economic composition has worsened,
                                   f
with current expenditure averaging 10 percent o f non-oil GDP in 2001-04 and 2 1 percent in
2005-08, compared with a constant investment ratio (around 12 percent o f non-oil GDP
during the period). And with a wage bill (civilian and military, with 85,000 soldiers o n the
payroll) rising to 9 percent o f non-oil GDP and over 90 percent o f the operational budget,
operational efficiency too i s likely to have diminished.

2.24 Despite the aggregate increase in current spending, the critical balance between
investment and recurrent costs was not achieved in many investment projects. The program
called for expenditure to be driven by "program budgets" formulated by the "priority"
ministries to implement the respective sector objectives, which in turn were expected to be
consistent with the thrust o f the overall poverty reduction strategy. However, as o f mid-2005,
several "priority" ministries (including education and social protection, among others) lacked
any coherent strategy (World Bank 2006b). Also, progress in implementation o f the I-PRSP
and the first PRSP was "rather limited," with "significant delays" and without stakeholder
consultation; procedural steps in economic governance had not translated into improvements;
and there was no evidence o f a fit between the activities in the priority sectors and either the
poverty or the sector strategies.26(With the new PRSP delayed until 2008, such consistency
could not have improved after 2005.)

2.25 An especially important obstacle to better current-investment integration was the
2005 decision to centralize authority for physical investments and their execution in the
Ministry o f Infrastructure, reporting to the President. The stated rationale was to achieve
quick and visible results. Without commenting on the rationale, this precluded programming
of expenditure by the competent line ministries; confirmed the "program budgets" as a time-
consuming irrelevancy; made it difficult to ensure adequate provision o f recurrent costs; and
diluted both the authority and the accountability o f the line ministries for accomplishing
results in their sector^.^'

2.26 Functional composition o expenditure. The functional composition o f expenditure
                                   f
was the central focus o f the program and o f the o i l revenue management arrangements. As
noted earlier, the revenue percentages to be devoted to expenditure in the "priority sectors"
originally applied only to the direct o i l revenue (royalties and dividends), allowing the
government full latitude for the allocation o f other domestic revenue. In the initial years, the
budgetary allocations were reasonably close to the agreed percentages, and despite the

26. See the PRSP progress assessment in World Bank 2005; see also the 2000 and 2003 PRSPs.
27. In some cases, physical infrastructure was built against the express wishes o f the concerned line ministry.
                                                              18


divergence between budgets and outturns, actual expenditure on the priority sectors did
increase. Table 4 shows budgeted and actual expenditures from domestic revenue (including
oil) on priority and non-priority sectors, for 2004-06 and separately for 2007 (which was the
reference year for the 2006 MOU). During 2004-06, actual expenditure from domestic
revenue was about 86 percent o f the budgeted amount. In itself, this would not indicate
unmanageable budget execution problems, except for the substantial intersector variance in
execution rates, with total actual expenditure in the "priority sectors" about 77 percent o f the
budgeted amount, compared to over 96 percent for the "non-priority" sectors. Moreover, the
execution rate in 2004-06 was at 92 percent for expenditure on infrastructure and only 71
percent o f expenditure on the other priority sectors.

2.27 In 2007, some changes for the better took place. The budget allocation to priority
sectors rose to 60 percent, and actual expenditure to 58 percent (compared to the 70 percent
agreed in the 2006 MOU). The overall budget execution rate increased to 91 percent and,
although s t i l l significantly lower in priority sectors, the expenditure outturn in priority sectors
increased to 87 percent o f the budgeted amount. Overall, during 2004-07 the share o f actual
expenditure going to the priority sectors increased significantly, from 49 to 58 percent, and
over one-quarter o f government expenditure from own resources (CFAF 434 billion, almost
$1 billion) went to health, education and rural development. While this i s a shortfall from the
                                                          19


agreed expectations, it does represent a substantial allocation o f public funds.28 issue i s
                                                                                  The
h o w well the money was spent.

2.28 Efficiency o expenditure. In the aggregate, the efficiency o f public spending has
                    f
been harmed by lengthy delays in putting in place the budget, and by violations o f the basic
procurement and financial management rules. In addition to the growing reliance on sole-
source contracts (one-third o f total contracts in 2005 and almost half in 2008), the signing o f
contracts without budgetary cover has become widespread. This practice disables financial
control o n budget execution (and thus accounting and payment controls as well) and
generates anomalies such as large advance payments followed by some initial work, but
without completion-either because the balance o f the contract cost i s not budgeted or from
simple lack o f oversight (or for other reasons). 29

2.29    Moreover, although for some government entities the expenditure cycle is extremely
short and simple because they are allowed to short-circuit all established procedures, most
ministries are subject to the official expenditure cycle-highly centralized even for a
francophone system, complex and inefficient, and with multiple redundant controls. 30

2.30 These and other problems were already apparent in 2005, and the 2006 PER Update
forthrightly concluded that "Chad is at a crossroads." While budget preparation has improved
somewhat since then, budget execution has remained disorderly and unpredictable-with the
resulting discrepancy between the efforts to meet the agreed targets in the budget and the
actual outturn.

2.3 1 Aside from the inefficiencies flowing from systemic budgeting weaknesses, there
were efficiency issues in specific public services. The investments in roads (paved roads
increased from just 300 kilometers in 2001 to 1,200 kilometers in 2008) and in water supply
carry the potential to strengthen economic connectivity and improve sanitation in the long
       The
run.31 same cannot be said for the investments in health and primary education, where
neither o f the two fundamental investment criteria--conformity with identified needs and
provision o f current inputs-has been observed. In primary education, school construction

28. In addition, substantial expenditures for school, clinic, and hospital construction were included in the
infrastructure budget-increasing the total expenditure for the social sectors. However, it i s questionable
whether such expenditure resulted in actual service improvements, as explained later.
29. The fundamental need for budgetary rule compliance was stressed as early as the 2002 PER (World Bank
                                                                                             n
2002), and the mounting problems o f budget execution were candidly and forcefully identifiedi the 2004 PER
and the 2006 PER Update (World Bank 2004b and 2006b).
30. T h i s issue was f i r s t identified in the 2004 CFAA (World Bank 2004). The simplification of procedures i s an
urgent priority o f future budget reform through the multidonor PAMFIP program (Program d'Appui a la
Modernisation de l a Gestion des Finances Publiquestfor both efficiency and anti-corruption reasons.
3 1. However, little attention was paid to rural roads-which are critical for connectivity. In particular, roads in
cotton-growing areas remain in poor condition, and Coton Tchad reports that nothing was done to improve them
in 2008, even though the funds were included in the Ministry of Infrastructure budget. In 2008, infrastructure
                                  n
spending turned to construction i the capital, with priority given to repairing the buildings damaged in the
February rebel attacks. Substantial "urban renewal" i s also underway, but by evicting people from their
premises (IAG 2009). The inevitable resentment has been compounded by the sudden government prohibition
on the use of charcoal and firewood, without providing alternatives.
                                                        20


has been inconsistent with local needs (for example, standard six-classroom schools were
built regardless o f local school-age population in the district) and with the availability of
teachers and supplies. As a result, some communities have empty classrooms while others
lack school capacity and have been forced to build straw shelters. The situation has been
worse in health, where more than half o f the facilities to be constructed did not appear in the
l i s t o f priorities defined by the Ministry o f Health, and most were not provided with the
personnel, equipment, and medicines needed for their functioning. As a result, several o f the
sites had to be replaced with others after contracts were signed or construction completed,
and the 14 hospitals and 85 health centers that were built will be unable to render any service
for years. (See Dupety 2007. On the issue o f "leakages" o f resources in Chad's public health
sector, see Gauthier and Wane 2007.)

2.32 . To these violations o f fundamental investment criteria must be added the excessive
cost o f c o n ~ t r u c t i o nFor example, the average cost o f a primary classroom block has been
                                .~~
CFAF 30 million (about $64,000), extremely high by comparison to either international or
regional norms and double the cost o f construction financed through the state budget rather
than through oil revenue. Construction o f health facilities has not shown the same degree o f
excessive cost; however, if the facilities cannot be operational for lack o f complementary
inputs, the entirety o f the construction cost can be said to be wasted and the cost-
effectiveness o f the investment i s zero.

                                             f
Producing Region
2.33 By contrast, some positive outcomes can be attributed to the program component that
was designed to address the needs o f the oil-producing region in the south-both to
compensate for adverse impacts o f o i l exploration and to foster regional participation and
development. The allocation in the 1999 Petroleum Revenue Management L a w (PRML) o f 5
percent o f royalties was retained by the government even after the 2005 amendments o f the
PRML, Pending the formation o f the local government entities, a Provisional Committee
was formed to receive funding proposals and administer the activities (hereafter the
Committee 5%). The resources have been regularly deposited in the Committee's account at
the Regional Central Bank and distributed among the districts o f the beneficiary region. I t i s
true that the share o f o i l revenue devoted to the oil-producing region i s not commensurate
with the region's population or i t s needs, but the targeted effort i s nevertheless noteworthy.

 2.34 Although detailed data on each project could not be collected, interviews and
 anecdotal evidence suggest that implementation has been comparatively satisfactory so
 far-especially after 2007, when the delegation given to the Ministry o f Infrastructure in




32. This has been due in part to unnecessary features (for example, a separate "administrative building" for each
block o f primary classrooms), and in part to the use o f unusually expensive materials (for example, for roofing,
which in addition to the higher cost created problems of darkness, lack o f ventilation and heat buildup); and
other elementary design faults (for example, lack of access ramps in district hospitals).
                                                         21


  this respect was ended and the Committee i t s e l f became responsible for contracting and
  implementati~n.~~

  2.35 Table 5 shows annual commitments and disbursementsunder the 5 percent provision
  during 2005-08. O f the cumulative total o f CFAF 56 billion (about $110 million equivalent),
  over 90 percent were committed and almost 80 percent disbursed. The number o f projects
  (66, not including microcredit) i s significant, with an average allocation o f CFAF 828
  million (around $1.6 million) and the majority receiving less than CFAF 500 million. There
  i s no evidence o f white elephants. As Table 6 shows, the 10 largest projects received an
  average o f CFAF 1.6 billion (about $3.1 million) each and, with the possible exception of
  Doba Stadium, all appear to fill obvious development needs. Moreover, many were focused
  on provision o f potable water, with significant improvements in access to clean water, as
  shown in the next section.

2.36 Important criticisms have been raised. (See IAG 2009.) In general, the functioning o f
the Committee suffered from political interference (as did the FACIL project and the
College) and genuine consultation with the affected communities was insufficient. The
allocation heavily favored urban areas rather than the villages; however, with most o f the
population in the towns, access to basic services was expanded for a large number o f people.
Also, a promising microcredit program addressed to the rural areas was begun in'2007, with
initial results and currently 12,000 members in the voluntary groups. However, investment
decisions have been insufficiently responsive to genuine community-driven demands, and
improving such responsiveness should be a major objective in the future.

2.37 Data on poverty and human development are few, many out o f date and some
unreliable. It i s nevertheless useful to provide the available data and look at some
intermediate outcomes. (Table 7.) The picture i s mixed, and there i s no clear evidence that,
overall, human development in Chad has either improved or worsened since 2000. K e y
health indicators show stagnation or deterioration since the early 2000s. A bright spot i s the
large increase in access to clean water between 2000 and 2007, from 34 percent to 48 percent
o f the population. (This i s consistent with the pattern o f investments in water supply,
including by the Committee 5%.) (Table 7.)

Sources: UNDP 1999 and 2008 for the first three indicators. World Bank, World Development Indicators, and USAID 2008

2008 PRSP gives a 55% poverty headcount for 2003/2004, consistent with the figures for 1997 and 2006.


2.38 Also noteworthy, according to the 2008 PRSP, i s a substantial increase in school
enrollment, for both boys and girls, to a gross enrollment rate o f 88 percent, among the
highest in Africa. However, the PRSP acknowledges that the quality o f teaching has
deteriorated: 42 percent o f classrooms are in poor condition, curricular materials do not meet
educational standards, and most importantly, three out of: four primary school teachers are
non-credentialed, community parateachers. (Although parateachers can have a very valuable
role in primary education, they must receive adequate basic training. Also, for a time the
government failed to pay them, although salary arrears have recently been reduced to eight
months.)

2.39 As noted, data on poverty are insufficient to permit any analysis o f developments
since 2000. With the emphasis given to poverty reduction in the program objective and in all
other WBG interventions, it i s regrettable that the actual efforts at collecting reliable data on
a timely basis and monitoring poverty and human developments have fallen short. However,
by relying on civil society organizations and in other ways, systematic monitoring efforts by
the Bank could have provided some reliable evidence in real time, even if partial, on human
and poverty developments on the ground. (This failure i s in part linked to the program's
overemphasis on percentages and amounts o f expenditure rather than on i t s results.)

GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
         AND

Governance
2.40 Sudden revenue windfalls from extractive industries have led in most developing
countries to a worsening o f the overall governance climate.34It is therefore critical that this
evaluation review actual developments in this area. The 1996 CAS for Chad listed the
restoration o f public sector capacity as the first strategic priority, and the first "pillar" o f the
2003 CAS was "strengthening governance, including institutional arrangements for public
resource management and service delivery [and] the rule o f law." N o progress has been
registered either in economic governance in general or in public financial governance.
Concerning public financial governance, Annex D shows h o w public financial management
in 2008 in Chad was o n balance no better than in 2000 and in many respects worse.
Concerning governance in general, whether measured by the Transparency International
index, the M o Ibrahim Index o f African Governance, or the World Governance Indicators,
there i s no evidence o f any improvement. The TI surveys show the same index o f perception
o f corruption in 2008 as in 2004-1.7,    second highest in Africa next to Nigeria and fourth
highest in the world (www.transparency.org). The M o Ibrahim index o f rule o f law,
transparency, and corruption has a score o f 40 for Chad in 2006-lower than any African
country except for Angola, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic o f Congo
(www.moibrahim.org). And the World Governance Indicators show deterioration on every
dimension o f governance between 2000 and 2007 (Table 8). 35

2.41 The adverse governance developments are o f particular significance when compared
to the Africa-wide picture, which shows progress in voice and accountability and in political
stability. (In other governance areas, the continent's relative position remained about the
same between 2000 and 2007 although, given the substantial improvements in governance
worldwide in recent years, this indicates a slight degree o f absolute improvement in Africa as
well.) Although all governance measures are subject to some debate,36 the convergence o f all
available indicators i s dispositive in this case. While it would not be appropriate to associate
the sharp deterioration in governance directly with the program, it may not be a coincidence
that the large increase in government revenue took place during the same period. Clearly, the
WBG's strong emphasis on improving accountability, the rule o f law, transparency, and
participation had no discernible positive effects o n governance developments in Chad. In
hindsight, the oft-stated government commitment to achieve those improvements i s highly
questionable. I t must be underlined that protection o f human rights, control o f corruption,
enforcement o f the rule o f law, and the management o f the economy for the benefit o f
economic and human development are the fundamental responsibility o f a country's



34. This was also a major criticism by some NGOs o f the Bank support for the program. (See, for example,
EDF 2006 and Amnesty International 2005.)
35. Although not shown in the table, the decline has been especially pronounced after 2004. In the Chad
government's view, the governance weaknesses have been caused by the adverse security situation and frequent
episodes o f rebellion. Other observers argue for the reverse causation, with insecurity and rebellion the result o f
                           n
malgovernance, which i s i keeping with the literature and empirical evidence on the "resource curse." (See,
among others, Amnesty International 2005 and EDF 2006.)

Institutional Development and Capacity Building
2.42 Because "capacity building" encompasses more than training, this section
summarizes the program's outcomes in capacity building in the broad sense, as including
institutional development, that is, sustainable improvement in the basic rules, decision-
making processes, and structure o f incentives. (As noted earlier, the risk to the program that
the capacity-building efforts might not be successful was not recognized.)

2.43      Revenue transparency. A positive aspect o f the o i l revenue management
arrangements enacted by the government o f Chad in 1999 was achieving a level o f revenue
transparency nearly unique in Africa and nearing best international practice. 37 Equally
important, during the past several ye.ars habits have been built in the direction o f openness
rather than secrecy. Other resource exporters and the international community should look to
the Chad-Cameroon program as an example o f how to achieve initial transparency in
production and revenue from extractive industries. The issues are two. First, the continuation
o f oil revenue transparency may be at risk: a state o i l company has been established; new
external partners and other o i l companies are active; a new refinery i s being built with
external assistance; the country has no independent capacity to monitor the o i l sector; and the
Bank i s no longer involved. None o f these factors i s o f concern in itself, but together they
add complexity and thus potential risks to transparency and resource integrity.

2.44 Given the controversial history o f the program, it i s unlikely that the government
would wish to lose international credibility by weakening this success aspect o f the program.


37. Key factors include the legal obligation o f EEPCI to make public the oil liftings and corresponding f.0.b.
export prices; the verification o f the amounts getting to the offshore terminal in Cameroon and publication o f
the pipeline transit fees; consistency checks with the Citibank-managed account in London; and, on non-oil
revenue, the improvements in the Ministry o f Finance capacity to project tax and non-tax revenues.
                                                       26


I t does appear critical, however, to take the steps needed to complete the process o f eligibility
                                                                and
to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)38 implement fully the
obligations under the initiative. All such considerations affect the future and are thus beyond
the scope o f this report. What is within the report's scope is the second issue: even the fullest
transparency in revenue has limited meaning without transparency in expenditure. In Chad,
the expenditure side has been as opaque as the revenue side has been transparent.

2.45 Expenditure management. With the program's earmarking o f direct o i l revenue for
expenditure on "priority sectors," budgeting in Chad-already segmented between
domestically financed and aid-financed expenditure-became more fragmented still. In
effect, the program caused Chad to operate four different budgets: the oil-financed budget,
the aid-financed budget, the HIPC budget, and the domestic revenue-financed budget-with
limited fungibility among them.39This was not a prescription for improving the institutional
capacity o f the budgeting system in the long run.

2.46 In a context o f very weak budgeting and financial management capacity, the
temptation to earmark certain revenues for categories o f expenditure important for
development and poverty reduction i s understandable. However, institutional enclaves
generally only work in the short term and, over time, tend to lead to systemic institutional
damage and diminished capacity. The Bank understood this, but owing to the special risks o f
this program chose to aim for the short-term achievements. Unfortunately, the ring-fencing
did not even succeed in achieving either a reasonable intersectoral balance in the allocation
o f expenditure (because the agreed target applied to total expenditure on all priority sectors
combined), or a balance between investment and recurrent expenditure.

2.47 The original assumptions were that both balances could be achieved by: (i)         the
formulation o f "program budgets" in each priority ministry (in line with the PRSP and
consistent with a rolling MTEF), with the corresponding integrated expenditure proposals
                                           i)
vetted and cleared by the CoZZBge, and ( isystemic improvements in expenditure
management would result from the periodic public expenditure reviews by the Bank. The
logic was sound, but reality interfered. Progress in implementing the 2003 PRSP was
extremely limited and the formulation o f the second PRSP was delayed; no MTEF was in
fact produced before 2007; ministries' "program budgets" were disconnected from fiscal
realities; the budget was assembled by the Ministry o f Finance with little meaningful
participation by the line ministries; neither the capacity nor the authority o f the CoZZBge came
up to the original expectations; and the recommendations o f the PERs, presented with an
increasing sense o f urgency, were mostly ignored.




38. The EITI i s intended to foster transparency o f revenue from extractive industries, and i s currently
implemented in 25 countries. (See www.eitransparencv.org.) For eligibility, a country must meet reporting
guidelines and fulfill a number of criteria. Chad's intent was announced in 2007, but the government has failed
to take necessary steps and i s not yet a formal candidate. (EITI++ refers to a World Bank concept to consider
transparency throughout the value chain o f the extractive industry, rather than just the final stage.
39. The 2006 MOU attempted to partly redress this problem by extending the agreement to all revenue
regardless of source.
                                                       27


2.48 Some improvements in budget preparation did take place in 2007, with a rudimentary
three-year MTEF loosely based o n the PRSP that was being drafted, and for the first time
there were meaningful discussions involving each line ministry and the ministry o f finance
on options for expenditure programs. It is not clear whether this initial progress will be built
upon. 40

2.49 Overall, while budget preparation has improved somewhat compared to 1999, budget
execution has worsened. Despite positive steps, including the closing o f a large number of
government accounts, a treasury single account system remains far from being achieved
and-more importantly-the improved rules and financial management provisions put in
place de jure have been violated de facto, routinely and with impunity. O n balance, available
analyses and reports indicate that public financial management was no better in 2008 that in
1999, and the extensive technical assistance complementing the support for the program was
largely wasted-in part due to inappropriate design and in part due to lack o f implementation
by the government. (See Annex D.)

2.50 Accountability and participation. The External Compliance Monitoring Group
(ECMG) and the International Advisory Group (IAG) were the two external bodies set up by
the program to monitor, respectively, the environmental and social dimensions and the
broader development and governance dimensions, and the CollBge de ContrGle was
established in Chad to provide a measure o f social accountability and civil society
participation in decision-making on the allocation o f o i l revenue.

2.5 1 The ECMG worked well, and its operation i s described in Annex A. The IAG
performed its independent role through intensive missions in every year except 2008 (for
security reasons), with the final one in January 2009. 41 The IAG advice has been viewed by
WBG senior management as well as both governments as candid, competent, and
constructive. This was a positive feature o f the program, and one worthy o f replication for
large and complex Bank interventions in the future. 42

2.52 Also a positive feature, albeit much less successful in practice, has been the
establishment o f the CollBge to monitor the uses o f the o i l revenue. The scorecard i s mixed.
The entity attempted faithfully to fulfill its mandate, and had status and credibility, but was
hampered by weak capacity and government support that was lukewarm at best. The
technical staff, although both diligent and competent, was insufficient and financial resources
were not commensurate with the envisaged role. However, with adequate government


40. A bright spot i s a proven anticorruption measure taken in a December 26,2008 circular to effect all salary
payments for government employees by bank check or postal order and requiring all employees who do not
have a bank or postal account to open one.
4 1. The I A G and IEG teams have exchanged views and logistic information during their work since January
2009, to the extent that it was proper given their different mandates. T h e final IAG report was published in
September 2009.
42. The Bank has set up a similar international advisory group for the N m Theun 2 hydroelectric project in
                                                                        a
Laos, with the government engaging a panel o f experts to monitor the environmental and social aspects o f the
project; and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline project financed by the IFC i cooperation with the EBRD
                                                                                n
featured similar mechanisms.

support or at least facilitation, the capacity constraint could have easily been relieved. For
example, the government resisted the appointment o f the civil society representatives, a
defect that was supposed to be corrected after agreement on the 2006 MOU. However, except
for the chairman, all members were replaced in 2008 by direct government appointment
without consultation with the organizations they are supposed to represent.

2.53 On the positive side, the concern that the activities o f the CollBge (despite i t s lack o f
formal executive authority) might overlap with those o f the ministry o f finance and planning,
did not materialize. On the negative side, despite i t s good efforts, the CollBge was not in a
position to fulfill the original expectations: its requests to the ministries for information were
infrequently responded to and follow-up o f i t s recommendations has been increasingly weak.
Yet, although currently in limbo, the CollBge i s the only remaining component o f the
institutional structure originally put in place by the program, and may s t i l l have at least a
modest influence for more effective investment and as a channel for voice. The concept was
innovative as well as sound, and it, too, is worth considering for future major Bank-supported
projects in other countries.

THEENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
              AND

2.54 Whereas environmental and social aspects could have been addressed through the
standard safeguard screening procedures pertinent to a "Category A" project, the Bank went
significantly beyond the requirements and processed two free-standing capacity-building
IDA credits, to strengthen the capacity to manage the o i l sector, with special attention to
social and environmental management in Chad and Cameroon. In addition to the main
project, this section also assesses these two capacity-building projects. (For details, see
Annexes A, Byand C.)

Main Findings
2.55 For a full picture, it i s important to distinguish three time periods: pre-construction,
during construction, and post-construction. The corresponding ratings are shown in Table 9,
and developments in each period are summarized subsequently. In the table, the
environmental and social aspects ratings relate to the o i l development and pipeline project
and the ratings under institutional development relate to the two capacity-building projects.
Although the last o f the projects was completed in November 2007, the ratings give some
consideration to the issues that s t i l l need to be addressed, as well as the continuing
weaknesses o f the institutions responsible for environmental management in both countries.
O n the whole, and certainly during the pre-construction and construction periods, the project
was in compliance with the EMP.

2.56 The handling o f environmental and social issues was satisfactory in both countries for
the first two periods. One major benefit from WBG involvement was the insistence on
establishing the multi-tiered monitoring structure. Although the national government
agencies ran into difficulties and failed to perform as expected, the monitoring by E C M G and
by IFC's Environment and Social Department was important in dealing with complex issues
for which no easy solution was available. Two important examples were: (i) resettlement
                                                                              the
and compensation challenges in Chad resulting from the more extensive land acquisition
associated with the in-fill drilling program; and (ii) institutional and financial problems
                                                      the
                                                         29


experienced by the Foundation for Investment and Development (FEDEC), which required
actions by both IFC and COTCO. IFC's contribution remains important in ensuring that
required mitigation actions are implementedso as to continue to meet the objectives
described in the EMP.

2.57 In Chad, however, issues emerged on the social side in the third period. Also, the
institutional development dimension has been consistently `unsatisfactory. There are s t i l l no
o i l spill response plans in either country, and government monitoring o f project activities in
both countries i s weak to non-existent. EEPCI, COTCO, and TOTCO have performed well in
meeting EMP requirements and Bank safeguards, particularly in the areas o f health and
safety, emissions, water management, solid waste management, o i l spill response planning
and implementation, and health and safety. (See Annex A.) At the same time, in Chad, there
are risks to the livelihoods o f communities and individuals from the in-fill drilling program
(with total wells eventually reaching about 700, compared to the estimated 287 at appraisal).

The Pre-construction Phase
2.58 The main project was appropriately screened to Category A, followed by a thorough
Environmental Impact Assessment to address alternatives for the pipeline corridor, selection
o f the right-of-way, land use and habitat modification, socioeconomic impacts, effects o f
construction on indigenous peoples, as well as emergency response and o i l spill contingency
plans for the entire pipeline and drilling project, and an Environmental Management Plan to
be followed during the implementation. The EMP was the guiding instrument for project
compliance during both the construction and operations phases and was subject to repeated
international scrutiny and revision until stakeholders found it s a t i ~ f a c t o r y(However,
                                                                                        .~~
neither the project Environmental Impact Assessment nor the EMP foresaw the need for in-
fill drilling to enhance well productivity.)

2.59 The Environmental and Social Clearance Memorandum (ESCM) o f September 15,
1999, identified environmental and social safeguard policies and guidelines to be referenced


43. During preparation ExxonMobil indicated that it would not only apply Bank safeguards but would use the
EMP to deal with the environmental and social impacts. Thus, the arrangements went beyond the criterion o f
"doing no harm" to the additional objective three o f ``doipg some good" (Annex A).

 in the investment agreement. The WBG exercised a high degree o f diligence with respect to
 the safeguard policies that this project triggered.

 2.60 The pipeline project put in place a multilayered environmental and social impact
 monitoring structure. This structure included both internal and external monitoring bodies
 along with IFC's own supervision by i t s environmental and social specialists. EEPCI,
 COTCO, and TOTCO hired expatriate and national staff from both countries to implement
 the EMP and i t s associated environmental and social monitoring. External monitoring was
 provided by the ECMG through a consulting firm and by the IAG. These arrangements
 worked in satisfactory manner. 44

 The Construction Phase: 2000-2004
2.61 The EMP served as an effective tool during the construction phase. In addition to
providing specific technical limits in such areas as water and air quality, it also detailed
principles and processes for implementing compensation programs in both countries.
Villages received community compensation, such as water wells and water points,
electrification, community centers, schools, etc. Individuals were compensated for lost land,
trees, and other types o f property. In Cameroon, the COTCO-PSMC-NGO platform for
cooperation and grievance resolution began operations to ensure that compensation programs
were delivered as intended. During the construction phase, COTCO implemented a
compensation program for individuals and villages affected by the pipeline construction, with
650 micro-development projects. At the completion o f the construction phase, the project
allocated over 1.84 billion CFAF ($2.8 million) for community and regional compensation in
Cameroon.

2.62 In Cameroon, the project properly addressed effects o f construction on indigenous
peoples, since the Atlantic Littoral Forest corridor for the pipeline was located to avoid
Pygmy settlements in Bakola/Bageli. As required under the EMP, the project established the
FEDEC with an initial capitalization o f $3.5 million provided by COTCO, which was to be
used to support the long-term development and management o f two new national parks
(Campo Ma'an Park and Mbam-Djerem Park) and the implementation o f the Indigenous
Peoples Development Plan for BagyeWBakola (Pygmies) communities. Implementation o f
these programs was delayed due to organizational problems in FEDEC. (See paras. 2.69-
2.70.)

2.63 In 2003, the World Bank declared two Level I11non-compliances in Cameroon
related to the Cultural Property safeguard. These non-compliances were related to project
activities at sites that had been previously identified as "high priority" archaeological sites
(ECA-68, ECA-15, and ECA-163). A special archeological mission conducted by the ECMG
determined that these areas could have been avoided and COTCO was asked to develop and
implement a mitigation program. The program consisted of: (i)      preparation o f a report on
opportunities for future archeological research in the affected area; (ii) funding post-graduate
                                                       i ithe
studies for two Cameroonian archeology students; ( i ) establishment o f two curation

            n                                                                                      n
  Although i this case the external compliance monitoring worked well, and IFC has also used it i other
complicated and risky projects, such multi-layer arrangements are costly, can overlap and provide inconsistent
messages, and do l i t t l e to foster national capacity."

facilities, one in Ndjamena and one in Yaounde, to house recovered artifacts and support
further archeological work; and (iv) preparation in book form o f the project's archeology
program in Chad and Cameroon. Project supervision and monitoring reports indicate that
these mitigation measures were implemented in a satisfactory manner.

2.64 In Chad's O i l Fields Development Area (OFDA), the construction phase presented
many environmental and social challenges. Among the most important were establishing
systems for solid and hazardous waste management, health and safety for workers and area
residents, and managing the spontaneous in-migration o f people interested in gaining
employment with the project. The EMP provided the guidelines and processes for addressing
these challenges while the monitoring by E C M G provided analysis and recommendations on
measures necessary to comply with environmental and social objectives o f the project.

2.65 Also, in the early years o f the project hundreds o f unskilled workers from other
regions o f Chad migrated to the project area. Spontaneous settlements sprung up around the
key project locations in Kome and Miandoum. The EMP provided guidance on the potential
impact o f these migrations and proposed mitigation measures. In addition, surveys were
undertaken, and based on the findings the Consortium and CTNSC initiated actions to
address living conditions and sanitation concerns. Water wells were constructed and garbage
collection initiated. ECMG during its monitoring visits paid close attention to these issues
and made recommendations aimed at mitigating the negative environmental, heath, and
social impacts associated with the spontaneous settlements. Since completion o f construction,
some o f the settlements have disappeared while others have become permanent. As with
villages in the area around the OFDA, permanent settlements receive a variety o f goodwill
support from EEPCI.

2.66 Some assistance was given to government entities, mainly training and provision o f
equipment. However, the government bodies (PSMC45in Cameroon and CTNSC46in Chad)
created for the independent monitoring o f the o i l fields and the pipeline were located within
the national o i l ministries o f both countries, putting them in situations o f potential conflict o f
interest. L i t t l e if any sustainable institutional development was achieved. The situation was
aggravated further in Chad when the Ministry o f Petroleum was destroyed, along with all o f
i t s records, during rebel attacks in February 2008. Moreover, the CTNSC had ceased to
function after 2007, thereby leaving no governmental monitoring presence in the oil-
producing area.

2.67 Although the two capacity-building projects were approved at the same time as the
Bank and IFC loans for the pipeline project, judging from the disbursement profiles
implementation only started when the pipeline was already built and operating. Thus, the
projects did not contribute to government monitoring during o i l fields development and
pipeline construction, as originally intended.

The Post-Construction Phase: 2004-2008
2.68 Cameroon. Overall, the pipeline project's environmental and social performance in
Cameroon during the post-construction phase has been satisfactory and i s in compliance with
WBG safeguards. It has performed particularly well in meeting desired standards for most
World Bank and IFC General Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines. The client has
been quite diligent in i t s efforts to implement the processes and mitigation plans detailed in
the EMP. A solid EMP management structure i s in place that includes both technical
specialists and Community Relations Officers who work closely with villages and towns
impacted by the pipeline.

2.69 During the operations phase, compensation activities generally relate to the ongoing
"Social Statement Process" to resolve a l i s t o f concerns and grievances developed in
collaboration with local NGOs, representatives o f the government o f Cameroon, and
villagers. There are also periodic requirementsto compensate for land use required for
maintenance or facilities improvements. COTCO admits that managing expectations related
to project benefits at the village level has been very difficult. The Consultative Platform,
which includes the PSMC, COTCO, government ministries, and NGOs, meets too
infrequently (once or twice a year), and has not proven to be effective in resolving
grievances. Local NGOs, while supportive o f the EMP and its processes, believe that a
project o f such scale should have longer-term economic development impacts at the village
level. While the "social closure" has not been achieved, the external monitoring concludes
that compensation programs are being implemented effectively, and in keeping with EMP
guidelines.

2.70 Since i t s creation, Cameroon's FEDEC has faced a number o f financial and
management challenges. In 2005, the ECMG described some o f the more important problems
faced by FEDEC, including the beginnings o f financial difficulties associated with the falling
value o f the U.S. dollar against the CFAF and lack o f success in raising funding from donors.
ECMG reports, along with observations provided by the IAG and the Project Inspection
Panel, have highlighted ongoing financial difficulties, i t s inability to fund raise, and its need
to draw down capital to support i t s operations.

2.71 Over the past few years, IFC, COTCO, and the government o f Cameroon have
attempted to address the deteriorating financial situation o f FEDEC. Proposals were made to
increase the endowment through additional capital from both COTCO and the IFC. As o f
early 2009, a draft action plan had been prepared. The recent decline in world stock markets
has further eroded FEDEC's endowment. COTCO has provided some interim funding, but a
long-term solution has not been agreed upon. One must question the commitment o f all the
parties to finding a solution considering the financial situation has worsened over the last
four years. L e f t unresolved, the financial and management problems faced by FEDEC will
likely have a serious negative impact on continued implementation o f the Indigenous
People's Plan (IPP) activities and could also adversely affect management o f the two parks.

2.72 The implementation o f the IPP continues to present challenges. Participation o f some
Pygmy communities in FEDEC-supported programs i s considerably lower than expected,
and there i s tension between Pygmy leaders and the implementing organization RAPID
concerning program implementation.
                                                         33


2.73 At present, there i s no effective government monitoring o f the pipeline. Proxy
monitoring i s being carried out by the ECMG, but it will end once IFC's involvement i s
concluded. COTCO i s mainly self-regulating. N o effective environmental and social
mainstreaming into transport, health, and other ministries has occurred, as envisaged under
the technical assistance project.

2.74 Chad, Overall, the oil development and pipeline construction project's environmental
and social performance in Chad has been moderately satisfactory and i s in compliance with
World Bank safeguards and IFC Performance Standards. The client, EEPCI and TOTCO,
have implemented the processes and mitigation plans detailed in the EMP and have been
cooperative in providing access to information required by the various monitoring and
supervision entities: ECMG, IAG, and IFC. Reporting to third parties and IFC has been
comprehensive, descriptive, and transparent, but despite a massive information dissemination
program, some local stakeholders s t i l l feel that more communication i s needed.

2.75 There has been reasonable success in addressing the environmental and social
impacts o f i t s activities, considering the size and complexity o f the Pipeline Project. The
most important examples include: (i) oil spill response management system, which
                                            the
includes automatic shut o f f to reduce the quantity o f spills and quick response by specialized
spill cleanup specialists; 47 (ii)  efforts to reduce well pad size and return land to farmers; (iii)
efforts to put in place technology required to reduce flaring volumes after a Level 1 non-
compliance for excessive flaring was raised by the EMP team in August 2006; (iv) meeting
the ongoing challenges o f solid and hazardous waste management; and (v) developing and
implementing health and safety programs that affect employees, contractors, and the
communities at large. In 2007 and 2008, project workers kept their historically low
Recordable Incident Rate well below the average rate o f the petroleum industry as a whole.

2.76 Probably the most challenging part has been the work to meet the requirements o f the
EMP and take the required action based on the conclusions and recommendations o f the
Barclay-Koppert report.48The report assessed the adequacy o f the Chad Resettlement and
Compensation Plan (CRCP) for addressing changes in project scope and land requirements
arising from more extensive drilling and production well development in the O i l Fields
Development Area (OFDA) than was envisaged in the original CRCP.

2.77 EEPCI and the EMP team have introduced a new, revised land compensation process
that gives more time to the affected people, and an enhanced land use Geographic
Information System (GIS) database that allows more effective management o f impacts and o f
compensation information. The GIS i s used to demarcate village land area according to use



47. The one spill that occurred totaled 34 barrels o f o i l and was contained within a few hours.
                                                          the
48. T h e main conclusions and recommendations were: (i) project has failed to achieve its objective o f
minimizing its impact on land and had only partially achieved i t s objective o f reclaiming land after
construction, and making as much land as possible available again to customary users; (ii) evaluation found
                                                                                               The
that the CRCP's emphasis on agricultural training and off-farm training as the principal livelihood restoration
measures was inadequate to restore the livelihood losses o f those 900 or so households experiencing loss o f
access to more than 20 percent o f their land.

 and who has traditional rights to specific plots. For agricultural land it specifies which plots
 are under cultivation and which ones are in fallow.

2.78     In November 2008, EEPCI & I F C engaged the services o f Environ to undertake an
Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) o f the in-fill drilling program that began
in 2005.49 This program will increase the number o f wells by up to 400, thereby increasing
the overall size o f the project's footprint, which was not foreseen in the original
Environmental Impact Assessment. While the E M P will continue to be used as guidance, the
E S I A will be used to determine whether or not the current mitigation measures
(implementation and execution procedures) need to be improved. I F C and E C M G consider
that the in-fill program does not pay adequate attention to the conclusions o f the Barclay-
Koppert report. In an effort to resolve their differences, I F C and EEPCI management met in
Washington D.C in April 2009 and agreed that: documents related to the L U M A P , the ESIA
and the Infill Drilling Program would be disclosed; Environ would complete a re-assessment
o f the ESIA (first report mid-year and final report YE 2009); and additional resources would
be allocated for either a social development specialist (as suggested by IFC) or GIS
specialists.

2.79 In terms o f land return, satisfactory results are n o w achieved and the footprint o f the
temporary facilities i s being significantly reduced. O f the 549 well pads 509 have been
restored to the dimensions committed to in the EMP. While not all o f them are yet effectively
returned for community use, this i s s t i l l a remarkable achievement.

2.80 From the government side the story i s very different. With the closing o f the IDA
capacity-building project in Chad, the promising F A C I L (Fonds d 'Actions Concerte`es
d 'Initiative Locale)" program for micro-credit, small infrastructure financing, and small and
medium enterprise development collapsed. (Annex C.)

2.8 1 Although drafted with support from the two IDA credits, environmental regulations
governing o i l fields, pipeline, and petroleum sector operations have not been approved by
either national government. The O i l Spill Response Plans in both countries have also not
been approved. The incipient and promising monitoring capacity that was being built up in
the N C T M C collapsed when the IDA technical assistance Credit was closed. Currently, there
i s no government presence in the o i l fields for monitoring or reporting purposes, TOTCO is
self-regulating and no effective environmental and social mainstreaming across transport,
health, and various sector ministries has occurred, as envisaged under the capacity-building
projects.




49
    Based on information from the ECMG reports from 2005, among other sources, IFC considers that the infill
drilling began i 2005, whereas EEPCI states that the infill drilling began i mid-2008, and the additional wells
               n                                                           n
drilled between 2003 and 2008 were development wells within the original 40-acre well-spacing pattern.

3. Evaluation Dimensions and Crosscutting Issues

3.1      As explained in chapter 2, despite the technical and financial success o f the main
project, linked largely to the high price o f oil, the fundamental objective o f the program has
not been achieved. Indeed, the o i l revenue windfall was associated with a resurgence of civil
conflict and a worsening o f governance. The evaluation concludes that the principal reason
for this disappointing outcome was lack o f government ownership. Actual outcomes might
have been better with a more flexible program design, suited to the fluid circumstances and
political economy o f Chad. However, no alternative program design or closer supervision
would have allowed to achieve the program's development objectives in the absence o f
government commitment. This section groups the major crosscutting issues loosely around
the major evaluation dimensions and, owing to the extensive preceding analysis, addresses
them briefly.

STRATEGIC RELEVANCE AND TIMING

D i d the WBG get involved for the right reasons and at the right time, and did i t do so in full
             f
recognition o the probable alternatives and the risks, including reputational risks?

3.2     The WBG got involved for the right reasons and in full recognition o f previous
experiences as well as the risks. The sound strategic rationale o f the WBG involvement was
noted earlier. At the time, it was reasonable to view the risks as somewhat mitigated by
Chad's comparatively good record o f reform implementation-staying on track with IMF
and Bank programs, liquidating wasteful parastatals, etc.; by the relative political stability o f
the previous four years; and by the government's public assertions o f strong ownership and
commitment.

3.3      O n timing, a major criticism (especially by the NGOs) was and remains that the
WBG should have waited longer, in order to help build the country's capacity to manage the
petroleum sector and the o i l revenue and to improve governance. I t is difficult to imagine,
however, h o w an additional two or three years could have achieved those long-gestation
objectives. Moreover, clear signs were already emerging in 1999 that the o i l would be
developed and the pipeline built in the near future with or without WBG involvement. The
easy decision in 2000 would have been to avoid both the involvement and the criticism-and
let the responsibility for likely unfavorable impacts rest entirely o n the government and the
o i l companies. Instead, the WBG rightly decided on the more difficult course o f reducing the
likelihood o f unfavorable impacts and improving the chances o f success-with hope but
without illusion. 51

3.4    The more appropriate criticism i s instead retrospective. After i t s involvement in
Chad's o i l sector in 1994 the Bank's efforts during the subsequent six years to help the

5 1. The notion that the WBG got involved because o f pressure by the WBG president i s not supported by the
evidenc-n      the contrary, there was substantial skepticism, and before Board presentation the Managing
Director was dispatched to Chad for almost two weeks to personally ascertain the situation from a variety o f
stakeholders. The internal debate was certainly intense, but the conclusion was that this was a risk worth taking
for Chad's development.
                                                         36


country improve budgeting capacity, budget execution mechanisms and financial
management controls were insufficient and unsuccessful, thus making it necessary to support
capacity-building activities concurrently with the program. Still, the eventual problems in
program implementation were caused much less by limited technical capacity than by
governance weaknesses and lack o f government ownership. This risk was recognized from
the beginning. Indeed, it i s possible that the widespread skepticism and the external criticism
led the Bank into an excessively rigid program design, as discussed next.

APPROACH DESIGN
       AND

Did the WBG have the right program design?

3.5      As explained earlier, the environmental and social safeguards were well designed,
better than in many projects o f a similar nature in developing countries, and so were the
mechanisms for transparency in o i l revenue. Technically, too, the o i l development and
pipeline construction were well designed, although the larger-than-projected o i l revenue was
due to the o i l price increase, which few could have predicted. However, the all-important
revenue and expenditure management arrangements proved inadequate and, in some respects,
counterproductive. The main issues concern the earmarking o f the revenue and ensuing
fragmentation o f the budget; excessive rigidity o f the arrangements combined with arbitrary
expenditure floors; neglect o f the quality o f expenditure and insufficient attention to budget
execution.52Similarly, the capacity-building projects for petroleum sector management were
overly ambitious, resulting in disappointing outcomes.

Oil Revenue Earmarking
3.6     The earmarking o f the o i l revenue-until 2006-caused an additional fissure in an
already fragmented budget process and weakened further public expenditure management
without clear benefits for resource allocation or efficiency. The logic was simple and direct.
In keeping with the classic definition o f conditionality as "a means for the appropriate use o f
             since Bank support was provided to generate the o i l revenue, the Bank
resources,yy53
conditions were limited t o the use o f that revenue. Even if the logic i s accepted, however, it
became inoperative when the o i l revenue turned out to be several times higher than domestic
revenue and the total o f foreign aid.

3.7     Moreover, as with other institutional enclaves, budgetary enclaves in a
malfunctioning budgeting system may generate a positive short-term impact but at the cost o f
dilution o f accountability and a weakening o f institutional capacity in the long term. In this
case, the earmarking did not even have i t s desired short-term impact, as the arrangements
were discarded by the government barely one year after the o i l revenue began accruing, and
the revenue escrow mechanism proved too fragile to survive its first real test.



52. The program did not contain a formal oil stabilization fund. However, while a stabilization fund can be an
important tool o f fiscal management, like any other "fund" it can only be effective if it i s used for the purposes
for which it i s designed. I t appears most unlikely that the government would not have drawn the resources in
such a fund to meet i t s immediate needs-whether or not the fund's rules or the fiscal stance justified it.

                                                          37


3.8     Since the Bank was well aware o f these realities, the question arises o f why it chose
to design such a complex and rigid mechanism. The answer i s a combination o f the intent to
maximize the protection against the high reputational risks o f the program and the need to
respond to the severe external pressure and vocal criticism o f WBG involvement.

Excessive Rigidity
3.9     Whether the chances o f improved allocation and efficiency o f resources would have
been better with more flexible arrangements rather than with fixed expenditure floors i s very
difficult to adjudicate, even in hindsight. Certainly, the lack o f government commitment
make it unlikely,that alternative designs would have yielded substantially better outcomes.
The issue i s not the six layers o f supervision (the Consortium, the government, the WBG,
civil society, the ECMG, and IAG); although costly, they worked well on the environmental
and social side and as advisory mechanisms. Neither i s the core issue the arbitrariness o f the
percentages o f revenue to be allocated to the various uses: since it is impossible to define
those percentages o n an analytical basis, negotiated targets are inevitable. The core issue of
excessive rigidity is the enshrinement o f quantitative spending targets into formal law, and
the ensuing lack o f subsidiary arrangements to give the Bank "judgment space" within
agreed targetss4. Alternatives could have included a soft target within a band triggering
progressively stronger review and correction provisions-providing a middle ground
between the excessively discretionary criterion "satisfactory to the Bank" and a negotiating
straightjacket. Also, instead o f a floor on the percentage o f o i l revenue allocated to the
priority sectors, the agreement could have focused on a ceiling on expenditure on non-
priority sectors (mainly security and regime maintenance), agreeing on the size o f the "black
box" but otherwise not discussing its contents or i t s execution, and thus focusing supervision
and dialogue on the functioning o f the overall budget process and the allocative and use
efficiency o f e ~ p e n d i t u r e . ~ ~

3.10 Because, in the final analysis, the issue is government commitment, more flexible
design or a focus o n expenditure rather than o n o i l revenue may well have led to the same
disappointing development outcomes. However, such an approach would at least have
avoided the budgetary fragmentation caused by earmarking the o i l revenue, with fiscal and
expenditure management capacity somewhat better than i s the case today.

Neglect o the Quality o Expenditure and o Budget Execution

3.1 1 The unsatisfactory outcomes in expenditure efficiency and budget management were
documented earlier. Insistence on a numerical quantum o f budgeted expenditure invited

54
  Key operational staff understood quite well that the quality o f expenditure was at least as important as i t s
amount, and thus intended to interpret the implementation o f the MOU in a flexible manner and taking into
account considerations o f efficiency and service provision. In the event, the Bank focus remained where it had
been from the start - on minimum percentages o f expenditure - and the Bank decision to exit rested primarily
on the deviation between the actual 2007 outturn o f 58 percent o f total expenditure on priority sectors as
compared with the 70 percent agreed in the MOU
55. The attractive alternative o f distributing a part o f o i l revenues directly to individual citizens and/or
households i Chad was briefly considered but rejected, as both impractical and too great an intrusion into
            n
national sovereignty. I t i s possible that such an alternative might be conceivable in other situations-with
government consent.
                                              38


disregard for quality and cost-effectiveness, and led to surprises ex post when budget
execution deviates from the approved budget. The Bank was aware o f this risk and for this
reason set up a process o f annual Public Expenditure Reviews to assure a regular dialogue on
expenditure management. The program design was coherent: the PRSP would underpin an
MTEF framing an annual budget consistent with an agreed sectoral allocation and financing
integrated capital-current expenditure programs endorsed by the Colkge, with the PERs
serving to monitor fiscal sustainability and to improve both budget preparation and
execution. The logic was textbook perfect-xcept      for the revealed weakness o f every link in
the chain.

3.12 While capacity-building efforts in budgeting system and practices were largely
unsuccessfbl, new capacity was created in other areas-primarily in the understanding o f
petroleum marketing and in the management o f infrastructural projects and construction. This
new capacity was instrumental for the large expansion o f the paved road network, but at the
same time serious problems emerged in procurement, cost control and observance o f basic
financial rules. The underlying cause o f both developments was the combination o f the
program's focus on percentage spending floors with the unexpectedly high revenue. N o t
only did this combination put pressure o n the government to spend more and faster in order
to meet the targets agreed with the Bank, regardless o f cost-effectiveness or integrity
considerations, but it also gave a convenient excuse to those elements who wished to exploit
the situation for personal or political advantage.

3.13 The counterfactual i s whether better results would have been achieved by focusing
agreements and supervision on good preparation o f major investment projects (including
appropriate provision o f recurrent costs) and supervision o f their implementation (including
attention to procurement and financial management)-plus          much more attention to the
execution o f the overall budget (including targeted expenditure tracking surveys). N o
definitive answer can be given, but good practice in public expenditure management points in
the direction o f focusing on the basics and it i s likely that explicit attention to project
preparation and implementation would have 1e.dto higher efficiency o f investment
expenditure than has been the case.

WBG IMPLEMENTATION
          PERFORMANCE
Has the WBG succeeded in effectively supervising the program, adapting to changes, and
managing decisions internally and vis-&vis the government, international partners, and
NGOs?

3.14    The high risks to the WBG and the worldwide interest generated by the project led to
unusual attention to implementation and supervision-with enormous efforts and personal
commitment o f almost every operational manager and staff member involved in the program.
In hindsight, however, these efforts could not be effective-due partly to the flawed program
design but mainly to lack o f government commitment and follow-through. But there were
other problems.
                                               39


Supervision Effectiveness
3.15 Owing to the importance o f the program, the Bank assigned in the early years two
highly respected former senior staff, with a great deal o f experience in difficult African
challenges, as consultants to supervise it in cooperation with country management-one
resident in N'djamena and the other in Washington. The expensive arrangement absorbed
most o f the otherwise generous supervision budget and ended before the critical period when
o i l revenue began to f l o w in large amounts. After the end o f the consultant arrangement
from mid-2004 until November 2007, a regular senior staff was assigned to N'djamena with
central operational responsibility for the program.

3.16 There were also problems with the supervision o f the capacity building projects The
Chad revenue management project suffered from the excessive rotation o f task managers (six
in seven years), with ensuing lack o f attention and continuity; the Cameroon capacity-
building project was afflicted by the conflict o f interest inherent in placing the monitoring
mechanism inside the national o i l company; and the Chad capacity-building project suffered
for several years from the lack o f in-house technical expertise needed to supervise the
experienced consultants.

3.17 IFC's supervision responsibilities in the main project related to environmental and
social issues were performed satisfactorily, in consultation with E C M G and with the Bank.

Senior Management Role
3.18 When full involvement in the program was decided in principle in 1998, the WBG
president was determined to use the opportunity to try and create a new model o f petroleum
use for development and the best possible environmental and social safeguards, as well as
international cooperation between the WBG and large multinationals.

3.19 After the intense internal debate prior to the decision, those staff who were initially
skeptical fully accepted the decision and proceeded to do all they could to maximize the
chances o f its success. For the first few years o f the program, too, senior management created
an enabling environment for operational managers and staff, and its decisions were informed
by and integrated with the efforts o f operational staff, who implemented the higher-level
guidance effectively.

3.20 The 2005 debate on h o w to handle the increasingly likely government decision to
break the agreement was thoughtful and deliberate, and the Bank's sharp and immediate
response in January 2006 to the government's unilateral action was understood and widely
agreed. However, the direct intervention o f the president's office in the subsequent
negotiations to engineer a new agreement was questionable. Although country and regional
management were fully involved and correctly sought to address the allocation o f all
expenditure regardless o f source o f financing rather thanjust the earlier blinkered focus on
direct o i l revenue, the weakened enforcement mechanism made the agreement in effect paper
conditionality with little chance o f actual success.

3.21 Based o n staff interviews, some operational staff and managers eventually came to
feel that their views, information, and arguments were not receiving consideration in senior
                                                         40


management decisions. This sentiment became especially strong in 2008. The contrary view
has also been expressed, however, that staff disappointment was due to their disagreement
with the decision to exit and the manner o f doing so, and not to the failure o f consultation or
consideration o f the arguments and the facts.

External Partnerships and Relations 56

Relations with the consortium were very good until the events o f early 2006. Subsequently,
although relations with IFC continued, the Bank's degree o f trust was no longer the same.57

3.22 Relations with donors were excellent at the beginning and remained good through the
July 2007 multidonor mission. Until then, consultation o f all development partners was close
and all major donors were in agreement with the program and with the Bank decisions
                                        '*
reached after such consultation. After mid-2007, the interaction with donors became
dominated by broader political and security considerations-underlined by the major rebel
attack on N'djamena in February 2008.

3.23 Several representatives o f external partners in Ndjamena felt that not only had they
not been consulted on the Bank decision to exit in 2008, but they had not even been informed
before the decision was made public. However, some Executive Directors had been aware o f
the Bank intentions since the 2008 Spring Meetings, and it i s possible that some local heads
of missions had not been informed by their headquarters on a timely basis. However, at
least one major program partner reported finding out only from the September press
communique o f the Bank's final decision to exit the program and o f i t s request that Chad
voluntarily repay in advance the balance on the IBRD loan and the IDA credits.

3.24 Relations with NGOs have been complex, and a distinction i s clear between the
position (and roles) o f the major international NGOs and those o f local NGOs in Cameroon
and Chad. As a broad simplification, while the international NGOs were against the project,
the local NGOs were pressuring to make it as environmentally and socially responsible as
possible, and, in Chad, to delay the project in order to build better governance and
accountability. Documentary evidence and interviews suggest that the criticism o f the Bank's
involvement advanced by some NGOs was not well grounded in factual evidence and thus
speculative and exaggerated. Conversely, the N G O pressure did contribute to strengthening
further an already strong set o f environmental and social protection safeguards. However, the
same outcome could have been achieved without the excessive criticism and undocumented
claims.


56. WBG relations with the governments are discussed throughout this report and are not mentioned here.
57. Recall that EEPCI chose to withhold the royalty and dividend payments instead o f depositing them in the
London escrow account, as per the agreement.
58. A t least one major donor, after adhering to a joint donor consensus, privately took different positions vis-&
vis the government. The IMF was consistently supportive, and even extended the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility although not even one review had been completed. However, the Fund's long-standing views
on revenue management and unity o f the budget are a matter o f record, and contrasted sharply with the
program's oil revenue earmarking-a contrast that the government attempted to underline in i t s efforts in 2005
to obtain Bank agreement to amend the revenue management law.
                                                       41


Exit
3.25 In the view o f the government o f Chad, the Bank's actions in 2008 were gratuitous
and unwarranted. In that view, good faith attempts had been made to meet the agreed M O U
targets for the 2007 budget, even though the expenditure outturn fell somewhat short, and the
rebel attacks o f early 2008 then upset all the fiscal plans for that year. Also, the Bank took i t s
decision unilaterally rather than after the joint review implied by the "consultations"
provision o f section 1V.d o f the MOU.59  Finally, the government points out that the Bank
effectively took its decision to exit before the final figures on the expenditure outturn for
2007, as the reference year, became available.

3.26 In the Bank's view, there had been staff meetings and exchanges on the execution of
the 2007 budget, which constituted consultations and also provided evidence that the agreed
targets would not be met. (This outcome was already clear at the time o f the July 2007
multidonor mission and in fact the targets were not met, by a significant margin. The Bank
concluded that, after going the extra mile in 2006 to come to an agreement on a reformulated
program following the government's unilateral changes, the government's failure to,
implement the new agreement made clear the futility o f further Bank involvement in Chad's
o i l sector and Bank inaction in the face o f repeated violations o f agreements would create a
reputational risk and send the wrong message. As for the advance repayment o f the balance
on the IDA credits by Chad(the first in Bank history) the reason stated was that, in i t s
absence, Bank involvement in Chad's o i l sector would not come to full closure. In reality,
relations had been tense since at least July 2007, and little development work was being
accomplished. In this perspective, the decision by the Bank's senior management to
withdraw might be seen simply as the final recognition o f a longstanding state o f affairs.
Moreover, the decision's justification lay in the repeated government violations o f the
agreements and the reputation risk o f continued involvement compared with the l o w
probability o f constructive influence.

3.27 Some internal and external observers have expressed concerns about the Bank's
decision-making process and the implications o f i t s withdrawal. Some stakeholders have
considered that the Bank gave away its "seat at the table" just when the government was
reaping an unprecedented o i l revenue windfall. Some have viewed the timin o f the decision
as especially unfavorable as it may have undercut the new unity governmen$', weakened the
"reformers" and strengthened the "hawks" in Chad. At least one major partner resented what
was perceived as insufficient consultation; and some local NGOs f e l t that without the Bank


59. The complaint of unilateralism i s curious in light o f the government's own unilateral decision in late
December 2005 to amend the 1999 PRML. The government argues, however, that the decision on amending the
law was taken by the Parliament in the exercise o f i t s sovereign functions and was thus outside the control o f
the executive branch.
60. In August 2008, a new government was formed, headed by a new Prime Minister. Views vary on whether
this action signals meaningful and durable change. One significant event, however, was the Cabinet decision to
assert the authority o f the line ministries to initiate physical investment proposals in their sector-consistent
with national development priorities and sector strategies-and limit the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Infrastructure to implementing those investments. T h i s decision could remedy the disconnect between
development needs and investment spending caused by the 2005 assignment to the Minister o f Infrastructure o f
all authority concerning investment in physical infrastructure and construction.
                                                       42


they had lost their only voice channel. To what extent these views are due to insufficient
knowledge o f the totality o f facts and o f the bases o f the Bank's decision making process i s
not clear.

IFCBank Cooperation
Was the joint Bank-IFC modality more cost-effective than parallel operations, and did it
yield better development outcomes?

3.28 The program featured significant WB-IFC collaboration at all stages, with a division
o f labor suited to their different mandates and comparative advantage. Thus, the Bank
focused on implementation o f the revenue arrangements and expenditure understandings, and
on the three IDA-supported projects to help build capacity to monitor the o i l sector and
manage the o i l revenue, while IFC dealt with the environmental and social aspects o f the
pipeline project. Also, the Bank handled relations with the governments and IFC relations
with the Consortium and the lenders. With the Bank exit from Chad's o i l sector, IFC
continued to monitor the environmental and social aspects o f the main project.

GOVERNMENT
        OWNERSHIP AND PERFORMANCE

Was the government performance satisfactory? Was government ownership genuine?

3.29 The performance o f the implementing entities, given their constraints, was
moderately satisfactory in both Chad and Cameroon. Cameroon government performance,
limited to the capacity-development project was moderately unsatisfactory. Chad's
government performance, as shown by the broad macroeconomic, fiscal, governance and
institutional outcomes, was described earlier. Whatever the variety o f influences on the
outcomes, this performance cannot be considered satisfactory. On the specific issue o f
ownership, two contrary views have been expressed: (i)         Chad was on board with the
agreement, until security and regime maintenance urgencies forced the government to
abandon it; (ii)   there was never genuine ownership from the top, despite protestations to the
contrary. I t i s not possible to judge intentions, but there i s little doubt that whatever
ownership was present at the beginning, if any, decreased through the years o f program
implementation. 61

3.30 The question arises whether the WBG could have demanded at the beginning a
sufficiently robust test o f government's ownership to use the o i l resources as agreed. I t i s true
that the Bank could perhaps have been more insistent on greater government participation in
the formulation o f the 1999 revenue management law and associated institutional structures.
(These were in effect designed largely by Bank staff and consultants-albeit in consultation
with Chadian officials, with serious review by them, and with approval by the legislature.)
But several high government officials were genuinely supportive o f the program; Chad had a
comparatively good record o f implementation o f Bank- and Fund- supported reform
programs, as noted; and Chad's president took all possible occasions to affirm publicly that

61. In the words o f a non-Bank, nongovernment interlocutor "ownership was a ventriloquist act." Still, it i s
interesting to note that the provision to allocate 5 percent o f the revenue to the producing region was fully
implemented-as explained earlier-in contrast with the abandonment o f the Future Generations Fund, which
the government reportedly opposed from the beginning.
                                                43


the 1999 l a w was fully owned by Chad and to proclaim his support for the program and all i t s
features, including during a personal meeting with the WBG president. I t i s hard to see what
else the Bank could have done to increase its degree o f ex ante comfort with government
ownership. The only real test would come, as it did, when the o i l revenue began to flow.

                                             RATINGS
A SUMMARY SCORECARD: PRINCIPALPROJECTS PROGRAM
                                     AND

3.3 1 The ratings for the individual projects and the program as a whole are shown in Table
10. The program-level ratings are related to the project ratings, but also stand on their own as
a judgment o f the overall cluster o f projects and activities against the program objective. The
ratings o f the program are not an average o f the ratings o f the component projects, nor are
they weighted by loan amounts, but flow from a combined assessment o f the developmental
importance o f each project-with the revenue management arrangements at the core o f the
program. A s explained in the above analysis, the program relevance was modest, from a
combination o f appropriate strategic objective and weak design; the high efficiency o f the
pipeline investments in narrow financial and technical terms was tempered by the modest
efficiency o f the capacity development investments and the overall less than efficient use o f
o i l revenues, efficacy in terms o f overall program objectives was modest at best. Hence, the
overall program outcome must be considered unsatisfactory, when assessed against the stated
core objective o f reducing poverty and improving governance by the best possible use o f the
o i l revenue in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner

3.32 However, in light o f the complexity o f this program and the diversity o f outcomes,
the standard evaluation approach o f assessing outcomes against stated objectives needs to be
qualified by consideration o f the possible counterfactual. With the rapid increase in o i l price
after 2000, it i s almost certain that the o i l would have been developed and the pipeline
constructed even without WBG involvement, albeit one or two years later. If so, the
environmental and social provisions and the external monitoring arrangements would not
have been as thorough as those under the program. Also, it i s probable that the revenue
allocations to the "priority sectors' would have been lower, and virtually certain that the
support institutions such as the Collige and the advisory group would not have been put in
place. In this sense, it could be concluded that the WBG involvement had a positive effect-
although it's not possible to speculate on whether these results would have been
commensurate with the scale o f the WBG effort. That said, the evaluation has rested o n the
standard approach.

4. Lessons and Future Implications

4.1    The well-known lesson that government ownership and commitment are the major
influence o n the effectiveness of projects and programs i s underlined by the experience o f the
                                               45


Chad-Cameroon program. Other lessons learned from the program are identified below-
many o f them also well known but brought in sharp relief by this experience. Because the
findings and conclusions are discussed in the earlier sections, the lessons and implications are
listed below with a minimum o f elaboration. (Project-specific lessons are included in the
corresponding annex.)

RELEVANCE, R I S K S , AND TIMING

4.2         International experience has shown that adequate expenditure management
mechanisms should be in place, and tested, before a large revenue increase i s likely to accrue.
In this case, the time available for capacity-building after Board approval and before the flow
o f o i l revenue was much shorter than expected and the revenue much larger-adding to the
difficulty o f building capacity contemporaneously with program implementation. A
secondary lesson is therefore to build expenditure management capacity as robust as
necessary to fit a high scenario o f revenue increase. (The capacity created will be useful to
the country even if the high scenario does not materialize.)

4.3      Setting up institutional enclaves and special mechanisms to protect resources and
accomplish quick results can damage local capacity in the long term. Such enclaves are
generally not successful beyond the short term and, even when successful in the short term,
they tend to undermine the already weak local systems and thus long-term development. In
this case, although the rationale for the establishment o f the revenue escrow account and the
earmarking arrangements was strong in the specific country context in 2000, when tested by
reality these mechanisms failed to achieve their objectives and meanwhile stood in the way
o f sustainable improvements in fiscal and expenditure management capacity.

4.4     While protecting inputs must remain a paramount consideration, development
objectives should be formulated in terms o f outcomes (ifpossible), meaningful outputs, or
concrete process improvements-rather than in terms o f inputs-and performance indicators
should be limited to thefew key indicators that are critical to achieving the PDOs and are
monitorable. Even when the immediate aim o f the project i s to increase resource availability,
reduce the cost o f input acquisition, or channel resources toward priority uses, a failure to
define clearly the expected results in terms o f key outputs, outcomes, or major process
improvements risks distorting the actual design o f the project away from those results. In this
case, defining the main project objective for Chad in terms o f budgeted expenditure to be
achieved diverted attention away from the efficiency o f expenditure and budget execution.
And to l i s t dozens o f "key" performance indicators o f diverse importance and questionable
monitorability makes monitoring impossible.

APPROACH DESIGN
       AND

4.5     If the WBG decides to risk involvement in ambiguous and fluid situations, it pays not
to do so in overly detailed and rigid ways. Utmost clarity is needed o n the objectives,
principles, and parameters, but the design and implementation modalities should be as fluid
as the situation itself, rather than rely on binary choices and numerical rules. This approach,
however, may in practice foster a propensity to make successive small compromises,
cumulating in the risk that continued Bank engagement may result in acquiescence to
inefficient use o f resources. Thus, in addition to clarity o f purpose, an adaptable engagement
                                               46


grounded on flexible but robust dialogue requires a strong fabric o f reciprocal trust between
staff and management and continuity o f both.

4.6     Revenue transparency i s necessary-specially      for revenues from extractive
industries-but i s not sufficient. Transparency on the expenditure side i s critical as well. In
this case, setting as the main target a global minimum percentage spending on several sectors
implied that the global target could be met even if the intersectoral allocation o f the resources
was very different from what had been agreed, and without regard to the efficiency o f their
use.

4.7    Project design must be based on recognition o f institutional and administrative
capacity. I t i s important in countries with weak capacity to focus on addressing the basic
problems rather than attempting to introduce sophisticated practices. In this case,
paradoxically, major components o f the program in effect assumed the prior existence o f the
very capacity they aimed to build.

4.8    An innovative design, even if it proves unsuccessful, may contain novel elements
worthy o f consideration and possible replication. In this case, there are three such elements:

       The formation o f the Collige de ContrGle was an excellent and exciting idea, even if
       it did not enjoy the necessary government support-and such joint publidprivate/
       NGO entities have the potential to foster expenditure efficiency as well as social
       accountability in countries with a government reasonably interested in a pro-
       development, pro-poor expenditure policy.
       The Provisional Committee to allocate the 5 percent o f the direct o i l revenue to the
       oil-producing region can be an illustration for similar arrangements in other countries
       with valuable mineral resources, despite flaws in i t s operation in this case.
       Finally, the cover and voice given to local NGOs through the dialogue on the
       preparation o f the program and during i t s implementation should be a regular feature
       o f all such WBG interventions.

WBG PERFORMANCE
4.9     Although in complex and high-profile cases strategic guidance and major decisions
must come from the top leadership o f the WBG, it i s not clear in this case that the top-down
direct intervention by the Bank President's Office in 2006 was helpful to formulate a new
agreement with a better chance o f enforcement.

4.10 In large, complex WBG projects with multiple stakeholders, good WB-IFC
cooperation i s important to improve the chances for positive results. In this case there was
good WB-IFC cooperation on the main pipeline project, but it also extended to Advisory
Services operations. In late-2004, when the IDA-funded capacity-building projects were
found to be progressing slower than expected, IFC was able to provide new funding for
sustaining the capacity-building initiatives.

4.1 1 IFC's Advisory Services have a signijkantpotential role to help the local private
sector. They can enable local companies to participate in the economic activity created by the
project; help the sponsors-typically large multinational corporations-meet national content
                                                  47


requirements; and promote local economic development. In this case, the Enterprise
Center-the focal point o f IFC's Chad SME program-became the cornerstone o f Exxon's
procurement platform that was the sole source for all o f i t s purchases in Chad, starting in
2005.

4.12 Whether the World Bank or the I F C i s involved, the concern with development
effectiveness goes beyond the gates o f individual projects-however well they may be
technically done-to the results o f the overall program. There i s no contradiction between
viewing favorably the technical and financial success o f the pipeline project even though the
weight o f other unfavorable outcomes leads to a negative conclusion o n the development
outcome o f the program o f which it was a component, as in this evaluation. However, the
evaluation illustrates the basic point that a part o f a program, however well carried out,
cannot be separated from the overall program and the broader setting within which its impact
i s being assessed: a project or a subproject cannot be ring-fenced in the assessment.

4.13 Continuity is critical to manage a project that i s central to a program, and a minimum
o f in-house technical competence is necessary to supervise consultants. In this case, the
revenue management project had six task team leaders in its seven years, and the Chad
capacity-building project relied almost entirely on consultants for the first years, without any
in-house expertise in the technical dimensions o f o i l exploration and production.

4.14 Good communications and transparency are particularly important in the context o f a
difficult decision. Senior management would want to appropriately consider the views o f
key operational managers and staff and ensure the fullest possible measure o f advance
consultation with key development partners.

    IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
MAJOR
4.15 With substantial o i l revenue expected to continue for many years, it i s s t i l l possible
for Chad to escape the resource curse. The difficulties are known. Institutional and
organizational capacity remain weak. Macroeconomic sustainability i s injeopardy. Fiduciary
risk i s likely to increase in the short t e r m with the unexpected fall in o i l price and revenue in
2009 and 2010-producing pressures to preserve security and regime maintenance
expenditures, and hence a downward pressure on pro-development, pro-poor expenditure.
Budgeting systems and skills remain quite insufficient for efficient resource allocation, and
motivation and integrity have been weakened by the lack o f consequences for the spreading
non-compliance with fundamental rules. However, there are scenarios under which a good
development outcome in the long run is s t i l l conceivable. The Bank could cooperate with the
IMF in monitoring overall fiscal and expenditure outcomes and make a useful contribution
by providing good and flexible advice in public sector management-focused o n the basics,
recognizing capacity realities, and supported by assertive cooperation o f certain major
bilateral partners. But the most important factor would be a new and genuine determination
by Chad's government to use the o i l resources for development and poverty reduction, and
do so responsively and efficiently.

4.16 The Chad-Cameroon o i l development and pipeline construction program exemplifies
the inherent tension between the limits o f the WBG as an international organization and i t s
mandate to foster development and poverty reduction. The WBG went very far in 1999
                                               48


toward the development side, by setting up complicated and prescriptive arrangements to
maximize the probability that the Chad government would use the o i l revenue windfall
mainly for development and poverty reduction. For various reasons, the revenue windfall
turned out to be used in large part for military expenditure and other regime maintenance and
for wasteful construction. The governance climate in Chad did not improve-rather the
reverse.

4.17     However, it should not be concluded from this experience that the WBG should not
intervene in supporting extractive industries because doing so carries reputational risks and
success i s unlikely. Indeed, despite the disappointing overall outcomes o n the development
and governance side, WBG involvement contributed to a notable increase in expenditures in
social sectors and environmental and social protection within the confines o f the project
better than they would have been otherwise. The analysis o f this report suggests that realistic
and constructive WBG involvement in extractive industries could rest o n combining an
insistence on high standards o f environmental and social protection with flexible
conditionality o n the composition o f all expenditure and its efficiency-complemented by
assistance to strengthen a unified budget system, ensure transparency in both revenue and
expenditure, and build capacity in accountability institutions. T o be effective, WBG
involvement must be buttressed by an agreement with all other major donors that violation o f
the environmental and social standards or backsliding o n fiscal transparency or
accountability would trigger consequences for the overall f l o w o f aid t o the government
concerned.

Annex A. Chad and Cameroon: Petroleum Development
and Pipeline Project (WB Loan 4558-CD; WB Loan
7020-CM; IFC Project 4338)

Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons

MAINFINDINGS
1.      The Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project (PDPP) i s the
main lending operation in the program o f World Bank Group (WBG) support for developing
the petroleum sector in the two countries, accounting for about 86 percent o f the total
financing. The program included two IBRD loans to Chad and Cameroon, two IFC loans to
both countries, and three IDA credits, one for revenue management in Chad, and one for
environmental and social capacity building in each o f Cameroon and Chad. These IDA
Credits have been evaluated separately (Annexes ByC, D).

2.      The outcome o f the PDPP i s rated moderately satisfactory. (See the main text for a
discussion o f the poverty and other broader outcomes o f the project.) The project was
executed efficiently by the private sector Consortium and completed ahead o f schedule.
Given the shortfall in oil production due to unexpected reservoir and well-productivity
problems, revenues to the government o f Cameroon were below expectations. On the other
hand, with the high level o f o i l prices, Chad government revenues exceeded expectations.
Though the investment climate in both Chad and Cameroon continue to be challenging (more
so in Chad than Cameroon), the project has supported private sector development in the two
countries and provided procurement opportunities to local suppliers o f goods and services-
especially SMEs-from Esso-Chad (EEPCI, ExxonMobil's Chadian subsidiary).

3.        As implementing agency, EEPCI effectively addressed issues encountered during
and after construction and performed satisfactorily overall. Private sector ownership and
control o f Doba oilfields and pipeline companies were fully achieved, while s t i l l giving
minority shares o f the latter to governments. Implementation o f the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was undertaken broadly in accord with what was reviewed and
approved at appraisal. When problems have arisen, the client companies-EEPCI, Cameroon
O i l Transport Company (COTCO), and Tchad O i l Transport Company (TOTC0)-have
taken the necessary mitigation actions consistent with both the EMP and Bank Group
safeguard policies. Some EMP issues remain a challenge, notably the increased project
"footprint" in the O i l Fields Development Area (OFDA), which i s associated with the in-fill
drilling program and the financial and organizational issues in the Foundation for
Environment and Development in Cameroon (FEDEC) that affect the long-term
implementation o f the agreed offsets.

LESSONS
4.      I n large multicountry programs or projects where local capacity for environmental and
                                                     f
social safeguard monitoring is limited, supervision o environmental and social issues.can
usefully include high-level independent bodies capable o ensuring compliance with safeguards

and environmental management plans. The model used for supervision o f the environmental
and social aspects o f the project included a multilayered monitoring system consisting o f both
national and international actors. The international inputs, which included the work o f ECMG,
IAG, and IFC's environmental and social specialists, provided solid technical support to the
client in i t s efforts to comply with the EMP. ECMG monitoring visits also provided guidance
and recommendations on mitigation measures as well as training for local monitoring entities
such as CTNSC. These supervision processes also inspired trust and respect in a diverse group
o f stakeholders. Both IAG and ECMG have disseminated monitoring reports on their Web
sites, ensuring public access. At the same time, national-level capacity building and
commitment to mitigating environmental and social impacts i s necessary over the longer term.

 5.                                                                 f
          I n large, complex projects that require the restoration o livelihoods, international
financial institutions may need to proactively work with the private sector sponsors to go
 beyond the usual compensation measures and corporate social responsibility initiatives and
 move toward regional economic developmentplansd2,in partnership with all stakeholders. The
 Chad-Cameroonpipeline project affected 375 villages (241 in Cameroon, 134 in Chad) along
 the pipeline in the two countries. Individual and community compensation paid to those
 affected along the pipeline was expected to restore livelihoods and sustain them for the long
 term. The project also earmarked 5 percent o f project revenues for the oil-producing Doba
 region in Southern Chad. While the villagers were compensatedwell above the national norms,
 full restoration o f livelihoods has not been achieved. It would have served the project well to
have put in place longer-term development objectives and supplemental activities that
 addressed rural development and poverty alleviation. This also would have been useful for
managing expectations, since projects like PDPP that provide short-term benefits, such as
 employment and compensation, also raise individual and community expectations for longer-
term benefits.

6.      I n a capacity-constrained environment, IFC may need to look beyond the project to
ensure development impacts in the local economy. In projects with significant linkage
prospects, such as the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline, IFC may need to undertake early
identification o f SME opportunities that the project would generate and develop appropriate
programs. When the project was approved in June 2000, IFC identified expansion and
diversification o f the non-oil sectors o f the two economies as a key challenge, especially in
Chad. IFC expected that local spending by the project would create demand for secondary
services and supplies that would boost the local economy. However, the local private sector
did not have the capacity to take advantage o f this demand, which limited the extent o f the
project's linkage effects. IFC responded by offering a range o f Advisory Services projects
under the Chad SME program, though it took time to get traction with EEPCI. The focal
point o f the program currently i s the Enterprise Center that IFC set up in February 2005 in
partnership with the Chadian Chamber o f Commerce, which has helped local Chadian f i r m s
gain procurement contracts from EEPCI.

7.                                                               f
       I n projects with wide-ranging impacts and a diverse mix o stakeholders, it is critical
to have a communications strategy aimed at achieving wide participation and building

  The FACIL program for the OFDA was supposed to be an intermediate step to the Regional Development
Plan (RDP) funded by the World Bank. RDP was never implemented.
                                                53


stakeholder confidence. IFC expected the extensive disclosure and consultation measures
developed by the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project to provide the platform for smooth
interactions with stakeholders. Despite the measures taken, groups o f stakeholders,
particularly local ones, s t i l l felt that communication was lacking. Although massive amounts
o f information about the project's activities were produced and various channels were
employed to disseminate this information, the lack o f direct and frequent contact alienated
some stakeholders.

8.      Given the inherent methodological limitations, standard project financial and
economic analysis needs to be supplemented by qualitative information. The standard
methodology for project financial and economic analysis i s inadequate for measuring all the
economic costs and benefits and i t s distribution among stakeholders. IFC uses the Financial
Rate o f Return (FRR) as the indicator for returns to all financiers and the Economic Rate o f
Return (ERR) as a measure o f the returns to the overall economy. Given the difficulties in
quantifying other benefits, such as long-term productivity improvements from training,
accounting for positive and negative externalities, and taking into account the distribution o f
costs and benefits among stakeholders, these measures cannot in themselves provide a full
picture of the relevant (development) outcomes o f projects. I t i s imperative to supplement
this quantitative assessment with qualitative assessments o f the direct effects on beneficiaries
that contribute significantly to local economic development.

The Project
         COMPONENTS, COSTS
OBJECTIVES,       AND

9.       Objectives. The PDPP consisted o f two Bank loans. The loan for Chad was to finance
the government's equity share in the Tchad O i l Transportation Company. TOTCO i s a
special-purpose company incorporated in Chad as a joint venture between the private
sponsors and the government to own the Chad portion o f the Export System (about 170
kilometers o f the pipeline) and the first pumping station. The loan for Cameroon was to
finance the government's equity share in the Cameroon O i l Transportation Company.
COTCO i s a special-purpose company incorporated in Cameroon as a joint-venture between
the private sponsors and the two governments to own the Cameroon portion o f the Export
System (about 880 kilometers o f onshore pipeline, 11 kilometers o f offshore pipeline, two
pumping stations, a pressure reduction station, and the floating storage and offloading
vessel). IFC also provided loan financing to COTCO and TOTCO. The project development
objectives (PDOs) from the Loan Agreements are as follows:

       Cameroon: "The objective o f the Project i s to assist in the development and export
       through the Borrower's territory o f the petroleum reserves o f the Doba Basin O i l Fields
       in an environmentally and socially sound manner, and thereby, inter alia, increase the
       Borrower's fiscal revenues available for financing priority development expenditures in
       the context o f the Borrower's strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction."

       Chad: "The objective o f the Project i s to assist in the development and export
       through Cameroon o f the petroleum reserves o f the Doba Basin O i l Fields in an
       environmentally and socially sound manner and thereby, inter alia, increase the
       Borrower's resources and expenditures for poverty alleviation.'' The Loan Agreement
                                                        54


         for Chad also incorporated provisions to earmark 76.5 percent o f petroleum royalties
         and 72 percent o f dividends to poverty reduction plus 4.5 percent o f royalties for
         priority projects in the production zone.

10.     According to the joint WB-IFC Project Appraisal Document (PAD, #19343, April 13,
2000), the development objectives o f the project were, through environmentally and socially
sound private investment in the petroleum sector: (i) increase Chad government
                                                      to
expenditures on poverty alleviation activities; and (ii) increase Cameroonian fiscal
                                                       to
revenues available for financing priority development expenditures in the context o f the
government's strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction. The PAD also listed two
key performance indicators (KPIs) for the PDOs: (i) increase in Chad o f at least $40
                                                      an
million63per year (2005-09) in petroleum-financed budgetary expenditures o n priority
sectors;64 and (ii) increase in Cameroon o f at least $40 million6' per year (2005-07) in
                  an
petroleum-generated revenues available to finance priority development expenditures.66

 11.    The discussion in the PAD focuses on the project's potential to reduce poverty in the
two countries. In Chad, the Petroleum Revenue Management program was expected to
transform petroleum revenues into poverty alleviation and sustainable economic growth. The
project was expected to benefit Cameroon by generating additional fiscal revenues for
priority public expenditures and create an atmosphere conducive to foreign direct investment.

63. In the case o f Chad, the pipeline project was expected to generate total government revenues o f about
$1.677 billion over the life o f the project (28 years). The average annual revenue was estimated to be about $60
million ($1.677 billiod28) and based on the allocation framework under Chad's revenue management program,
this was expected to result in at least $40 million in additional annual expenditures in the priority poverty
sectors over the f i r s t 10 years o f production. See PAD, p.25 for details.
64. For Chad, the PAD listed the following outputs and associated KPIs:
Output: substantial fiscal revenues from export o f Doba petroleum
=Is: export o f first oil flow through the pipeline by end-2004 and 81 million barrels per year in 2005-2007;
government petroleum revenues o f at least $70 million per annum 2005-2008
Output: Petroleum Revenue Management Program (PRMP) in operation
WI: petroleum revenues allocated and disbursed in accordance with PRMP
Output: private sector owned and operated oil field and export systems
KPI: private sector ownership and control o f Doba oilfield and pipeline companies (excluding minority
government share)
Output: development o f oilfields and construction and operation o f pipeline in environmentally and socially
sound manner
KPI: achievement o f targets and norms prescribed in the EMP, including under the Resettlement and
Compensation Plan.
65. In the case o f Cameroon, the pipeline project was expected to generate total government revenues o f about
$505 million over the l i f e o f the project, representing an annual average o f about $18 million, with average
annual levels over the f i r s t five years o f production o f about $45 million. See PAD, p. 26 for details.
66. For Cameroon, the PAD listed the following outputs and associated K P I s :
Output: substantial revenues from export o f Doba oil
KPI: increase in government by at least $40 million per year in 2005-07
Output: private sector owned and operated export system
KPI: physical completion and commissioning o f Export system before end-2004
Output: construction and operation o f the o i l export system in an environmentally and socially sound manner
KPI: Achievement o f targets and norms prescribed in the EMP, includingunder the Compensation Plan, and the
Indigenous Peoples Plan.

12.    This evaluation i s based on the two core objectives, that is, the common themes
evident in the above objectives: to develop the Doba o i l fields in order to increase the fiscal
revenues o f Cameroon and Chad available for priority poverty reduction expenditures; and to
carry out this development in an environmentally and socially sound manner.

13.    Components. The PDPP supplied the following infrastructure and equipment needed
to enable the export o f Chadian oil:

       a field system, including the drilling and operation o f about 300 wells in Chad; and
       an export system, including a 1,070 kilometer buried pipeline to Kribi in Cameroon's
       southwestern coast, an 11 kilometer submarine pipeline from the coast to offshore
       floating storage and loading facilities, and pumping stations.

14.    Environmental and social impact mitigation, although not a component in the PDPP,
was an imperative demanded by the international community for COTCO, TOTCO, and both
governments. The governments received IDA credits for strengthening their environmental
and social management capabilities. The PDPP components were not revised.

15.     Costs. The private Consortium that capitalized, constructed, and i s operating the
PDPP consists o f ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Petronas o f Malaysia. The actual project cost
amounted to $4.8 billion, compared to appraisal estimates o f $3.7 billion, with the cost
overrun o f $1.1 billion funded by the Consortium. Table A. 1 shows the actual and estimated
costs (including contingencies and excluding $15 million for preparation) and financing
sources. A $400 million bond issue was cancelled for lack o f market interest and Consortium
equity covered the gap.

16.     The Field System was funded by equity from the Consortium. The Export System was
financed by equity and loans to TOTCO and COTCO. IFC provided an A Loan o f $13.9
million and a B Loan o f equal amount to TOTCO for the construction o f the Chad portion o f
the Export System. IFC also provided an A Loan o f $86.1 million and a B Loan o f equal
amount to COTCO for the construction o f the Cameroon portion o f the Export System. Other
commercial loans totaling $400 million were provided through U.S. Eximbank and Coface. In
addition to the IFC loans, IBRD provided loans o f $39.5 million and $53.4 million,
respectively, to Chad and Cameroon to finance their equity participation in the Export System.

Implementation Experience

17.      Key Dates. The pipeline construction was completed in July 2003, 18 months ahead
o f schedule, with o i l deliveries starting in October 2003. Considering the size and complexity
o f the project and i t s challenging location, the early completion was a major achievement. As
o f February 2009, the project was producing about 120,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), less than
half o f the original target production rate o f 225,000 bbl/d. Actual o i l production has been
hindered by early water breakthrough, water disposal limitations, damage in some o f the
producing wells, and pressure depletion in one zone. The project has been addressing the
production shortfalls through the use o f three satellite fields (since 2005) as well as an in-fill
drilling program6' (since 2005) that has expanded the footprint o f the project and increased
land requirements.

18.     Monitoring and Evaluation. The quality o f the project's M&E is rated modest. The
PDPP was designed to set relevant date-bound targets, and i t s logical framework was
consistent throughout. I t specified the right data required on expenditures, output (for example,
drilling progress, pipeline construction, and E M P activities), and outcome (for example,
petroleum exports, generated revenues, amounts transferred to Treasuries, and expenditures on
priority sectors). Decision-making in the project has been informed by M&E data. For
example, the shortfall in the quantity and quality o f crude production led to new investments by
the Consortium. Also, data on the allocation o f revenues to priority sectors prompted a
dialogue between the WB and government o f Chad that led to a new M O U in 2006.

19.     However, there were shortcomings in the monitoring o f the actual use o f petroleum
revenues. At project close in June 2005, the welfare and poverty impact o f the poverty-
reduction activities financed by these revenues were unknown and there were no provisions
(for example, through surveys) to evaluate it. There were also iags in the monitoring o f
construction funding and compliance with covenants. Internal evaluation o f the PDPP (ICR,

67
  Based on information from the ECMG reports from 2005, among other sources, IFC considers that the infill
drilling began in 2005, whereas EEPCI states that the infill drilling began in mid-2008, and the additional wells
drilled between 2003 and 2008 were development wells within the original 40-acre well-spacing pattern.
                                                     57


#36560, December 2006, and IEG-WB review; XPSR, November 2005, and IEG-IFC
review), made no effort to measure the project's results for poverty reduction.

20.     Given the scope and complexity o f the project, specialized consultants were engaged to
provide independent opinion and expert knowledge on issues relating to o i l reserves,
construction, insurance, and ongoing environmental and social impacts. On behalf o f the
WBG, IFC appointed a consultant, D'Appollonia (Genoa, Italy), as the External Compliance
Monitoring Group (ECMG) to monitor the implementation o f the EMP by the Consortium and
to assess the work o f the governments' implementing agencies in Chad and Cameroon. The
ECMG visited the project 3 times a year during the construction phase o f the project and has
continued to do so once a year during the current operational phase. The average cost o f the
ECMG's services i s about $400,000 per annum and i t s reports are available on the project and
IFC Web sites. Supervision visits by IFC environmental and social specialists are carried out
regularly in coordination with their counterpart consultants from ECMG.

2 1.     In addition, five distinguished individuals-the International Advisory Group
(1AG)-were appointed in February 2001 to provide an independent overview o f the project,
and to advise the WB president and the two governments on the progress in achieving the                         '


broad objectives o f the pipeline project and the related capacity-building projects. The work
o f the IAG was expected to continue for up to 10 years and involved visits twice a year to the
two countries. The average annual cost o f IAG's services i s about $600,000 and i t s reports
are also available on the project Web site. IAG i s about to end i t s monitoring role in the
project, with the final report expected in June 2009.

22.     Financial Management. The evaluation team found financial management aspects o f
the project to be satisfactory.

23.     Procurement. The evaluation team found no procurement issues in the project.

24.     Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Environmental and Social Clearance
Memorandum (ESCM) dated September 15, 1999, identifiedthe following environmental and
social safeguard policies and guidelines6*that should be referenced in the investment
agreement. The project EIA led to the preparation o f an EMP that would govern the processes
and actions required to comply with environmental and social safeguard policies and guidelines
in both countries. The IFC was tasked with supervising the implementation o f the EMP.

Main Findings

25.     The handling o f environmental and social project issues was satisfactory in both
countries. EEPCI, COTCO, and TOTCO have performed well in meeting EMP requirements
and Bank safeguards, particularly in the areas o f health and safety, emissions, water

68. The applicable safeguard policies and guidelines are: OP 4.01 Policy on Environmental Assessment, dated
October 1998; OD 4.20 Indigenous People, dated June 1999; World Bank Operational Policy Note 11.03,
Management o f Cultural Property, dated September 1986; OD 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement, dated June 1,
1990; World Bank General Environmental Guidelines dated July 1, 1998; IFC General Health and Safety
Guidelines, July 1, 1998; and Onshore O i l & Gas Guidelines, dated July 1, 1995; OD 4.15, Poverty Reduction;
and OP7.50, International Waterways.
                                              58


management, solid waste management, and oil spill response planning and implementation.
At the same time, in Chad, there are risks to the livelihoods o f communities and individuals
from the in-fill drilling program (with total wells eventually reaching about 700, compared to
the estimated 287 at appraisal).

26.      One major benefit o f IFC involvement was i t s insistence on establishing the
multitieredmonitoring structure. Although the national government agencies ran into
difficulties and failed to perform as expected, the'monitoring by ECMG and by IFC's
Environment and Social Department was important in dealing with complex issues to which
there was no easy solution. Two important examples were: (i) resettlement and
                                                                 the
compensation challenges in Chad resulting from the more extensive land acquisition
associated with the in-fill drilling program; and (ii) institutional and financial problems
                                                     the
experienced by FEDEC, which required actions by both IFC and COTCO. IFC's contribution
remains important in ensuring that required.mitigation actions are implemented so as to
continue to meet the objectives described in the EMP.

27.     In the IFC Environment and Social Review (April 14,2006), applicable safeguard
policies, guidelines, and procedures were evaluated and rated. Comments were provided and
compliance or non-compliance determinations were made. The review concluded that the
project materially complied with all relevant policies, guidelines, and procedures. It received
a satisfactory rating. The following section presents information to determine compliance
with safeguard policies and guidelines from 2006 to the present.

OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples
28.     The EMP identified the Bakola Pygmy and Bantu settlements in Southern Cameroon
as vulnerable to the impacts o f the pipeline construction. The decision about where to locate
the pipeline took these settlements into account. However, to mitigate potential long-term
indirect adverse impacts associated with constructing and operating the pipeline in Pygmy
and Bantu-inhabited areas between Lolodorf and Kribi, an Indigenous Peoples Plan was
developed.

29.      The IPP contained background information on Bakola Pygmies and the
interdependent Bantu communities in the immediate vicinity o f COTCO's easement between
Lolodorf and Kribi, along with results from community consultations. The objective o f the
IPP was to provide long-term benefits to the project-affected Pygmy population via
assistance to programs and projects that address health, education, and agriculture in the
region. In addition, due to the Bantu's historical association with the Bakola Pygmies in the
Atlantic Littoral Forest, the IPP addresses some health issues o f Bantu groups. Hence, the
IPP included an organizational framework for developing and implementing IPP programs in
basic literacy, education, hygiene assistance, improved water supplies, and agriculture. Six
hundred thousand dollars (360 million FCFA) o f COTCO's $3.5 million (2,100 million
FCFA) capital contribution to the Foundation for Environment and Development in
Cameroon (FEDEC) was earmarked and managed to fund IPP-related programs.

30.    Project monitoring reports from ECMG and IFC and the FEDEC Evaluation Report
(October 2007) point to ongoing implementation successes along with challenges for
continuing implementation o f the IPP. Despite financial difficulties in FEDEC, programs in
                                                       59


citizenship, housing, education, health, and agriculture are continuing, though at a reduced
level. The level o f participation o f some Pygmy communities in FEDEC-supported programs
i s considerably lower than expected, and there appears to be some tension between Pygmy
leadership and the implementing organization, RAPID. As o f May 2009, agreement has been
reached by IFC, COTCO and FEDEC to fund the long-term IPP.

3 1.     Finally, the ongoing financial and management problems faced by FEDEC, if left
unresolved, will likely have a serious negative impact on continued implementation o f IPP
activities as well as the environmental offsets detailed in the EMP.

O P N 11.03, Management o Cultural Property
                         f
32.      In 2003, The World Bank declared two Level I11non-compliances in Cameroon. Both
were related to project activities at sites that previously had been identified as high-priority
archaeological sites (ECA-68 and ECA-163). A special archeological mission by the ECMG
determined that these areas could have been avoided, hence the Level I11non-compliance.
COTCO was asked to develop and implement an acceptable mitigation program. The program
consisted of: preparation o f a scientific report that summarized findings and opportunities for
future archeological research in the areas traversed by the pipeline; funding to support post-
graduate studies for two Cameroonian archeology students; and the establishment o f a curation
facility to house recovered artifacts and support further archeological work in Cameroon and
Chad. Monitoring by ECMG and IFC confirm that COTCO i s meeting its obligations to
mitigate the non-compliances. No other non-compliances have been reported.

OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement
33.      . Chad. I n November 2005, ECMG recommended implementing the provision in the
EMP for an evaluation o f the Consortium's resettlement and compensation activities "at the
end o f the first agricultural cycle after the construction o f the fixed facilities has been
completed." The Chad Resettlement and Compensation Plan Evaluation Study was carried
out between April 2006 and August 2006. The evaluation assessed the adequacy o f the Chad
Resettlement and Compensation Plan (CRCP) for addressing changes in project scope and
land requirements arising from more extensive drilling and production well development in
the O i l Fields Development Area (OFDA) than was envisaged in the original CRCP.

34.       The evaluation had three major findings. First, the original CRCP was not performing
as intended primarily due to the more extensive land use associated with the need to drill
more wells to reach production targets. Second, CRCP-prescribed mitigations are assessed as
no longer adequate to address the magnitude o f project impacts on the agricultural livelihood
o f households and on community resources (bush and fallow), particularly in a small number
o f villages where land to support populations i s already scarce. Third, as o f June 2006, the
project had permanently compensated 1,243 hectares o f land in the OFDA, exceeding CRCP
estimates by about 65 percent. A further 1,698 hectares o f land had been temporarily
compensated, nearly twice the area estimated by the CRCP.69


69. The report recommendedthat compensation be reviewed for all villages and where necessary adjusted to
reflect their differing levels of communal land loss and that livelihood strategies place emphasis on providing
project-affected people with replacement land.
                                                   60


35.      Since issuing the report, both ECMG and IAG have observed that EEPCI has started to
implement some o f the reports' recommendations, particularly those related to land use
process and to effective management o f impacts and o f compensation information. The Land
Use Management Action Plan (LUMAP) uses a geographic information system (GIS) to
demarcate village land area according to use and who has traditional rights to specific plots.
For agricultural land it specifies which plots are under cultivation and which are in fallow. The
                     a
LUMAP program h s helpedthe EMP team to ensure that temporarily occupied land i s
restored and returned to previous users; there i s a high degree o f accuracy in data collection
and information management pertaining to compensation (both individual and community) and
household socioeconomic information; most seriously affected villages and households are
prioritized based on the principles recommended in the Chad Resettlement and Compensation
Plan Evaluation Study; and based on this prioritization, Site-Specific Plans are devised for the
most severely affected settlements.

36.      The IEG evaluation mission observed in February 2009 that LUMAP has been
undertakenin 4 o f the 10 most affected villages in the OFDA (Danmadjia, Dildo, Dokaidilti,
and Ngalaba)70.The data have not been fully analyzed, but preliminary analysis suggests that
current compensation and resettlement programs are likely to be adequate in mitigating the
impacts associated with the increased permanent land acquisition o f the in-fill drilling program
at least for those 4 villages. The remaining 6 villages should be completed in 4-6 months.

37.     In November 2008, IFC engaged Environ to undertake a Cumulative Environmental
and Social Impact Assessment focused on the in-fill drilling program. The report i s currently
a "confidential draft," and i t s findings are not available for use in the current IEG report.
However, IFC and ECMG believe that the in-fill program does not pay adequate attention to
the conclusions o f the Chad Resettlement and Compensation Plan report and that this could
be considered non-compliance.

38.     In terms o f land return, satisfactory results are now achieved and the footprint o f
temporary facilities i s being significantly reduced. Five hundred nine o f 549 well pads have
been restored to the dimensions committed to in the EMP. W h i l e not all o f them are yet
effectively returned for community use, this i s s t i l l a remarkable achievement (ECMG 2008).
A new procedure has been devised for the quitus (clearance) o f land return. W h i l e before
only the village chief was expected to sign the quitus document, previous landowners are
now identified and invited to sign as well; in this manner they are informed that their land i s
ready for cultivation, and are much better placed to claim to use it (ECMG 2008).

39.      Cameroon. During the construction phase, COTCO implemented a compensation
program for individuals and villages affected by the pipeline construction. The program
followed the guidelines in the EMP. Villages received community compensation such as water
wells and water points, electrification, community centers, schools etc. The program
encompassed a total o f 650 distinct micro-development projects for the benefit o f 266 villages
in the vicinity o f the pipeline and other permanent facilities such as the pump stations and the


'O According to ECMG (April-May 2009), the Village Land Use Survey had been completed in 8 villages
(Dokaidilti, Dildo, Ngalaba, Mouarom, Danmadjia, Begada, Mbanga and Bela) and was on-going in Bero,
covering a total o f 2061 households.
                                                       61


marine terminal. At the completion o f the construction phase, the project allocated over 1.84
billion FCFA ($2.8 million) for community and regional compensation in Cameroon.

40.     During the operations phase, compensation activities generally relate to the ongoing
Social Statement Process to resolve a l i s t o f concerns and grievances developed in
collaboration with local NGOs, representatives o f the government o f Cameroon, and
villagers. There are also periodic requirements to compensate for land use required for
maintenance or facilities improvements. The COTCO-PSMC-NGO platform for cooperation
meets regularly and functions as intended. Since 2005,357 out o f 456 grievances (80
percent) have been resolved. From project inception until end-2008 there remain 142
unresolved grievance cases. Some communities and individuals are dissatisfied with the
outcomes and continue to press the platform for mitigation o f impacts, particularly since they
are receiving l i t t l e information about the status o f claims dating back several years. NGOs
believe that the processing time for grievance resolution i s too long. COTCO admits that
managing expectations has been very difficult.

41.     Total individual compensation (cash and in-kind) for both phases in Cameroon has
reached about $1 1.5 million. NGOs, while supportive o f the EMP and i t s processes, believe
that a project o f such scale should have longer-term economic development impacts at the
village level. External monitoring suggests that compensation programs are being
implemented according to the guidelines specified in the EMP.

Onshore Oil and Gas Guidelines
42.    The key production and control practices were monitored closely by EEPCI and the
ECMGe71  With the exception o f gas flaring, the project consistently complied with the
requirements detailed in the EMP72.Gas flaring i s discussed below in the section on Air
Emissions and Air Quality.

World Bank General Environmental Guideline and IFC General Health and Safety
Guidelines
43.     Air Emissions and Air Quality: Stack emissions and ambient air quality at facilities in
both Cameroon and Chad are within established guidelines. A Level 1 non-compliance for
excessive flaring was raised by the EMP team in August 2006. Flaring volumes o f natural gas
associated with the produced crude were higher than the project target level o f 1.1 million
cubic feet per day during most o f 2007. Two additional compressors were installed in April
2008, which helped drop flaring to about 0.65 million cubic feet per day. When compressors
are under repair or maintenance, flaring increases. Energy needs for the project continue to rise
and EEPCI i s now beginning to use most associated gas for power generation.


7 1. Maximize the use o f freshwater gel-based mud systems, dispose of drilling muds in a manner that
minimizes the impact on the environment, reuse invert (diesel-based) muds, reuse drilling-mudpond decant
water, the reuse o f produced water for steam generation when steam i s used to stimulate reservoir production,
minimize gas flaring, and scrub sour gases.
'*In 2007 and until April 2008, flaring was above the target level o f 1.1 MSCFD defined in the Consortium's
License To Operate. ECMG (April-May 2009) has noted that since the Miandoum compression station has
become operative the Project the project has met the target level o f 1.1 MCFD/day
                                               62


44.     In 2005 ECMG reported a significant non-compliance with commitments made by
the project at the time o f the completion certificate issuance. In response to this observation,
EEPCI has revitalized and strengthened i t s dust control and mitigation program. This
program includes: (i) increase in paved road surface in the OFDA (a total o f 20.8
                       an
kilometers were paved in 2007 and 2008); and (ii) application o f molasses during the dry
                                                      the
season. Dust control along the spine road and in the OFDA appears now to be adequate and
compliant with project commitments.

45.     Liquid Effluents: Functioning systems for data collection and monitoring are in
place. Systems to treat and process waste are functioning according to guidelines detailed in
the EMP.

46.   Hazardous Materials and Wastes: Functioning systems for data collection and
monitoring are in place. Systems to treat and process waste are functioning according to
EMP guidelines.

47.      Solid Wastes: Waste management continues to be a challenge for the project,
especially at Kome. Volumes o f waste are considerably higher than estimated due to the lack
o f infrastructure and markets for scrap metal etc. in Chad. Hazardous waste incinerators
frequently break down and waste i s being stored in drums. Waste recycling and donation
programs appear to be effective. A Chadian company has been contracted to handle plastics
and food waste composting. The EMP team i s actively looking for new approaches to ensure
waste i s efficiently and cost-effectively processed.

48.     Health: From the human health perspective, malaria and HIV/AIDS are the big
concerns in both Chad and Cameroon. All employees and visitors are required to take
malaria medication unless they are determined to have immune status. In addition, there i s an
ongoing education program, which serves as a constant reminder o f the serious health effects
o f contracting malaria and HIV/AIDS. Employees are randomly checked to ensure that they
are taking the malaria medication.

49.    Safety: The Recordable Incident Rate captures even minor injury accidents, a broad
measure o f safety performance. In 2007 and 2008, project workers kept their historically l o w
recordable incident rate well below the average rate o f the petroleum industry as a whole.
The Year End 2008 rate o f 0.23 incidents per 200,000 working hours i s three times better
than U.S.petroleum industry average (based on reports from participating companies to the
American Petroleum Institute).

50.     Drinking Water: The project maintains a thorough water quality and quantity
monitoring system in both countries. This system includes: surface and groundwater
withdrawals in the OFDA, monitoring o f water for human consumption from project-
installed wells, regional groundwater monitoring in and around project facilities in both
countries, and groundwater monitoring at project solid waste landfill sites. A laboratory in
the Netherlands verifies water quality. N o problem areas have been identified.
                                                63


5 1.    Monitoring, records and reporting: At all levels o f record keeping and reporting,
efforts by the project have improved over time. ECMG has provided regular guidance and
suggestions on how to improve the system.

EMP-Defined Offsets: The Foundation for Environment and Development in Cameroon
52.   The creation o f FEDEC was proposed by the World Bank as an offset for OP 4.04
and OP 4.20. FEDEC would provide long-term financing to support the ongoing
management cost o f two new national parks, Campo Ma'an and Mbam and Djerem and the
implementation o f the IPP for BagyeliBakola (Pygmies) communities.

53.      COTCO provided initial seed money o f $3.5 million that would be managed as an
expendable endowment by a third-party fund investment manager. At design two important
assumptions were made: first, that this level o f investment would be sufficient to support the
two parks and the IPP for 28 years; and second, that FEDEC was expected to raise additional
funds from international donors. The design o f the investment portion o f FEDEC's
institutional structure was based on previous experiences undertaken with World Bank/GEF
resources. FEDEC has had no success in raising additional money, which may be due to the
foundation's perceived close association with ExxonMobil.

54.     Despite ongoing implementation challenges FEDEC's support has been extremely
important for both national parks and for the IPP. Prior to FEDEC's support, neither park had
a management plan or the resources to implement one. Mbam and Djerem National Park i s
managed by the World Conservation Society (WCS) and receives about $160,000 per year,
substantially more than what was estimated in the EMP. The additional costs are due to the
dollar devaluation, the provision o f budget for costs that were supposed to be met by the
government (park guard salaries), and to increased costs over time. WCS has devoted
considerable resources to working with local communities, pastoralists, and fishermen to
obtain their help in implementing the management plan. WCS i s also implementing
alternative livelihood programs, has partnerships with research institutes, and has established
agreements with logging companies and safari operators. Both these enterprises now provide
annual financial contributions to the park. The park employs 34 ecoguards that are paid by
WCS and the government o f Cameroon. Unfortunately, in 2008 WCS lost some o f i t s non-
FEDEC support, which i s affecting i t s ability to continue i t s operations at the park. There i s
also a disagreement over the use o f funds that were advanced by FEDEC.

55.      Campo Ma'an National Park i s managed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
and receives about $130,000 per year, which i s also more than originally estimated in the
EMP. Their current contract runs from January 2007 to December 2010. WWF works in four
main program areas: park protection, partnerships, bioecological monitoring, and
transboundary issues. WWF believes that the FEDEC support has been instrumental in i t s
ability to raise additional funds for the program. This may be another reason why donors
have not supported FEDEC directly because it's easier for them to directly support the actual
implementing organization.

56.    Since its creation, FEDEC has faced a number o f financial and management
challenges. In i t s January 2005 report, the ECMG described some o f the more important
problems faced by FEDEC, including the beginnings o f financial difficulties associated with
                                                64


the falling value o f the US. dollar against the CFA and the lack o f success in raising
additional funding from donors. Each succeeding ECMG report, along with observations
provided by the IAG and the project Inspection Panel, have highlighted ongoing financial
difficulties, i t s inability to raise funds, and its need to draw down capital to support i t s
operations. E C M G notes in i t s June 2008 report that the a m o y t drawn from the funds
exceeds what was foreseen by over $1.O million. The Inspection Panel noted that i t s budget
projections for the IPP program appeared to be inadequate to support the programmatic
elements o f the IPP. Finally, the FEDEC Evaluation Report o f October 2007, which looked
at the three programs in depth, including the preparation o f cost simulations, recommended
that FEDEC would require an additional $3.3 million to meet i t s long-term objectives.

57.     Over the past few years, IFC, COTCO, and the government o f Cameroon have
attempted to address the deteriorating financial situation. Discussions have been held and
proposals made to increase the endowment through additional capital inputs from both
COTCO and the IFC. At the time o f report preparation these discussions are continuing and a
draft action plan has been prepared. At the same time, FEDEC's situation continues to
worsen. The recent decline in world stock markets has further eroded i t s capital endowment.
COTCO has provided some interim funding to help operations, but a long-term solution has
not been agreed. One must question the commitment o f all the parties to finding a solution
considering the financial situation has worsened since 2005.

58.     The design o f FEDEC could have been better. Initial capitalization was inadequate
and that, coupled with FEDEC's inability to raise additional money, has contributed to its
ongoing financial difficulties. Limits on the drawdown should have been put in place. It also
appears that rate o f return estimates may have been too optimistic and there was no provision
on how to meet budget requirements during times when investments do not perform. If
additional resources are provided to the endowment, stricter controls should be placed on the
drawdown.

RELEVANCE
 59.     Objectives. At approval; the pipeline project's objectives were consistent with the
priorities o f the Country Assistance Strategies o f Chad and Cameroon. The project
represented a significant opportunity for Chad to develop i t s o i l resources and use the
revenues to finance expenditures in sectors with the potential to reduce poverty. This was
consistent with the Bank Group's country strategy o f increasing domestic revenues by
stimulating private sector-led growth through significant foreign direct investment. For
Cameroon, the project was expected to provide an additional source o f income for financing
priority development expenditures in the social sectors and rehabilitation o f basic
infrastructure, two key elements in the WBG's strategy for long-term growth and poverty
reduction in the country.

60.      The objectives were relevant in at least two ways. First, the project directly addressed
the issues o f private sector development and poverty reduction in both countries. Second, it
matched the Consortium's interest in exploiting and exporting o i l with governments' interest
in increasing fiscal revenues for priority sector expenditures with the potential for poverty
alleviation. However, as noted in the main text, the objectives did not include aspects o f
efficiency o f expenditures. Therefore, the relevance o f the PDOs i s rated modest.
                                                 65


61.     Design. The project's design ensured that the facilities would be successfully built
and operated with adequate safeguards and private sector involvement. Also, at appraisal,
special measures were taken to maximize the likelihood that most o f the additional
government revenues to Chad would be spent o n poverty reduction initiatives, namely, a
1999 law and the IDA-supported Petroleum Revenue Management Program that allocated
the revenues to expenditures on public health and social services, education, infrastructure,
rural development (agriculture and livestock), environmental protection, and water resources.
The P A D also listed two K P I s that set annual targets for oil-revenue-financed priority sector
expenditures in the two countries. However, as noted in the in main text, the emphasis on
inputs rather than results made the project design ineffective. The quality o f project design i s
rated modest.

62.    The project featured five layers o f externalhnternal monitoring, including the IAG
and ECMG. The multiple layers o f oversight have been useful for tracking the progress in a
transparent fashion.

63.     Overall, the project relevance is rated modest, based on modest ratings o f relevance
o f objectives and o f design

EFFICIENCY
64.     Economic Internal Rate o Return (EIRR). The NPV projected at completion (June
                                   f
2005, based o n the Bank's Implementation Completion Report) was $3,721 million versus
$1,417 million estimated at appraisal, that is, 162 percent higher. Chad's share ($1,884
million) i s 300 percent higher due to higher-than-expected o i l prices, but Cameroon's share
($1 12 million) i s 22 percent lower due to lower-than-expected o i l output. These estimates
were based on conservative assumptions about production and prices.

65.      Financial Rate o Return (FRR). For the purposes o f this evaluation, FRR was
                        f
estimated using a financial model. The FRR exceeded the W A C C (weighted average cost o f
capital) benchmark significantly, implying excellent investment returns for project financiers.

66.     Economic Rate o Return (ERR). In addition to the FRR, the ERR for the project was
                        f
computed using the financial model. L i k e the FRR, the high value o f ERR suggests that the
project has provided significant net economic benefits. As noted elsewhere, the FRR and ERR
measures do not take into account the distribution o f costs and benefits among stakeholders.

67.     With the unraveling o f the PRMP and the Bank's exit from the Chad portion o f the
project in August 2008, there is even greater uncertainty n o w about the judicious use o f o i l
revenues for poverty reduction purposes. Even when the Petroleum Revenue Management
Program was in force, the government o f Chad had expanded the scope o f the priority sectors
to include security and territorial administration and eliminated the Future Generations Fund.
The government o f Chad undertook these actions unilaterally, without inputs from the
development partners.

68.    Overall, efficiency o f the project i s rated high.

EFFICACY
69.    Project Development Objectives. The project's efficacy in achieving the core PDOs i s
rated modest.

Objective 1: To develop the Doba oilfields in order to increase thefiscal revenues of
Cameroon and Chad available for priority poverty reduction expenditures

70.     Chad. The achievement o f this objective was modest in Chad. Though o i l production
started earlier than planned, the 8 1 million barrels per year target was not (and will not be)
achieved73due to production setbacks on account o f unfavorable geological conditions. Price
discounts for Chad o i l with respect to the Brent marker crude was about $10-1 5 per barrel.
However, these adverse factors were more than offset by higher-than-projected crude prices,
on average $39.2 (2003-08) versus $16.4 per barrel.

71.     By end-2008, Chad's share o f project revenues had reached $4,383 million,74
implying an average annual revenue o f $835 million for the operational phase (Q4-2003 to
44-2008), a much higher level than expected at appraisal, thanks to high o i l prices.
Cumulative oil revenues in Chad are close to three times the levels anticipated at appraisal
for the entire l i f e o f the project.75As noted in the main text (Table 3), however, during the
2004-07 period, the share o f expenditures going to priority sectors amounted to 53 percent o f
the total, well short o f the expected 70 percent at approval. (See the annex on the PRMP for a
fuller discussion o f the public expenditure aspects o f the program.)

72.     Cameroon. The achievement o f this objective was modest in Cameroon. According to
EEPCI's production figures, 288.3 million barrels o f o i l has been exported so far (Q4-2003 to
Q4-2008), implying estimated transit fees o f $1 18.2 million and total revenues o f $177
million76for the operational phase. This leads to an annual average o f $22.5 million, well
short o f the $40 million per year expected at appraisal. As noted earlier, the o i l revenue
shortfall in Cameroon has been due to the lower-than-expected production levels stemming
from well productivity problems.

Objective 2: To carry out the oil development and transportprogram in an
environmentally and socially sound manner

73.     The achievement o f this objective was substantial in both countries. The pipeline
project has been challenging from an environmental and social perspective, comprising
sensitive and complex aspects related to selection o f the pipeline corridor, land use and

73. Oil production peaked in 2005 at 63 million barrels for the year.
74. These figures are based on the latest Esso-Chad project update ("Project Update #25, Annual report 2008)
from i t s Web site.
75. The pipeline project was expected to generate total government revenues o f about $1.677 billion over the
life o f the project (28 years).
76. As per the project agreement, Cameroon receives 41c per barrel, which leads to estimates o f total transit
fees (transit fees make up about 66 percent o f Cameroon's project revenues. Income tax and dividends from
COTCO are additional sources o f revenues) o f $1 18.2 million (288.3 x 0.41 x 1000000) and total revenues o f
$177.4 million (1 18.2/0.66) for the operational phase (44-2003 to 44-2008).
                                                            67


impacts to both terrestrial and marine habitats as a result o f pipeline construction, oil spill
prevention, control o f air emissions and liquid effluents, and a multitude o f socioeconomic
impacts including involvement o f indigenous communities and cultural resources in two
African countries. Extensive GIS work was undertaken to select the optimal pipeline route to
follow main road and railroad routes for minimum disturbance o f protected and
environmentally sensitive areas like Deng Deng forest in Cameroon. The project properly
addressed the effects o f construction on indigenous peoples, optimizing the pipeline corridor
through Cameroon's Atlantic Littoral Forest to avoid Pygmy settlements in Bakola/Bageli.

74.     During the operations phase, EEPCI, COTCO, and the TOTCO have performed well
in meeting EMP requirements and Bank safeguards, particularly for health and safety,
emissions, water management, solid waste management, and o i l spill response planning and
implementation. O i l spill response plans (EEPCI's) and equipment at drilling sites, pump
stations, and the unloading bay in the Kribi tanker terminal are adequate. The malaria
prevention program has cut the malaria infection rate among employees over the past six
years (2002-08) by a factor o f 40-reducing the rate recorded in 2008 to only 2.5 percent of
the 2002 rate. Compensation and resettlement programs in both countries have achieved
mixed results, but overall have functioned as intended. The same can be said o f the EMP
defined offsets (FEDEC), which have had difficulties meeting EMP defined goals. Project
monitoring organizations (ECMG, IAG, and the IFC Environment and Social Department)
have reported on these implementation difficulties in a comprehensive way, which has led to
technical changes in program implementation.

75.     Evidence from ECMG, IAG, and the IEG mission (February 2009) suggests that the
project complies with relevant national ESHS laws and regulations and applicable WBG
environmental and health and safety policies and guidelines. Environmental management,
communication with stakeholders including WBG, and supervision o f compliance with EMP
during the project was successfully delegated to D'Appolonia, an Italian consulting firm that
took the responsibilities o f the ECMG.

77.      Direct effects on beneficiaries: Over and above the government spending o f o i l
revenues, the pipeline project generated significant direct benefits to the two economies, such
as employment, training, supplier development, compensation (individual and community),
infrastructure improvements, and community investments by the Consortium. Given the
overall paucity o f state capacity in the two countries-more so in Chad than Cameroon-for
program execution and service delivery, the project played (and continues to play) a critical
role in the lives o f communities around the project.

78.     Employment and training:,Employment o f nationals peaked at just under 10,000
(4,166, or 42 percent, in Chad and 5,796, or 58 percent in Cameroon) during the construction
phase in 2002. At end-2008, the project employed 6,409 people, with 5,246 (82 percent) in
Chad and 1,163 (18 percent) in Cameroon. These figures reflect the fact that during the
construction phase o f the project, most o f the employment came from building the pipeline in
Cameroon, whereas during the operational phase, most o f the employment relates to oil
production-related work in the OFDA in Chad. O f this workforce, nationals (Chadians and
Cameroonians) held over 88 percent (Chad, 87 percent; Cameroon, 92 percent) o f the
project's direct employment o f 6,409 jobs. (For comparison, 87 percent o f the ExxonMobil
workforce in Nigeria at year-end 2008 i s national.) The high participation rate o f nationals in
the workforce i s also consistent with ExxonMobil's goal o f workforce nationalization in host
countries. Almost 70 percent o f the Chadians and Cameroonians working for the project held
skilled or semi-skilled positions at end-2008. The project has provided significant
opportunities for transfer o f knowledge to Chadians and Cameroonians through formal
training and on-the-job experience.

79.      Compensation: Since the project began (to end-2008), a total o f over 12 billion
FCFA (nearly 19.7 million; 53 percent in Chad and 47 percent in Cameroon) in individual
compensation (cash and in-kindpayments) has been paid. The project has also undertaken
community compensation programs with in-kindmicro-development programs that benefit
entire communities affected by the project. In Cameroon, for example, the project has
supported about 350 community projects (to end-2008) such as school classrooms,
community houses, market shelters, latrines, water wells, and soccer fields. Since most o f the
project facilities have been completed in both countries, compensation-like employment-
has stabilized below the 2000-03 period when the central oil facilities, initial oil
development, and the Export System were constructed. In Chad, ongoing Compensation
relates to land needed for new wells for increasing o i l production. In Cameroon, where
construction ended in 2002, current compensation activities relate to the resolution o f
outstanding grievances and maintenance or facilities improvements.

80.     Community investments: The project has made a number o f community donations in
Chad and Cameroon. Since the beginning o f the project (to end-2008), the project's total
contributions to community investment-health clinics, school classrooms, etc.-have
totaled about $12.25 million. Esso-Chad, the project operator, also provides logistical support
for the national polio vaccination days and distributes mosquito bed nets in Chad.

8 1.   Infrastructure improvements: In connection with the project, improvement or
construction o f 900 kilometers o f roads has been undertaken in the two countries. The project
also built a major bridge connecting the two countries across the Mbere River. The project
                                                     69


also refurbishedover 200 Cameroonian national railway cars and six locomotives. The
project funded and installed fiber optic cable with the pipeline during project construction.
Cameroon has used the cable to allow phone and Internet connectivity to many parts of
Northern Cameroon.

82.     Private sector development: Given the enclave nature o f the petroleum sector in
Chad, i t s impact on the domestic economy has been limited (more detailed analysis i s being
done on the project's impacts on the non-oil sector). The project has strengthened private
sector activity in the two countries, despite the challenging investment. (In the 2009 Doing
Business report, Chad ranked near the bottom, at 175 out o f 18 1 economies. Cameroon fared
slightly better, with a rank o f 164.) During construction, the project maintained a database o f
Chadian businesses ranging in size from one-person outfits to the state-owned water and
electric utility company. O f the close to 3,000 businesses covered in the database,
approximately 2,000 have done business with the project at least once during the construction
phase and about 450 work for the project on a regular basis. Overall, enterprises working for
the project tend to improve their business practices, ranging from a firmer grasp o f tendering
and bidding processes, a better understanding o f expectations about quality control and
timeliness o f deliveries, and a greater appreciation o f general business management. The
building o f the pipeline has also increased the economic value o f other o i l reserves in Chad
and has made exploration more attractive.

83.      Chad SMEprogram: IFC launched the Chad Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)
Initiative in June 2000 as a linkage project to support the pipeline project. The initiative
aimed to expand the participation o f local businesses in the economic activity generated by
the project, in particular, to help the expansion o f the private sector in Chad through the
development and support o f SMEs. W h i l e the project had less traction with EEPCI during
the construction phase (2000-03), there was a realignment o f interests between EEPCI's need
for local content during the operational phase and the revamped activities o f the Chad SME
program. The program currently consists o f four components: entrepreneurship capacity
building, business linkages, access to finance, and business enabling environment. The focal
point o f the IFC Advisory Services operations in Chad i s the Enterprise Center that IFC
founded in November 2005-as a Business Linkage component-in partnership with the
Chamber o f Commerce o f Chad. In 2005, EEPCI decided to carry out all i t s procurement
needs (about $300 million annually) in Chad electronically through i t s e-procurement system.
The Enterprise Center has become the key tool for EEPCI to build a diverse local supplier
network to meet some o f i t s procurement needs locally, as part o f the effort to build national
content. By purchasing goods and services in-country and developing long-term supplier
relationships, EEPCI has supported the development o f the local private sector. The
project's purchases o f goods and services from local suppliers have totaled over $1.9 billion
since the project began (to end-2008). In Chad, the estimated spending to date i s more than
$1.2 billion and in Cameroon, about $69 1 million."



77. These local spending figures include three types o f business: purely local (owned and operated by
ChadiansICameroonians), purely foreign (owned and operated by foreigners such as Schlumberger, KBR,
others), andjoint ventures between local and foreign firms.

R I S K S TO DEVELOPMENT
                      OUTCOME

84.      With the unraveling o f the PRMP and the withdrawal o f the WI3 from the Chad
portion o f the project, risks to development outcome are substantial. The government o f
Chad is now under no compulsion to channel resources to priority sectors as before, which
had the potential to reduce poverty and improve the lives o f the Chadian people. With regard
to the environmental and social aspects o f the project, risks to development outcome are
moderate. E C M G will continue to monitor the project for I F C and other lenders over the l i f e
o f the loan (until 2013). However, with the winding up o f CTSCN and the withdrawal o f the
Bank from the Chad portion o f the project, there is no institutional capacity in the
government o f Chad to track the environmental and social aspects o f the project.

85.      The biggest risk to development outcome is the failure to allocate enough revenues to
priority sector expenditures for poverty reduction. In Chad especially, the capacity for
economic management is (and is expected to remain) weak, after the failure o f the IDA
Petroleum Economy Management Project. Government commitment has proven highly fickle
on budget priorities and the allocation o f petroleum proceeds. Unrest and wars in the region
are putting both under a lot o f stress. From the environmental perspective, both countries
failed to live up to their commitments regarding the necessary strengthening o f capacity for
environmental policy and monitoring. Environmental management through compliance with
the EMP has been met by the private companies, EEPCI, COTCO, and TOTCO. Currently,
these three companies, along with E C M G and IAG, are doing the environmental monitoring
o f activities associated with o i l production and transportation.

86.     With the private sector in control, especially the current high-caliber operators,
technical and production risks appear modest and can be managed. Energy infrastructure i s
seldom left to deteriorate and, unlike in many other infrastructure sectors, in the petroleum
sector prices are set on a strictly commercial basis. Geological risks will continue to exist,
but despite the production shortfall in Doba, other fields have been (and perhaps will be)
developed as their commercial potential is boosted by the proximity o f the pipeline and the
prospect o f high crude prices.

87.      In the case o f Cameroon, risks to development outcome are moderate, given that the
project had a relatively minor impact in Cameroon to begin with, due to the shortfalls in o i l
production on account o f unexpected reservoir and well productivity problems. As in the case
o f Chad, E C M G will continue to monitor the environmental and social aspects o f the project
in Cameroon. Also, given the unsatisfactory performance o f the environmental management
capacity building project (CAPACE) in Cameroon, institutional capacity to monitor
environmental and social effects i s limited. With the closing o f the CAPACE project, the WI3
and government o f Cameroon are no longer interacting o n project-level environmental and
social issues.

World Bank Group Performance

QUALITY    AT   ENTRY
88.     The project's quality at entry i s rated moderately satisfactory, due to shortfalls in
project design and definition o f objectives. The project featured significant collaboration
between World Bank and IFC. The WBG chose to undertake a high-risk (and potentially
high-reward) operation in a sector where i t s financing and safeguards policies have been (and
are) very restrictive. WBG was also able to help maximize project relevance and design
while financing only about 3 percent o f the cost. At entry, it was considered highly
innovative to tie a petroleum project's revenues to poverty reduction objectives, as a brave
new economic experiment to deal with the "resource curse" phenomenon, despite the
shortfalls in project design noted elsewhere. Preparation was thorough, including due
diligence on project costs and production potential, upfront agreements in key areas such as
the EMP, innovative supervision arrangements, and an earmarking o f benefits in Chad that
became law in 1999.

89.    A critical risk to the project, relating directly to i t s sustainability and i t s potential to
maximize development impact, was the weak capacity o f Chadian and, to a lesser extent,
Cameroonian institutions. The three IDA-fundedcapacity-building projects (two in Chad,
one in Cameroon) were formulated to address these weaknesses.

90.     The project was appropriately screened to Category A. An extensive Environmental
Impact Assessment was prepared by the client to address alternatives for the pipeline
corridor, selection o f the preferred right-of-way, land use and habitat modification,
socioeconomic impacts, effects o f construction on indigenous peoples, and emergency
response and o i l spill contingency plans for the entire pipeline and drilling project. The EIA
became the basis for the 19-volume Environmental Management Plan to be followed during
implementation. During preparation the client indicated that it would not apply Bank
safeguards but would be obligated to use the EMP to deal with the environmental and social
impacts that would result from i t s activities.

91.     Prior to appraisal, the EMP was reviewed by the IFC and WB and revisions were
undertaken resulting in changes such as the rerouting o f the pipeline to avoid
environmentally sensitive areas and the creation o f nature reserves to offset the unavoidable
impairment to the environment that the project would cause. Specifically, the pipeline route
was modified to avoid crossing the Mbere Rift Valley and the Deng Deng forest in
Cameroon. Crossing the Atlantic Littoral Forest could not be avoided, but the pipeline route,
which roughly paralleled an existing road, was optimized to minimize damage to areas with
high biodiversity. In addition, the Consortium agreed to provide funds to support the
development and implementation o f management plans for two protected areas in Cameroon
to offset any residual biodiversity impacts as well as the IPP.

92.     The EMP provided the relevant guidelines that would govern the construction and
operation phases and incorporates IFC/WB environmental and social safeguards relating to
natural habitats, indigenous peoples, cultural properties, and involuntary resettlement. The
EMP covers crucial aspects including induced access to sensitive areas, solid waste
                                                        72


management, compensation and resettlement, in-migration, o i l spill response plans, and
health and safety.

93.     The E M P has served as the key guiding document for the E C M G and the IFC's
environmental and social specialists assigned to the project as well as the Consortium. The
EMP was an excellent tool during the construction phase but has faced a number o f
challenging circumstances during the operational phase. In 2005, Exxon began an in-fill
drilling program to enhance well productivity''. This program will increase the number o f
wells in the O F D A by up to 400, thereby increasing the overall size o f the project's footprint.
This activity was not foreseen in the EIA, and it i s unclear how the EMP can be used as
guidance for this drilling program. The I F C i s n o w evaluating its options, including
requesting that the E M P be amended. I F C also helped introduce improvements to the
concession agreements to reduce possibilities o f disputes and ensure fairness.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

94.    The quality o f supervision is rated satisfactory. There was an implicit division o f
labor between the WB and IFC, with the WB particularly focused on the implementation o f
Chad's PRMP and the three capacity-building projects, while I F C dealt with the technical,
financial and aspects o f the pipeline project. I F C handled the relationship with the project
and the other commercial lenders while the World Bank managed the relationship with the
government.

95.    The project featured three innovations to strengthen project supervision: the
Committee on the Monitoring and Oversight o f Petroleum Resources to monitor the
management and expenditures o f o i l revenues; E C M G to report to I F C on the operational
work by the Consortium and both governments; and IAG to advise the World Bank president
and the two governments. This additional oversight made supervision more effective and
transparent but was costly at about $1.O million per year.

96.      IFC's supervision o f the project's environmental and social aspects has been
consistent and extensive. Supervision is carried out in close coordination with the World
Bank and the ECMG, which focuses i t s efforts on reviewing the projects compliance with the
EMP. As part o f the project completion requirements, the E C M G certified that the project's
construction phase complied with the EMP. Given the extent and importance o f
environmental and social issues, specialized consultants were engaged to provide
independent opinion and expert knowledge o n ongoing environmental and social impacts.
I F C worked closely with these consultants to ensure that emerging issues were addressed in a
timely and decisive manner. Supervision visits by environmental and social specialists were
carried out regularly in coordination with their counterpart consultants resulting in a close
and trusting dialogue with the experts. The frequency o f these site visits was much higher
than normal (at least twice a year during project construction). The Independent Advisory
Group (IAG) that advises the WBG on project issues, including those that impede
achievement o f the project's broader development objectives, has also supported supervision

78Based on information from the ECMG reports from 2005, among other sources, IFC considers that the infill
drilling began in 2005, whereas EEPCI states that the infill drilling began in mid-2008, and the additional wells
drilled between 2003 and 2008 were development wells within the original 40-acre well-spacing pattern.
                                              73


efforts through independent verification o f problematic issues including those characterized
as environmental and social.

97.     During the operational phase, the IFC's Environment and Social Department has: (i)
ensured mitigation o f archeology-related Level I11non-compliance in Cameroon; (ii)    ensured
the recommendations from the Barkley-Koppert report on EEPCI Resettlement and
Compensation Activities are acted upon including the implementation o f the Land Use
Management Action Plan (LUMAP); (iii)        assessed and developed an action plan to meet the
ongoing financial and operational challenges being faced by the Foundation for Environment
and Development in Cameroon (FEDEC); and (iv) worked closely with the ECMG in
evaluating all environmental and social issues and following up with the Consortium when
actions are required. The Environmental and Social Department has also closely monitored
the project's activities in areas in and around indigenous Pygmy communities in Southern
Cameroon and has provided ongoing inputs and guidance to FEDEC's program with the
local NGO, RAPID. IFC's environmental and social specialists have also followed up with
EEPCI, TOTCO, and COTCO on health and safety issues during both the construction and
operational phases.

98.     Regarding FEDEC,the E C M G first identified administrative and financial issues
during i t s December 2004 monitoring visit. During the November 2005 monitoring visit, a
number o f critical observations were made, among them:

       N o additional funds had been raised and no new donor support had been achieved in
       the preceding 12 months.
       Cooperation between FEDEC and the government o f Cameroon was lacking and had
       not improved.
       FEDEC's financial constraints had been further exacerbated by the fall o f the U.S.
       dollar against the CFA Franc.

99.     These issues and others have continued to be problems for FEDEC. An extensive
evaluation undertakenin October 2007 analyzed the institutional challenges faced by FEDEC
and recommended a plan o f action. Nevertheless, by the end o f 2008, the problems appear to
have worsened and are s t i l l unresolved despite efforts by IFC and the Consortium to find
solutions.

100.   Overall, World Bank Group performance i s rated moderately satisfactory.

              ROLE
WORLD BANKGROUP

101. WBG role and contribution were in three main areas: mobilize long-term financing
from commercial sources; instill confidence in the project's arrangements and operation; and
raise the standard and quality o f the project's environmental and social due diligence. It
helped raise the standard and quality o f the environmental assessments, mitigation plans, and
public consultations and disclosure undertaken by the project. When needed, the WBG
helped support Chad's regulatory and supervisory functions on the project while trying to
build the country's capacity to perform these functions. The WBG was also involved in
mediating the ongoing dialogue between Chad and the Consortium, particularly on
contentious issues such as the quality discount to Doba o i l price and measurement o f sales
                                                 74


volumes. However, the main thrust o f the World Bank Group's role and contribution to the
project relate mainly to political risk mitigation, particularly in terms o f trying to improve
governance and building institutional capacity. Following the W B ' s withdrawal from the
Chad portion o f the project, IFC's role has been enhanced and become more critical,
especially regarding environmental and social issues.

Borrower and Client Performance

 102. Overall, borrower performance i s rated moderately satisfactory, with some
shortcomings (discussed below). The governments' performance was moderately
satisfactory. Both countries showed project ownership in many ways at the outset; for
example, they secured the pipeline right-of-way and Chad passed the Petroleum Management
Revenue Law in 1999. They were also very cooperative in the design and implementation o f
the physical project arrangements. However, neither government fulfilled agreements for
establishing and continuously providing support for competent environmental and social
monitoring structures. Cameroon's performance i s rated satisfactory, Chad's i s moderately
unsatisfactory because o f its breach o f the Loan Agreement on revenue allocation in 2006
and the ultimate unraveling o f the Petroleum Revenue Management Program in 2008.

103. The implementing agency (EEPCI) performance i s rated satisfactory during both the
construction and operations phases. EEPCI was very efficient in project execution,
monitoring, and problem-solving, in particular, replacing the Consortium partners who
dropped out, filling the financing gap after the bond issue f e l l through, and getting rid o f the
excess water in the pipeline. I t cooperated with the governments and the Bank, applying
Bank guidelines on procurement for jointly financed components and for the EMP.

104. The client has adhered to the requirements o f the EMP and has been cooperative in
providing access to information required by the various monitoring and supervision entities:
ECMG, IAG, and IFC. Reporting to third parties and IFC has been comprehensive,
descriptive, and transparent, but despite a massive information dissemination program, some
local stakeholders s t i l l felt that more communication was needed. The client has also
facilitated work by consultants such as R. Barkley and G. Koppert who preparedthe report
on EEPCI Resettlement and Compensation Activities. Apart from the mitigation activities
required by the EMP, the client has an ongoing donations program funded from i t s own
resources for communities living near the facilities in both Cameroon and Chad. This
program includes construction projects such as water wells, schools, and community centers
along with donations o f wood and other construction materials.

 105. Although some issues continue to be problematic, the client has had reasonable
success in mitigating most o f the environmental and social impacts o f i t s activities,
considering the size and complexity o f the project. Some o f the most important examples are:
(i) s o i l spill response management system, which includes automatic shutoff to reduce the
   it
quantity o f spills and quick response by specialized spill clean-up specialists; (ii)s efforts to
                                                                                        it
reduce well pad size and return land to farmers; (iii)s active participation in the pipeline
                                                        it
steering committee in Cameroon; (iv) i t s efforts to assist in finding a solution to FEDEC's
financial problems; and (v) its efforts to revise the resettlement and compensation program in
Chad based on the recommendations o f the BarkleyKoppert report.
                                                75


 106. The client has been responsive to close supervision by and continued dialogue with
IFC and the ECMG, leading to early identification o f emerging issues and satisfactory
mitigation o f impacts according to best practice, the EMP and World Bank Group policies
and guidelines. At the same time, the client has been steadfast in i t s opposition to suggested
changes in the EMP-proposed by IFC and supported by the ECMG-related to the in-fill
drilling program and the dramatic increase in the project's footprint in Chad. The client
believes that it i s legally bound to the required actions detailed in the EMP and new issues
that have emerged can be addressed by changes in the implementation procedures (internal
execution procedures) without the need to change the EMP principles which have been
defined at the beginning o f the project. W h i l e the client has provided the necessary resources
to implement the Land Use Management Action Plan (LUMAP), ECMG, IAG, and IFC have
serious concerns about the livelihood impacts on villages o f the in-filldrilling program and
the dramatic increase in land use by the project for wells, flow lines, roads, etc. I t i s unclear
how the potential need for in-fill drilling was not identified in the EIA considering that this i s
a fairly common practice.

107. The number o f non-compliances over the past few years has fallen from 49 in 2005 to
17 in 2008. For the second half o f 2008, project environmental monitors recorded 7
Environmental Management Plan non-compliance situations, 3 in the third quarter and 4 in
the fourth quarter. Two o f the non-compliances were categorized as Level I1 situations. There
were no Level 1 1situations. Two spills occurred during this reporting period (EEPCI 2008).
                1

 108. The client has also maintained fairly good relations with local NGOs. Representatives
o f COTCO (Cameroon) participate in the work o f the Pipeline Steering and Monitoring
Committee (PSMC), which consists o f project stakeholders, including NGOs. Most o f the
committee's work involves grievances from individuals and communities that date back to
the construction period. W h i l e mechanisms such as the Platform for Cooperation and Social
Assessment (COTCO-PSMC-NGO) are in place to fairly and transparently resolve
grievances, some cases remain unresolved. COTCO has indicated that they will continue to
work to resolve pending cases but recognizes that in some cases other parties (contractors
and subcontractors) bear the responsibility. In Chad, grievance issues are generally taken up
directly with EEPCI through the EMP office. The government's participation through the
Comite Technique National de Suivi et de Contrde (CTNSC) ended in 2006. EEPCI reports
that complaints are at their lowest level since the operations phase began in 2003.
Annex B. Cameroon: Petroleum Environment Capacity
Enhancement Project (Credit 3372-CM)

Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons

1.      The CAPECE Project i s part o f a cluster o f technical assistance (TA) and advisory
projects financed by the WB and IFC that supported capacity building related to the Chad-
Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project (PDPP). The objectives o f the
CAPECE Project were to establish national capacity for the environmental management and
monitoring o f the PDPP and to ensure the environmental sustainability o f future projects,
programs, and policies in Cameroon's petroleum sector, including the establishment o f the
necessary regulatory fiamework. The project was consistent with the Cameroon Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which highlighted the accelerated development o f oil, gas, and
mineral resources as a key strategic goal for the country, to be carried out in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner.

MAINFINDINGS
2.      Based on modest ratings for relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, overall project
outcome i s rated unsatisfactory. Serious project delays meant that the government's Pipeline
Steering and Monitoring Committee (PSMC) was not able to independently monitor
construction o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline between 2000 and 2003. Instead, during that
period, Exxon self-regulated while the External Compliance Monitoring Group (ECMG)
conducted monitoring on behalf o f IFC. The PSMC and i t s three field u n i t s have been
strengthened through equipment and training, as well as the initial operations o f the
Environmental Management Information System (EMIS), but effective national capacity for
regulation and monitoring has not yet been mainstreamed across the concerned sector
ministries (notably the Ministry o f Environment), as intended.

3.       The PSMC continues to operate within the management and reporting structure o f the
Socie`te` Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH), the national o i l company, potentially risking
conflicts o f interest and compromising i t s independence. Thus, although the recently
established Consultative Platform-including PSMC, COTCO, other government ministries,
and NGOs-has proven useful in sharing information and airing grievances at i t s annual or
semi-annual meetings, the close affiliation with S H could weaken PSMC's ability to
                                                     N
resolve social the grievances that continued long after the completion o f pipeline construction
in 2003.

4.      Government support at entry and i t s commitment during implementation have been
weak. Twelve decrees have been prepared under the project to enforce the 1996 Cameroon
Environment Code. However, only the Decree on Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)
has been approved, while the rest have been awaiting the Prime Minister's approval for
several years. The critically important National O i l Spill Response Plan (NORSP) has also
not been approved. Although PSMC has developed a stronger coordinating and facilitating
role among the PDPP stakeholders, COTCO i s s t i l l self-regulating to a significant extent.
This arrangement was tested and proved unsatisfactory during the 2008 oil spill, when
                                                77

external communication was seriously delayed and the extent and potential impacts of the
spill were not known for several days, at possible peril to the residents at Kribi.

LESSONS
5.       Significant lessons from the project are as follows:

         Setting PDOs: When seeking to improve capacity from a l o w base, project
         expectations need to be realistic and may prove to be counterproductive if they are
         too ambitious in their scope. In this project, the focus should have been on the
     '
         immediate and already highly complex needs o f the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline, rather
         than seeking to improve the vastly more challenging environmental and social
         safeguards capacity o f the country as a whole.
         Packaging o TA components: A TA project with a relatively small outlay needs to
                      f
         avoid the temptation to package together too many interventions at multiple levels,
         which can result in expending a disproportionate amount o f attention and energy on
         procurement and logistics. In this project, the large number o f sub-components was
         all the more difficult to handle due to lack o f familiarity and experience with Bank
         procedures.
         Leveraging o investments and timing: Capacity-building operations can work in a
                       f
         complementary manner with investment projects. W h i l e such operations are
         necessary to strengthen the overall policy and institutional framework, the investment
         projects associated with them could transform these policies into actions on the
         ground while providing hands-on experience to the concerned institutions and staff.
         However, those TA projects should start several years ahead o f the investment
         projects, given the long lead times associated with capacity building.

The Project
OBJECTIVES, COMPONENTS, AND COSTS

6.      According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the CAPECE Project's
objectives were:

         to help develop and establish a national capacity for the environmental management
         and monitoring o f the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project
         (PDPP); and
         to help ensure the environmental sustainability o f future projects, programs, and
         policies in the petroleum sector, including strengthening the capacity to mitigate the
         negative social and environmental impacts o f the PDPP and the establishment o f an
         environmental regulatory framework for the petroleum sector.

7.       The project objectives and associated outcome targets (discussed in the Efficacy
section) were not revised during implementation. There were two amendments to the DCA,
the first dated March 24,2004, and the second dated December 13,2005. The amendments
dealt with changes in the project schedule, procurement arrangements, budget reallocation, as
                                                78


well as the schedule for meeting the performance indicators. According to the DCA,79the
key indicators included:

     e   publication o f environmental decrees in the borrower's Official Journal by December
         3 1, 2001, and training o f officials in this new regulatory framework;
     e   completion o f a Long-term Vision Study for an effective and sustainable regulatory
         framework for the petroleum sector by July 1, 2004, and an assessment o f the
         application o f this framework;
     e   publication and adoption o f a government O i l Spill Response Plan by July 1, 2002;
         and
     e   an Environmental Management Information System (EMIS), as well as a project
         management and M&E system, in place and fully operational by July 1,2001.

8.       The project's components were as follows:

Implementation Experience

10.      Key Dates. The project's effectiveness was delayed by nine months after Board
approval due to the government's delays in meeting the conditions o f effectiveness. A 15
percent disbursement rate was reached only at the start o f 2004, when the pipeline
investments were already completed and operational. The project's closing date was also
delayed to November 30, 2007, nearly two years after the original closing date, mainly due to
the delays in staffing the three field units and PSMC's lack o f knowledge regarding Bank
procurement, financial reporting, and other procedures, which slowed down the completion
o f project activities, notably the Long-Term Vision Study (the project's second development
objective).

11.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The indicators for the objective were in the
form o f outputs rather than outcomes. These indicators include progress in the
implementation o f decrees and regulations; the identification and monitoring o f
environmental standards and norms; and the training o f staff. The EMP did not have
adequate targets that could be reflected in the M&E design. The project commissioned a
socioeconomic study in 2003 and gathered baseline data, which were used later in a similar
study for 2005-07, but no significant follow-up actions on these studies have been reported.

12.     Environmental and Social Safeguards. The project was classified as Category "C"
under the Bank's safeguard policies, since it was a TA project that would have no adverse
impacts on the physical and social environment. N o safeguard issues arose during project
implementation. While this TA support project focused on strengthening the government's
capacity, the actual environmental and social outcomes by Exxon and i t s affiliates," who
implemented the pipeline project, and the performance ratings and findings o f IFC, who
supervised the project, are discussed in Annex A. That assessment covers the results o f
Environmental Management Plan, the Indigenous Peoples' Plan, the compensation outcomes,
the continuing risks presented by the weaknesses o f FEDECS1   and i t s lack o f funding, the
new risks presented by EEPCI's plans for a significantly expanded in-fill drilling program,
and the findings and recommendations o f the high-level agenciess2that monitored the
environmental and social aspects o f the PDPP over the past eight years.

13.     Fiduciary Aspects. The project's use o f funds was low during the three first years.
Internal budget controls were weak and the accounting system was not fully operational
while the commitment and availability o f staff was inadequate. However, PSMC regularly
provided financial and audit reports with some improvements over time in their content and
format.

implement the Indigenous Peoples' Plan for the Bagyelfiakola (pygmy) communities, as well develop and
manage two new national parks (Campo Ma'an Park and Mbam-Djerem Park) over the long term.

Advisory Group, financed by the World Bank.

14.    Procurement. Procurement was very complex for a project o f this size, involving 33
transactions for consulting services and 22 for purchasing o f equipment. Procurement f e l l
behind schedule because o f unrealistic plans, lack o f experienced staff, inadequate
monitoring o f the delivery time, the absence o f submission o f performance security by the
contractors and insufficient response time granted to prepare bids for N C B contracts.

RELEVANCE
 15.     Objectives. While strengthening the national capacity for independent monitoring o f
the Chad-Cameroon pipeline is critically important, the formulation o f the first objective l e f t
open the option o f concentrating this capacity building o n the PSMC. The PSMC was created
by decree in 1997 and remains within the Socie`te` Nationale d'Hydrocarbures (SNH), the
national o i l company, in an apparent conflict o f interest. While S N H (and PSMC by
affiliation) i s mandated to look after the country's o i l interests, the CAPECE Project was
supposed to build the government's capacity to supervise and monitor objectively the
implementation o f the EMP for the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project. From the start o f the
appraisal this has been a highly contentious issue between the Bank and the government
because the direct and subsidiary relationship o f PSMC with S H has repeatedly cast doubt
                                                                       N
over PSMC's independence. Moreover, the first objective was also formulated to assume that
the national monitoring capacity could be in place in time for the construction o f the pipeline,
a goal that was clearly impossible to implement given the very l o w level o f capacity that
existed when the project was appraised. The second objective was formulated too broadly to
cover the government's capacity to manage the overall environmental and social impacts o f
the petroleum sector in Cameroon, extending significantly beyond the urgent focus on the
monitoring needs for the pipeline. This led to an overly ambitious project design, which
proved difficult to implement in a country with l i t t l e interest or capacity in environmental
management. The relevance o f the first objective i s substantial, while that o f the second
objective i s modest, leading to an overall modest rating for the relevance o f the PDOs.

 16.    Design. The project design recognized the l o w level o f expertise for environmental
management and limited capacity to absorb new training for this purpose. However, the
project design was ambitious in assuming that a quantum improvement could be achieved
through programming a large number o f activities that would be carried out with the help o f
international consultants. The government's commitment was overestimated, even though it
was not initially persuaded o f the usefulness o f the project and needed to be convinced by the
international community and the international operators. The project design underestimated
the risk that PSMC would not always ensure adequate budgetary resources as well as their
transparent and efficient allocation. The likelihood o f an Advisory Panel being employed was
also overestimated (it was canceled), given that the government previously had been
reluctant to create a similar advisory panel for the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The quality o f
project design i s rated modest.

17.     The project's overall relevance is modest, based o n modest ratings for relevance o f
objectives and design.
                                                    82


EFFICIENCY
18.     Under the Bank's operational guidelines, an ERR i s not required for technical
assistance projects. However, given the long time delays and cost overrun, the efficiency o f
the project i s considered modest.

EFFICACY
19.      The project's overall efficacy i s rated modest, based on the assessment below for each
o f the development objectives.

Objective One: to assist the Borrower to develop and establish a national capacityfor the
environmental management and monitoring o the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum
                                              f
Development and Pipeline Project.

20.     The project's first objective was achieved only to a modest extent. Given the project
delays, it was not possible for the PSMC to have a fully independent monitoring capability to
assess environmental and social compliance o f the EMP during construction phase. This
affected the government's performance during the entire construction period. The pipeline
project's compliance with the World Bank Group's safeguard policies, as well as i t s
adherence to standards and norms required under the EMP are assessed in Annex A.

21.     In 2007/08, which represents a significant delay since the pipeline was already
constructed in 2003, a Consultative Platform comprisin PSMC, several ministries
(Environment, Infrastructure, Health), and local NGOs*$ started to meet periodically to
discuss pipeline monitoring reports and hear continuing grievances from individuals and
communities along the pipeline. However, some sector ministries and non-official informants
have indicated that, although the Consultative Platform i s very useful for sharing information
and airing divergent views, it has not yet proven to be an effective instrument to influence
operational decisions related to the pipeline and arbitrate social grievances from affected
communities. This may be related to the fact that the Consultative Platform meets only once
or twice a year, and that the PSMC, which chairs the meetings, remains within the national
oil company in a potential conflict o f interest (see Objective 2, below).

22.     The PSMC and the three field u n i t s that were established received equipment and
training, including instrumentation required for the Environmental Management Information
System (EMIS), which has just recently become operational. Other ministries and civil
society organizations (CSOs) also participated in workshops and public consultations, but
intersectoral monitoring capacity has not been mainstreamed as intended (for example, the
Land Ministry remains very weak with respect to land cadastres, and the Ministry o f
Environment, while consulted, has no active role in environmental matters related to the
pipeline). On social aspects, the PSMC monitored the implementation o f the Indigenous
People Plan (IPP) and reported an increase in agricultural activities, an increase in school
attendance and hospital visits, promotion o f citizenship through the granting o f national
identity cards, and provision o f housing benefits. A survey conducted by PSMC shows that


83. T h e Implementation Completion Report for the pipeline project (dated December 2006) recommendedthe
formation o f this platform.
                                               83


almost all o f the 23 8 villages affected by the pipeline were compensated. However,
community grievances and N G O complaints have continued and remained unresolved for
several years, as reported by affected community leaders and individuals whom the IEG
mission visited. (The negative findings o f the more recent 2007 Barclay-Koppert report are
discussed in the main text.) Moreover, FEDEC remains weak and lacks the financing to
continue i t s mandate o f managing and implementing the IPP for the Pygmy communities and
two new national parks (see para. 12, above, and the detailed discussion in Annex A). After
initial delay, the PSMC worked through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and CSOs
to raise awareness o f the public on health and social impacts o f the CCPP, primarily on
HIV/AIDS in the villages along the pipeline route and among indigenous peoples' groups.
However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness o f these awareness-raising activities due
to lack o f monitoring. PSMC monitored the compensation plan due to archeological impact
in a satisfactory manner.

Objective Two: on a medium to long-term basis, to help ensure the environmental
sustainability o future projects, programs and policies in the Borrower's petroleum sector,
               f
including strengthening the Borrower's capacity to mitigate the negative social and
environmental impacts o the PDP Project and the establishment o an environmental
                         f                                         f
regulatory framework for the petroleum sector.

23.     Achievement o f the second objective was negligible. K e y indicators (see para. 7,
above) were not achieved. Environmental decrees (with the exception o f the EIA Decree)
were not published, and the new regulatory framework was not put in place. The Long-Term
Vision Study was s t i l l incomplete as o f the IEG mission in February 2009. Compared to the
2002 target, the government has not yet approved a National O i l Spill Response Plan.
Finally, the Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) has only recently
become operational, too late for the construction o f the pipeline. These outcomes pale in
comparison to the project's intention, which according to the DCA84was to strengthen the
enforcement capacity o f all agencies involved in the EMP implementation and monitoring,
including disseminating, implementing, and enforcing environmental legislation and related
administrative procedures.

24.     In terms o f preparation o f regulations for environmental management o f the o i l
sector, 12 decrees have been prepared for enforcement o f the 1996 Cameroon Environmental
Code. O f these, only the decree on EIA has been approved and is currently in force. The rest
are yet to be approved at the level o f the Prime Minister, where the draft decrees have been
waiting for approval for several years.

25.     NGOs have raised issues about possible weakening o f the EIA Decree. The PSMC
indicated that the draft texts o f decrees prepared under the project can be modified by the
sponsoring ministries before they are submitted to the Prime Minister's office for approval.
With respect to the EIA decree, some informants interviewed by the IEG mission raised the
issue that the text o f the (approved) EIA Decree may have departed in important and
unwelcome ways from the original draft text prepared by the project's consultants. As


84. Schedule 2, Description o f the Project.
                                                    84


evidence, those informants indicated that the approval date o f the EIA Decree preceded the
completion date o f the EIA draft text that was prepared under the project.

26.     The project developed a National O i l Spill Response Plan (NOSRP), but this has not
yet been formally approved or adopted as a law. In the consultative processes related to
drafting the NOSRP, some progress was made in clarifying the rules, norms, and guidelines
o f hydrocarbon exploitation, and defining the roles o f all entities that are involved. ECMG
reported that COTCO handled an o i l spill in early 2008 in a professional manner, although
there were shortcomings in external communication with respect to the incident, as it took
four days before information on the spill reached PSMC and the government. Information on
environmental and social safeguards was disseminated as part o f the Environmental
Management Information System (EMIS), periodic newsletters, and annual meetings.
However, the PSMC has showed some weaknesses in the timely dissemination o f
information, which was often indicated by N G O and individual informants to the IEG
mission.

27.     Around 200 staff from 13 ministries and the PSMC Secretariat who were involved in
supervising the environmental and social aspects o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline and other
infrastructure projects were trained in the monitoring and mitigation o f environmental
impacts. There were no specific indicators to assess the effect o f this training.

28.     The project had unintended impacts. On the positive side, it helped to involve women
from affected communities, including indigenous peoples groups, in activities funded by
           and
FEDECS5 as laborers for COTCO. Women also participated in training sessions and
awareness campaigns for controlling the spread o f HIV/AIDS. The project also helped build
the country's capacity to monitor social aspects connected to labor in a large infrastructure
project. There was a positive change in the administrative culture toward collaboration
between government agencies and NGOs.

29.     Two studies conducted during the project highlighted the long-term economic and
social impacts o f the pipeline, particularly in the Kribi area, showing that the improvement o f
the road infrastructure during the project facilitated access and movement o f sections o f the
population, and strengthened health service delivery to communities in the corridor o f the
pipeline. The establishment o f the two biological diversity offsets (Campo Ma'an and M'bam
and Djerem National Park) included a management plan and a legal status that will bring
them under the highest level o f protection under the 1994 Forest Law.

30.     On the negative side, large migration occurred toward localities along the pipeline to
take advantage o f the improved infrastructure and availability o f jobs. N G O documents
indicate that this may have increased exposure to HIV/AIDS, although no quantitative
evidence has been provided, and there has been no consistent government follow-up or
regular monitoring. Pollution o f river water in certain localities along the pipeline has limited
the access to potable water for the inhabitants. Fishermen blame the destruction o f the natural
reef offshore o f Kribi for reducing their fish catch. The Deng Deng forest, a biodiversity

R I S K S TO DEVELOPMENT
                      OUTCOME
32.      Owing to i t s legal mandate and the experience and training gained during the project,
the PSMC expects to continue to act as a "one-stop shop" for managing the environmental
and social impacts o f pipelines, and any infrastructure projects falling within the area o f
influence o f the CCPP. After project completion, PSMC continues to function with the same
level o f staff as during the project. Presently, the PSMC i s financed by SNH, which raises a
conflict o f interest in that S H i s the petroleum arm o f the government and a representative
                               N
on the Board o f Cameroon O i l Transport Corporation (COTCO). The government intends to
follow upon the recommendations o f the Long-Term Vision Study in a follow-on
environment and social capacity-building project. However, Cameroon has a long way to go
in formalizing i t s environmental regulations for environmental management, improving
capacity, and meeting standards and norms. When considered together with the low to
varying commitment shown by the government, the overall risk to development outcomes i s
significant.

BANKPERFORMANCE
33.     QuaZity at Entry. As already discussed, the relevance o f project design i s modest. In
retrospect, the Bank should have requested a Quality at Entry Review, which may have
yielded recommendations and guidance on how to simplify the project design and tailor it to
                                             86


the country's existing human and financial resources. On the positive side, the Bank
consulted local NGOs and government stakeholders throughout the design, preparation, and
implementation period. Quality at entry was moderately satisfactory.

34.     Quality o Supervision. The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources for
                 f
supervision. The supervision teams included staff that had a good knowledge o f Cameroon's
government structure and environmental issues, and brought relevant environmental
experience from other countries. Following decentralization o f the Bank's functions to the
Country Office, local staff in operational, financial, and procurement management provided
continuity. Supervision missions were proactive in prevailing upon the PSMC to share
budget information and training plans with all relevant ministries and upon the government
to implement its commitments, including the appointment o f an International Advisory
Panel. This ultimately resulted in the government agreeing to hire individual international
experts to provide advice on the NOSRP and implement the training plan o n coastal zone
management and marine environment protection. However, the supervision reports could
have provided better information on the Key Performance Indicators and related them clearly
to the development outcome and institutional progress ratings.

35.      A midterm review (MTR) in July 2003 made several recommendations relating to
speeding up implementation and training, improving collaboration among the Cameroon O i l
Transport Corporation (COTCO), the PMSC, and other entities, and to launch the Long-
Term Vision Study. But the MTR missed the opportunity to propose simplifying the project
components to renew focus on monitoring the E M P o f the pipeline. This was particularly
important in the light o f the Inspection Panel concern relating to the project's delay in
monitoring the EMP, which the Bank acknowledged was constrained by inadequate
institutional and human resources. Bank supervision was moderately satisfactory.

36.    Overall Bank performance i s moderately satisfactory.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
37.     Government Performance. The government was not initially convinced about the
usefulness o f the project, and though commitment improved as project design progressed, it
was not consistent during implementation. The government showed limited interest in
supporting the decision-making process, speeding up project effectiveness and
implementation, enacting environmental decrees, and approving the National Oil Spill
Response Plan. However, the government provided additional counterpart funds o f $4.56
million to increase the original amount o f $5.23 million to $9.79 million. Government
performance was moderately unsatisfactory.

3 8.    Implementing Agency Performance. The PSMC, which i s competently staffed at the
level o f its management and the three field units, implemented its overall mandate with some
delays because o f initial weaknesses in project fiduciary management. After the MTR, it
agreed to recruit and use outside consultants to help speed up the procurement and
disbursement processes and build its own capacity for project management. Consultation
with stakeholders and affected people took long to become effective. The Consultation
Platform-following a recommendation from the pipeline project's December 2006
Implementation Completion Report-was organized and started consultations with other
                                             87

ministries, NGOs, and various stakeholders in 2007-08 period. Based on reports by external
monitoring groups, supervision has improved over time with staff trained and equipped by
the project and better monitoring processes implemented,by field-based PSMC teams and
                                   N ,
experts. PSMC's affiliation with S H however, continues to raise issues o f conflict o f
interest. Implementing agency performance i s rated moderately satisfactory.

39.     Given the strong weight o f the government's lack o f interest and progress in
finalizing key actions, overall borrower performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Annex C. Chad: Petroleum Sector Management Capacity-
Building Project (Credit 3373-CD)

Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons

1.      The Petroleum Sector Management Capacity-Building Project i s part o f a cluster of
technical assistance (TA) and advisory projects financed by the WB and IFC that supported
capacity building related to the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline
Project (PDPP). The main objective o f this particular TA project was to strengthen the
capacity o f Chad to manage the development o f i t s petroleum resources in an
environmentally and socially sound manner, consistent with the Chad Country Assistance
Strategy.

   FINDINGS
MAIN
2.      Based on i t s modest relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, overall project outcome i s
rated unsatisfactory. The performance o f this Chad project has many similarities with the
parallel project in Cameroon (Annex B). The delays in effectiveness and procurement meant
that the government's monitoring agency, CTNSC 86 was not able to conduct independent
monitoring during the development o f the Doba o i l field and the construction o f Chad's
section o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline from 2000-03, Instead, during that time, EEPCI self-
regulated while the External Compliance Monitoring Group (ECMG) conducted monitoring
on behalf o f IFC.

3.      As an indirect result o f suspension o f Bank operations in Chad in 2006, whatever
nascent capacity was being built within NTCMC and i t s field staff collapsed for lack o f IDA
funding. An Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) was initiated but not
fully developed. Effective national capacity for regulation and monitoring was far from being
mainstreamed across the concerned sector ministries, notably the Ministry o f Environment
and Water Resources (MEW), as intended.

4.      Unlike Cameroon, there i s no Consultative Platform in Chad to share information and
air grievances at regular meetingss7,despite mounting local and WBG concerns related to the
expansion o f in-fill drilling by EEPCI, which would reach triple the level appraised under the
original Environmental Management Plan (EMP). With the Bank's departure from the
petroleum sector, the NGOS have lost the protective mantle that the Bank's leadership and
convening role has provided over the past decade, thus exposing them to greater risks when
publicly raising environmental and social issues related to Chad's petroleum development
program. Despite a slow start but promising initial results, the FACIL (Fonds d 'Actions
Concerte`es d 'Initiative Locale) microfinancing and small community development program
intended to mitigate social impacts also collapsed when the Bank pulled out o f the petroleum

  According to ECMG (April-May 2009), meetings with communities and with eligible persons are now held
regularly for passing messages and explaining procedures. Meetings have also been held with local authorities
and NOGs.

sector, which meant that the pending Supplemental Grant (intended to continue community
development-type programs) could not be approved before the credit's closing date.

5.       Government support at entry and its commitment during implementation have been
very weak. None o f the intended environmental regulations have been approved, much less
publicly debated or disclosed. The country does not have implementing regulations for a
critically important National O i l Spill Response Plan. EEPCI is almost entirely self-
regulating, since there i s no independent government presence on the ground. To date, an
environmental decree or implementing regulations have not yet been adopted, and the
M E W does not have any monitorable performance indicators related to geophysical,
forestry, health, and other relevant areas within its responsibility. Although the MMEP has
developed some economic and technical indicators related to. producing o i l concessions,
these remain weak, and regular updating and monitoring still needs to be strengthened
significantly.

LESSONS
6.       The main lessons learned from the project's experience are:

     e Borrower commitment: Effective implementation o f capacity-building projects
       requires solid commitment from the borrower at the highest levels, and must take
       place in the context o f clear policy support for environmental and social management
       objectives, coupled with the political determination to reach them.
     e A pre-existing legalfiamework: In nearly all cases, but especially in extractive
       industries, an appropriate legal, institutional, and regulatory framework should be in
       place before production starts, in order to facilitate the building o f capacity.
     e Adequate assessment o institutional and absorptive capacities at entry: Human,
                                f
       financial, and institutional constraints must be carefully assessed. Only on the basis o f
       such an assessment can realistic expectations be built as to what can be achieved
       through this type o f TA project. There should be maximum clarity about what types
       o f capacity need to be created and which personnel are to be targeted. Moreover,
       capacity building should be properly sequenced.
     e Sharpfocus on objectives that can be implemented Temptations to simultaneously
       cover multiple sectors and many activities should be avoided. Inclusion of, for
       example, infrastructure-building components are likely to prove a serious distraction
       for both financial and human resources in a relatively small TA project.
     e Capacity building needs to focus on existing permanent national institutions:
       Training and other capacity-building efforts should not be focused o n temporary
       entities that have no political or operational authority and are thus unable to
       mainstream reforms.
     e Full assessment o the impact o the Bank's actions: When the Bank decides to invoke
                         f              f
       remedies for borrower non-compliance, it is important to assess not only the Bank's
       desired effect on the top government authorities, but the impact o f the Bank's actions
       on ultimate project beneficiaries as well. In this project, the Bank's seven-month
       suspension o f operations in Chad and disbursements o f IDA funds in 2006 (in
       addition to the failure to meet conditions for the Supplemental Grant) led to the
       disintegration and eventual collapse o f the capacity-building and environmental and
                                                          90


         social mitigation programs that the project sought to support-to the detriment of the
         poor, local populations in the o i l field and pipeline development area that the project
         sought to serve. Every effort should be made to ensure that the Bank, in taking such
         major actions, does not subvert i t s own poverty reduction goals.

The Project
OBJECTIVES, COMPONENTS, AND COSTS

7.       According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the project objectives were:

         to better manage the development o f petroleum resources in an environmentally and
         socially sound manner; and
         to increase the use o f petroleum resources generated from the Chad Export Project.

8.      The second objective is inappropriate, since revenue management and public
expenditure aspects were pursued in other projects in the cluster. Consequently, in this case
the formulation o f the development objectives in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
guided the implementation o f the project and therefore was used as the basis for this
evaluation.

9.       The P A D states that the project would:

         strengthen the capacity o f Chad to manage the development o f i t s petroleum
         resources in an environmentally and socially sound manner, beginning with the Doba
         Petroleum Project (DPP)88 in southern Chad;
         strengthen the capacity o f Chad to minimize and mitigate the potential negative
         environmental and social impacts o f the DPP o n the producing region;
         strengthen local capacity in the Doba region, and provide opportunities for the
         region's residents to improve their living conditions; and
         establish an effective framework for further sound private sector investment in the
         petroleum sector, and engage effectively with such investors.

10.   The PDOs and Key Performance Indicators were not revised during project
implementation.

11.      The project consisted o f two components:

         Component 1: DPP management (estimated cost at appraisal, $18.9 million; actual
         cost, $18.2 million). This component accounted for 71 percent o f total project costs,
         and consisted of:

              strengthening the government's capacity by developing technical, social, and
              environmental competence in the Ministry o f Environment and Water Resources
              (MEWR), Comite Technique National de Suivi et de Contrtjle, or CTNSC), the


88. This i s the same as the Chad Export Project cited in the D C A ' s statement o f objectives.
                                              91


            Doba Project Unit (DPU) set up to monitor the operations o f the DPP, and the
            Ministry o f Mines, Energy, and Petroleum (MMEP);
            mitigating negative impacts o f the DPP on the producing region by limiting
            migration through a communications campaign, financing social infrastructure
            facilities, and supporting local development activities; and
        1
            conducting information and communication activities, including the development
            o f a monitoring and information system, and generating accurate public
            information on the DPP and the project with a view to encouraging dialogue
            among stakeholders.

        This part o f the project included the F A C I L program (Fonds d 'Actions Concerte`es
        d'lnitiative Locale), which provided grants or loans to finance microprojects and
        small-scale community activities in the Doba area related to infrastructure for health,
        education, sanitation, water supply, and market access. FACIL also included income-
        and labor-generating projects, as well as specialized training for NGOs, CSOs,
        municipalities, and communities.

        Component 2: The second component was aimed at building petroleum sector
        management capacity (estimated cost at appraisal, $5.3 million; actual cost, $5.5
        million). This component consisted of:
        1
            strengthening the environmental and social regulatory framework applicable to
            petroleum development projects in Chad, drawing on the lessons o f the DPP; and
        1
            strengthening Chad's capacity to manage the technical aspects o f the sector and
            i t s ability to attract, negotiate, and engage with potential investors, inter alia,
            through developing an effective management information system, training, and
            promotion activities.

 12.    At closing, total project costs were $25.7 million-including a refinanced Project
Preparation Facility advance o f $2.2 million--or $0.5 million less than the $26.2 million
estimated at appraisal. However, there were substantial cost overruns during the first years o f
implementation, and the Credit proceeds were almost entirely committed by mid-2003, In
October 2005, the borrower requested a reallocation among expenditure categories in the
D C A to cover the higher than anticipated costs o f consulting services due mainly to the
weakness o f the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The consulting services category was increased
by $3.1 million (or 46 percent), financed by reductions mainly in unallocated expenditures,
operating costs, and microprojects.

13.     By 2005, the Credit was fully utilized. In July 2004, the borrower requested a
Supplemental Grant (SG) o f $10 million. However, there were delays in fulfilling Board
presentation requirements, specifically a Letter o f Sector Strategy, assurance o f counterpart
funding availability, and a procurement plan. Moreover, as noted, the Bank suspension o f
operations in Chad in 2006 meant that the Supplemental Grant could not be approved before
project closure.

14.    The estimated and actual costs are presented in Table C. 1

15.    The IDA Credit o f $23.7 million equivalent financed 92 percent o f project costs. The
contribution o f the government was $2 million, $0.5 million less than foreseen at appraisal.

Implementation Experience

 16.     Key Dates. The Credit's effectiveness on March 2001 represented a delay o f 9 months
after Board approval. The delay was the resuIt o f disagreements between the government and
the Bank concerning the institutional arrangements for implementation and difficulties in
staffing the project implementation unit (PIU). The closing date was extended twice. The
first extension, for four months from December 3 1,2005, to April 30,2006, was to allow
what was thought to be sufficient time for preparation o f the Supplemental Grant. The second
extension, until December 3 1,2006, was to allow completion o f ongoing activities, which
had been delayed during the Bank's suspension o f the country's lending portfolio.

 17.    Monitoring and Evaluation. The quality o f the project's M&E is negligible. The
PAD indicators are mostly based on outputs rather than outcomes, and for the most part are
neither quantified nor time-bound. The approach for measuring the four basic output
indicators shown in the Results Framework o f the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
was not clear: (i) effective government monitoring o f the DPP, including financial and
technical aspects; (ii) effective implementation o f the DPP Environmental Management Plan;
(iii)social infrastructure improvements in the producing region; and (iv) substantially
increased government dealings with new investors. The four intermediate outcome indicators
                                            93


were actually also output indicators: (i)i l price comparators reflect pertinent international
                                         o
price; (ii)
          environmental regulations for the petroleum sector are developed and a new
Hydrocarbons Code i s prepared; (iii)  capacity in the Environment Ministry and CTNSC to
monitor environmental and social aspects o f petroleum activities is strengthened; and (iv) the
pressure o f migrating population on the region i s mitigated.

18.     In sum, there were no objective, time-bound outcome benchmarks for the project's
capacity-building objective, which should have been made available to project stakeholders.
Although the PAD'SAnnex 2 contains a summary data sheet for a fuller and more
sophisticated management information system (MIS), this was not properly developed,
implemented, or maintained, and necessary data were not collected. The sustainability o f
M&E capabilities developed in /CTNSC and D P U is in serious doubt (some informants say
"decimated"). These two agencies do not have the capacity or the organizational structure to
mainstream M&E practices.

19.    Environmental and Social Safeguards. The project was classified Category C under
the Bank's safeguard policies, as a TA project that would have no adverse impacts on the
physical and social environment. N o safeguard issues arose during project implementation.
The Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, however, had important
environmental and social impacts, which are discussed in Annex A o f this report.

20.       Financial Management Aspects. The project's financial management system-
including accounting, controls, auditing, and reporting-was adequate and satisfied Bank
requirements. However, major fiduciary issues arose during project implementation. The
Special Account was drawn down to finance ineligible expenditures. Several unpaid invoices
are outstanding because the government made commitments beyond Credit resources. While
the Bank's portfolio in Chad was suspended in 2006, the PIU lacked access to government
counterpart funding but used the Special Account to finance expenditures. Six months after
the project's closing date, the outstanding balances in the Special Accounts o f D P U
($213,000) and CTNSC ($700,000) had not yet been refunded by the government. The
F A C I L program reimbursed $40,000 to CTNSC, but this has not yet been repaid to the
project. Some o f these problems resulted from the pressure to keep up with the accelerated
pipeline construction schedule. In other cases, however, the issues arose from the
government's delays in providing counterpart funds. Although the government is responsible
for reimbursing unused funds in the Special Accounts, amounts are s t i l l outstanding and
invoices remained unpaid for a period after the Credit closed.

2 1.    Procurement. The DCA's procurement provisions were violated o n numerous
occasions: contracts were awarded without the Bank's non-objection; single-source
contracting was excessively used; bidding was fragmented; ceiling amounts were exceeded;
and either there was no procurement plan or it was not observed.

RELEVANCE
22.     Objectives. The project i s consistent with the goals o f the 1996 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) o f restoring public sector capacity, focusing public expenditures on poverty
reduction, and creating an environment favorable to private sector development. I t i s also
consistent with the principal objective o f the 2001 and 2003 CASs, to assist Chad in making
                                               94


the best use o f i t s petroleum revenues as it attempts to attain the Millennium Development
Goals. The project i s relevant to one o f the two pillars o f the 2003 CAS, which is to
strengthen governance and the institutional arrangements for public resource management
and service delivery, the r u l e o f law, and the establishment o f robust social and
environmental safeguards, as Chad exploits i t s o i l reserves. However, as in Cameroon, the
objective o f strengthening the entire petroleum sector significantly exceeded the immediate
needs o f monitoring o i l field development and pipeline construction. Consequently, the
relevance o f objectives was modest.

23.     Design. The objective o f strengthening the entire petroleum sector resulted in a
design that was too complex and ambitious for the existing country capacity. (This finding i s
similar to that o f the parallel project in Cameroon and the revenue management project in
Chad.) The project's design did not adequately address the l o w absorptive capacity o f the
civil servants who were targeted for capacity building, although this was well known during
project appraisal. The emphasis and funding for training was insufficient. Given the l o w
capacity to start with, the project (as in Cameroon) attempted to tackle too many activities
and sectonvide issues instead o f focusing on the immediate needs o f the already-highly
complex o i l field development and pipeline project. During project preparation, there was
inadequate attention on ensuring coherence between the PDOs and the burgeoning
responsibilities yet weak capacities o f the Chadian institutions involved. The relevance o f
design was modest.

24.    Although the project's objectives are relevant, the flaws o f i t s design weighed very
heavily as a factor underlying the serious problems encountered during implementation.
Overall project relevance i s modest.

EFFICIENCY

25.     Under the Bank's operational guidelines, an ERR i s not required for technical
assistance projects. However, given the long implementation delays and issues related to
financial management and procurement, the efficiency o f the project i s considered modest.

EFFICACY

Objective 1: to strengthen the capacity o Chad to manage the development o its petroleum
                                         f                                f
resources in an environmentally and socially sound manner, beginning with the Doba
Petroleum Project (DPP)

26.     Achievement o f this objective was negligible. Capacity building was ad hoc and
although some competencies were initially developed, the nascent institutions-most
importantly the pipeline coordinating committee (CTNSC)-all collapsed soon after the IDA
funding was interrupted when the Bank suspended its operations in 2006. IEG's document
review and interviews show that there was no clear training plan under the project, and the
training that was carried out did not fit established patterns o f career development in Chad's
public service. The funding allocated for training was insufficient. Most training was
provided to project implementation units (PIUs) or other temporary structures with no long-
                                                     95


term operating responsibilities or political authority. There was no coherent capacity-building
strategy and no sustainable improvement in institutional capacity.

27.     Nearly all the trained staff l e f t government service because o f the poor to non-existent
career perspectives and the uncertain future o f the government institutions themselves. Any
modest impact that the project may have had was underminedby adverse institutional
changes made by the government. In 2005, the decision to create a National O i l Company
and vest i t with national coordination responsibilities undermined the capacity o f other
bodies, notably the MMEP, and spread scarce skills even more thinly. 89

28.    Severe weaknesses s t i l l characterize the government institutions responsible for the
petroleum sector, and there i s no independent monitoring on behalf o f Chad o f the
environmental and social aspects o f the petroleum investments and Exxon's operations.

Objective 2: to strengthen the capacity o Chad to minimize and mitigate the potential
                                         f
negative environmental and social impacts o the DPP on the producing region
                                            f

29.      Achievement o f this objective was negligible. The DPU's petroleum inspectors
initially helped to apply appropriate quality and quantity control procedures to the export o f
crude oil. The DPU also carried out regular analysis o f royalties and initiated the launch and
supervision o f external audits. Improved coordination with the operating Consortium enabled
improved management o f land, water supply, and sanitation for the benefit o f local
communities and new arrivals. Reportedly, prevention campaigns financed by the project
have heightened awareness o f the dangers o f sexually transmitted diseases among truckers
and other high-risk groups, although systematic evidence i s not available. Sustainable forest
management practices were introduced in six pilot villages. At least toward the end o f the
construction period, CTNSC monitored the O i l Field Development Area and gained
credibility with the Consortium through i t s technical reviews o f the Consortium's
environmental proposals. 90

30.    However, these improvements were not sustained. The MIS was not properly
developed, implemented, or maintained, leading to the ongoing difficulties in collecting,
analyzing, and using social and environmental data. A robust institutional framework
necessary to support continued environmental protection and mitigation activities has not
been developed. Although there was some tentative provision in the 2007 national budget for
CTNSC, it did not materialize and the committee was eventually dissolved. Guidelines for
implementing the Environmental Management Plan were prepared in 2005, but no
Environmental Decree or regulations have been adopted. Although an O i l Spill Response
Plan was approved by the Cabinet, implementing regulations have not yet been developed.

Objective 3: to strengthen local capacity in the Doba region, andprovide opportunitiesfor
the region's residents to improve their living conditions



89. The destruction o f the ministry and i t s records during the rebel attack severely compoundedthe problem.

3 1.    Achievement o f this objective was modest. Although the F A C I L program (Fonds
d'Actions ConcertCes d'Initiative Locale) got o f f to a slow start due to delays in recruiting
qualified personnel and poor cash management by CTNCS, its micro-credit loans were given
to 8,000 people for economic and commercial activities in 10 cantons, though the outcomes
for employment creation and increased living standards have not been evaluated. In terms of
social infrastructure, 29 school buildings and 58 new classrooms were built, seven bridges
were constructed or rehabilitated, and drinking water supply systems were improved.
Training courses on a variety o f topics (such as masonry and poultry breeding) were
delivered to some 500 people, though again it i s not known h o w useful they were in actually
raising incomes due to lack o f M&E. Women played an active role o n F A C I L committees
and were directly assisted in the promotion o f income-generating activities.

32.     These improvements, however, were not sustained. No institutional or other measures
were taken to ensure the regular maintenance o f the new infrastructure. When IDA
suspended disbursements, the F A C I L program disintegrated and eventually ceased. At
present, an unspecified number o f invoices to small and medium enterprises and other
community investors who participated in the program remain unpaid.

Objective 4: to establish an effective framework for further soundprivate sector investment
in the petroleum sector and engage effectively with such investors

33.     Achievement o f this objective was modest. Considerable efforts were made in
technical and financial training for staff o f the DPU, MMEP, and Ministry o f Finance.
However, as noted earlier, many o f the people concerned have left government, leaving little
capacity to negotiate with foreign private investors. A model was successfully developed to
help the government determine the price differential between Doba Blend crude o i l and Brent
(commonly used as international price benchmark). However, MMEP has not kept current its
subscription to Platts Oilgram, which supplies the monthly input o f freight rates and o i l
prices required by the model. Hence, the model cannot be regularly used.

34.     Accelerated negotiations (unforeseen at the time o f project preparation) were
successfully conducted for the renewal o f the Consortium's concession after the pipeline's
construction phase was completed much faster than anticipated. The negotiations were
carried out principally by specialized technical and legal consultants, and it i s unclear how
much capacity has been transferred to Chadian officials. The government has been actively
promoting the petroleum sector, and three new concessions were signed in 2004.

35.     The quality o f the promotion effort has been undermined by lack o f funding under the
project to develop an information system for geological, geophysical, and petrophysical data.
This data i s currently stored by the Consortium. The greatest shortcoming with regard to this
objective is the failure to improve sector governance through the strengthening o f institutions
and the establishment o f a legal framework favoring a clear separation between policy,
implementation and monitoring responsibilities. Although the project supported the
preparation o f a new hydrocarbon law, there i s a lack o f political support for key governance
measures in Chad in general, and in the petroleum sector specifically.

36.    The project's overall efficacy i s modest.

OUTCOME
37.      The project's outcome i s unsatisfactory. I t s principal development objective-to
build Chadian capacity to manage the country's petroleum sector-has not been achieved,
partly due to poor design and partly from lack o f government commitment and ownership.
Moreover, the seven-month suspension o f Bank operations in 2006 led to the rapid erosion
and eventual loss o f whatever capacity had been built under the project, and the termination
o f the promising FACIL program. The sub-ratings comprising the overall outcome rating are
shown in Table C.2.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
                 OUTCOME

38.      The risk to development outcome i s high. First, the project has failed to develop an
institutional and legal framework capable o f supporting environmental protection and
mitigation activities. Second, capacity constraints in the sector ministries have only been
partially addressed. Third, the CTNSC has lost nearly all o f i t s trained staff. As for DPU,
some o f i t s personnel have been absorbed into MMEP, but no further budgetary provision i s
to be made for the institution itself. Fourth, it i s not certain whether MMEP w i l l have the
financial resources to conduct the regular training programs necessary to keep i t s staff
abreast o f changing developments in the oil industry. Similarly, the ministry may be unable
to secure sufficient funding to acquire essential equipment or to create and maintain a
petroleum database. The capacity constraints o f the MMEP may have been further
exacerbated by the creation o f a National O i l Company. Fifth, there i s currently no financing
for continuing the project activities, which have collapsed. Finally, with respect to Chad's
participation in the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, there i s no
longer a budgetary provision for national coordination, which has practically ceased to exist.

BANKPERFORMANCE
39.      Quality at entry was unsatisfactory. In addition to the major design shortcomings
described previously, risks were inadequately assessed, notably institutional and fiduciary
capacities, and mitigating measures were weak. For example, two important risks were
considered modest, namely, the low and weakening government commitment and capacity to
strengthen the sector, and the inadequate use made o f trained Chadians. These were to be
mitigated by Bank support, linkage to the implementation o f the PDPP, and improved
working conditions. With hindsight, it i s clear that linking the project to the implementation
o f a large and highly visible engineering activity like the pipeline project led to unrealistic
demands in a country with severely limited human resources and capacity. More attention
should have been given to proactively targeting and sequencing the functions and skill types
that were likely to be critical in the short to medium term. The design was hasty, and the
PAD'S M&E indicators are not quantifiable, time-bound, or outcome-oriented.

40.      Supervision was moderately unsatisfactory. It was hampered by inappropriate design
and staffing problems. During the first three years o f implementation, the task team had no
petroleum specialist. Inadequate supervision contributed to the project's considerable
financial and fiduciary difficulties. Despite manifest problems, supervision missions
classified the project as satisfactory until mid-2005; only after that date was it rated
moderately unsatisfactory and then unsatisfactory.

41.      Perhaps the most regrettable aspect o f the Bank's performance i s the apparently
inadequate assessment o f the full impact o f the Bank's actions related to the suspension o f
relations with Chad as a result o f i t s unilateral amendments o f the petroleum revenue
management agreements. The need for additional funding for capacity-building project
activities was recognized, but given the Bank's seven-month suspension o f operations in
Chad, the Supplemental Grant could not be approved before the 2006 closing date. This led
to the disintegration and eventual collapse o f the slow but promising capacity-building and
environmentalhocial mitigation programs that the project sought to support-to the
detriment o f the people in the oil field and pipeline development area that the project sought
to serve. Every effort should be made to ensure that the Bank, in taking such major actions,
does not subvert i t s own poverty reduction goals.

42.    The Bank's performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
43.     During project preparation, the government appeared committed to the project, but it
opposed many o f its features during implementation. Intense dialogue and the intervention o f
senior Bank management was needed to convince the authorities o f the need to improve their
petroleum sector management capabilities. By late 2004, commitment was wavering once
again.

44.     Serious fiduciary and financial management issues contributed to an exhaustion o f
project funds by 2005. In December 2005, Parliament approved the government's decision to
amend unilaterally the Petroleum Revenue Management Law, in contravention o f both the
D C A for this project and the Loan Agreement for the pipeline project. As part o f the Bank
                                            99


response, all disbursements were suspended, including under this project, and did not resume
until July 2006-by    which time the National O i l Company had been created, the PIUs had
lost almost their entire staffs, the already weak interagency coordination was debilitated, and
project-trained government personnel left. The government could have filled the funding gap
with some o f the substantial resources already accruing from o i l revenue, but did not. The
government's performance was unsatisfactory.

45.     Most o f the shortcomings o f the implementing entities were the fault o f the
government rather than o f the entities themselves. National coordination, even before its
absorption into the MMEP, proved unable to carry out its appointed tasks or to contribute
effectively to the building o f the institutional and legal framework for the sector.
NCTMC/CTNSC steadily improved its capacity during implementation and gained
credibility with the Consortium. However, its valuable work was undermined by lack o f
coordination with the DPU, and later by inadequate funding, and the entity was eventually
dissolved. Overall implementing agency performance was unsatisfactory.

46.    The borrower's overall performance i s rated unsatisfactory.

Annex D. Chad: Management o f the Petroleum Economy
Project (Credit 33 16-CD)

Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons

1.     The Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project, o f about $19.5 million,
including an IDA Credit o f about $17.5 million, i s part o f the cluster o f technical assistance
(TA) and advisory projects financed by the W 3 and I F C that supported the Chad-Cameroon
                                              E
Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project (PDPP). This project focused on the
management o f the o i l revenue from the PDPP.

MAINFINDINGS
2.       Based mainly o n the ratings for efficacy and efficiency, the overall project outcome is
rated unsatisfactory. W h i l e the project objective itself was relevant, the design was
overloaded, too ambitious, lacking selectivity and focus, and oriented toward fiscal
management best practice rather than addressing the basic weaknesses o f the country's public
financial management system. The underlying issue was that the project design, in effect,
assumed that the capacity the project was supposed to help develop was already largely in
place. The flaws in project design were compounded by loose implementation arrangements,
lack o f continuity o f supervision, and most importantly, weak government commitment and
growing non-compliance with budgetary rules. As a consequence, the project objective was
not met.

LESSONS
3.     The main lessons learned from the project's experience are:

                                               f
        The critical need to design aproject o this type around the institutional and capacity
       realities o the country.
                  f
       Related to the above is the need to focus on improving the basic plumbing ofpublic
       expenditure management, not on introducing sophisticated practices, recognizing that
       capacity is inherently relative to the complexity o the tasks the system is expected to
                                                          f
       perform. In this case, the failure to focus on concrete improvements in the preparation
       o f good investment projects (including recurrent cost provision) and on the nuts and
       bolts o f budget execution led to wasteful investments and divergence between
       budgeted and actual expenditure.
       Performance indicators need to be limited to thefew key ones that are critical to
       achieving the objectives and are monitorable. The plethora o f performance indicators
       in the project was related to the overloaded design but contributed to diverting
       attention away from the efficiency o f expenditure. Also, listing dozens o f K e y
       Performance Indicators o f diverse importance and questionable clarity made robust
       monitoring impossible.
       PERs can be very useful but cannot by themselves remedy major weaknesses in
       budget preparation and execution. In this case, the logical sequence went from PRSP
       formulation through sector expenditure programs that would underpin an MTEF that
                                               101


         would frame an annual budget containing integrated programs approved by the
         CollBge-with the necessary practical improvements in the system addressed by the
         annual PERs. Unfortunately, aside from the weakness or absence o f the various l i n k s
         in this chain, the excellent diagnoses and recommendations o f the various PERs were
         mostly ignored.
     *                f
         Continuity o supervision is always critical for good project implementation, and
         higher-level guidance and monitoring should not be allowed to supersede or diminish
         the role and responsibility o the designated TTL. In this case, the project had six
                                        f
         TTLs in its seven years-a syndrome not unrelated to the assignment o f high-
         powered consultants with de facto supervisory and direct implementation
         responsibilities during the f i r s t three years.

The Project

OBJECTIVES
4.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) stated the objective as to "help Chad to build
capacity to implement i t s petroleum revenue management strategy to enable it to effectively
absorb and allocate expected o i l revenue, and thus pursue the poverty-reduction objective of
petroleum resources development." This general objective was articulated into the following
(more generic and ambitious than the primary objective):

         to help improve the quality and effectiveness o f Chad's public resource management,
         with a view to ensuring the priority use o f o i l revenue to alleviate key infrastructure
         and human resource bottlenecks that constrain growth and poverty reduction, and
         mitigating the potential negative macroeconomic, governance, and social impact of
         o i l exports;
         to help build Chad's capacity to increase public expenditure in priority poverty
         reduction activities (basic health and education, social affairs, essential infrastructure,
         and rural development), while maintaining a sound macroeconomic environment
         conducive to economic growth, increasing the efficiency, transparency, and
         accountability o f the government's finances, and promoting a participatory approach
         to foster better governance.

COMPONENTS
        AND           COSTS

5.       The project had five components:

     0   Component 1: Strengthening public financial management ($8.2 million, or 42
         percent o f total). Increasing efficiency, transparency, and accountability o f public
         financial management; upgrading and rationalization o f budget cycle, including the
         macroeconomic and public expenditure framework, budget programming, revenue
         mobilization, expenditure circuits, debt and cash flow management, and internal
         control and audit system.
     0   Component 2: Poverty database and strategy ($3.0 million, 16 percent). Analytical
         and policy underpinning for allocating public resources and assessing the impact o f
         public expenditure on poverty reduction. Support to producing and maintaining
                                              102


       poverty database and reporting system, and participatory articulation o f a strategy for
       poverty reduction.
       Component 3: Humanresource development ($1.3 million, 7 percent).
       Implementation o f administrative reform, giving priority to institutional and staff
       reform (organization, job profiles, training, recruitment, incentive system,
       accountability) in pilot economic administrations.
       Component 4: Oversight and control ($1.3 million, 7 percent). Implementation o f
       oversight capacities in the Auditor General's Office and the civil society as well as
       the information and consultation o f the civil society on the implementation o f the
       petroleum revenue management strategy.
       Component 5:-Monitoring economic reform and coordinating capacity building ($3.7
       million, 19 percent). Support to existing institutions in charge o f monitoring structural
       adjustment and coordinating capacity building-primarily in the Cellule Econornique
       o f the Ministry o f Finance.

6.       Neither the primary objective, nor the other PDOs, nor the key performance
indicators, were formally revised during project implementation. However, the Midterm
Review o f July 2003 led to a major financial restructuring-mainly the reallocation of over
$5 million from the public finance management component to supporting the implementation
o f the 2002 Procurement Code, financing construction o f the offices o f a number o f
government agencies, and increasing the amount for monitoring economic reform.

Implementation Experience

 O IO I G
M NT RN AND EVALUATION
7.     The quality o f design o f the project's M&E result framework i s negligible, for the
following reasons:

       Listing 28 performance indicators, o f widely differing importance, i s incompatible
       with the concept of key performance indicators.
       Although it i s normal for institutional development assistance that important
       indicators are process-oriented rather than result-oriented, most o f the performance
       indicators in this project are entirely process-oriented or limited to the completion o f
       studies and submission o f reports.
       Several indicators are too vague to be monitorable (such as "budget control and
       oversight mechanisms").
       Most o f the indicators that are both meaningful and monitorable would be too
       ambitious in any country given the time allowed (such as "implementation o f a
       financial management information system").
       Some indicators are inconsistent with the reality o f extremely limited capacity in
       Chad, candidly acknowledged in the PAD (such as "implementation o f a streamlined
       and simplified budget expenditure system and o f improved procedures for the internal
       control o f expenditures").
       A few are either contrary to good public expenditure management practice in
       developing countries (such as "introducing program budgeting in a budget system
       with basic weaknesses") or to the logic o f the program design (such as "execution o f
                                             103


        the consolidated budget on the basis o f a new nomenclature, whereas the special
        arrangements for o i l revenue management preclude a genuinely consolidated
        budget").

8.      With such deeply flawed design, it i s evident that monitoring and evaluation could
not be implemented, and thus no information could be collected to help inform decisions.

9.      Environmental and Social Safeguards. The project was classified as Category C
under the Bank's safeguard policies, as a technical assistance project that would have no
adverse impacts on the physical and social environment. N o safeguard issues arose during
project implementation.

10.    Fiduciary Aspects. Serious public procurement problems emerged both in Chad
generally and affecting this project, especially after 2004. Arrangements for financial
management were satisfactory, but the government and implementing agencies significantly
delayed the measures required for compliance.

RELEVANCE
11.     Overall project relevance is rated modest at bets. Despite the relevance o f the
project's objective, and the coherence with the program, major flaws in design and loose
implementation arrangements led to serious problems in implementation and proved
responsible for the lack o f achievement o f the objectives.

12.     Objectives. The project objective is fully consistent with the goals o f the Country
Assistance Strategies o f 2001 and 2003, and with the overall program objective o f helping
Chad escape the "resource curse," for which the capacity to manage the o i l revenue and use it
efficiently in pro-development pro-poor activities is critical. However, the articulation o f the
objective was deeply flawed and excessively framed in terms o f inputs.

 13.    Design. As i s evident from their descriptions, the five project components were
extremely broad and ambitious (except the monitoring o f reform component). Although the
generality o f the components was alleviated by the specificity o f the expected outputs listed
in the Project Design Summary, most o f those outputs would require, in themselves, years o f
preparatory activities and sustained support. The project did follow on the earlier Economic
and Financial Management Project (Cr. 1872, closed in June 1996) and the Capacity
Building for Economic Management Project (Cr. 28 18, closed in June 2000), and was
intended as a continuation o f those activities. I t s design reportedly factored in the lessons
learned from those proj ects-the need for clear project objectives, ,government commitment,
availability o f qualified counterparts, giving priority to local capacities, adequate accounting
and procurement in place, continuity and depth o f supervision, adequate budgeting o f
components, and donor coordination "to avoid overtaxing Chad's limited institutional
capacity."

14.    The question arises why some o f these most basic requirements had not been put in
place by the two previous projects. (Indeed, the ICRs o f both the older projects rated their
outcome and achievement o f most objectives satisfactory, which in hindsight raises grave
doubts on the soundness o f those evaluations.) However the previous projects had been rated,
                                                     104


it remained incumbent upon the Bank to assess the capacity situation as it was at the time o f
project appraisal. And, in fact, a strong sense o f realism concerning the very limited capacity
is inherent in the PAD'S listing o f lessons learned, Against this background, it i s difficult to
understand h o w project design could incorporate such a vast agenda o f comprehensive
budgeting and administrative reform to be implemented injust four years-an agenda that
would require at least a decade for proper implementation in a country with greater capacity
than Chad, and a far greater investment that $17.5 million.

 15.      Compounding the design overload, the PAD accent on bringing best practices into
Chad's fiscal management was sharply at odds with i t s clear recognition o f the fundamental
problems o f basic budget preparation and execution systems and severe capacity limitations
in Chad. This i s particularly relevant to the need to ensure investment efficiency-given the
project's role within the broader program that called for a large proportion o f the o i l revenue
to be invested in priority sectors. Chad's "public investment programs" o f the 1990s were
lists o f insufficiently researched project ideas assembled to attract donor funding. The
priority was clearly to focus on improving that process-particularly the nuts and bolts of
project preparation (including recurrent cost estimation), and investment programming of the
basic sort. Instead, the design entailed a "transition from PIP to Sector Expenditure
Programs," that is, from a flawed mechanism that could be improved at acceptable
transaction costs to a more advanced system for which neither basic understanding nor
capacity were in place. This factor alone was in large measure responsible for the
inefficiencies o f the large investment expenditures eventually financed with the massive o i l
revenue. (See the main text.) The underlying paradox is that the project design in effect
assumed that the institutional capacity which the project was aimed to build was already
largely in place.

16.     Finally, the implementation arrangements were insufficiently clear. While the M o F
was responsible for the P F M component and the Ministry o f Planning for the PRSP
component-as i s normal-responsibility for the other components was not clearly assigned.
Some ambiguity was created by the split responsibilities o f the two implementing offices-
the National Capacity-Building Secretariat (SENAREC) and the Economic Cell (Cellule
Economique). And, after project effectiveness, the government created a Technical Cell
                                                                                           91
(Cellule Technique) in the MoF, which simply added an unnecessary administrative layer.

EFFICIENCY
17.     Under the Bank's operational guidelines, an ERR i s not required for technical
assistance projects. However, given the long implementation delays and issues related to
financial management and procurement, the efficiency o f the project cannot be considered
more than modest.

EFFICACY
18.     The project's overall efficacy i s rated as negligible. As noted, the objective o f
"helping Chad to build capacity to implement its petroleum revenue management strategy to
enable it to effectively absorb and allocate expected o i l revenue, and thus pursue the poverty-

91. See the ICR for details (Report No.32710-TD o f October 2006).
                                                     105


reduction objective o f petroleum resources development" was articulated in the following
three goals:

         help improve public resource management;
         help build capacity to increase public expenditure in priority poverty reduction
         activities;
         foster better governance.

Improvingpublic resource management
19.      This first goal was achieved as concerns revenue transparency but not achieved as
concerns expenditure transparency or budget management. The o i l revenue management
arrangements o f the program produced a level o f revenue transparency in Chad nearly unique
in Africa. K e y factors include the obligation o f Exxon, under the legally binding agreement,
to regularly make public the estimates o f o i l liftings and the corresponding f.0.b. export
prices; the verification o f the amounts getting to the Kribi offshore terminal in Cameroon and
associated publication o f the pipeline transit fees; consistency checks with the Citibank-
managed account in London; and, on non-oil domestic revenue, the significant improvements
in the Ministry o f Finance capacity to project tax and non-tax domestic revenues.

20.     Although the continuation o f such transparency in the future i s not assured, it
represents a signal improvement in the management o f public resources-flowing from the
overall program design but also partly attributable to the technical assistance provided under
the project.

2 1.     Little improvement was achieved in public expenditure management. The 2006 PER
Update, the last comprehensive one in the series, flagged the same serious problems
identified by the previous PERs in expenditure programming, budget preparation, and budget
execution without significant action to implement the recommended improvement^.^^ Most
serious was the segmentation o f Chad's budget resulting from the program's earmarking o f
the direct o i l revenue for expenditure in priority sectors. In effect, through the entire project
period, the program caused Chad to operate four different budgets: the oil-financed budget,
the aid-financed budget, the HIPC budget, and the residual domestic revenue-financed
budget-with limited fungibility among them. (See the main text for an explanation.) Thus
constrained, the assistance provided under the project could not be effective in improving the
institutional capacity o f the budgeting system in the long run.

22.     The motive for the earmarking was to ensure an acceptable intersectoral balance in
the allocation o f expenditure and economic balance between investment and recurrent
expenditure. The project itself was expected to fill the capacity gap and achieve both

92. The annual PERs envisaged in the project proved too heavy for government capacity, and were agreed to be
replaced with more targeted annual updates and a full PER only every three or four years. In the event, the 2006
update was the first and last, in view o f the rupture o f 2006 and subsequent lack o f implementation o f the new
measures agreed in the 2006 MOU. (See the main text for a description o f these developments.) The continued,
involvement o f the IMF (in consultation with country and sector Bank staff at headquarters) allowed monitoring
the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and led to certain improvements in the budgeting system-mainly the
closure o f a number o f government bank accounts as a move toward eventual achievement o f a treasury single
account system.
                                                         106


balances by helping formulate "program budgets" in each priority ministry (in line with the
PRSP and consistent with a rolling MTEF), and fostering systematic improvements in
expenditure management through the periodic PERs. However:

          progress in implementing the 2003 PRSP was extremely limited and the formulation
          o f the second PRSP was delayed;
          no MTEF was in fact produced before 2007, two years after project closing;
          ministries' "program budgets" were disconnected from fiscal realities and in any case
          were made inoperative by the several months' delay in putting the budget in place;
          the budget was assembled by the Ministry o f Finance with little meaningful
          participation by the line ministries;
          the sound recommendations o f the PERs, presented with an increasing sense of
          urgency, were mostly ignored, and the efficiency o f expenditure was badly damaged
          by the failure to plan for recurrent inputs along with the large investments-
          producing inoperable physical facilities-and grave weaknesses in procurement,
          financial controls, and audit, as explained in the text.

23.     The only significant improvement during the project l i f e was the installation and
validation o f the debt management database. However, one may attribute to the project
certain improvements in budget preparation even though they took place after the closing
date. For example, in 2007, for the first time, a rudimentary three-year MTEF was put in
place (loosely based on the PRSP that was then being drafted), and meaningful discussions
began between the line ministries and the ministry o f finance on options for expenditure
programs. Unfortunately, while budget preparation has improved somewhat compared to the
situation at the time o f project approval in 2000, budget execution has worsened. Despite
positive steps, including the closing o f a large number o f government accounts, a treasury
single account system remains far from being achieved and-more importantly-the
improved rules and financial management provisions put in place de jure have been de facto
violated routinely and with imp unit^.'^ The extensive technical assistance provided through
the project to improve P F M was largely wasted-in part from the inappropriate design and in
part from lack o f implementation by the government.

Building capacity to increase expenditure in priority activities
24.      This second goal was largely achieved-judging from the actual expenditure
outcomes rather than from any measure o f "capacity to spend." As Table D.2 shows,
although heavily weighted by infrastructure, actual expenditure on the priority sectors
increased substantially, from an annual average o f CFAF 173 billion (including CFAF 98
billion for healtWeducatiodrura1 development) to CFAF 402 billion in 2007 (including


93. T h e introduction o f a computerized financial management information system, attempting to transplant the
one developed in Burkina Faso, resulted only in producing sets o f tables with unreliable and inconsistent data.
Once again, this outcome i s related to insufficient consideration o f the institutional and capacity pre-requisites
for successful introduction o f complex systems. It also confirms the findings o f a later study showing that F M I S
introduction in developing countries has invariably been more fraught, expensive and complex, and has taken
much more time than envisaged. (Diamond and Khemani 2006.) The few countries that successfully
computerized financial management information have done so from a strong foundation o f budgeting, based on
a clear and agreed information technology strategy, gradually, and over a long period.

CFAF 207 billion for healtldeducatiodrural development). Although significantly lower than
the percentage targets agreed in the program (see the text), these are substantial
achievements. It i s difficult, however, to assume that the increased expenditure improved
access to or quality o f actual services important for poverty reduction, in view o f the
investment inefficiency and the other weaknesses in expenditure management mentioned
earlier. (See the text for data on human development indicators showing a lack o f positive
changes during the period.)

Fostering governance
25.     The third goal must be interpreted as limited to public financial governance, as a
small TA project cannot be expected to improve the overall governance climate in a country.
Even when so limited, the three major aspects.of this goal were largely not met. If anything,
the current state o f public financial governance i s worse than at the time o f Board approval in
early 2000:

         Fiduciary risk has not lessened-financial and accounting controls are frequently
         bypassed during budget execution, and the Budget Discipline Court i s practically
         in~perative;~~
         Economy and integrity have suffered from the increasingly frequent violations o f
         procurement regulations and routine recourse to sole-source contracts;95



94. T h i s Cour de Discipline Budge`taire (CDP) has the mandate o f adjudicating violations o f budgetary rules by
budget managers and others with the responsibility to authorize expenditure.
                                                             108


          Financial accountability is very weak. The General Inspectorate o f Finance i s
          uncertain o f its role in practice, in view o f the creation in 2003 o f the Ministry o f
          General State Control and Moralization, and the staff lacks motivation-
          understandably in view o f the inaction after problems are uncovered. And, despite an
          increase in audit activity, the external audit entity (the Chambre des Comptes) is
          hampered by the long delays in producing the budget accounts, lack o f government
          follow-up to audit findings and even difficulties in obtaining from the M o F and the
          Ministry o f Justice i t s authorized operational funding.

OUTCOME
26.     The project's outcome is unsatisfactory. I t s objective was not achieved, and little if
any progress was registered in the subsidiary objectives. This was due to the interplay of
overloaded project design+onflicting    with the very limited capacity-and weak
government ownership, compounded by the negative impact o n institutional capacity from
the revenue earmarking under the overall program, and the frequent changes in team
leadership. Table D.2 summarizes the subratings.

R I S K TO DEVELOPMENT
                    OUTCOME
27.     The risk to development outcome i s high. Both institutional and organizational
capacity remain weak, and fiduciary risk i s likely to increase in the short term with the
unexpected fall in o i l price and thus government revenue in 2009 and 201O-combined with
the pressures to preserve or increase the level o f security and regime maintenance
expenditures, hence risking downward pressures on pro-development, pro-poor expenditure.
Staff skills remain insufficient for efficient budgeting, and motivation has been weakened by
the spreading culture in which fundamental budget, procurement, and financial rules are
broken with impunity.

28.    While the risk is high, o i l revenue will continue to accrue in large amounts over the
foreseeable future. Good development outcomes in the long run are still possible, if the slight
progress actually registered in budget preparation in recent years continues, and is
complemented by urgent improvements in budget execution, monitoring and control-with


95. The Procurement Control Office (Organe de ContrGle des Marches Publics-OCMP) i s proposing the
creation o f a separate authority for public contracting, with private participation. The future of this proposal i s
unclear, and so i s its likely effectiveness.
                                                      109


support from the ongoing multidonor program to strengthen public financial management
and renewed involvement by the Bank in monitoring overall fiscal and expenditure
outcomes. Especially important in this respect will be the constructive and assertive
cooperation o f certain major bilateral partners.

29.     There i s a scenario under which-with continued substantial o i l revenues; a focus on
the basics; recognition o f capacity realities; and most important, a new determination by
government-the experience learned through the Management o f the Petroleum Economy
project and the program as a whole can substantially increase the development effectiveness
o f expenditure and i t s pro-poor profile. The most important steps in this direction would be:

         in budget preparation, to refocus o n sound preparation o f investment projects
         (demand-driven, cost-conscious, and with the requisite balance between capital and
         recurrent inputs);
         in budget execution, to establish a robust treasury single account system, and
         streamline procedures while restoring legality and rule-compliance for all;
         in public financial accountability, to strengthen the autonomy and support the efforts
         o f both the Inspection Ge`ne`rale de 1'Etat and the Chamber o f Audit;
         in participation, to resume effective activity by the CollBge de Contrde, which would
         improve both the quality o f decisions and public support for the government.

BANKPERFORMANCE
30.     Quality o f entry was unsatisfactory, owing to the flaws in project design, insufficient
recognition o f capacity limitations, and inappropriate performance framework. The risk
assessment was partial and inadequate as well, with mitigation measures patently
insufficient, 96 but what is most inconsistent with Chad's realities and the experience o f
similar projects i s the P A D Soverall rating o f risk as modest.

3 1.      Supervision was moderately unsatisfactory. Most Bank staff worked diligently and
with the highest degree o f commitment and competence to try and help achieve the project
objectives, at least in part. Unfortunately, the best efforts at supervision could not have
succeeded given the flaws in project design (and the revenue management provisions o f the
whole program). Moreover, ownership and responsibility o f the task team was not helped by
the assignment o f two high-powered consultants, former Bank senior staff, to de facto
supervisory and direct implementation responsibilities during the first three years o f the
project. (This may help explain the unusually rapid rotation o f task team leaders-six
altogether in the fewer than six years o f the project.) Despite the guidance provided by
competent and committed country and sector management, such lack o f continuity in direct
team leadership cannot be conducive to effective supervision. Nevertheless, after the delays
and financial management difficulties o f the first three years, the Midterm Review achieved
both a sensible reallocation o f funding among the project components and a partial resolution
o f the fiduciary issues.


96. For example, the risk o f a "temporary disparity o f treatment within the civil service" was to be mitigated by
an information campaign, and that o f a failure to "review the Auditor General's mandate" by exposure to
international best practice.
                                                110


32.     Overall Bank performance i s rated unsatisfactory.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
33.      Borrower performance, overall, was highly unsatisfactory. Implementing agencies,
especially the Cellule Economique, did make some efforts to abide by the revenue
management arrangements and to improve budgeting. Their performance was unsatisfactory,
but in large measure for factors beyond their control-primarily political interference.
Government performance was highly unsatisfactory. As in the case o f the program and for
the other projects in the cluster, government commitment appeared very strong during project
preparation but did not translate into effective support during project implementation. Most
telling i s the shortfall in government contribution-less than one-third the promised amount
o f $1.9 m i l l i o n 4 e s p i t e the substantial o i l revenue accruing after 2003, Also, project
oversight was weak to indifferent, with failure to take the basic steps required to put in place
a project financial management system and conduct adequate audits o f proj ect funds.

34.      Government performance was even more questionable concerning the capacity-
building dimension o f the project. The increasing tolerance for r u l e evasion, severe violations
o f basic procurement and financial management procedures, lack o f accountability, and leaks
o f resources between the budget allocations and the intended beneficiaries-all undermined
the efforts o f a number o f committed and competent Chadian public officials and created a
culture o f impunity. Especially instructive, albeit couched in technical language, is the
recommendation in the 2006 PER Update to "progressively improve the arrival o f the
expenditure to the final beneficiary (salaries, operational expenses, construction funds, etc.)."

35.     Compounding the problem, at the same time as grave violations by some were
tolerated the majority o f budget managers and civil servants remained hamstrung by an
antiquated, overly centralized, and extremely burdensome set o f rules concerning budget
execution, the expenditure cycle, and procurement. (In this light, the achievement, after
project closure, o f a number o f minor technical improvements in the formal budgeting system
should be noted, but is insufficient to permit a higher rating.)

Program Description and Results
LINKAGES     CHADSME

a linkage project to support the Chad-Cameroonpipeline project. The SME program had two

97. Through Advisory Services, IFC provides advice to governments, private companies, and industry sectors on how
to grow businesses sustainably as well as to create a positive investment climate, with a focus on five business lines:
Access to Finance, Business Enabling Environment, Environment and Social Sustainability, Infiastructure, and
Corporate Advice.
A S projects are rated on s i x dimensions: (1) Strategic relevance-Did IFC do the right project at the right time?; (2)
Output achievement-Were the products, capital goods, and services delivered?; (3) Outcome achievement-Were
the intended short- and medium-term effects o f the intervention achieved?; (4) Impact achievement-Were the
intended longer-term effects o f the intervention achieved?; (5) Efficiency-Were the costs reasonable in relation to
the potential results?; and (6) IFC Role & Contribution-What was IFC's role and contribution in engaging in t h i s
intervention? Ratings on the first five dimensions are synthesized into an overall rating o f Development Effectiveness.

phases: the pilot phase and the development phase, with the program being more successful in
the second phase. The firstlpilot phase covered the three first years (2002-04) and represented a
comprehensive approach, with three components: capacity building, access to information, and
access to finance, with a total o f nine activities. During the construction phase o f the pipeline
project (2000-03), the SME program received little attention from EEPC19*, which was focused
on the pipeline construction. In addition, the program faced the following challenges: program
design unsuited for Chad; underestimation o f human and financial resources; inadequate l i n k s
between program components; no monitoring and evaluation framework; and no client
ownership. Overall, the pilot phase o f the SME program was not successful.'

3.      During the operational phase o f the pipeline project from 2004 onwards, with the
pressure o f the construction phase deadlines disappearing, EEPCI was more receptive toward a
local supplier development program. EEPCI also wanted to appease the local business
community, which was disgruntled from not being included at all during the construction
phase. The seconddevelopment phase o f the SME program also focused on three components:
entrepreneurship capacity building, business linkages, and access to finance. The SME
program currently focuses on preparing local companies to bid for goods and services contracts
with EEPCI and its subcontractors, through the Enterprise Center (EC).

4.      The EC was created in December 2004-part o f the business linkages component-
as a joint partnership between IFC, the Chamber o f Commerce o f Chad, and EEPCI.99
EEPCI's e-procurement experience in Chad with the EC has now been published as a manual
("Developing a Transparent System for Local Contracting," November 2008,
www.commdev.org). The manual provides a step-by-step guide for SMEs in developing
countries get access to procurement opportunities with large companies through a transparent
system for local contracting, based on the Chadian experience.

5.      In 2005, EEPCI decided to carry out all i t s procurement for Chad (about $300 million
annually) electronically through i t s e-procurement system. This was a challenging task, since
Chad has l i t t l e Internet connectivity, extremely low computer literacy, and sporadic
electricity (as little as one to two hours a day). IFC partnered with EEPCI to make e-
procurement a reality by introducing training related to the e-procurement system at the
Enterprise Center.

6.         The EC has i t s main office in N'Djamena, the capital city, with satellite centers in the
o i l field area (Doba, Moundou, and Sahr). The EC's reach and network has been useful in
conducting an SME mapping exercise that increased the pool o f SMEs that EEPCI could
work with for local procurement. Initially, EEPCI had a l i s t o f only 17 local SMEs, but the
l i s t expanded to more than 1,300 SMEs after the mapping exercise.

7.      Based on current information, the EC has helped 19 local and joint venture
companies get EEPCI contracts worth $33.18 million that have generated 149 jobs. Given
that EEPCI's annual procurement in Chad i s currently about $300 million, there i s significant
potential for Chadian SMEs. These figures also suggest a low level o f "local content" in
EEPCI's supply chain in Chad"' (Cameroon as well), similar to the experience o f other West
African o i l producers like Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Angola.

8.       Based on the EC's successful partnership with EEPCI, it has started to expand i t s
local supplier development work to other clients. In June 2007, UNICEF signed an 18-month
$120,000 partnership contract with the EC to train local entrepreneurs operating in the field
o f water well drilling. The EC intervention will provide UNICEF local supplier identification


99. The EC concept i s being standardizedas Linkage products in other IFC projects (such as Cairn energy,
India).
  In 2008, total spent by EEPCI in Chad was one third o f the total supply chain - $400M for foreign supplies
loo
and $200M for local services & supplies (50% purely local and 50% joint venture).

and evaluation, assistance i s setting up and structuring bids, assistance to SMEs to respond to
bids, and training and consultation to improve the quality o f SMEs.

9.       Under the Community Agricultural Program, the Enterprise Center i s supporting a
poultry initiative to assist people displaced from their land in the O i l Fields Development
Area (OFDA) to become egg producers and sell to EEPCI's caterers, who meet their current
demand (about 70,000 eggs per month) through imports from Cameroon. The poultry
initiative i s currently progressing well, based on supervision reports. There i s also an ongoing
pilot program for growing vegetables for the EEPCI caterer.

10.    The SME program has performed better in the development phase and has
contributed to local private sector development. Overall, the development effectiveness o f
the Chad SME program i s rated mostly SuccessfuI).

FINADEV
      TCHADTA
11.     IFC supported Finadev as a key component o f the Chad SME Initiative that was
launched in June 2000 to help local companies benefit from the economic opportunities
generated by the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project. Finadev was launched in July 2001 as a
specialized window o f Financial Rank Tchad and was the only licensed microfinance
institution in Chad. IFC was one o f the founders o f Finadev and supported the MFI through
$30,000 grant funding in the start-up phase.

 12.     Since inception, Finadev faced significant challenges related to the difficult
investment climate in Chad, inadequate staff capacity, and weak governance. Retention rates
o f clients have steadily declined over time. IFC supported Finadev through various rounds o f
financial restructurings, with a view to reach the underserved SMEs in Chad. However,
operating and financial results continued to be poor and IFC decided to exit the project in
2007, though other shareholders decided to continue operations with new funding.

13.    The development effectiveness o f the Finadev Tchad TA i s rated unsuccessful.

CHADCAPACITYBUILDING
 14.    The Chad Capacity Building project was conceived in December 2004, for an 18-
month period, to provide financial support to the ongoing IDA projects. The IDA projects
were at the heart o f the WBG capacity-building initiatives that had three major themes: (i)
overall management o f the petroleum economy within the public sector bodies in Chad; (ii)
development o f monitoring and supervision capabilities o f environmental and social matters
within the relevant ministries in Chad and Cameroon; and (iii)   SME development through
technical assistance and access to finance in Chad. Given the slow progress in the IDA
capacity-building projects, the WBG adopted a number o f risk mitigation measures in mid-
2004: a full-time coordinator was appointed for all o f the Bank Group's related capacity
building initiatives; additional Bank sector experts were given a clear mandate to spend the
majority o f their time on capacity-building work; and IFC streamlined the SME program to
only those components that had the potential for success.

15. The Chad Capacity Building project was among the first AS projects to receive
FMTAAS funding, the dedicated funding source for AS operations that IFC set up in 2004 to
                                             115


improve the sustainability o f I F C contributions toward A S operations. The Chad Capacity
Building project i s a good illustration o f the close WB-IFC collaboration that marked the
Chad-Cameroon pipeline project as well as the intensity o f WBG supervision efforts. IFC's
role in the program was to secure funds and provide administrative oversight. Since the
activities related primarily to government entities, the WB undertook the tasks regarding
planning, implementation, and supervision.

16.     O f the five components o f the Chad Capacity Building project, three were for
strengthening the operations o f Coll2ge, the independent body mandated to monitor the
allocation and use o f o i l revenue by the government, and one was for placing an o i l expert in
the Ministry o f Petroleum. The original technical advice component for the CollBge was
changed to budget support, used primarily for meeting the travel expenses o f the Coll2ge
members in the oil-producing region to hold meetings with the public.

 17.    The Technical Adviser to the Ministry o f Petroleum was installed in October 2005
only to be recalled in December as a result o f the dispute between the WB and the
government over the latter's unilateral amendment o f the Petroleum Revenue Management
Law. Substantial expenses were incurred, but the objectives o f the Technical Adviser were
not met. Likewise, the Seminar on O i l Economy was discontinued due to the dispute between
the WB and the government. As the training was not fully carried out, the cost incurred for
the only seminar (two were planned) that took place did not provide full value to the
participants. Though the I F C SME-Linkages program received some funding from the Chad
Capacity Building initiative, the results are reported as part o f another AS operation (see
above).

 18.    IFC's support for the Chad Capacity Building project was timely in i t s efforts to
mitigate the perceived risks in the ongoing capacity-building initiatives through the IDA
projects. However, implementation and delivery o f the program were difficult as country
conditions, particularly with regard to security, caused delays and limited the pool o f
consultants. Also, the timely execution o f programs was affected adversely by personnel
turnover in the government.

19.    Overall, the development effectiveness o f the Chad Capacity Building project is rated
mostly unsuccessful.  '




Lessons

20.     Understanding the needs and internal constraints o the client company and a high
                                                             f
degree offlexibility are essentialfor designing effective Advisory Service programs. In the
pilot phase o f the Chad SME program, most o f the activities under the Africare and STEP
(Support and Training Entrepreneurship Program) programs were not relevant to EEPCI.
However, the poultry initiative that was started as an alternative source o f income for people
displaced by the project in the O i l Field Development Area was continued. Also, the S M E
program did not get traction from EEPCI in the first phase, since they were occupied with
meeting the construction deadlines.
                                                116


21.     I n large, complex WBGprojects with multiple stakeholders, good WB-IFC
collaboration is essential. In the case o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project, there was a
high degree o f WB-IFC collaboration that extended to Advisory Services operations as well.
In late-2004, when the WB-supervised (IDA-funded) capacity-building projects were found
to be progressing slower than expected, IFC was able to provide fresh funding for sustaining
the capacity-building initiatives and improve their chances o f success. I t also illustrates well
the intensity o f WBG supervision efforts in the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project.

22.      A strong local institutional partner is critical for success. The weak capacity at the
Chamber o f Commerce o f Chad to internalize the project remains a key challenge for the
sustainability o f the Enterprise Center, the current focal point o f IFC's Advisory Service
operations in Chad. Like many other Chadian institutions, the Chamber o f Commerce i s yet
to complete i t s transition from a dysfunctional, politicized outfit to a consular institution truly
representative o f the private sector. At a broader level, IFC i s committed to provide
institutional support to the Chamber o f Commerce. I t i s expected that in a year's time, the
Chamber o f Commerce w i l l take on a more active governance role in the Enterprise Center's
management.

23.     IFC 's Linkages projects have the potential to: enable local companies participate in
the economic activity created by the project; help sponsors-typically large MNCs-meet
national content needs; andpromote local economic development. In the case o f the Chad-
Cameroon pipeline project, the Enterprise Center became the cornerstone o f EEPCI's
procurement platform that was the sole source for all o f i t s purchases in Chad, starting in
2005, with an annual budget o f about $300 million. The Enterprise Center has helped local
Chadian f i r m s compete successfully for Exxon's procurement contracts. As discussed in
greater detail in Annex A, these effects, together with other direct effects for beneficiaries,
has promoted Local Economic Development.

Summary and Conclusions

24.     IFC's Advisory Service operations have been an ingredient o f the WBG effort to
expand the development impact o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project. The Chad SME
program-the centerpiece o f IFC's AS operations in Chad-contributed to WBG capacity-
building initiatives in the program. Likewise, the Chad Capacity Building project supported
the IDA-funded capacity-building initiatives, which failed. These two Advisory Service
operations are symbolic o f the high level o f WB-IFC collaboration in the Chad-Cameroon
pipeline project and the intensity o f WBG supervision efforts.

25.      The Enterprise Center, which has become the focal point o f the Chad SME program,
illustrates well the internal learning value o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project for the IFC
in subsequent large, complex projects with multiple stakeholders. In particular, i t shows the
symbiotic relationship between the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project and the BTC oil pipeline
project approved in 2003, involving Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, with BP as the lead
private sponsor. While BTC incorporated several important features from the Chad-
Cameroon pipeline project-such as environmental impact assessment, environmental
management plan, consultation, compensation, multiple layers o f monitoring, and future
generations fund, the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project borrowed the Enterprise Center
                                                     117


concept from BTC and has implemented it successfully in Chad, except for the supplier
financing facility.

26.    While local Chadian f i r m s have been successful in getting an increasing share o f
procurement contracts from EEPCI"' through the EC, the overall low level o f local content
remains an issue. In part, this reflects the significant supply constraints in the Chadian
economy. The issue o f l o w local content,i s similar to the nationalization o f expatriate
management issue that IEG-IFC has highlighted in previous evaluations o f African projects.

27.     Overall, the development effectiveness o f IFC's Advisory Services operations in
Chad i s rated mostly unsuccessful.




101. EEPCI's support o f local Chadian companies through procurement and engaging them in the project
supply chain h s generated direct benefits (discussed in greater detail in Annex A) that have contributed to local
              a
economic development. T h i s in turn has the potential to reduce the project's social risk and provide the
necessary social license essential for the long-term sustainability o f the project.

      Object: Borrower's comments on the performance assessment Report
      o f the Program for the Chad-Cameroon petroleum development and
      pipeline construction

The report rates the program outcome as a whole unsatisfactory in light o f the program's
main objective which was to achieve progress in governance and poverty alleviation by means o f
o i l revenues. More specifically, the Government o f Chad's performance o n institutional,
fiscal, macroeconomic and governance aspects have also been considered highly
unsatisfactory. This assessment lacks nuancing, just as the relationship between Chad and the
World Bank did, which ultimately led to the World Bank's unilateral decision to disengage
from the project and the early repayment o f the credits allocated to the Government.
Although it mentions it, the report does not attach sufficient importance to the impact which
multiple attacks that Sudan-armed mercenaries led against Chad had o n the program.
Specifically, the attacks on the capital conducted in April 2006 and February 2008 have
forced the Government to invest massively in the defense o f the national territory and in
reconstruction, affecting temporarily NSPR (National strategy for poverty reduction)
priorities.

Main constraints o f the program

Even if many o f the program risks were identified at an early stage, among these the
"possible spillover from the crisis in Darfur" and "social unrest if the o i l revenue were not
                                             141


used for pro-poor, pro-development activities", the scale o f attacks conducted by the
mercenaries paid by Sudan and the destruction they caused have extensively exceeded the
anticipated risks. Thus, as the report underlines, until 2006 and before the repeated
mercenary attacks, "the budgetary allocations were reasonably close to the agreed
percentages and despite the divergence between budgets and outturns, actual expenditure on
the priority sectors did increase".

Furthermore, the impatience and pressure from the populations, particularly the workers who
expected to derive direct monetary benefits from o i l resources extraction had not been listed
among the potential risks. The social unrests have nevertheless prompted the Government to
agree to an increase in salaries which averaged 15 percent in 2007.

The management o f four different budgets which Chad was requested to maintain, (domestic
revenue-financed budget, oil-financed budget, HIPC budget, aid-financed budget) made
program management more difficult.

The rigidity o f the o i l revenue management mechanism and the World Bank's lack o f
flexibility regarding i t s revision and adaptation to Chad's context became a straight jacket in
which the Government o f Chad could operate only with difficulty.

The unilateral withdrawal and the early repayment to the World Bank, upon i t s request, o f all
IDA and IBRD credits which amounted to US$ 67,5 millions, had repercussions o n the
implementation o f the NSPR2.

Despite the constraints imposed by the Sudan-armed rebel aggressions and the differences in
interpretation and appreciation with the World Bank, one has to point out some tangible
results o f the program.

Program outcomes

In agreement with the report and using i t s terms, the Government considers that the Chad
Cameroon petroleum pipeline and development project has been satisfactory. The WBG
involvement has accelerated project implementation and reassured the main stakeholders.
This project facilitated Chad's access to resources devoted to poverty alleviation and
development actions, even if this impetus was momentarily slowed down by the constant
attacks led by the mercenaries paid by Sudan.

Until 2007, the discussions between the WBG and the Government were constructive. They
allowed the implementation o f a certain number o f initiatives, these include taking into
account the environmental dimension in the o i l fields area, improving budget preparation
even if its implementation remains difficult and, revenue transparency, even if efforts on
public expenditure rationalisation are still needed.
                                               142


Chad outcomes
As the report acknowledges, the social and environmental dimensions o f the petroleum
pipeline and development project proved to be quite satisfactory, the stakeholders
implemented impact mitigation plans, even if not all objectives were attained.

Similarly, the report notes that although comparatively small, the expenditures in the oil-
producing region financed by the 5 percent o f o i l royalties were effectively equivalent to the
agreed rate identified in the o i l resources management mechanism.

I t also acknowledges that the o i l revenue management mechanism accepted by Chad has
shown a "transparency nearly unique in Africa    ...and that habits have been built in the
direction o f openness rather than secrecy", even if raises doubts about Chad's capacity to
pursue this effort following the World Bank's withdrawal.

Even if the targeted 70 percent rate o f expenditures from all budgetary resources allocated to
priority sectors was not reached, the budget share and expenditure effectiveness in priority
sectors have improved steadily. This share rose from 48 percent to 57 percent in the executed
budget o f 2007 (against a budget forecast o f 60 percent).

When the report indicates that "the macroeconomic, poverty reduction, governance, and
institutional development outcomes were disappointing and there i s as yet n o evidence o f the
hoped-for positive improvements", i t does not consider the fact that all these objectives may
only be achieved in the medium to long term, a fact that it implicitly acknowledges.

The report seems surprised by the lack o f efforts to collect data to monitor human
development outcomes and poverty. It ascribes this lack to the substantial delays in the
NSPR2 preparation. In doing this, the authors seem to ignore two elements.

First o f all, there i s no time break between the NSPRl and the NSPR2. NSPRl was
implemented until NSPR2 was adopted. Implementation o f sector strategies was pursued by
the ministries o f priority sectors. Furthermore, there are no fundamental changes between the
two NSPR. The main line o f conduct for the NSPR2 i s to "complete what has been started,
optimize the reforms initiated and improve the outcomes achieved by the NSPRl'I.

Second, several o f the monetary and non monetary poverty alleviation and human
development indicators can only be obtained through surveys. This applies to poverty level,
its incidence and depth, as well as to net enrollment rates and infant and maternal mortality
rates. These surveys are not linked to the NSPR preparation. The last round o f these surveys,
ECOSIT2 and EDST2, without which it remains difficult to assess the NSPR's impact on
poverty alleviation and human development, if one does not wish to speculate, apply to the
2003-2004 period, just the beginning o f the petroleum era. These costly surveys can only be
conducted at long intervals. Consequently, the Government actually plans a third ECOSIT
and EDST survey in 2010-201 1.

Conclusions

Despite the World Bank's withdrawal from the petroleum project, the Government continues
to implement the reforms initiated with it. N o w that it has been able to durably restore
security and peace in the country, the Government i s in a position to improve public financial
management and to achieve i t s poverty alleviation objectives, in particular within the
framework o f the PAMFIP and in its interactions with other development partners.

        The report from the IndependentEvaluation Group (IEG) o f the World Bank (WB) presents a
        retrospective performance assessment o f the Chad-Cameroon petroleum development and
        pipeline construction program supported by the World Bank Group (WBG).

'       The Chad-Cameroon petroleum development and pipeline construction program includes the
        following projects:

            1. Chad &Cameroon: Petroleum Pipeline and Development Project, financed by IBRD
               and the IFC;
            2. Chad: Petroleum Sector Management Capacity-Building Project, financed by IDA;
            3. Chad: Petroleum Economy Management Project, financed by IDA;
            4. Chad: Advisory Services financed by the IFC;
            5. Cameroon: Petroleum Environment Capacity Enhancement Project, financed by IDA.

        After a short summary o f the program background, the report sets out the objectives, the
        expected outcomes and the lessons learned after each project implementation.

        The evaluation results are summarized in the following table.

    6. PROGRAM
Outcome                                                           I Moderately unsatisfactory
Risk to development outcome                                        High
WBG performance                                                    Moderately unsatisfactory
Borrower performance                                               Unsatisfactory




This table shows that wherever Chad i s concerned, neither expected outcomes nor the
borrower's performance (Chad Government) are satisfactory; everything i s more or less
negative.

In conclusion, the evaluation report states that in the case o f Chad, the objective targeted by
the WBG through its financing o f the program has not been reached, namely poverty
alleviation and governance improvement for the best possible use o f the o i l revenues, in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner.

For the IEG, the failure o f the program in Chad i s explained by the lack o f government
ownership and repeated violations o f the basic agreements.

However, the report acknowledges that significant progress was made in the following areas
by the Government o f Chad with World Bank support:

        Social and environmental protection;
   0    Transportation infrastructure;
        Access to clean water;
   0    Management o f the 5 percent o f o i l revenues in the extraction area.



LESSON LEARNED

The report draws the following lessons after i t s negative assessment o f the implementation
o f the Chad-Cameroon petroleum development and pipeline construction program:

    1. Continued Government ownership remains a major factor in project success;
   2.   Despite the involvement o f the World Bank, the program outcome was unsatisfactory.
        Therefore, the World Bank (WB) was not able to help Chad avoid the "resource curse".
   3.   This failure should not prevent the World Bank from supporting other extractive industry
        projects, because mistakes identified in Chad may be corrected.

OBSERVATIONS

After reading the report, we would like to express the following comments:

    1. Page 94: the Comite` `Technique National de Suivi et de ContrGle (CTNSC) was never
       attached to the Ministry o f Mines, Energy, and Petroleum as stated by the report. The CTNSC
       has always been attached to the Ministry o f Environment;

   2. The failure by Chad's Government, the borrower, must be nuanced to the extent that
      Chad faced a difficult security situation on one hand and it identified certain priority
      sectors with which donor agencies did not always agree on the other hand;

   3. Page 50 and 52: Instead o f trying to understand the reasons that caused Chad to be
      involved in permanent hostilities, the report limits i t s e l f to criticize the actions o f the
      Government, who invested part o f the petroleum windfall in the country's defense in
      the face o f external aggressions.

The parts o f the report that only criticize the Chad Government's actions must be revised.
