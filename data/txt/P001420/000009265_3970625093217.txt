PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LIBERIA
LIBERIAN BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
(Loans 1055-LBR and 1323-LBR)
HIGHLIGHTS
The two loans under review were made against the background of
two decades of rapid economic growth, satisfactory operational and
financial performance of LBDI under the first project (Loan 839-LBR),
and an investment environment favorable to private-domestic and for-
eign--sector.  The main focus of the loans was on institution building
of LBDI and providing finance to productive enterprises (paras
3-01-3.02)   LBDI developed into a mature institution and responded to
difficult economic conditions with competence and flexibility.  LBDI
also successfully made a transition from a mixed expatriate/Liberian
management to a fully Liberian management (para 4.02). Considerable
progress was made in achieving the institution building objectives of
the projects, although there is still need for further improvement.
The country environment under which the projects were imple-
mented changed drastically during the period 1979-83 and Liberia experi-
enced a period of unprecedented economic, financial and political
turmoil. The changed environment (a) reduced the demand for investments
which delayed project implementation, (b) forced a number of enterprises
to go out of business and (c) led to declining profitability of the
corporate sector reducing its capacity to service debt (para 2.04). All
of these developments had an adverse impact on the financial condition
and performance of LBDI and the economic benefits from the project
investments. In this respect the experience under this project
underscores the general malaise of DFCs whereby the corporate distress
due to prolonged recession since 1980 caused a significant deterioration
in the quality of the loan portfolio and financial position of a large
number of DFCs.
Other points of interest are:
- LBDI's flexibility in providing loans for rehabilitation and
working capital in response to a changed economic
environment (paras 4.04 and 4.05);
- LBDI's successful efforts at raising foreign currency funds
on international markets (para. 6.06);
- the sharp deterioration in the quality of LBDI's loan
portfolio and financial condition as a result of exogenous
factors (paras 5.08, 5.09, 6.02-6.04);
- the inadequacy of LBDI's loan supervision, and investment
promotion efforts (paras 7.02-7.05).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

LIBERIAN BASK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
(LOANS 1055-LBR AND 1323-LBR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI) was
established in 1965 with the assistance of the International Finance
Corporation which subscribed to 25 percent of the original US$ 1 million
share capital. The Government, IFC and private Liberian investors
(Class A shareholders) hold 51 percent of LBDI's share capital. Other
financial institutions, the Firestone Plantation Company and two mining
companies (Class B shareholders) account for the balance of 49 percent.
A representative of the IFC has been a member of LBDI's Board of Direc-
tors since inception.-
1.02      Although LBDI was initially set up to promote industry and
agro-business, over the years it has become a multi-sectoral institution
with a diversified loan portfolio covering agriculture, forestry, wood
processing, fishing, manufacturing, hotels, tourism and services. LBDI
continues to be the prime source of term loans in the country. A large
proportion of the projects it finances have been for Liberian entrepre-
neurs.
1.03      This report covers the second and the third loans which the
Bank made to LBDI in December 1974 and September, 1976 respectively.
The first loan (Loan 839-LBR), in an amount of US$ 1 million was fully
committed by April 1974 and closed in December 1976, with a total
disbursement of US$995,000. A Project Completion Report (PCR) for Loan
839-LBR was issued by the Western Africa IDF Project Division on March
18, 1978 and a Project Performance Audit Memorandum (PPAM) was issued by
the Operaticus Evaluation Department on June 30, 1978 (Report No. 2133).
The second loan (No. 1055-LBR) of $4 million was closed in December 1980
with a total disbursement of US$3.97 million; the balance US$0.03
million was cancelled. The third loan (No.1323-LBR) is fully committed
and 92% disbursed as of August 30, 1984. It is expected to be closed by
December 31, 1984. At present there are no plans for a follow-up
(fourth) loan for LBDI, due largely to a shortage of IDA resources.

II. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT (1975-1983)
Economic Environment
2.01      Liberia has a population of about 1.9 million, and an annual
per capita income of US$510. I/ The majority of the population is
engaged in subsistence farming. Liberia enjoyed rapid rates of economic
growth in the sixties (over 6.0 per annum) and early seventies (over
4.0Z per annum) due to increases in value-added and output in the iron
ore and rubber sectors and the improvement in the terms of trade. The
growth was heavily dependent on the performance of the foreign-owned
enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines, (b) rubber
plantations, and (c) forestry concessions.  The foreign sector plays a
major role in other parts of the economic life in Liberia. They own
most major manufacturing industries, dominate the banking sector, and
control most of the trade and distribution sectors.
2.02      In 1975-76, the Government formulated its first Development
Plan (1976-1980) which gave priority to economic diversification outside
the foreign enclaves and greater Liberian participation in all economic
activities. Because of the limited scope for further development of
import substitution industries due to the small size of the local
market, greater emphasis was placed on area based integrated agricul-
tural development programs and agro-based enterprises with export
potential.  The Government also aimed at reducing economic dominance by
the enclave sector by promoting schemes aimed at increasing Liberian
participation, while at the same time preserving the "open door" policy
to foreign business. The Plan goals were to be achieved through a
combination of public and private investment. Public expenditures were
mostly devoted to building of physical infrastructure and upgrading
manpower skills. Private, mainly foreign, investment was seen to play
an important role in agriculture, manufacturing and services. The LBDI
undertook to nrovide medium- and long-term loans (in many instances with
the Government guarantee) for investment projects involving the Liberian
public and private investors in large foreign-sponsored timber and agro-
industrial schemes.
2.03      The Plan envisaged an average annual growth rate of 6.8
percent in real GDP. However, because of delays in the implementation
of expected investment in iron ore mining, slackening of demand for the
country's main exports, and diversion of plan allocations towards
non-productive projects, real growth during the 1976-80 period averaged
only about 1.3% per annum. Tne public sector finances worsened during
the plan period due to (i) a large import bill following the unprece-
dented rise in energy prices, (ii) decline in export earnings,
(iii) resource drain caused by inefficient public sector enterprises and
(iv) large debt accumulation in connection with OAU Conference at
1/        GNP per capita L982 using World Bank Atlas Methodology.

Monrovia in 1979. The overall budget deficit which in FY1975 was only
US$4.3 million increased to US$163.8 million in FY1979 or 81 percent of
government revenue, and 16 percent of GDP.
2.04      Against the background of stagnant economic growth and ex-
tremely poc-. state of public finances and prompted by prevailing social
inequities, the Civilian government in Liberia was replaced in April
1980 by a Military government. The Military Government's medium and
long term plans are articulated in its four-year (July 1981 to June
1985) National Socio-Economic Development Plan. The PLan aims at
arresting and reversing the declining trend in the economy, diversifying
the economy, increasing the participation of Liberians in the country's
economy and improving the distribution of income through agricultural
and rural development, promotion of small scale industry and improve-
ments in transport and communication. The plan's performance during the
period 1981-83 has been disappointing. There has been a decline in GDP
each year since 1980. The decline in economy is mainly attributable to
the continuing weak performance of exports. Other major factors for
decline include continued lack of confidence in the private sector,
large budget and balance of payment deficits, and continuing capital
flight.
Financial En-;`unment
2.05      Associated with the poor performance of the economy was the
decline in the total domestic savings rate, drying up of foreign invest-
ment, and a decline in private as well as public sector investment. The
gross domestic investment as a percent of GDP showed a steady decline
from 342 in 1975 to 17% in 1982. During the period 1980-83 the finan-
cial environment rapidly deteriorated as a result of the failure of a
major bank, large budget deficits, accelerated private capital flight
due to a continuing crisis of confidence, serious liquidity problems
experienced by financial institutions, and inability of the Government
to honor its financial obligations and pay its employees on time. The
liquidity crisis in the economy precluded any serious resource mobi-
lization effort and led to frequent dishonoring of financial obligations
in all sectors of the economy - private, government and banking.
2.06      To contain the economic and financial crisis the Government
undertook stabilization programs, with IMF assistance beginning mid
1980, focused on expenditure control, strengthening the external posi-
tion of the National Bank of Liberia, reducing external payments arrears
and improving external debt management. Improvements have been regis-
tered in these areas but the crisis is far from over as export prospects
for iron ore, the leading export, are uncertain, public cor-fidence
remains low, private investment remains sluggish, and the debt burden
remains awesome. The Government is at present discussing a major effort
to begin restructuring the economy with IDA.



-4-
Industrial Sector
2.07      The Liberian industrial sector is smnll and centered on import
substitution activities mainly production of light consumer goods.
Other activities include food, beverage and tobacco. The industrial
sector relies heavily on foreign capital and management. Liberians are
involved in sm.-11 and medium enterprises and service industries.  The
non-Liberians 1,wn and operate most of the large manufacturing industries
and distribution centers. The performance of the industri.al sector
during the period 1975-1983 deteriorated like the rest of the economy.
Capacity utilization fell and labor productivity was low. The political
events of 1980 and their aftermath seriously undermined the private
sector confidence for about two years. After the coup several busi-
nesses were confiscated and many businessmen fled the country.  Only
recently the process of returning the confiscated properties to owners
has begun.
2.08      The 1976-80 Plan gave priority, within the industrial sector,
to an increase in the processing of local raw materials such as timber,
rubber and agricultural products and to production and assembly indus-
tries especially for exports.  These priorities were reaffirmed by the
new Government in 1980. The "open door'" policy to attract foreign
investment was also continued though increased emphasis was to be placed
on involvement of Liberians in the industrial development. The Govern-
ment pursued these objectives through Liberia's Investment Code of 1966,
amended in 1973. which provides liberal investment incentives, including
duty exemption on imported machinery, equipment, and inputs; tax ex-
emptions; rebates on export duties, income and excise taxes on man-
ufactured exports; and other miscellaneous benefits such as accelerated
depreciation. However, the foreign investors were wary of the uncertain
pojitical environment that prevailed immediately after the coup, and
foreign investment in the economy remained low compared to the 1970s.
Agriculture Sector
2.09      Agriculture is the largest sector in the economy contributing
about 32% to GDP. The farm systems are characterized by rubber con-
cessions and oil palm plantations, Liberian owned commercial farms
producing rubber, poultry, and sugar cane, and traditional small subsis-
tence farms. During the period 1974-79 the agricultural sector attained
a growth rate of 3.9% per annum but, like the rest of the economy, its
performance deteriorated since then and the production actually declined
in 1981.
Investment Promotion
2.10      The Government's primary instrument for promoting private
businesses, until 1979, was the Liberian Development Corporation (LDC).
LDC was set up in 1961 as an autonomous public corporation with the
responsibility for identifying, promoting and establishing viable
business enterprises in Liberia. However, due to financial and staff



constraints LDC's effectiveness was limited. In Septevtber 1979, the
Government established the National Investment Commiss1on (NIC) with the
goal of (a) eliminating or reducing the obstacles whicl are perceived as
having discouraged private investment in Liberia in recent years and (b)
administering the incentives provided under the Investrient Code. NIC
absorbed the LDC as well as the Concessions Secretariat from cue Minis-
try of Finance. NIC was retained by the Government which took power in
1980 and its mandate remained basically unchanged. Hcwever, the effec-
tiveness of NIC in achieving its goals was severely hampered by the
overall economic downturn in tue economy, the depressed domestic and
foreign private sector confidence, and the exodus of tTained manpower.
2.11      The promotion of small and medium enterprises (SME) was given
a high priority by the Government under the first Plan and a separate
SME department was established within NIC. The Government also sought
IDA assistance for a SME development project and an IDA Credit
(1076-LBR) was approved in 1980. In 1981. the LBDI in ccnsultation with
the IFC, FMO, the Bank and the Government sponsored a private, autono-
mous development organization for the promotion and financing of small
business enterprises. This organization, named the Small Enterprises
Financing Organization (SEFO), was established in August 1981 and is in
operation since then.
III. DESIGN OF THE PROJECTS
3.01      The second Bank loan to LEDI, in 1974, was made against a
background of two decades of impressive growth of economy, satisfactory
operational and financial performance of LBDI under the first project
(Loan 839-LBR), liberal government policies and incentives for invest-
ments, and a healthy pipeline of investment projects seeking LBDI
assistance. In the area of sectoral policies, interest rates and
investment promotion were identified as the main areas for improvement,
but no specific proposals were made to address them, as it was thought
that an increase in interest rates would follow repeal of the usury law
(which was under consideration of the Government and was later repealed)
and the newly reorganized LDC would be able to improve the investment
promotion effort. The focus of the project was, thus, on (a) institu-
tional development of LBDI, through proposals aimed at improvement of
project appraisal and supervision and better financial planning; and (b)
financing of productive investments in Liberia.
3.02      The third Bank loan to LBDI was appraised in February 1976,
about 14 months after the approval of the second project. At that time
the first loan was fully committed and the second loan was expected to
be fully committed by end 1976. The economic conditions were good,
inflation was declining, and the investment climate was assessed to be
better than the one prevailing in the early 1970's. LBDI loan commit-
ments were increasing rapidly, far exceeding projections. During a
short period of 1973 to 1976, LBDI had moved from a net loss position to
a profitable DFC which started distributing dividends to shareholders
and successfully undertGok a twofold increase in its share capital. The
project's main objectives were: (a) to provide LBDI with foreign



-6-
exchange resources for medium and long-term loans to productive enter-
prises in Liberia; (b) to encourage, through dialogue with the Govern-
ment and LBDI improvements in credit and technical assistance facilities
tor Liberian enterprises; and (c) to provide assistance for the training
and development of LBDI's Liberian staff and for further strengthening
of LBDI's project appraisal and supervision capacity.
3.03      During appraisal of the third project. several weaknesses in
financial and industrial sector policies as well as in LBDI's policies
were recognized and proposals made to address them. These included:
greater autonomy to LDC to improve effectiveness; a study of credit
guarantee and technical assistance schemes for small scale enterprises;
annual review of LBDI's lending interest rate according to criteria
acceptable to the Bank; a program of staff development and training for
LBDI staff; modification of LBDI appraisal guidelines to include pro-
curement, environmental impact and sensitivity analysis; and improved
quality of follow-up work and client assistance through staff training.
The financial policy constraints on domestic resources mobilization as
well as limited opportunities for LBDI to mobilize domestic resources
were noted, but no specific measures were proposed under the project to
address them, since it was realized that there was little LBDI could do
in this area within the existing financial systems.  The main focus of
the Bank's sectoral policy proposals included strengthening of invest-
ment promotion activities and development of small scale enterprises
through credit guarantee and extension services.
IV. LBDI'S ORGANIZATION AND POLICIES
Capital, Management, and Organization
4.01      During the period under review (1977-83) 7/  the ownership
structure of LBDI did not change significantly. It continued to be an
autonomous corporation whose shareholders comprise the Government,
Liberian citizens and corporations, and IFC (Class A shareholders) and
foreign institutions (Class B shareholders). In terms of LBDI charter
Class A shareholders will always represent a majority of the total
voting capital. At end 1983, the Class A shareholders controlled 52.81Z
of capital compared to 50% share at end 1976. The authorized share
capital of LBDI was increased in 1976 from $1 million to $5 million and
was further increased in January 1979 to $10 million. The paid-in share
capital increased from $250,000 at end 1975 to $4.6 million at end 1983.
The share holdings of LBDI continued to be international in character
with IFC and foreign financial institutions, such as Citibank, Caisse
Centrale, European Investment Bank, owning nearly two-thirds of the LBDI
stock.
2/   The PCR for the first loan covered the period 1972-76 (para. 1.03).



- 7 -
4.02      The LBDI managem'nt underwent a change after the coup in 1980,
following a seven-year (1973-1980) period of stable and dynamic leader-
ship. The new government proposed and LBDI Board approved the appoint-
ment of a Liberian (an ex-Minister of Finance) to the post of Presi-
dent. However, the newly appointed President left after about 9 months
and in Mar' a 1981 the incumbent General Manager was promoted as the
President of LBDI. The incumbent comptroller was also promoted as the
General Manager and, for the first time since LBDI's inception in 1965.
the top mnnagement became fully Liberianized. The new LBDI management
provided a strong element of continuity in policies and procedures,
performed competently in the face of difficult economic conditions, and
succeeded, with the help of the international composition of the Board,
in keeping the Government interference to a minimum.
4.03      During the period 1977-1983 there were no significant changes
in LBDI's organizational structure though in late 1980 a proposal to
merge LBDI and Agriculture and Cooperative Bank was seriously con-
sidered. The justification for the werger was to unify development
tinancing within one institution and to provide LBDI access to deposit
resources. The proposal was opposed both by the Bank and the IFC on the
grounds that it would financially and organizationally weaken LBDI and
would not enhance efficiency of development financing. The Government
agreed not to pursue the matter further.
Operational Policies and Procedures
4.04      The following significant policy and procedural changes were
introduced during the period 1977-83: (i) refinancing operations and
working capital loans were permitted according to the guidelines ap-
proved by the Board; (ii) charter was amended to allow LBDI to finance
public sector projects up to an amount equal to 45Z of total cumulative
commitments; (iii) loan granting power of the management and the Execu-
tive Committee were doubled; (iv) a soft-loan fund (authorized amount of
$1 millicn) was set up to finance small scale enterprises; (v) Promo-
tional Expenses Fund of $50,000 was set up to promote viable businesses;
(vi) detailed criteria for determining provisions against doubtful loans
were adopted, and (viii) a Project Implementation and Supervision
Department was created and given the responsibility for follow-up and
loan recovery.
4.05      The above changes illustrate tne responsiveness of LBDI to the
changing economic and business environment and the evolving problems in
its operations. However, no signiticant change was made in LBDI's
policy on collateral requirements, which was noted and criticized for
its strictness in the PPAR for the first project (Loan 839-LBR). LBDI
continued to justify the strict policy on requiring first mortgage on
fixed assets of significant value in light of the uncertainties of
business environment in Liberia and to ensure borrowerts commitment to
the project. The experiences since 1980, where LBDI, in some cases, has
been able to recover its loans from sale or lease of fixed assets of
borrowers seems to vindicate LBDI's position on collaterals. However
the experience since 1980 also has revealed the difficulties and high



-8-
cost of liquidating fixed assets to recover loans. The mixed experience
has pushed LBDI to give renewed and stronger emphasis to seek potential-
ly viable investment projects through intensive industrial promotion
efforts and the strengthening of loan supervision and follow-up work.
Both of these aspects were insufficiently pursued through the period
under review, in spite of persistent pressure by the Bank supervision
missions.
4.06      At the time the second Bank loan was made to LBDI, its inter-
est rate on loans was 10Z plus a 1.5% service charge. It also charged a
commitment fee of 1% on undravn balances. During the negotiations of
the third loan it was agreed (recorded in the Minutes) that LBDI would
undertake annual studies of its lending rate and would consult the Bank
on the criteria to be used in reviewing the rate. In September 1976
LBDI revised its interest rate structure and introduced a two-tier
structure of interest rates: 10% per annum on loans of less than 3-year
maturity and 112 on loans of 3-year and longer maturity: the service
and commitment charges remained unchanged. During supervision missions
the on-lending interest rates charged by LBDI were discussed but no
upward adjustment was considered necessary since the inflation rate
declined from 202 in 1976 to 8-9% during 1978-79 and LBDI obtained
adequate spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates to cover
costs. However, the situation changed in 1980 and inflation edged up
and the cost of resources available to LBDI also increased substantial-
ly.  In 1981, LBDI reviewed its interest rates and other charges and
increased them from 10-11z to 13-15% per annum on term loans and 19% per
annum on working capital loans, plus a service charge of 1.5% and
commitment fee of 1.5% on undisbursed amounts.
4.07      There have been no further changes in interest rates on loans
since 1981. During the period 1981-83 the average cost of long-term
borrowings of LBDI ranged from 6.8 to 7.2Z whereas the average yield on
loan portfolio ranged from 10.3 to 11.4%. Tne spread available ranged
from 3.3 to 4.6% and was barely sufficient to cover the administrative
expenses which ranged from 3.7 to 4.0% of average total assets. 3/
Taking the provisions made into account the interest rates charges were
3/        The administrative costs of LBDI at 4% of the average total
assets during the years 1982 and 1983 were unusually high for
a DFC. This, hopefully, is a temporary situation brought
about by (i) doubling of public sector employee wages in
1980-81 which necessitated salary increases by LBDI to retain
staff, and (ii) slower than anticipated growth in lending
activities due to adverse economic conditions. LBDI has taken
steps to control the administrative costs while expanding
volume of business so that the administrative costs as
percentage of average total assets would gradually decline to
an acceptable level of 2-2.5% which was prevailing during the
period 1977-79 (Table 6).



inadequate to cover all costs and were also negative ir real terms.
However, due to its expanded capital resources on whicb- no dividend was
declared during 1981-83 the LBDI was able to keep the 1.jss in 1981 to
only $74,000 and realize profits of $322,000 and $472,(J0 in 1982 and
1983 respectively. During 1983 LBDI also raised commission rqtes on
guarantees which helped improve its profits. The profit situation
helped LBDI avoid the need for raising interests rates which was polit-
ically difficult to do and could have adversely affected new business in
the difficult investment climate in the country.
V. LENDING OPERATIONS
Overall Lending Operations
5.01      The volume of LBDI's total loan approvals flu.-tuated over the
period 1977-1983 (Chart 1). It exceeded the projected levels during
1977 and 1978, fell short during 1979-1982 period owing to the economic
and political difficulties and the liquidity crisis affecting the
country, but exceeded projections during 1983 mainly due to increased
amount of short-term lending. The actual amounts disbursed were signi'-
icantly lower than both the amounts approved as well as the projected
disbursements. The main reasons for this included unstable business
environment, depressed investor confidence, and liquidity crisis which
led tn withdrawal of several approved projects. In terms of size of
loans, about two-thirds of total number of loans approved during 1977-83
were below $50,000 each. However, several large loans of more than
$200,000 each were also made and accounted for more than 50% of the
total amount of loans approved during 1977-83 period (Table 6).
5.02      The business environment in which LBDI operated during the
period 1979-83 was characterized by weak investment climate, a liquidity
squeeze in the financial system, the disruptions and damage to business
during the 1979-80 political upheaval, and the low levels of capacity
utilization in the industrial sector. LBDI responded to the changing
environment by providing an increased number of short-term and mod-
ernization and rehabilitation loans (Chart 1). Thus the share of new
projects in total loans approved decreased from 76% in 1977 to 17% in
1983 while the modernization and working capital loans increased from
29% to 83%. In recent years (1982-83) more than 50% of number of loans
approved were for working capital, representing about one-third of the
total loan amounts approved.
5.03      The sectoral allocation of the total amount of loans approved
shows that the loans were fairly evenly distributed among the man-
ufacturing, services, agriculture and construction sectors (Chart 2) and
in case of more than two-thirds of the loans the sponsorship was 100%
Liberian (Table 6). The investment projects for manufacturing were
typically large and involved foreign investors, while services and
-;riculture investment projects were small and Liberian sponsored.
Overall the LBDI was able to build a reasonably diversified loan portfo-
lio.

5.04      During the period 1977-83 LBDI approved 314 loans with a total
cost of $122 million of which LBDI's share of financing was $41 million
(33%) (Table 15). Most of the investments were in the private sector.
LBDI did not calculate employment effect in all cases but for a limited
number of projects for which the information was compiled the typical
average coF per job was about $8-12,000. This would suggest that over
10,000 jobs were created during the period 1977-83.  Considering that a
total of 672,000 persons were employed in Liberia in 1980 the marginal
impact of LBDI-assisted projects was significant and in all probability
made a positive difference of 1-2% in the nation's employment, but
substantially more in the private sector outside agriculture.
Use of Bank Funds
5.05      The two Bank loans were used to finance a total of 129 sub-
projects (Tables 10 and 11). Estimated total cost of the subprojects
was $39.3 million, with LBDI's total contribution amounting to $14.5
million i.e. 37% of total cost. Bank funds were used to refinance about
75% of LBDI loans or 28% of the total cost of the subproiects. In terms
of size 57Z of the sub-loans were of less than $25,000 but a significant
number, 20% were of more than $200,000 each for larger subprojects
(Tables 12-14 ). These larger subprojects involved foreign investment
in association with Liberian investors. In comparison with overall size
distribution of LBDI loans, the Bank funds were used for relatively
bigger projects reflecting their higher direct foreign exchange require-
ments. The sub-loans were almost equally distributed among the agricul-
ture, manufacturing and the service sectors (Chart 3). About two-thirds
of the total number of sub-loans went to 100% Liberian-owned enterprises
while the balance of one third went to majority foreign-owned enter-
prises. As was the case with the overall lending of LBDI, more than
halt the sub-loans were for expansion and modernization/ rehabilitation
of enterprises while 37% of subloans were for new subprojects (Chart 3).
Distribution of Bank funds generally followed the loan demand pattern as
it emerged. An amount of $0.55m out of Bank loan proceeds was used to
finance overseas training of LBDI staff ($0.15m) and construction of
LBDI building ($0.4m).
5.06      The pace of commitments and disbursements under the Bank
projects was slower than anticipated (Chart 4, Tables 8-9) and the
closing dates had to be extended by 18 months for the second project and
36 months for the third project. The appraisal forecasts of pace of
implementation were justified given LBDI's performance under the first
project as well as the upbeat economic environment then prevailing. The
economic and political crises of 1979-83, which was the main reason for
slower than projected project implementation could not have been antic-
ipated at the time of the project appraisal. An additional factor which
caused delays in project implementation related to the Bank's disburse-
ment practices. In mid-1978 LBDI requested the Bank to make disburse-
ments in US$ instead of other hard currencies. The basis for this
request was that Liberia used US$ as its currency and use of other hard
currencies, which at that time were appreciating against the US$, posed
a significant foreign exchange risk which the investors in Liberia

were not willing to take. Due to its overall policy constraints the
Bank was not able to accommodate LBDI's request. Under the circum-
stances LBDI gave priority to use of its other lines of credit which had
more attractive terms and some iavestors cancelled their projects rather
than take the risk. This situatio. continued for about 12 months and
preject implementation suffered till the Bank introduced the Gurrency
Basket Scheme in 1979 and the LBDL started utilizing the Bank funds.
The deteriorating economic conditions since 1979 caused further delays
in the project implementation.
Performance of Subprojects
5.07      The repayment performance of the sub-loans under the Second
and the Third Projects mirrored the deteriorating performance of LBDI's
overall loan portfolio (para. 6.03). Out of 54 sub-loans made under the
Second Project, 29 (55%) had been fully repaid as of June 30, 1984, 3
were being paid on time, and 22 were in arrears. Out of the 29 fully
repaid subprujects 16 firms are still in business while the reaining 13
have gone out of business. Similarly out of the 25 loans still on
LBDI's books 11 have gone out of business while 14 are still in busi-
ness. For 15 out of the 25 still active loans LBDI has initiated legal
action to recover the loans. Under the third project out of a total of
75 loans a significant number of them were made in the last 2-3 years
and it is too early to analyze their performance. Nevertheless some of
the earlier loans are in arrears and for a few of them, legal action has
been initiated to recover the loans.
5.08      The unsatistactory performance of subprojects raises questions
about the quality of project selection, appraisal and supervision as
well as the adequacy of investment promotion efforts by LBDI; these are
discussed in paras 7.01 to 7.06. However, the main reasons for the
unsatisfactory loan repayment performance and high rate of business
failures (24 out of 54 firms assisted under the Second loan went out of
business) lie in the economic and political crisis in the country since
1979. Many of the LBDI's clients lost property during the coup in 1980
and some even lost their life while some others left the country. At
one stage 20X of the LBDI's loan portfolio was affected by these devel-
opments. Those firms which stayed in business saw their market dwindle
or disappear due to the economy's decline, capital flight and liquidity
crisis.  The liquidity crisis also caused many of LBDI's clients, who
otherwise probably would have repaid the loans, to default and hold onto
the±r liquid assets. The breakdown of local check clearing system among
banks in 1982-83 meant that the only form in which LBDI could accept
repayments was in cash. This compounded the debt recovery problems.
Nevertheless, LBDI deserves credit for making determined efforts to
recover loans and try novel approaches (para. 6.04).
5.09      The effect of the downturn in the economy on the corporate
sector is illustrated by a review of the financial performance of 5 out



- 14 -
of 25 firms assisted under the Second Project and still in business 4/
(Table 16). The analysis shows that the profits of these enterprises
declined significantly and in some years losses occurred, as their sales
as well as profit to sales ratio declined. The return on average equity
as well as the average total assets also declined. The significant
decline in profitability severely handicapped the capacity of businesses
to service their loans from LBDI and led to a rapid build-up of loan
defaults. Some of the businesses suffered loss of property in the 1979
riots and had to seek loans from LBDI for reconstruction/rehabilitation.
LBDI was responsive to their request. A comparison of LBDI's financial
projections and the actual results shows that the actual performance was
substantially below the projections. This is to be expected considering
that there has been a decline in GDP of Liberia in every year since
1980. Nevertheless the projections made by LBDI were optimistic.
5.10      Overall, the financial resources provided through Bank lending
appear to have generated mixed results for the subborrovers and the
economy.  The sectoral distribution of subprojects and types of invest-
ment financed were well diversified and in line with Liberia's develop-
ment objectives. About half of the subprojects financed under the
Second LBDI Project realized returns sufficient to repay their loans,
inspite of unprecedented adverse financial, economic and political
circumstances in the country. At the same time, the other half of the
subprojects could not survive the adverse conditions and ran into
financial difficulties and arrears. It is noteworthy that ir. many of
the loans in arrears partial repayments were made, suggesting that the
willingness and ability to pay was initially there but changed circum-
stances caused default. In general the financial returns to businesses
were severely depressed and the rate of business failures was very high.
Thus, due to adverse macro-economic conditions, the subproject perfor-
mance was less than satisfactory.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF LBDI (1977-83)
6.01      Financial Condition.  LBDI's assets grew at an average annual
rate of about 6Z over the period 1977-83, which was lower than the
projected growth rate; as of December 31, 1983 the total assets amounted
4/        The number of subprojects examined is small but discussions
with LBDI staff and Liberian businessmen indicate that the
financial results of these 5 cases and the conclusions drawn
from them have widespread validity and are unlikely to change
even if a larger number of subprojects were reviewed. Most of
the businesses in Liberia do not keep records adequate to
permit ex-post evaluation of economic peiformance and LBDI
does not collect data on actual performance of its
subborrowers on a regular basis.

to $34 million (Table 2). The current ratio fluctuated but stood at a
satisfactory 1.8:1 as of December 31, 1983 as compared to 1.7:1 in 1977;
the long-term debt-equity ratio fluctuated between 3.1:1 to 4.8:1 and
was well within the agreed limit of 7:1 agreed with the Bank. (Table 3)
The total debt/equity ratio at end of 1983 was 4.8:1 and LBDI can be
considered adequately capitalized.
6.02      Profitability.  Until 1979 LBDI improved its profitability and
declared dividends. In fact, the profits and dividends both exceeded
projected levels (Table 1). However, the political events of 1980 and
the economic and liquidity crisis affecting the country since then, had
a severe adverse impact on LBDI's profitability. In 1980 about 20% of
LBDI's loan portfolio was affected by executions or detention ot its
clients. This necessitated an unprecedented increase in provisions for
doubtful loans; an amount of $1.96 million wdS allocated to provisions
compared to a combined total of $500,000 provision for the three year
period 1977-1979. As a result, in 1980, LBDI's operating profit before
provision of $0.9 million was turned into a net loss of $1 million after
provisions. In 1981 a further $0.74 million was tllocated to provisions
for doubtful loans, converting a profit before provisions of $0.59
million into a net loss of $0.15 million. During the period 1981-83
LBDI's profitability was squeezed by inc-reases in administrative ex-
penses following an upward adjustment in salary structure of employees
approved in 1981 and rising costs of foreign borrowings. However, a
reduced level of provisions ($237,000 in 1982 and $482,000 in 1983). a
deliberate increase in commissions and commitment fee charges during
1983, and strict control of administrative expenses in 1983 enabled LBDI
to realize net profits after provisions of $0.32 million in 1982; and
$0.47 million in 1983. Overall the financial management of LBDI, during
the difficult period of 1980-83 was both prudent and competent and is
indicative of a maturing of the institution. LBDI's board played a
significant role in monitoring the financial condition of LBDI and
providing the guidance as needed. The Bank supervision missions moni-
tored the financial condition of LBDI closely and pressed for remedial
actions.
6.03      Arrears.  While there was a marginal decline in the quality of
LBDI's loan portfolio during the period 1977-79, it took a deep plunge
in 1980 from which it has yet to recover: the proportion of loans
outstanding affected by arrears increased from 8% in 1977 to 13Z in
1979 and jumped to 31% in 1980 and stood at 37% at end 1983. Similarly
total arrears as % of total loans outstanding increased from 5% in 1977
to 27% at the end of 1983 (Table 4). To a large extent, the portfolio
problems of LBDI reflected the increasing level of financial distress in
the corporate sector in Liberia (para. 5.09). The deteriorating finan-
cial and economic conditi_ns (mainly due to factors exogenous to
Liberia) adversely affecced the profitability of businesses, and many
enterprises were unable to service their debts. The inadequacies in
LBDI's subproject selection criteria as well as appraisal and super-
vision procedures contributed to the severity of the portfolio problems.



- 17 -
6.04      In response to growing portfolio problems LBDI took several
measures. Since 1980 LBDI started classifying its loans outstanding in
seven categories on basis of status of recoveries and probability of
full or partial recoveries. The policy for making provisions was also
revised in 1982 and made clearer by linking the provisions to aging of
cash collection, operational viability of project, and quality of
security. Depending on above, the provision rates varied between 5% to
80% of the outstanding loan amount. As of December 31, 1983 provisions
for doubtful debts were 11% of total loans outstanding and 40X ot total
amount of arrears. The level of provisions was considered adequate by
LBDI management and the auditors. The arrears situation of LBDI remains
serious but LBDI management and Board monitor it closely and devote
considerable efforts to improve loan recoveries. LBDI also initiated
some novel approaches for Liberia in its loan recovery effort. For
instance, in a few cases where the owners of a factory left the country
or died LBDI took possession of the factory and leased it to new opera-
tors and used the income from the lease to amortize the loan. Similar-
ly, in cases where residential or commercial buildings had been taken as
security, LBDI took legal action to either sell the property or arranged
for its rental, using the sale or rent proceeds to recover the loan.
These actions helped enhance LBDI's image as a tough banker willing to
take firm action to recover its loans. The Bank supervision missions
attached considerable importance to monitoring the quality of LBDI's
loan portfolio and continually emphasized the need for field supervision
and follow-up.
6.05      Audit.  LBDI accounts were audited in a timely manner in
keeping with international standards by Coopers & Lybrand, Monrovia, a
member firm of Coopers & Lybrand (International). The accounts were
certified without qualifications for all years except 1980 and 1981.
For these years the auditors qualified their opinion in view of difti-
culties of determining the realizable value of certain collateralized
assets in case of some overdue loans. However, in 1982 the difficulties
were resolved and provisions consistent with generally accepted account-
ing principles were made and the 1982 and 1983 audit reports were issued
without qualifications. The audit reports were submitted to the Bank in
a timely manner.
6.06      Resource Mobilization.  During the period 1977-83, the total
incremental term resources mobilized by LBDI amounted to $19.75 million,
of which 86% had been mobilized from foreign borrowings, 5% from domes-
tic borrowings and 9% in the form of additional equity (net of increase
in paid up share capital and retained profits or loss and reserves).
The above amounts do not include the second and third Bank loans since
these were approved before 1977 though the entire amount of these loans
- $11 million - was disbursed during 1977-83. The PPAR for the first
loan had highlighted the inability of LBDI to mobilize domestic re-
sources and noted the limited opportunities for domestic resource
mobilization. LBDI made some efforts in 1977-78 to attract deposits
from domestic sources and obtained short-term deposits of about $10
million from institutional sources. However, this could not be sus-
tained in the worsening liquidity position in the economy and the



- 18 -
deposits steadily declined from a high of $7.85 million at end 1977 to a
low of $0.3 million at end 1980. Since then LBDI was able to increase
the deposits to $2.2 million at end 1983 and they accounted for about 6%
of total resources at end 1983. Overall the opportunities for any
substantial resource mobilization domestically continued to be bleak
during the period 1979-83 in view of capital flight, loss of savers
confidence in the banking system following failure of a major domestic
bank, liquidity crisis in the economy, and worsening public finances
which precluded any significant funding from Government sources.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES
Project Appraisal
7.01      LBDI's appraisal procedures were considered acceptable when
the second and the third Bank Loans were made, though some weaknesses
were noted which were to be overcome through staff training (financed by
the Loan proceeds) and Bank reviews of subprojects. During implementa-
tion, LBDI made several efforts to improve the quality of project
appraisal. Tnese included training of staff (financed by proceeds of
the third Loan), an in-house seminar on appraisal techniques organized
with the help of Bank, and issuance of guidelines for appraisals. As a
result there was some improvemenz in the quality of project appraisals,
though weaknesses, particularly in the evaluation of market prospects
and economic merits of the investments, persisted. LBDI tried to
address this by undertaking sensitivity analysis of market prospects.
Both the Bank and the LBDI Board kept up the pressure on LBDI, to
Improve the quality of project appraisals, by seeking addition-
al information and clarifications. LBDI management feels that the
quality of its appraisals is satisfactory and is the best possible given
the lack of reliable market and economic statistics and uacertain
economic environment in Liberia.
Supervision
7.02      During the appraisal of LBDI for the second and the third Bank
Loans, project supervision activities were emphasized as needing partic-
ular attention and during the negotiations for the second Loan LBDI
agreed to upgrade their standards. LBDI took action and set up a
separate follow-up and Client Assistance Unit in the Projects Depart-
ment. However, the supervision work continued to be neglected in favor
of the appraisal work. In 1980, the appraisal and supervision were
separated into a Project Supervision and Implementation (PSI) Department
and a Project Appraisal Department.
7.03      The creation of the PSI department improved the follow-up work
somewhat but the loan closing and disbursement authorization activities
of the department dominated at the expense of field visits to clients.
Field visits were generally made when the loan fell in arrears with the
objective of loan recovery. Regular supervision visits to clients, in
LBDI's view, are not cost-effective. However the experience of many
DFC's shows that the benefits of regular field contact with clients



- 19 -
outweigh the costs, which through efficient handling can be minimized.
Regular follow-up would have enabled LBDI to get an early warning about
the problems experienced by many of its clients and initiate remedial
measures.
Investment - omot4on
7.04      LBDI played a low-key role in investment promotion since it
was considered to be in the domain of the Liberian Development Corpo-
ration until 1979 and the National Investment Commission since (para.
2.10). LBDI's efforts in this area consisted of: (i) creation of a
fund to promote businesses (para. 4.04); (ii) helping establish a Small
Enterprises Financing Organization (para. 2.11); (iii) several equity
investments to promote joint venture and Liberian investment projects;
and (iv) a deliberate effort in 1976-79 to finance indigenous con-
struction industry. Until 1979, LBDI continued to receive large numbers
of investment proposals and realized good growth in loan disbursements.
The subproject selection criteria followed by LBDI to screen the walk-in
applicants were not well defined and did not include a detailed economic
evaluation and assessment of longer-term viability of the business
proposed. LBDI feels that it it had applied a very strict subproject
selection criterion it would have had to decline a much larger number of
subprojects than it did, which in turn would have caused increased
problems for LBDI as it was already under criticism for being too
conservative. A vigorous investment promotion effort would have enabled
LBDI to improve the quality of subprojects selection and avoid the
conservative label. The lack of investment promotion and rigorous
subproject selection criteria contributed to the loan portfolio problems
ot LBDI
7.05      Since 1980, the number of proposals reaching the LBDI fell
sharply; they were smaller in size, and in many instances, were not for
purposes/terms consistent with the various lines of credit available to
LBDI. In addition, the expectation that LDC (and later NIC) would
adequately perform investment promotion work and provide LBDI
with bankable investment projects did not materialize due to internal
weaknesses of these organizations, as well as the recent poor investment
climate in the country. The slowdown in volume of business has prompted
LBDI to take a more aggressive role in industrial promotion. LBDI is
considering establishing a Project Identification and Promotion Cell to
pursue project ideas from private, government, and foreign/domestic
institutional sources. It is also considering joint financing of (i)
investment projects with other banks and (ii) area development projects
in Liberia where bilateral/international financing has been approved. A
general improvement in investment climate in the country would be an
essential prerequisite for success of LBDI's efforts for investment
promotion.
Resource Mobilization
7.06      LBDI was successful in mobilizing resources from foreign
sources (para. 6.06) but was not able to raise any significant funds



- 20 -
locally. With the increase in short-term lending the need f r local
funds increased sharply since most of the foreign lines of credit did
not allow short-term financing. However, the opportunities for domestic
resource mobilization were severely limited and, since 1980, further
deteriorated (para. 2.05). In addition, LBDI was further constrained by
its mandate which precluded it from competing with commercial banks.
Nevertheless, two proposals to involve LBDI in resource mobilization
activities were considered. The first proposal, considered by the Board
(in 1978) was to open a commercial window at LEDI to take deposits from
public and perform commercial banking activities. Approval was given
for LEDI to take deposits from its existing clients only, as it was
thought the comercial activities would overshadow the term-lending and
would distract from LBDI's main purpose and would constrain LBDI's staff
availability. The second proposal was to merge LBDI and ACDB which would
have provided LBDI with the deposit resources.  This proposal, on
careful evaluation, was found to be not in the interest of LBDI since
the negative financial impact of the problem-ridden loan portfolio of
ACDB outweighed the benefits from the deposit resources (para. 4.03).
Given the importance of domestic resource mobilization for LBDI 's
long-term viability, much more determined efforts should have been made,
particularly in the period 1972-79, to establish LBDI in the savings
market.
7.07      The macro-economic and institutional constraints notwithstand-
ing, the LBDI made efforts and was able to mobilize some resources
domestically (from non-governmeat sources) through short-term borrowings
from institutional sources. The volume of these borrowings, in 1982 and
1983, was in excess of L$2 million. LBDI expects te -obilize increased
amounts of funds through short-term borrowings domestically, as the
e-onomLc conditions improve.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      Both the Second and the Third Projects were approved against
the background of two decades of impressive growth of the economy,
impressive operational and financial performance of LBDI, and government
policies favoring private foreign and domestic investments. During
implementation the environment changed drastically with adverse impact
on the financial condition and performance of LBDI as well as its
clients.  Ilr unstable economic conditions and political changes during
the period of proj...ct implementatiou, resulted in a number of businesses
being closed or changing ownershlp. These overall economic factors
reduced the development impact of the projects in relation to what would
have been in normal economic conditions. The medium- to long-term funds
provided under the projects, together with other foreign lines of credit
to LBDI, represented virtually the only term resources available in the
country for the private sector. The role the projects played in the
economy was, therefore, substantial.
8.02      The specific project objectives of institution building of
LBDI and strengthening of investment promotion and small scale enter-
prise development systems were reasonable and well conceived at the time



- 21 -
of appraisal. The lack of emphasis on domestic resource mobilization
and the related financial policy reforms, viewed in the context of then
prevailing economic conditions and institutional framework, appear
justified. The projects were implemented at a slower pace than antic-
ipated during the period 1975-79 due to problems associated wit'a curren-
cy disbursement systems. They were further delayed by the political
events of 1979-80 and the general decline in economic activity thereaf-
ter. The loan proceeds were used to finance investuent projects in a
variety of sectors. The economic impact of these investments appears to
be less than satisfactory since a number of the projects were disrupted
by the economic upheaval in the country in 1980 and the economic crisis
thereafter.
8.03      LBDI recorded an impressive growth in its operations and
profitability during the period 1977-1979. However, since 1980, the
economic recession and consequent liquidity crisis in the economy
adversely affected the quality of LBDI's loan portfolio as well as the
volume of new business. LBDI demonstrated its maturity and institution-
al strength by responding to the changes in the economic environment in
which it operated. It undertook a thorough review oL its distressed
accounts and granted rehabilitation loans and rescheduled debts where
justified. It initiated legal action and stepped up loan recovery
efforts. It demonstrated flexibility by providing working capital
financing to its clients and continued its lending operations when other
local financial institutions were freezing theirs. Finally, it made
realistic provisions for possible increased portfolio losses follTwing
the sharp deterioration in the loan portfolio quality due to the ex-
ternal shocks.
8.04      LBDI has developed as a mature DFC with a well trained group
of statf and management and has coped well with the distressing situa-
tion prevailing in the financial sector in which it operated. Two
significant institutional weaknesses, however, remain to be overcome.
First, a further diversificatior. of operations and financial resources
is needed; the current reliance on foreign borrowings as the principal
source of funds and lending as the main business is not suff'cient to
ensure LBDI's long-term viability. Second, the LBDI has yet to build up
a strong investment promotion capability and a greater focus on economic
evaluation and regular supervision of investments financed. On balance,
considerable progress was made in achieving the institutional objectives
under the projects, although there is still need and scope for further
improvement.
8.05      The progress in achieving the broader sectoral objectives of
investment promotion and development of small scale enterprises (SSEs)
was less than satisfactory. LDC never developed into an effective
investment promotion agency and its successor, NIC, came into being at
a time of unfavorable investment climate. In retrospect, a much more
active role in investment promotion by LBDI would have been desirable
rather than relying on LDC. While the two loans to LBDI emphasized the
development of SSEs, concrete actions and initiatives to achieve it were
launched under the IDA-financed Small and Medium Enterprise Proje-vt



- 22 -
fCr. 1076-LBR) which was approved in 1980. The project is ongoing and
under it the development of small scale enterprises received a boost
through the creation of the SSE department in NIC, a UNDP project to
provide extension services to SSEs, creation of a Small Enterprise
Financing Organization (SEFO), and establishment of credit guarantee
scheme at National Bank of Liberia.
8.06      The prospects for LBDI would depend to a large extent on the
pace of economic recovery in Liberia. The improvements in the quality
of its loan portfolio as well as opportunities for diversification and
domestic resource mobilization will be considerably enhanced by a rapid
and sustained growth of the economy. At present the prospects for such
economic growth are bleak. Therefore, tBDI would have to rely on
turther foreign resources for the next few years to enable it to meet
the needs of its existing and future clients to weather the economic
crisis. Increased resource mobilization by LBDI will be critical to
enable it to better assist its financially distressed borrowers and
thereby minimize the incidence of default on LBDI loans and adverse
impact on the economy.
