INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO LIBERIAN
BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT (LBDI) WITH THE
GUARANTME OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBEIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
second loan to the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment 1/ (LBDI),
with the guarantee of Liberia, for the equivalent of US$4 million to help
finance development projects. Amortization would conform substantially to
the aggregate amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment
projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan with a maximum period of
15 years from the approval or authorization of an investment project. The
interest rate would be 8 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the Liberian economy was distributed to the Executive
Directors three years ago (AW-25 dated June 1, 1971). A basic economic mission
visited the country in 1973, and the seven volume report will be ready for
distribution in the near future. Its principal conclusions are presented in
the following paragraphs.
3.        For the past two decades Liberia has experienced an unprecedented
rate of economic expansion. An annual rate of increase of national product of
close to 7 percent stands in sharp contrast to the complete stagnation of the
previous eighty years. This rapid expansion, led by the investments of
foreign enclaves, has allowed Liberia, for the first time in her 150-year
history, to undertake the economic and social infrastructure investment her
people so desperately need. There is concern, however, that this rate of
progress may not be sustained beyond the present decade, and that by the mid-
1980's the economy may not be able to grow faster than 3 percent per annum,
about the same as the rate of population growth. This would be a serious
prospect for the vast majority of the people whose near-subsistence livelihood
brings them no more than $70 per year.
4.        The Liberian economic boom has three major elements.   First, iron
ore, accounting for 30 percent of GDP and three-quarters of exports; of every
dollar earned in mining, only 16i stays in Liberia. The current outlook is
for, at best, no growth in output during the current decade and a possible
decline thereafter. Next is rubber where the participation in the economy is
more extensive and as much as 50# of every dollar stays in Liberia. It accounts
for only 12 percent of exports and 6 percent of gross product and the outlook
for world markets indicates a 3 percent growth rate. Finally, there is forestry,
whose recent growth has been phenomenal, but whose contribution to exports and
production is relatively small and whose retained product is even smaller. In
this sector there is a very real prospect for swift depletion, and even with
1/ Formerly Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment, a
borrower of $1.0 million from the Bank in June 1972 (Loan 839-LBR).



- 2 -
careful management and good reforestation the long-ran outlook is not out-
standing. The Mission has looked carefully at other potential leading sectors
and products, but under present circumstances no single one can match iron
ore, rubber or forestry.
5.        Liberia does have the possibility to escape from the bleak prospect
of depletion of her resources and stagnation within a decade, if she embarks
on an active all-out strategy of diversification, which should make the economy
strong enough to survive by itself once the raw material boom ends. Such a
diversification strategy not only calls for the promotion of such products as
forest products, non-traditional agricultural goods, fish, and manufactures,
but also for broadening of the participation of Liberians in their own economy.
6.        Current estimates are that GDP should be able to grow at 5 percent
per annum through the end of this decade, but unless a concerted, active develop-
ment effort is made within the next few years, such a growth rate will be
difficult to sustain beyond 1980. On the balance of payments, the present $100
miLlion resource surplus, most of which flows out in the form of factor income
payments, will decline to perhaps $25 million by the end of the decade, and is
projected to turn into a deficit soon thereafter. The balance of payments
position of the country is currently quite strong and will enable Liberia to
weather international disruptions resulting from the "energy crisis".   Given
the existing profile of debt service and a public sector borrowing plan of
some $20 million a year rising to about $35 million by the end of the decade,
the prospect is for an overall balance of payments surplus of significant
proportions, followed after 1979 by substantial deficits if no changes are
made in the current development path. Even so, the debt burden will remain
smnall and Liberia should remain creditworthy through the 1980's. Debt service
-atios are presently about 7 percent of exports and are projected to stay below
this level for the next 15 years.
7.        Liberia has four iron ore concessions producing about 23 million tons
a year. One of them will close operations in 1975, but the shortfall will be
made up by greater production in two others and the volume of exports should be
maintained around 23 million tons a year up to 1978. Prospects beyond 1978 are
uncertain and would depend on opening of some of the new deposits currently
under study by foreign firms. While Liberia should continue to remain attractive
for private mining investments, the Government might be able to improve its
revenues from the concessions operated by the remaining three companies (LAMCO
renegotiations in 1973 yielded an additional $2 million a year). Liberia should
be careful to avoid granting unreasonable tax and duty exemptions which, because
of double-tax avoidance arrangements, usually benefit the home governments of
the foreign firms rather than the enterprises.
8.        The rubber industry consists of seven foreign-owned concessions and
5,300 Liberian-owned farms and is the most important source of employment in
the country. Firestone dominates the industry; it produces 50 percent of
Liberia's rubber output and, including purchases from local farms, processes
and sells 72 percent of the nation's output. There are two main policy issues
vis-a-vis the foreign rubber concessions: the first concerns the tax conces-
sions, the second the securing of improved marketing arrangements, so that the
Liberian producers get better prices for their produce.



- 3 -
9.        Forestry's contribution to GDP is expected to increase rapidly from
2.2 percent in 1972 to 8 percent in 1978, and exports to grow from $8 million
in 1972 to $39 million in 1978. No single large foreign concession dominates
this sector. The concession arrangements contain obligations for -(i) annual
cutting to be limited toregeneration and reforestation levels; (ii) scientific
reforestation of the concession areas and (iii) processing in Liberia of progres-
sively larger percentages of its timber harvest (20 percent in 1973, rising
to 100 percent in 1977). Unfortunately, the Government lacks machinery to
supervise and enforce these obligations.
10.       Particularly important is the intention of the Tolbert administration
to encourage greater participation in the national economy of the rural people
who make up over 70 percent of the population. A reorientation of agricultural
policy must focus attention on the marketing system and pricing policy, both
of which have unduly discriminated against the small farmer. The Government
should encourage competition in marketing of farm products by changing the
Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation from a foreign-controlled and highly
profit-oriented marketing institution to an agricultural service corporation.
A pricing policy - backed by acdministrative machinery to enforce floor farmgate
prices - should offer farmers adequate incentives. Measures to extend credit
and banking services to rural areas, to modify existing controls so as to
encourage small entrepreneurs to improve the land tenure system, extension
services, research and infrastructure (feeder roads, storage facilities) should
form part of any new rural development program.
11.       The industrial sector is still small and consists largely of high
cost import substitution ventures, which typifies the mis-direction of Liberia's
industrial strategy. The incentive system is geared to protect import sub-
stitution and, as a result, the potential for export industries lies largely
untapped. Yet it is here that Liberia will find the key to sustained development
in the long-run.
12.       In the financial sector, problems are related to the lack of an
independent monetary system. At present there is no set of government policy
instruments that will allow the public sector to tap the substantial private
savings that exist in the economy. There are no deposit requirements, no credit
rules and no obligations on the part of the comnercial banks either to lend
locally, to keep currency in the country, or even to supply cash for circulation
purposes. Domestic savings typically end up in Daropean and Amerian banks.
Only Monrovia and some of the concession towns have commercial banking facili-
ties. Even if the local farmer could be induced to save, there are no institu-
tions at present to handle such funds or to lend him money for productive
investments.
13.       In the social sectors - health, housing, and education - the available
infrastructure is relatively small and almost entirely directed towards Monrovia
and the concessions. Allocations of resources, both current and capital, to
education, will have to be significantly increased if Liberia is to sustain her
present rate of economic development in the coming decades. There is a shortage
of teachers at all levels, the curricula are not properly directed, particularly
in the vocational and agricultural fields, and equally important, the Ministry
and the sector are poorly organized.



- 4 -
14.       The fiscal system is relatively under-developed, highly sensitive to
external fluctuations, and ill-equipped for development purposes. While fiscal
performance, as measured by public sector savings, may give the impression of
being very good, it must be recognized that this is largely due to the government's
conservative fiscal policies, directed at maximization of revenue and a restraint
cn the growth of expenditure. This cautious policy, compounded by an inadequate
capacity for project identification, preparation and implementation, has resulted
in a level of current and development expenditure, especially for the agricul-
tural sector, that is inadequate relative to the economic and social needs of
Liberia.
15.       The limited capacity of public service in Liberia has been a major
constraint on growth and development. The new administration has placed a high
priority on reforming the civil service and strengthening public administration.
.A Civil Service Commission and a Public Administration Institute were established
and various administrative reforms were introduced which, although adding $3-4
million annually to government expenditure, could prove to be very productive.
Tn the field of planning Liberia is currently in a phase of transition. A
t.echnical assistance team, sponsored by the US Government, UNDP and IBRD, is in
process of being established. The initial planning efforts in the early sixties,
under the guidance of the Harvard Advisory Group, concentrated on building the
1oundations:  statistics, organisation, budgets and training. As there were
few resources available, almost nothing was accomplished in the field of project
evaluation and execution. Under current circumstances, with significantly more
resources available for investment and with a government that places great
c-mphasis on action, the government's limited ability to prepare and implement
is a serious bottleneck.
1';.      The long-run future of Liberia will depend to a great extent on the
development strategy that is adopted. The following potential strategy contains
five key elements: concessions, diversification, dispersion, distribution, and
decentralization.
17.       Given the importance of concessions to Liberia - they account for 40
percent of employment and 27 percent of government revenue - the Government
still maintains a relatively cautious policy towards them. Even though in
recent years there has been some improvement in the contribution of iron ore
mining concessions, Liberia still gets only 16.5d (government revenue plus
local wage payments) for every dollar of iron ore, while for example Brazil
and Mauritania have negotiated 36/ and 21/ respectively in government revenue
alone. Liberia has always valued its "open door" policy, and any precipitate
moves would not be in consonance with this philosophy. The Government should
move towards having concessions wit, more linkages to the economy, and in this
respect the establishment of independent rubber processing facilities and the
regulations requiring local sawing of timber are steps in the right direction.
Finally, the question of how the concessions can contribute in the way of
infrastructure in their local areas should be considered.
18.       The need for diversification arises from the inability of the major
export products to provide the long-run dynamism required for a 5 percent
rate of growth in GDP. By the late 1980's, the economy must find an additional
$200 million per year in foreign exchange, and this might be achieved with a



-5-
combination of export diversification and import substitution. In the former
area, wood-based industries, coffee, cocoa, palm products, and fishing suggest
themselves, while in the latter a concerted program of rice production and
increased hydroelectric generation would significantly affect the import bill.
Proper incentives and the availability of key infrastructure are required for
both.
19.       The elements of dispersion, distribution and decentralization relate
to the importance of a greater involvement of Liberians, particularly from
the rural areas, in the process of economic development and a more equitable
sharing of its benefits. The reluctance of farmers to participate in the
economy, the extreme shortage of health and educational facilities and of
roads and water supply in the rural areas and the highly centralized control
and management of the economy in Monrovia will hinder satisfactory long-run
development and require investment in infrastructure and changes in pricing
and marketing policies and in administrative organization.
20.       Finally, it is important to realize that until the late 1950's
Liberia had no resources whatsoever to devote to development and she arrived
in the post World War II era far behind, both in physical and in human invest-
ment. The country has thus required more than the international average of
per capita aid and will continue to do so in the future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
21.       The Bank has made eight loans for projects in Liberia totalling
$26.9 million, and there have been three IDA credits totalling $11 million
and one technical assistance grant of $200,000 for development planning. IFO
has made one equity investment in Liberia: $250,000 in the share capital of
the proposed borrower, LBDI. The Bank loans have been for roads, port expansion,
power and LBDI; IDA credits have been for education and agriculture. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loan3, IDA credits and IFC investment as
of September 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
22.       The objectives of the Bank Group operations in Liberia are:
(a)  to increase the absorptive capacity of the economy and
enable the Liberians to take greater initiative in developing
their own resources for the benefit of their own people;
(b) to support policies and programs leading to a broader sharing
of the fruits of economic progress; in the Liberian context
this implies carrying the development process to the 70
percent of the population in subsistence agriculture largely
bypassed by the recent economic gains;
(c) to help the Government in broadening the economic base and
in easing the adjustment problems arising out of a declining
mining sector; and
(d)  to assist the Government in mobilizing development resources
for sound projects from other external agencies.



- 6 -
The proposed project, for which the African Development Bank is also providing
assistance (para. j42 ), will promote the participation of Liberians in their
own economy and broaden the economic base. Several integrated rural develop-
ment, road, education and public utilities projects are in preparation for
possible Bank Group assistance and three or four projects - a rural develop-
ment, an education, roads and possibly a power project - are expected to be
submitted for approval of Ebcecutive Directors in the next twelve months.
PART III - THE INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
Industry
23.       Liberia is a small country with a small domestic market and has
little manufacturing activity. On the average, manufacturing contributed
5.4 percent of the GDP during the 1969-72 period. A survey of industrial
establishments undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Transpor-
tation for 1972 indicated a gross output from industry of $254 million and
employment of about 15,000. Most of the activity was concentrated in mining
and quarrying and forestry (accounting for 82 percent of gross output and
69 percent of employment). Ownership is largely foreign, although there is
a small but active group of Liberian entrepreneurs engaged in a number of
agri-business, manufacturing and service industries.
24.       The important export industries are peletizing of iron ore, fi.sh
processing, wood and rubber processing. Other manufacturing so far in Liberia
has been almost wholly for import substitution, supported with protective
policies. A sample analysis of the performance of import substitution fiims
conducted by a Bank mission in March 1973 showed that several inefficient
firms were being sustained in operation by high rates of effective protection
provided under government tax and incentive policies. These policies are now
being reviewed by the Government with a view to increasing their effectiveness
in promoting export-oriented industries and processing of indigenous raw
materials for the domestic and neighboring markets.
25.       Traditionally, Liberia has followed a liberal policy under which
foreign firms are encouraged to invest in the country and are granted tariff
and tax incentives and enjoy freedom to repatriate earnings. Recently, the
Investment Code and the structure of tariffs were revised. Changes include
the establishment of differential income tax treatment for investors. depending
on whether realized profits are reinvested or repatriated, and extension of
the benefits of the Code to small entrepreneurs and to the service sector
and tourism. Excport industries are given more encouragement under the new Code
than import-substituting industries.
26.       Despite the constraints of a small domestic market and a scarcity
of technical andmanagerialknow-how, manufacturing has grown at a rate of 10
percent per annum fram 1 964 to 1972. Most institutional financing of private
investment comes from the banking system. There are six commercial banks,
two of which have a majority Liberian ownership. Commercial bank loan
maturities are generally less than two years, although in a few cases longer-
term loans have been granted. Outstanding commercial bank loans to the private



- 7 -
sector totalled $54 million at the end of 1973. Of these, 46 percent were
for canmerce, 24 percent for agriculture (including forestry and fishing),
18 percent for personal and other loans, 5 percent for construction, 3 percent
each for transportation and manufacturing and 1 percent for mining.  Interest
rates have been held below 10 percent under Government's usury law. However,
when service charges and other fees are included, the effective cost of
borrowing from commercial banks is about 12 percent.  Recently a new central
bank - the National Bank of Liberia - was established. In addition to super-
vising banking operations, managing the clearing house and holding the Govern-
ment's accounts, the new central bank is also empowered to prescribe reserve
requirements for the commercial banks, determine ceiling interest rates on
loans and deposits and serve as a fiscal agent and advisor to the government
on monetary and financial matters. The US dollar is the currency of use in
Liberia, and a separate Liberian currency is not expected to be issued in the
near future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Liberian Bank for Development
and Investment" (number 503-LBR, dated October 31, 1974) is being distributed
separately. The project was appraised in April 1974. A loan and project
summary is attached as Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C.
fron September 23 to September 27, 1974. Mr. Edwin Williams, Deputy Minister
of Finance, and Mr. Elias Saleeby, President of LBDI, represented the Guarantor
and Borrower respectively in the negotiations.
LBDI - The Borrower
28.       The Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment, a
Liberian statutory corporation, was established in 1965 with the help of IFC,
which subscribed 25 percent of LBIDI's share capital of $1 million. The
Government, IFn and private Liberian investors together hold 51 percent of
the company's share capital. Foreign private investors (financial institutions,
Firestone Plantation Company and two mining companies) own the remaining 49
percent. The company, which recently changed its name to the Liberian Bank
for Development and Investment in order to better reflect its multi-functional
orientation, is the only national institution in the country providing long-
temn loans and equity financing for productive investment. The great bulk of
the projects it finances have been with small Liberian entrepreneurs.
Management and Organization
29.       Of the eight members of LBDI's Board of Directors, three are
Liberians, one represents IFC and four represent foreign interests in pro-
portion to shareholdings. The Chairman is the Minister of Finance of Liberia.
The Board takes an active interest in the affairs of the company. Board
matters are first discussed by the LBDI Executive Committee (five Board Members
resident in Monrovia), and are often voted upon by mail. In September of 1973
Mr. Elias Saleeby, a Liberian previously employed in the Bank's DFC Department,
took over as President of LBDI. He has proved to be effective in improving
internal procedures and in finding new initiatives for the company. He is



- 8 -
assisted by an able expatriate general manager. The company has been successful
in increasing its operations markedly and also in reducing the proportion of
its portfolio affected by arrears over three months (to 5 percent fram 10 percent
a year ago).
30.       LBDIts project staff has responsibility for project appraisal and
follow-up of investments. There are seven full-time staff members, four of whom
are Peace Corps volunteers. Recently, LBDI obtained UNIDO Special Industrial
Services (SIS) funding for technical assistance in improving appraisal capacity.
Generally, LBDI's appraisal and follow-up work have been satisfactory.
Policies
31.       Although LBDI's policies are generally sound,in some cases it has
aemanded excessive security fram project sponsors, and LBDI's new management
wi 1 liberalize its policies in this regard as appropriate.  Previously, LBDI
cculd make commitments in a single enterprise up to 10 percent of its total
resourzes, which is now considered high given the company's growing debt/equity
ratio. At the same time the company wishes to retain its capacity for dealing
wath larger projects. Following discussions on this matters during negotiations,
LBDI changed its policy limit on investments. LBDI's commitments to an
individual enterprise are now limited to the equivalent of a combined amount
representing 30 percent of net worth and 5 percent of the quasi-equity (the
present $3 million of subordinated loans outstanding from Government).
32.       In may 1974 LBDI raised its interest rate from 9 percent to 10 percent
and its service charge from 1 percent to 1.5 percent per annum; resulting in an
effective rate of 11.5 percent per annum. LBDI's current interest rate is
the maarjqum permissible under the existing usury law, and LBDI plans to review
its lending charges again once the law is revised as expected soon. On Bank
and ADB funds the sub-borrowers assume the exchange risk. Because of the use
of the US dollar in Liberia, this exchange risk is only that between the
currencies of disbursement and the US dollar.
Record of Operations
33.       LBDI was established to pronote private enterprise through loans,
equity participations, guarantees and underwrit.ings. Although LBDI got off
to a slow start, its level of activity is now increasing significantly. Annex
II] contains a summary of LHDI's outstanding loan and equity portfolio as at
March 31, 1974. The first Bank loan to LBDI was approved in June 1972, together
with a $500,000 loan from the African Development Bank. The company has progres-
sively improved its operations; approvals of loans and equity investments rose
from $576,000 for 23 projects in 1972 to $1.3 million for 34 projects in 1973.
Another $1.5 million for 12 projects was approved during the first four months
of 1974. Commitments rose from $289,000 in 1972 to $885,000 in 1973. Dis-
bursements were $L477,000 in 1973 compared to $141,000 in 1972. LBDI has
experienced a low rate of cancellation of projects after Board approval.



-9-
Portfolio
34.       About 35 percent of LBDI's portfolio at March 31, 1974 was for
manufacturing enterprises, and 30 percent for agricuture, agricultural
processing and livestock projects. Forestry and fishing each represented
another 10 percent, tourism 6 percent and the 9 percent balance consisted
primarily of transport and trade services. LBDI assistance has been largely
for small Liberian-sponsored projects and nearly half of them (by amount)
have been primarily export-oriented.  Projects submitted under the first Bank
loan had an average expected economic return exceeding 25 percent.  Of the
103 projects for which LBDI has provided a total of $3.9 million of financing
since its establishment, 92 percent of the number and 79 percent of the amount
financed are majority Liberian-owned enterprises.  The average size of LBDI's
loans has been about $38,000, and 80 percent of the loans by number (20 percent
by amount) have been for $50,000 or less.
35.       LBDI's present outstanding portfolio consists of three equity
investments totalling $143,000 and 70 loans for $2 million. Four loans out-
standing (oil palm processing, logging, fishing and assembly of consumer
clurables) exceed $100,000 each and together account for nearly half of LBDI's
portfolio.  Two of those projects have not yet become operational, and the
other two are meeting the repayment obligation regularly. Eighteen loans with
$103,000 outstanding, representing 5 percent of the loan portfol o, were
in arrears over three months as of March 31, 1974. This is a significant
improvement since March 1973 when 9 percent of the portfolio affected by arrears
over three months. As of December 31, 1973, LBDI had made an adequate provTision
of $103,000 - representing 5.3 percent of the loan and equity portfolio - to
cover possible losses on the portfolio. This provision has been jugded adequate
by LBDI's auditors.
Financial Results
36.       LBDI has an outstanding deutsche mark loan from Kreditanstalt fur
WAederaufbau (KfW) equivalent to about $1 million, on which it had previously
failed to pass on the foreign exchange risk to its borrowers.  As a result,
LBDI has suffered foreign exchange losses amounting to over 30 percent of its
net worth in the last few years. In early 1974, KfW agreed to extend the
maturity of the loan from 1978 to 1996, and to lengthen the grace period until
1986. An assurance was obtained from LBDI at negotiations that the present
deutsche mark foreign exchange risk exposure on the KfW loan would be sub-
stantially eliminated by LBDI by June 30, 1975.
37.       LBDI suffered net losses in 1971 and 1972, and earned only a very
small profit in 1973 (less than 1 percent of net worth). This was primarily
due to the large foreign exchange losses described above.
Future Operations and Required Resources
38.       The strategy LBDI is presently following is to expand the scope and
volume of its financing, to improve its stance in the community as an active
development agent, and to improve its profitability. In the last year, LBDI



- 10 -
has begun financing agricultural cooperatives and retail enterprises, and
soon it is expected to finance its first majority Government-owned enterprise
(a rubber processing operation). LBDI is obtaining a change in its Act to
enable it to finance public projects and will limit such financing to 30
percent of its portfolio. This stance is appropriate to LBDI's role within
the Liberian environment.
-9.       LBDI needs in time to increase its equity base which would be possible
-sithout disturbing the current non-governmental ownership, only if it can
Le-lare attractive dividends. Accordingly, along with the current emphasis
on service to small enterprises, it proposes to increase its equity participa-
tion and portfolio in comparatively larger and more profitable enterprises.
The risk-taking capacity of LBDI in assisting smaller units will also be thereby
improved.
LLo.      At the end of March 1974, LBDI had a pipeline of appraised projects
requir ing some $3.5 million of its financing. In addition, several additional
projects requiring $0.5 million were under preliminary study.
1.        The unexpectedly rapid increase in LBDI's level of business since
last year led to a liquidity shortage, and LBDI had to seek additional funds
from several sources. Chase Manhattan Bank of Liberia agreed to an over-draft
facility at an interest rate one percent above the London inter-bank rate.
Also, L3DI discounted $500,000 of government promissory notes with the New
York branch of the First Curacao International Bank at an effective interest
-ate of about 11 percent. The Government recently agreed to provide LBDI with
,1 s&-iLon of funds on a short-term basis at 7.5 percent interest.
42 .      Over the longer term, LBDI's commitments from calender 12974 through
1976 are expected to be approximately $11 million. They are expected to be met
by the following sources:
Sources of runds                                        EXpenditures
Foreign          Local

The Government's contribution will come in the form of a new $2 million long-
te.m- subordinated loan signed in May 1974; LBDI will receive promisory notes
f Ti the $2 million loan amount redeemable over a five-year period beginning in
V1 75. Of the $6.5 million required from international sources, ADB has recently
negotiated the equivalent of a $2.5 million loan to LBDI. The proposed $4



million Bank loan would help LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar 1976.
43.       Because of the limited resources the Government is able to provide
and the lack of other sources of local cost financing, LBDI requested the
African Development Bank and the IBRD to permit limited local cost financing
from their respective loans. These two institutions have worked closely in
appraising the 1974-76 investment program of LBDI, and the African Development
Bank has agreed to release 20 percent of its loan for meeting local expendi-
tures. It is proposed that the residuary local expenditure financing gap of
$500,000 be covered from the proposed Bank loan. Local expedniture financing
this amount (equivalent to about 13 percent of the proposed loan)is justified
given the shortage of public and private investment resources in Liberia, made
more acute by the recent movements in oil and commodity prices.
Retroactive Financing
44.       The first Bank loan (839-LBR of June 1972), was fully committed by
May 1974. To maintain continuity of Bank financing, retroactive financing up
to $750,000 is proposed for sub-projects approved since May.
Disbursement
45.       The Bank loan would be disbursed (i) for foreign goods and services
obtained directly, (ii) 75 percent of the invoiced price for goods previously
imported into Liberia, (iii) 60 percent of construction costs, and (iv) up to
$500,000 of local goods and services.
46.       Each project requiring $100,000 or more of the proceeds of the pro-
posed loan would require the prior approval of the Bank, until the aggregate
of loans approved by the LBDI without reference to the Bank reaches $1 million.
The proposed aggregate free limit of $1 million would ensure that at least
75 percent of the amount of the loan would be subject to Bank approval.
47.       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from LBDI regarding
improvements in procedures, flexibility in lending conditions and pari passu
draw-down of the ADB and IBRD lines of credit. Other tenms and conditions of
the proposed Bank loan are those generally applied to recent Bank loans to
development finance companies, including standard commitment fees. The foreign
exchange risk would be taken by sub-borrowers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Liberian Bank for
Development and Investment (LBDI) the draft Guarantee Agreement between Liberia
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with Articles
of Agreenent of the Bank.
PART VI - RECQMMENDATIONS
50.       I reccmmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 617 - Port DeveloPment;   S$3.6 million Loan of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: May 31. 1975.
This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area
within the Monrovia port to accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers;
provision of two tugs and a pilot launch, as well as additional buoying
and lighting of the navigable channels; consultants' services for
individual advisers and feasibility studies for the development of road
approaches to the port. Project execution has been satisfactory. The
Bank has agreed to the Government's request that funds still undisbursed
be used to help finance an overall study of port development needs in
Liberia, which was stipulated in the project. Government signed a contract
in May 1974 for the port development study.
Loan Nos. 684 and 778 - Power: US$7.4 million Loan of June 4. 1970
(fully disbursed) and US$7.6 million Loan of October 26. 1973; Closing
date: June 30, 1975.
The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) have helped
finance the expansion of the Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, the
installation of two gas turbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; pro-
curement and erection of 42 miles of overhead lines in Monrovia and 54
miles in outlying areas; establishment of a new substation and related
facilities. There have been cost overruns mainly due to international
currency fluctuations and the purchase of larger generators than originally
anticipated. A supplemental loan of $2.9 million was provided in October,
1973 to cover the cost overruns, and project implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily. PUA has recently encountered management problems. These
were discussed during the 1974 Annual Meeting with the Government delegation.
A Bank mission looked into the problem further during appraisal of the
Third Power Project in early October, 197h.
Credit No. 305 - Education; US$7.2 million Credit of May 17, 1972;
Closing date: March 1, 1978.
The education credit is helping to finance construction of, and
provide equipment for, two new multilateral high schools in the north and
the east, each offering a wide curriculum in agriculture, mechanics and
academic subjects; construction of and equipment for a new college of
agriculture and forestry; expansion of a rural teacher training institute
and construction of an adjacent demonstration school, technical assistance
and fellowships for manpower and education planning, technical teacher
training, secondary education and project implementation. Some delay
was encountered last year in obtaining requisite expatriate staff for
the project unit and the original effectiveness date had to be postponed.
This problem has been overcome and project implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily.

Credit No. 306 - Agriculture; US$1.2 million Credit of May 17, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1976.
The agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and preparation
of detailed investment proposals for two integrated rural development projects--
one in Upper Lofa county in northern Liberia; the other in Bong county in the
central region; a physical survey and detailed study of the Liberian-owned
rubber industry; a pilot rubber scheme to provide Liberian rubber farmers
with credits to rehabilitate untapped or poorly tapped rubber; improving
rice research; reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and training
for Liberians to prepare investment projects. Effectiveness of this credit
had to be postponed because of difficultires in obtaining necessary staff
for the project unit.  A project manager was designated in January, 1973 but
left after a month because of irreconcilable differences with the Ministry
of Agriculture. A replacement was appointed and the project is now progressing
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 839 - Development Finance Company; US$1 million Loan of June 26,
1972; Closing date: December 31, 1976.
This loan helped finance foreign exchange costs of industrial
projects financed by LBDI in 1972 and 1973. The first loan is fully
committed.
