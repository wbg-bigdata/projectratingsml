SECOND TEXTILE INDUSTRY REHiABILITATION PROJECT
Credit and Proiect Summarl
Borrower:          People's Republic of Bangladesh
Beneficiaa:        About 15 private sector textile mills and abou't 7 public
sector textile mills under the direction and control of the
Bangladesh Textile Hills Corporation (BTMC)
Amount:            SDR 21.6 uillion (US$23.0 million equivalent) IDA Credit
and SDR 20.7 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) Special
Fund Credit
Terms:             Standard
Relendin-          USS27.0 million equivalent of the proceeds of the proposed
Terms:           Credit would be onlent to about 15 participating private
sector mills, at an interest rate of 14.5% p.a. (13.5% p.a.
for mills located in non-metropolitan area) with the
Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) and the Bangladesh Shilpa Pin
Sangstha (BSRS) acting as the administrative agents of the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB). US$16.7 million equivalent
of the proceeds would be onlent to BTMC at an interest rate
of 14.5% p.s. which would in turn relend this amount to
about 7 public sector mills designated for rehabilitation
at the same rate. The subloans to private and public
secror mills alike would be repaid to GOB over periods not
exceeding 15 years, including a grace period of up to 4
years. The foreign exchange risk would be borne Sy GOB
against a fee of 2.5% p.a. which would be paid by .he
participating mills. BSB/BSRS would be paid an admitistra-
tive fee of 2.5% p.a. by GOB, in the form of deductions
from interest payments received on the loans to the private
sector mills. The remaining portion of the Credit (US$1.3
million) would be retained by GOB for technical assistance
to the Ministry of Industries and Commerce (MOIC).
Proiect            The project is a continuation of an earlier credit
Description:      (Cr. 1205-BD) and seeks to increase the efficiency and
capacity utilization of existing textile mills in both the
public and private sectors, through balancing, modern-
ization and replacement (BIR) of existing facilities.  The
project would provide for market and feasibility studies
necessary to support moves toward adoption of new product
lines, and to assist in the elaboration of GOB's strategy
for the further development of the textile sector. The
project would also provide traiming in order to relieve the
shortage of adequately trained tecbno-managerial manpower.
The project would face no unusual technical risks.

capacity of BSB and BSRS have been addressed. Most of the
BMR plans have already been prepared with assistance froc. a
UNDPIUNIDO team, and BTMC textile engineers. Based on its
previous experience in subproject appraisals of this type,
IDA has prepared detailed guidelines for the BSB/BSRS
appraisal teams, ard each subproject would be reviewed by
IDA prior to final approval.

Following preparatory missions in December, 1982 and May, 1983, the
project was appraised in September, 1983 by a mission consisting of
Messrs S. Thomas, P.R. Jacob, T.H. Cheah, and P. Dinsdale (Consultant).
Post-appraisal missions visited Bangladesh in November, 1983 and January,
1984 to follow up progress in BMR plan preparation for the private sector
mills, and to assess the impact of GOB decisions regarding capital
restructuring of the private sector mills.

I.   INDUo."C!L SECTOR
A. Role in the .'sry
1.01      Previous Reports.  The existing role of the   L i-cial sector In
Bangladesh, and the major issues affecting Industrial developaic!, have beea
discussed recently in the Economic Report cLrculated in March, 1983 i/
Further background is provided in an earlier industrial sector report 2/
which gives a full characterization of the sector, and a detailed discussion
of industrial development issues.
1.02      Dimensions.  Industry at present con.rtibutes about 9% of GDP and
employs about five million people, or 13% of the work force. Until early
1983, when signifti--- moves toward denationalization were made (paragraph
1.06), the industrial seéctor in Bangladesh was dominated by the public sec-
tor.  State-owned enterpriles accounted for 85% of capital assets of the
sector, 65% of value-added, 85X of manufactured exports, and 25% of employ-
ment in medium- and large-scale industry.  The state-owned jute manufacturing
sector accounted for about 702 of the country's foreign exchange earnings,
while the textile sector, also state-owned, was the country's third largest
user of foreign exchange, importing almost all its raw materials, and most of
its spare parts requirements.
B. Public Sector Performance
1.03       The profitability of public sector enterprises has been poor.
Table 1.1 indicates that in FY82, four of the public sector manufacturing
corporations sustained losses. In the case of the Bangladesh Textile Mills
Corporation (BThC), the loss in FY82 roughly equalled accumulated losses up
to that time.
1.04       With aggregate losses by the public sector manufacturing
enterprises in FY82 exceeding Ik 1.5 billion, the conclusion was inescapable
that something needed to be done to prevent a continuing drain on the
Treasury. The main causes of poor public sector profitability in manufactur-
ing industries were felt to be the lack of dynamism which goes with operating
a commercial enterprise as the arm of a Government ministry, and the pursuit
of pricing policies airied at keeping consumer prices at levels thought to be
socially desirable, irrespective of the need to meet operating costs from
revenue.

C. New Industrial Policy
1.05       On June 1, 1982, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) announced its
New Industrial Policy. Among the objectives of this policy were:
(a) expaqsion of the manufacturing sector with increased participation
of the private sector;
(b) limitation of the role of the public sector to establishment of
basic, heavy and strategic industries;
(c) encouragement of optimum utilization of existing capacity including
measures for balancing, modernization and replacement (B!4R);
(a) decision in principle to return jute and textile mills, owned by
Bangladeshis before the 1972 nationalization, to the previous
owners in order to create a favorable investment climate;
(e) improvement in debt service of private sector industries by allow-
ing the financial institutions to undertake more liberal reschedul-
ing of debt to mitigate genuine difficulties of borrowers; and
(f) preparation of a scheme for absorption of the burden of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations by the Bangladesh Bank.
This New Industrial Policy was welcomed by IDA as being very much in harmony
with its own thinking on what steps needed to be taken to foster greater
dynamism in the industrial sector and the economy more generally.



-3-
1.06       GOB has moved quickly with its program of denationalization.  Over
the period, December, 1982 to March, 1983, 28 jute mills and 22 textile mills
were returned to their former Bangladeshi owners.
1.07       In addition to the denationalisation initiative, and the clear
intention of GOB to place greater reliance on private sector efforts, it has
taken first steps toward restructuring of public sector corpo)rations in an
attempt to improve their efficiency. The basic premlse of the proposed
reorganisation, announced in the Gazette of July 24, 1983 is that the public
sector corporations would perform best if allowed to function as commercial
enterprises with a minimum of civil service interference in the day-to-day
management of these enterprises. There is therefore a strong awareness
within the present Govermnent that a certain degree of operational autonomy
is essential in such functions as procurement, production, staffing, hiring
and firing, pricing policy, marketing and distribution, if efficiency is to
be secured.
1.08       GOB has also recognized the importance of rationalizing the incen-
tive structure. The industrial incentive system, including tariff policy,
should be at the center of the process of creating an environment in which
greater private participation in industry and more e%port production is
encouraged. At the same time, some degree of initial protection, promotion
and incentive for new industry may be needed. GOB, therefore, has begun,
with IDA assistance, an extensive program to review and reform trade and
industrial policy (TIP). The TIP Reform program has as its objective not
only the rationalization of the incentive structure, but also that of the
system of administrative control and licensing procedures affecting invest-
ment and trade. As a key industrial subsector, the textile industry is
receiving priority attention under the TrP program.
II. TEXTILE SECTOR
A. Historical Background
2.01       The area now known as Bangladesh was a producer and exporter of
high-quality muslin cotton fabrics when the East India Company came to the
subcontinent. It is reported 1/ that the export of Dhaka muslin to Europe
continued up to 1817, having gone into decline after 1789 with the imposition
of high tariffs in Britain, and with the discouragement of cotton cultivation
in the Bengal provinces in favor of jute.
1/   S.N.H. Arangzeb.  Cotton cultivation in Bangladesh.  (Dhaka: Cotton
Development Board. October, 1979.)



-4-
2.02       By the time of partition in 1947, local cotton production was
estimated at about 7 m.lbs of mostly short-staple Comilla cotton, grown
almost entirely for export, and used for mixing with wool. At that time
also, there existed a local spinning capacity of about 110,000 spindles in
eleven mills, and these were supplied witlh medium-staple cotton grown else-
where in the subcontinent.  During thle Pakistati years, the spinning industry
in Bangladesh was based largely on relatively cheap cotton brought from West
Pakistan.  In addition to West Pakistan cotton, the local industry relied to
a large extent on West Pakistani entrepreneurslhip and management. With these
important inputs, the industry experienced steady growth.
2.03       By late 1971, installed spinning capacity had grown to about
858,000 spindles. Installed automatic looms in the mill sector had grown
from 2,700 in 1947 to 7,400 in 1971. And the handloom sector, which used as
its major input the yarn produced by the spinning sector, had grown from an
estimated capacity of abou, 100,000 handlooms in 1947 to about 300,000 in
1971. Following the war of independence in 1971, and the departure of West
Pakistan entrepreneurial involvement in the industry, the growth and perfor-
mance of the industry faltered. Raw material procurement now required scarce
foreign exchange.  Technical supe,rvision and maintenance became a problem, in
part because the departure of the West Pakistanis left a gap in the
availability of trained and experienced techno-mariagerial staff, and in part
for lack of spare parts. Facilities deteriorated. Yarn production in FY70
stood at 105.7 m.lbs; in contrast, production was 95.3 m.lbs in FY82. Even
after more than a decade, production still had not caught up to
-re-independence levels (paragraph 2.12). In the meantime, population had
grown by roughly 20 mil.JU.n people.
B. Industrial Structure
2.04       Fiber.  Fiber production is low in relation to consumption, with
the bulk of fiber used in spinning provided by t.mported cotton and synthetic
fiber. Short-staple Comilla cotton continues tc be grown for export, with
about 15,000 acres under cultivation yielding less than 2 m.lbs. Following
the establishment of the Cotton Development Boa:d in 1972, a program of local
growing of medium staple American cotton for use in local spinning mills was
undertaken.  As of FY80, 12,000 acres had beer brought under cultivation,
rising to 60,000 acres iii FY83, and with further plans to increase the
acreage to 300,000 acres by 1990 and 600,000 acres by 1995. Corresponding
raw cotton production has increased from about 7 m.lbs in FY80 to 11 m.lbs in
FY82. Raw cotton imports in FY82 amounted to 110 m.lbs, supplemented by
imports of viscose of about 4 m.lbs.

2.05       Spinning.  Yarn production is undertaken almust entirely in the
modern mill sector, where conventional ring-spinning technology is
employed. 1/ As of FY82, the spinning sector comprised 60 mills, three of
which were in the process of liquidation.  An additional eight mills were
under construction. The 60 mills accounted for an installed capacity of
1.032 million spindles. Capacity utilization in FY82 was 76% (paragraph
2.13). FY82 yarn production amounted to 95.3 m.lbs (109.9 m.lbs converted to
32 count equivalent). Local production of yarn is not sufficient to meet the
requirements of local weaving capacity in mill sector and handloom sector
combined, leaving substantial room for imports, much of which is smuggled.

a reported 1,039 further looms under installation. This sector accounted in
FY82 for an estimated output of 42 m.yds operating at nearly full capacity.
The powerloom units produce fabrics intended largely for urban menfolk out of
imported polyester and synthetic blended yarns   The BTMC mills produce

2.07       The bulk of cloth production is undertaken in the handloom sector.
The Handloom Census of 1978 estimated a total of 437,000 handlooms of which
only 260,000 were in operation. FY81 sales of domestic yarn to the handloom
sector amounted to 84.5 m.lbs. Together with declared yarn imports of
17.9 m.lbs, the cloth production of the handloom sector may be estimated at
537 m.yds, 1/ roughly seven times that of the mill sector. This does not take
account of undeclared yarn imports, so the relative role of the handloom
sector should in fact be larger. Mia (Table 2.3) estimates FY82 handloom
sector production at 551.7 m.yds.

2.08        Other.  The remainder of the textile sector is made up of miscel-
laneous units involved in the manufacture of hosiery, tape, lace and braid,
sewing thread, twine, specialized textiles for bed sheets, bed covers,
towels, canvas, etc, other specialized textiles, and readymade garments.
Annex 2.1 gives details of installed capacity.
2.09       Employment.  The handloom sector is the largest in terms of
employment, accounting for an estimated 850,000 people. These include, apart
from weavers, people engaged in ancillary activities such as yarn reeaiing,
dyeing and beaming. Self-employed weavers in cottage units also engage in
other activities, particularly in agriculture. The mill sector employs about
75,000 people, and hosiery, specialized textiles and other groups of textile
industries employs about 60,000 people.
2.10        Ownership and Size.  In the mill sector, the average nuxmber of
employees per mill is about 1,200. Following independence in 1971 all mills
were nationalized. In early 1983, however, under the New Industrial Policy,
22 of these units were returned to their former Bangladeshi owners. These
private mills now account for 425,544 spindles, or 41% of capacity, and a
similar percentage of employment in the mill sector. The handloom units are
in the orivate sector, and consist of cottage and small units comprising
typically 1-25 looms. At replacement cost, the fixed assets of the handloom
sector toLal about Tk 1,300 million, compared with Tk 9,000 million In the

industries are all in the private sector, and range from cottage to medium
in terms of size.
2.11       Location.  The relative locations of the various textile
activities are shown in the map attached. As would be expected, the large
mills are located largely in the industrial areas, mainly around Dhaka and
Chittagong. Handloom areas are dispersed throughout the rural areas of the
country, but with concentrations which have arisen reflecting the advantages
of shared access to various common facilities supporting weaving activity,
notably yarn and cloth markets, dyeing, and beaming services. Comilla cotton
is grown in the hilly areas near to Chittagong in the east, while Am rican
cotton is being introduced in the upland areas around Jessore anu Kushtia to
the west. The attached map shows where the various textile activities are
located.
C. Recent Performance
2.12      Production Performance.  The recent performance of the spinning
sector is summarized in Annex 2.2. As of FY82, the performance of this
sector still had not been restored to its pre-independence (FY70) levels; as
against a spinning capacity utilization of 88% in FY70, the corresponding
figure in FY82 was 76%. Actual production of 106 m.lbs in FY70 compares with
95 m.lbs in FY82, although the number of installed spindles in FY82 had
increased to 1.032 million from 750,000 in FY70, with no appreciable shift in
count mix.
2.13       The disruption to the industry caused by the exodus of Pakistani
entrepreneurs and subsequent nationalization of the industry is reflected in
the precipitate drop in capacity utilization from 88% in FY70 to 75% in FY73.
Some improvement from this level was evident in the subsequenz years, as
capacity utilization rose to 82% in FY79. However, as we have seen, FY82
saw a further setback in spinning capacity utilization to 76%. The increased
average age of machinery installed is no doubt a factor in this reversal, and
is reflected in the fact that 18% of lost capacity (Table 2.5) is due to
machinery breakdowns and maintenance. Frequent power outages is a further
exogenous cause of poor performance, accounting for 25% in FY82 of lost
spindle-hours. Although these are clear exogenous factors affecting perfor-
mance, it is also clear that techno-managerial shortcomings are a major
weakness leading to poor performance. The incidence of machinery breakdowns
is a reflection not only of the age of the machinery but also of lack of
maintenance. Likewise, high levels of absenteeism reflect not only
socio-cultural factors, but also management performance. Shortage of back

process, 1/ which accounts for 17% of lost capacity, reflects in part
problems of machinery imbalance, often stemming from problems of maintenance,
and in part problems of raw material supply arising from chronic foreign
exchange shortage.

2.14       The proposed project would directly address the problem of lost
capacity due to machinery breakdown and maintenance, and to back process
shortage stemming from plant imbalance. The problem of power failures
affects the industrial sector generally, and is being addressed by projects
such as the Ashuganj power project being financed by IDA. The absenteeism
problem has a socio-cultural basis that is exacerbated by public sector
management; privatization is expected to help reduce this problem.
2.15       The implications of poor capacity utilizati3n may be seen by
considering the cost structure. Taking cotton yarn of 32 count as illustra-
tive, and using Olympia Textile Hills as roughly average 2/ in terms of
performance, the cost structure in the spinning subsector is as shown in
Table 2.6. Increased capacity utilization would mean greater output spread
over the same level of fixed conversion costs, reducing unit conversion
1/  This term is commonly used in Bangladesh to refer to the output of
steps in a production process immediately preceding the one under
reference. In this case, the output of the production steps
preparatory to spinning are "back process".
2/  Profit before interest and taxes is estimated at 18% for Olympia
Textile Mills (after BMR - see Annex 7.1), which compares with a high
of 32% for Pahartali, and a low of 11% for RR Textiles, among mills
accepted for BMR financing.

costs. A 10% increase in output would yield a 49% increase in gross
profitability, taking account of increased raw material and other input
requirements, and assuming no changes in variable costs. A 20% increase in
volume would yield a 100% increase in gross profitability. Given that FY82
capacity utilization was in the vicinity of 76%, and that at least an 88%
achievement (FY70) is possible in Bangladesh, potential for profitability
improvement is evident.

2.16       Table 2.6 also shows that raw material accounts for 70% of
manufacturing cost. Potential for cost reduction here is limited by the fact
that Bangladesh is a price-taker on the world market for cotton and man-made
fibers.  Nevertheless, there are elements of raw material cost - as distinct
from raw material price - which are within the control of Bangladesh as a
yarn producer, and which have a large impact on profitability. First, duties
and other landing expenses represent in FY83 a significant 10% of product
cost.  These costs have been reduced from FY82 levels, when sales taxes of
20% (of cif value plus duties) on imported cotton had been in place. BTMC's
reLound to profitable operations in FY83 from massive losses of Tk 652 mil-
lion in FY82 is due in large part to the removal of this sales tax. Second,



-11-
raw material cost reduction could be achieved through the reduction of waste,
which represents about 4% of product cost. Raw material wastage results in
part from poor techno-managerial practice in the mills, and in part from
procurement of substandard quality cotton. Cotton waste percentage stood at
11.2% in FY82 (see Annex 2.2) - only a slight reduction from FY81 and FY80
levels, and much greater than the level of 9.46% achieved in FY78. BTMC has
taken steps to correct the problem of poor quality cotton, including the use
of USDA specification;; and pre-shipment inspection services. As a third
avenue of raw materiaL cost reduction it is possible to substitute cheaper
man-made fibers - viscose and polyi ster - for cotton. There are limits
imposed by marketability consideratt,ons on the extent of substitution which
is possible. BTMC has found that ail 80/20 blend of cotton and viscose is the
highest that can be adopted without adverse consumer reaction.
Polyester-cotton blended yarns of up to 65/35 enjoy ready market acceptance,
as it is both cheaper to produce and more durable. However, it is necessary
to convert existing facilities if polyester-cotton blended yarns are to be
efficiently produced (paragraphs 2.37-2.39).
2.17       In the case of weaving, raw materiils are again the major cost
element, accounting for 60% of production costs, suggesting that increased
efficiency in yarn production, and reduced input prices would be the most
important means of improving weaving profitability. In addition, increased
capacity utilization would have a large impact on weaving profitability. A
20% increase in weaving output due to increased capacity utilization would
yield a 48% increase in gross profits.

2.20       The mill sector experienced poor profitability over the FY8O-82
period, followed by a rebound in FY83. Operational performance in FY82 was
relatively poor, with spinning capacity utilization at 76%, and weaving
capacity utilization at 66%. The corresoonding figures for FY83 are 86% and
71% respectively. 1/ Given the extreme sensitivity of profit to capacity
utilization (paragraph 2.15), the performance rebound in FY83 can be under-
stood. Further, in response to the heavy losses sustained in FY82, GOB
allowed increases in yarn prices, and removed the sales tax on raw cotton.
Lower cotton prices in FY83 were offset by taka devaluation. The duty struc-
ture and price movements affecting the textila sector are detailed in
Annex 2.3.
2.21       The present duty structure reveals a high level of protection for
local weaving, particularly of synthetic fabrics. This has led to the estab-
lishment of a large number of powerloom units, with many more applications
pending with the banks. These units use imported synthetic blended yarns,
and produce synthetic fabrics intended largely for urban menfolk. The import
duty on synthetic fabrics is 200% (Annex 2.3). By comparison, imported
blended yarns attract a combined duty and sales tax of 80% ad valorem, and
an excise duty of Tk 0.35 per sq. meter on locally produced fabric - the
equivalent on average of about 2% ad valorem. The combined effect of this
tax and duty structure is to confer a fair degree of effective protection on
the local powerloom sector, and attendant profitability in financial terms.
The economic attractiveness of such activity from a country standpoint has
not been fully investigated. However, the high level of effective protection
raises doubts as to whether the concomitant high level of investment being
undertaken in this sector is appropriate. This question and its policy
implications regarding in particular the relative roles of handloom and
powerloom sectors are being addressed under the TIP Reform Program (paragraph
1.08).
D. Market Aspects
2.22       Projections of demand for yarn and cloth show a significant gap
between demand and supply in the base year of the projections (FY83), widen-
ing with growth in population, and with iacrease in income per capita (Annex
2.4). The yarn equivalent of yarn and cloth imports is projected to rise
from a base-year estimate of 41 m.lbs in FY83, to 90 m.lbs by FY86, increas-
ing to 126 m.lbs by FY90. By comparison, FY82 yarn production in Bangladesh
was 95.3 m.lbs.
1/  These figures are for BTMC mills only.

2.23       The major assumptions underlying these projections are that:
-  population will grow at the rate of 2.6% p.a;
- real GDP growth will be 4.5X p.a;
- average fabric weight is 3.05 oz. per yd;
- base-year cloth consumption is 9.1 yds per capita;
-  income elasticity of cloth consumption is 1; and
- prices will remain at FY83 levels in real terms. i/
2.24       The population and GDP growth rate assumptions, taken from the
recent Economic Report 2/, imply a real income per capita growth rate of
1.85% p.a. Cloth consumption per capita is assumed to increase at the same
rate, implying an income elasticity of cloth consumption of 1. This is a
conservative assumption. The estimated elasticity for saris, lungis, grey
cloth are all greater than 1 (Table 2.11) and these together constitute 85%
(Table 2.3) of production in the handloom and mill sectors combined.

2.25       The effect of increased cloth prices due to the expected rise in
world cotton prices has not been taken into account, but this effect should
be negligible. The average share of textiles in household consumption is
only 10%, while the projected real price increase in finished cloth over the
period FY84-FY93 is estimated at 1.55%, 1/ or less than 0.20% p.a. on a
simple average basis. Thus, the relative price increases in textiles would
be to erode the impact of per capita income by only roughly 0.02% p.a., a
negligible amount.
2.26       The average fabric weight of 3.05 oz. per yd is the same used by
Mia. Considering fabric weights for typical fabric constructions of saris,
lungis, and grey cloth (markin), which contribute about 90% of consumption, a
weighted average fabric weight of 3.35 oz per yd is obtained. 2/ This sug-
gests that the Kia estimate is a fair one. However, given the wide variety
of 'abric constructions that are used even for the same fabric type, there is
an element of uncertainty surrounding the estimate.
2.27       The most important assumption underlying the demand projections is
the assumed FY83 level of cloth consumption per capita. The figures given
1/   Based on projected relative price increases in raw cotton being
passed on to the consumer (see Annex 7.2, Sales Schedule for Olympia
Textile Mills).
2/ Sari fabric of 30x38/44x42/44 construction (30 count warp yarn by 38
count weft, 44 ends per inch in the warp, 42 picks per inch in the
weft, 44" width) weighs 2.78 ozs/yd; lungi fabric of 32x32/60x68/44
construction weighs 4.12 ozs/yd; grey cloth of 32x32/60x72/36 con-
struction weighs 3.6 ozs/yd. Saris (all constructions) constitute
46% of consumption, lungis 30%, and grey cloth 14% (see Table 2.3).



-16-
above (Table 2.2, 2.4) do not reflect undeclared (or smuggled) imports and so
understate true cloth consumption. Estimates which attempt to make up this
deficiency vary quite widely. The Handloom Census of 1978 estimated cloth
consumption at 12.5 yds per capita.  The report of the Task Force for the
Handloom Sector (1982) estimated consumption at 9.0 yds per capita.  The most
recent report by Mia (op. cit.) has produced an estimate of 9.09 yds per
capita as of FY82.  This figure, rounded to 9.1 yds per capita, is taken as
the FY83 base-year figure in the present demaad projections.  This compares
with visible cloth consumption per capita (that is, based on declared
imports) of 7.0 yds per capita in FY82 and 6.9 yds per capita in FY83, sug-
gesting that imports (declared as well as undeclared) represents 24% of
consumption. Persons familiar with the textile trade in Bangladesh have
ventured the opinion that closer to 50% of cloth consumption in Bangladesh
derives either from imported yarn or imported cloth, which is not inconsis-
tent with the estimate of 12.5 yds per capita made in the Handloom Census of
1978.
2.28       Proceeding, however, on the basis of 9.1 yds per capita as
base-year consumption, the results shown in Table 2.10 are obtained. This
suggests that by FY88, the year projected for completion of BMR in all mills
(paragraphs 6.08 - 6.09), the yarn equivalent of imports would be 107 m.lbs.
BMR would accoant for an increase over base-year production of about
27 m.lbs. Currently there are six BTHC mills under construction comprising
87,500 ring spindles, which would represent approximately 14 m.lbs of addi-
tional capacity.
2.29       Further expansion should be considered with caution as long as
consumption and demand data are as poor as they are. In this connection,
GOB has sanctioned the establishment of new spinning capacity in the private
sector of up to 425,000 ring spindles over the period of the Second Five Year
Plan (SFYP), FY81-FY85.   This would represent a yarn output of about
70 m.lbs which on the basis of the present demand projections cannot be
considered prudent. Table 2.12 shows the projected domestic supply gap in
terms of spindle capacity. Although this is about 450,000 spindles in FY84,
dropping to about 360,000 spindles in FY88 as BMR and planned BTMC invest-
ments take effect, rising again to about 470,000 spindles in FY90 in the
absence of further investment, this assumes that all imports can in fact be
substituted, which is unlikely, and that per capita income will grow at 1.85%
p.a., which is uncertain. On this basis, additional capacity to FY88 should
not be allowed to exceed about 200,000 spindles. Thus far, it is reported
that interested entrepreneurs have had difficulty obtaining suppliers'
credits and other needed financing. Applications to IFC for foreign exchange
financing have been received, and are under consideration. IDA has also been
approached informally by the Government to finance the establishment of new
facilities which would seek to diversify local production into new product
lines for which opportunities for import-substitution and exports exist.
While IDA agrees with this strategic initiative, bearing in mind particularly
the opportunities opened for Bangladesh under the terms of the recently
renegotiated Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and also Bangladesh's potential com-
petitive advantage in this industry, the position of IDA has nevertheless
been that present market data, though imprecise, are sufficient to justify



-17-
BMR of existing facilities producing traditional product lines, but: not
sufficient to support, in addition, entry into new product lines or the
setting up of new facilities. Substantial additional market intelligence is
needed to support such moves, particularly firmer estimates of imports, licit
as well as illicit, witn breakdowns by various market segments, and also
investigation of export opportunities. Provision for such a consumer and
market demand study has been made under the project (paragraph 3.04). In the
meantime, GOB has agreed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that a situa-
tion of overcapacity is not created.

E. Present Outlook and Issues
2.30       Denationalization.  The Government's decision to denationalize
a number of textile mills by transferring them to their forner Bangladeshi
owners was taken with the intention of strengthening the private sector's
role in industrialization. Before the announcement of this decision in the
New Industrial Policy, Government had sanctioned the establishment of 25 new
spinning mills in the private sector. However, the Bangladeshi entrepreneurs
who had formerly owned textile mills expressed some reluctance to undertake
new investments at the same time that their former enterprises remained
nationalized. GOB therefore felt it necessary, if investor confidence were
to be restored, to return textile and jute mills to their former (Bagladeshi)
owners. Mills which had been abandoned by their former Pakistani owners
would remain with the respective public sector corporations. Twenty-two
textile mills were transferred over the period December, 198z to narch, 1983,
representing 41% of spinning capacity and 54% of mill weaving capacity.
2.31        It is unlikely that denationalization beyond the list of pre-
viously Bangladeshi-owned mills can be expected in the near future. In the
medium term, and as a largely political matter, further denationalization
will depend on the relative performance of the public and private sectors.
If the private sector performs well, one can expect pressures to develop for
further denationalization. However, it is likely that some rpsidual role for



-18-
the public sector will be retained - possibly in mill management, at minimum
in the provision of common training facilities, and perhaps also in advisory
and extension services.
2.32       Yarn Distribution and Pricing.  Successive regimes have sought
through the public ownership of the mill sector to provide yarn at low prices
to the weavers. Thus GOB policy over the years has been characterized by
controlled ex-mill prices, and various distribution arrangements that have
sought to give effect to the goal of low prices to the weavers. This objec-
tive has been frustrated by the near-impossibility of controlling prices at
the retail level as well as ex-muill. At the retail level, there is no
evidence to suggest that anything other than the market has prevailed in
setting prices. In a situation of scarcity there arose the perception that
the middlemen were reaping inordinately high profits. Thus, coupled with
controlled ex-mill prices, various institutional agencies, together with the
Bangladesh Handloom Board (BH3) were used as distribution channels.  These
were supplemented up until 1982 by a large nuimber (4,000) of licensed private
dealers, each of whom was given a relatively small allotment of 600 lbs per
month which put a fairly low limit on the profit that each dealer could earn
from the trade. In this system of fixed prices, poor quality yarn could be
cleared only by obliging the dealers to take some of such yarn with every
order lifted. This system was clearly inadequate. It caused BTMC to run at
a loss, as price increases requiring ninistry approval came too late and were
generally too little to meet rising costs. Further, the BTMC mills no longer
needed to be responsive to their market. And finally, it was not at all
clear that the intended beneficiary of the pricing/distribution system was
well served by it: yarn prices to the weaver, and cloth prices to the con-
sumer, reflpcted ultimaately the effect of scarciLt.
2.33      Against this background, GOB agreed as a conditIon of Credit
1205-BD to move towards free market pricing according to an agreed
time-table. The private denationalized mills have been given complete
freedom in their pricing arrangements. BThC meanwhile has implemented a
system of pricing in which prices are allowed to vary from mill to mill in
accordance with quality and therefore demand differences in the market, as
well as the need to compete with the private mills and with imports.
Individual mill managers do not, however, have the power to raise or lower
prices except within very narrow limits, with pricing policy subject to
-entral coordination by the Sales Directorate of BTMC.  GOB has indicated
that BTMC would be allowed complete freedom to raise or lower prices in
accordance with free-mark.et principles, reversing an earlier policy under
which BTMC was not allowed to raise prices by more than 10% p.a without
Kinistry approval. GOB has given assurances that it would maintain this
policy.
2.34       The distribution system also has been changed.  A New Distribution
System, details of which may be found in the Project File, was announced in
August, 1982. Instead of an allotment of 600 lbs per month (one and a half
bales), each Distributor now has an allotment of 15 bales per month. Instead
of 4,000 dealers, the number has shrunk to about 500, allowing each a greater
profit potential at reduced markups, at the expense of greater concentration



-19-
in the distribution trade. This system appears to be working more smoothly
than the previous, but continues to incorporate certain rigidities that are
not likely to remain tenable following the creation of a nixed public/private
mill sector. BTMC's Agents/Distributors are enjoined to restrict the com-
bined profit margia, not only on their own sales but also on that of their
sub-agents and retaiLers, to no more than 10% over ex-mill prices. This
provision has questionable legal force, sitice it is difficult to see how an
Agent could be made responsible for the prices set by thie wholesalers or
retailers to whom he sells. Furthermore, on the evidence available, it does
not appear to be practicable to control prices at the retail level as well
as ex-mill. Moreover, since the private mills have complete freedom in
maeting distribution arrangements, the attempt to control prices of BTMC yarn
at the retailer level, while leaving private sector yarn uncontrolled, will
become untenable. Ultimately, the best and perhaps the only control over
prices is to produce in adequate supply, to adequate quality, and at minimum
cost - the major objectives of BMR.
2.35       Handloom Sector Revitalization.  The Bangladesh Harndloom Board
(BHB) is in the process of preparing a comprehe.,nsive plan for revitalization
of the handloom sector.  BHB envisages a program of intervention which would
help the weavers to (a) obtain finance, increase efficiency, and develop
greater market orientation, (b) provide channels into the local urban
markets, and (c) develop export markets. The handloom sector plays a vital
role in the economy, producing about 70% of the cloth consumed in Bangladesh.
Further, the estimated 850,000 persons directly employed in the sector alone
constitute about 13% of the non-crop agricultural workforce in the country.
There is therefore merit in investigating the needs and problems of this
sector, as a first step toward Lhe formulation of an intervention program to
address those needs.
2.36     The project proposals so far developed by BHB require more work
before they could be considered suitable for Bank financing. The Mia report
has addressed some of the issues which need to be examined in developing a
program of intervention for the handloomn sector, but two studies - a weavers'
needs study, and a non-traditional markets study - required to support a
wel. .-formulatei program are still underway. In addition to these studies,
the proposed project would include provision for a strategy study for the
handloom sector. This strategy study would be structured into three levels:
(a) Analyses of the alternatives for the long-term development of
the cloth producing industry in Bangladesh and the definition
of an appropriate strategy for developing the sector (setting
out the rationale for support);
(b) In the context of the long-term strategy defined, identification
of the most pressing areas for development, and the areas where
the most cost effective support can be given (defiring
priorities); and
(c) Design of appropriate instrumentalities and institution-building
measures required including detailed project preparation.



-20-
2.37       Polyester Blends.  Blended polyester-cotton yarns have significant
advantages over pure cotton yarn. Polyester staple fiber is a cheaper raw
material than cotton. Spinning efficiency is higher for polyester. Also,
the ultimate fabric is two to three times more durable. For these reasons,
the gradual introduction of synthetic fiber spinning capability is
inevitable, and is supported.
2.38       The major change which must be made in spinning facilities to
allow for spinning of polyester/cotton blended yarns is the installation of
equipment for control of temperature and humiditv - either air-conditioning
or humidification systems. Other required modifications would include the
installation of bye-pass chutes in the blow-room, fitting carding machines
with wire cloth, and possible installation of autoclaves for yarn
heat-setting. Spinning of polyester-blended yarns requires not only tighter
control over ambient conditions, but also of the mecl.anical condition and
settings of running machinery, which would imply better performance in the
maintenance function than is common in Bangladesh, and hence the need to
improve techno-managerial performance.
2.39       Polyester-blended yarns also have implications for yarn dyeing,
sizing, and the finishing of the eventual fabric. Polyester-blended yarns
require pressure dyeing, and therefore equipment which is not available to
the cottage and small industries which support the local handloom industry.
If conventional dyeing methods are used, only the cotton portion of the
blended yarn would take the dye, yielding lighter shades and pastels. If
market acceptance of pastels is not adequate, facilities for deep dyeing of
polyester yarns would be required. These would need to be installed in the
mill sector, possibly displacing to some extent cottage dyeing activity. The
sizing material used to prepare polyester-blended warp yarn prior to weaving
is different from that used for cotton warp yarn. However, the introduction
of such new materials should pose few problems as it is reported that the
suppliers of such materials have already set up establishments in Bangladesh.
Finally, synthetic fabrics generally require heat setting to develop maximum
easy-care properties in garments. Here too the required facilities could not
ne provided in existing cottage industries.
2.40       Despite the attractions of polyester-blended yarns, their intro-
duction will be gradual at best, as facilities need to be set up or converted
lor processing synthetics. The private sector has moved to respond to the
needs arising from greater utilization of synthetic yarns aad fabrics. From
one facility in 1979, the list of units with synthetic processing capacity
has grown to seven 1/ as of 1983. In the public sector, three mills Meghna,
Olympia, and Ahmed Bawany have capacity for processing a combined total of
27 m,yds of synthetic fabric. Capacity for spinning polyester/cotton blended

-'21-
yarn stands at 175,000 spindles, with a further 87,500 spindles under con-
struction. BMR of older mills will enhance capacity for spinning blended
yarns, particularly in those mills with built-in insulation features. In
those mills which do not have the requisite heat insulation features in their
con3truction, air-conditioning may not be a feasible proposition, but
humidification is an alternative which is being adopted under the BMR scheme,
and which allows spinning of blended yarns for at least part of the year.
2.41       Development Strategy.  With its comparative advantage in cotton
textiles, its long history in the industry, and a nucleus of trained staff on
which to build, GOB's principal objective for the textile industry is to
expand ou'put to keep pace with domestic demand, and ultimately to win inter-
national markets, while making the efficiency gains that are essential to
this endeavor. GOB's immediate strategy in pursuing this basic objective is
to correct the weaknesses of the mill sector, the performance of which fal-
tered noticeably in the post-independence period, both in terms of output and
efficiency, and which suffered losses over the period FY76-FY82. Policy
weaknesses have already been forcefully tackled. Under its New Industrial
Policy, 22 mills have been returned to the private sector, while the BTMC has
been granted freedom to set prices for its mills following normal commercial
principles. This is a significant departure from previous policy under which
yarn prices ex-mill were controlled by the Government in an effort to provide
cheap yarn to the weavers, and cheap cloth to the consumer, with disastrous
consequences for mill profitability, and dubious benefit to the ultimate
consumer. This policy reversal, togeth,er with the removal of a sales tax on
imported cotton led to a profitable year in FY83, and has strengthened the
determination of the Government to allow prices to be set in accordance with
free-market principles, and to prevent a continual drain on the public
treasury. Although the present political leadership is committed to exploit-
ing market forces in its approach to industrial development, it is expected
that the public sector will maintain a presence in the textile sector, par-
ticularly in spinning, where it is felt that the relatively large scale of
investment justifies continued public sector presence to ensure desirable
investments are undertaken. Weaknesses in plant and process management have
been addressed by a UNDP/UNIDO team attached to BTMC which has set up the
Savar Training Institute for in-service training in these areas. Under the
proposed Credit, this institute will be strengthened with provision made for
the establishment of training courses in the areas of management accotinting
and production management practices specific to the textile industry. Con-
sultancy arrangements under Credit 1205-BD ongoing will lend assistance to
the BTMC mills in the areas of financial management and production planning
systems. Weaknesses in plant facilities are being addressed by a program of
balancing, modernization and replacement (BMR) of older plant facilities.
BMR is correctly regarded by GOB as the means of first resort in securing
extra output and efficiency and quality gains.
2.42       Beyond the immediate strategy of correcting the weaknesses of the
existing mill sector, the major directions for longer-term strategy include
the following: (i) expansion of spinning and weaving activity into
non-traditional product lines to exploit emerging opportunities for
import-substitution in urban markets, and to utilize export quotas under the



-22-
terms of the recently renegotiated Multi-Fiber Arrangement -- this will
involve the establishment of forward linkages with export oriented gar-
ment-making activities based on imported fabrics which have already sprung up
to take advantage of the new Multi-Fiber Arrangement; (ii) exploitation of
Its surplus labor advantage, as well as its centuries-old tradition in hand-
loom weaving by adopting policies and programs to strengthen the handloom
sector in those product areas where it can enjoy a competitive advantage
vis-a-vis powerloom and mill weaving; (iii) reduction of import dependency in
raw materials, and in textile machinery and spare parts; and (iv) strengthen-
ing of manpower training facilities to meet the upgrading, replacement, and
expansion needs of the industry. To support moves in these strategic direc-
tions, detailed analytic input is required. The proposed Credit would fund a
consumer demand and market study which would form the basis for expansion of
the industry into non-traditional product lines.  It wculd also make provi-
sion for a handloom sector study which would have the principal objective of
formulating an intervention program and institutional arrangements to enable
this sector to play a maximum role in those product areas where it can remaia
competitive. GOB has agreed to prepare for discussion with IDA a long-term
strategy paper that would draw in part on the findings of these two studies.
III. PROJECT CONCEPT
A. Origin and Evolution
3.01      In 1975 IDA carried out a survey of the Bangladesh textile
industry. The recommendations of this survey formed the basis for action
programs undertaken as part of Imports Program Credits IV-VIII, encompassing
inter alia pricing policy, capital restructuring, and mill rehabilitation.
The review of mill rehabilitation requirements led in 1979 to a project
proposal by GOB and the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC) for the
rehabilitation of 50 of BTMC's operational mills. IDA agrc-d to finance this
project, but in a phased manner, given limited implementatioii capacity. The
first phase, which was intended to cover the rehabilitation requirements of
about 15 selected mills, formed the basis of the Textile Industry Rehabilita-
tion Project (Credit No. 1205-BD). The remaining mills were to be taken up
in subsequent phases, the intention being that the workload on the Project
Implementation Cell would be distributed as evenly as possible, with periods
of high activity on the subsequent phases timed to coincide with periods of
low activity on the first phase.
3.02       Shortly after Credit 1205-BD became effective, GOB, as mentioned
earlier, denationalized 22 of BTMC's mills.  Nine .f the 15 mills included in
Credit No. 1205-BD were among those transferred to the private sector. Since
the new owners needed time to take effective control of t-heir mills and to
address immediate liquidity problems following the transfer, GOB proposed to
drop the nine transferred mills from Credit 1205-BD, and agreed to allow BTMC
to propose substitute public sector mills in their place. These were



-23-
accepted for inclusion under the credit on the basis of a mill-by-mill review
by IDA. At the same time, the proposed project was prenared principally to
support the BMR needs of the denationalized private sector mills, while
providing further support to address any additional BMR requirements of the
BTMC mills that could not be accommodated under the ongoing credit. Thus the
BTMC mills are in effect being taken up in three batches, comprising the six
mills retained by BTMC from the original first-phase batch of 15, the nine
substitute mills for those which were denationalized, and about seven which
would be provided for under the proposed Credit. Bid evaluations have been
completed for the first batch of six, and procurement awards have been made
for blow-room machinery and draw frames, with others to follow. Tender
documents are being finalized for the second batch of nine substitute mills,
and are in preparation for six of nine mills constituting the third batch for
which BXR financing is sought. Of 21 private sector mills for which BMR
financing is sought, BMR requirements surveys have been completed for 16,
and financial/economic appraisals are in progress, and projected to continue
through October 1984.
3.03      For the purposes of IDA involvement in BMR financing, the
Bangladesh textile mills may be grouped as shown in Annex 4.1. Group 1
comprises the six mills accepted for BMR financing under Cr. 1205-BD which
are still in the public sector. Group 2 comprises the mills substituted by
PTMC for the nine mills, originally included under Cr. 1205-BD, which were
either denationalized or put up for liquidation. Group 3 comprises the
remaining public sector mills proposed for inclusion under the present
project. Group 4 comprises the private sector mills which constitute the
main target of the present project. Finally Group 5 comprises those mills,
public and private, for which BMR assistance is not sought. The number of
mills in each category is shown below:
Table 3.1:  NUMBER OF MILLS BY REHABILITATION CATEGORY
Group 1          Cr. 1205-BD, original              6

Group 3/a        Second Credit, BTMC                9
Group 4          Second Credit, private sector   21
Group 5          Assistance not sought             18
Total                     5
/a This includes three units which are not cotton
textile mills. Valika produces woollen textiles,
Karilin silk textiles, and Engineering Industries
Limited (EIL) is an engineering workshop and
parts manufacturing facility run by BTMC.
B. Summary Project Design
3.04       In addition to meeting the BMR needs of the mill sector, the
proposed Credit would lay the foundation for further growth and evolution of
the sector as a whole. In this regard, potential exists for embracing new



-24-
product lines for both import-substitution and exports. Any such expansion
would not be undertaken under the proposed Credit, but provision would be
made to carry out the market and feasibility studies necessary to support
such moves (paragraphs 2.29, 2.42). As a further component, the project
seeks to remove the fundamental competitive weakness of the Bangladesh tex-
tile industry, which remains the shortage of adequately trained
techno-managerial manpower. The Credit would make provision to ensure the
continuation and adequacy of training programs. Finally, a component is
included to help formulate strategy and a program of assistance to the hand-
loom sector (paragraph 2.36).
C. Project Objectives
3.05       The goals conceived for this project are as follows: It would
support the privatisatiori initiative of GOB and further the aims of making
the Bangladesh textile mill sector more competitive, and ultimately capable
of exports in selected product areas, through improvements in labor and
machine productivity, product quality, manpower skills, management systems,
and in the policy environment. These goals require action at three different
levels addressed in the project. First, the coxitinuation of mill rehabilita-
tion, manpower training, and maanagement systems upgrading would secure the
immediate strategic objective of correcting the weakness of poor technical
efficiency in the mill sector. Second, the project would attempt to further
the gains already made in the policy environment, in which the objective is
to ensure that the incentive structure does not insulate poor performance
from the sanctions of the market place, and conversely, rewards efficient
performance. Third, the project would provide the market intelligence and
sector knowledge - as well as strengthen the iastitutional mechanisms -
required to formulate longer-term strategy which would respond to changing
market conditions and emerging opportunities in both domestic and foreign
markets.
D.  Health, Safety and Environmental Aspects
3.06      As a special concern, the project will continue efforts started
under the ongoing Credit to improve health, safety and environmental aspects
of mill operation in Bangladesh. Based on a health and safety audit of BTMC
mills carried out jointly by the Factories Inspectorate and the BTMC Medical
Department, a number of shortcomings in present mill standards were iden-
tified. Various low-cost remedies have been proposed and are being adopted
by BTMC. Higher-cost remedies which involve installation of industrial plant
to assist in dust removal and noise abatement are understandably resisted by
BTMC as damaging to profitability. IDA has agreed with BTMC to a low-cost
program aimed at achieving the greatest impact at the lowest cost. The
Environmental Pollution Control Department is in the process of carrying out
a survey focusing on mills having dyeing and finishing facilities. Following
submission of their report and recommendations, which were due to be handed
over to BTMC by mid-October 1983, BThC would formulate specific proposals for
IDA review. Equipment requirements would be eligible for financing under
both the existing and proposed Credits. The standards agreed to for BTMC
would be broadened to apply equally to the private sector mills.

IV. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. BSB and BSRS
4.01       Under Credit 1205-BD for the rehabilitation of public sector
textile mills, BTMC acted for GOB as implementing agency and project financ-
ing intermediary. With the divestment of 22 textile mills during 1982 and
1983 to private ownership, an alternative intermediary is now needed to
fulfill BTMC's role for private sector rehabilitation. The Bangladesh Shilpa
Bank (BSB) and the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (BSRS) are the logical
choices since they both have had considerable experience in financing textile
projects, and were the original financiers of most of the private mills
applying for BMR financing under the present project, and continue to hold in
their respective portfolios Loans to some of these enterprises. However,
a significant restructuring program initiated by GOB, IDA and ADB has not yet
been completed (paragraph 4.06), and it is proposed that the institutions
would administer the proposed project on behalf of GOB, rather than serve as
direct intermediary lending agencies.
4.02       Past Operations.  IDA's association with BSB has been the longer
and more direct, involving two lines of credit totalling US$75.0 million. 1/
Association with BSRS has been limited to indirect contacts through the
rescheduling of jute sector loans and the recent Financial Sector Study. 2/
4.03      BSB was set up in 1971 after Bangladesh became independent, to take
over the operations of the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan and to
provide long-term finance, especially foreign currency, to small and medium
public and private sector enterprises. BSRS was also established in 1971 to
provide long-term financing to medium- and large-scale industry, taking over
the operations of the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation,
the National Investment Trust and the Equity Participation Fund. At the time
Bangladesh became independent, most of the enterprises financed by the
predecessors of BSB and BSRS were nationalized, and in the early
post-independence years, both institutions provided finance predominantly to
the public manufacturing sector. Since 1975, almost 100% of new disburse-
ments by BSB and BSRS have been to private manufacturing enterprises.  As of
1/ Credit 632-BD for US$25.0 million appr'ved by the Board on May 20, 1976
and Credit U117-BD for US$50 million approved by the Baard on
May 19, 1981 (SARs 1162-BD dated May 6, 1976 and 3186-BD dated
February 23, 1981 respectively).
2/ Report No. 4098-BD - Bangladesh Financial Sector Review - dated
December 14, 1982.



-26-
June 30, 1983, loans outstanding by BSB/BSRS amounted to Tk. 8.1 billion
(US$325 million) or about 60% of outstanding loans to the private manufactur-
ing sector. 1/ The balance of funds, mainly in the form of general advances,
was provided by the commercial banks.
4,04       Although their predecessors had performed well during the 1960s,
the 1970s proved to be a difficult period for BSB/BSRS. With the creation of
Bangladesh, many units financed by BSB/BSRS lost access to markets in Pakis-
tan. This, together with significant devaluations of the taka led to high
arrears, liquidity problems and disputes with clients who were adversely
affected by continual taka devaluations. Operational efficiency, already
affected by the high Levels of portfolio infection, was further affected by a
high level of staff turnover. By 1975 BSB and BSRS were in serious financial
difficulties and needed support from GOB to remain operational. During this
period, GOB and IDA and GOB and ADB worked closely together to resolve the
operational difficulties of BSB and BSRS respective'.y. By 1980, the finan-
cial health of both institu:ions had been restored. However, by late 1982
the impact of the economic recession, exacerbated by a tendency to poor
financial discipline resulted in large increases in private sector arrears.
Both BSB and BSRS were unable to meet their debt obligations. This
deterioration led to the informal suspension (in October 1982) of disburse-
ments by IDA, ADB and KfW under their credit lines to BSB/BSRS.
4.05       As conditions for lifting the informal suspensions, GOB took a
number of actions to revitalise BSB and BSRS including: (i) a capital
restructuring to restore debt/equity, current and debt service coverage
ratios to limits agreed by the bilateral agencies; (ii) the passing of spe-
cial debt recovery ordinances, (iii) curtailment of credit by commercial
banks to defaulting borrowers, (iv) a joint GOB/IDA/ADB periodic review of
loan recovery performance by BSB/BSRS, (v) upgrading of staffing
capabilities, particularly in the areas of end use operations, and
(vi) initiation of an institutional review and portfolio audit for both
institutiors.  Subsequently, in January 1983, new managing directors and a
number of new general managers were appointed and GOB announced a scheme to
protect borrowers from exchange rate fluctuations. On the basis of these
actions, the informal suspensions were lifted in February 1983.
4.06       While GOB's actions have provided short-term relief for BSB and
BSRS, it is recognised that more fundamental financial reforms would be
necessary to restore the institutions to long-term financial viability and
improve their capacity to function as fully effective vehicles for term
lending to industry. The institutional reviews and portfolio audits to be
carried out by consultants under a UNDP-funded/AID3-administered technical
assistance program are expected to provide recoamendations on the reforms
necessary. While BSB/BSRS are facing operational constraints as a result of
their financial difficulties, both institutions have well developed project
1/ See Annex 3.1 for details of the operations cnd financial statistics of
BSB/BSRS.



-27-
appraisal and project implementation capabilities. Thus, pending the outcome
of the institutional reviews and portfolio audits, these capabilities would
be used by GOB to carry out appraisal and implementation activities relating
to the private sector rehabilitation projects. Until the financial restruc-
turing of BSB/BSRS has been agreed between GOB and the bilateral agencies,
the credit risk under the proposed project would be borne by GOB, with provi-
sion in the Development Credit Agreement to transfer it to BSB/BSRS when the
restructuring has been completed to IDA's satisfaction.
4.07       Background and Role of BSB.  BSB is one of the country's major
suppliers of long-term financing for industry. As of June 30, 1983, its
long-term portfolio (Tk. 4.3 billion) accounted for about a third of the
total outstanding long-term portfolio of the financial system. BSB's opera-
tions encompass almost all segments of the industrial sector although, for
historical reasons, it has concentrated on agro-industries, jute, textiles
and chemical industry projects (many in the public sector). Since 1975 it
has concentrated its lending to private sector operations, following GOB's
general industrial investment policy guidelines.
4.08       Institutional Set Up and Capabilities.  BSB's operations are
controlled by a Board, appointed by GOB, consisting of a chairman, managing
director and seven other directors, including two private sector
industrialists. (An oiganisation chart is shown in Annex 3.2.) The six civil
service directors are all senior GOB policy making officials. The Chairman
of the Board is also chairman of BSRS. Currently BSB has three general
managers at its Read Office and a general manager at each of its three
regional offices.
4.09       The overall number of professional staffing is satisfactory.  Due
to the rapid expansion of BSB's portfolio, however, BSB's supervision efforts
have largely been restricted to projects experiencing major difficulties and
to resolving disputes with borrowers on arrears increases caused by foreign
exchange fluctuations. These weaknesses have been recognised by BSB which
has assigned more staff to supervision operations, created a Special Recovery
Cell attached to the office of the Managing Director, and initiated a
case-by-case review of arrears projects to develop appropriate repay-
ment/restructuring programs with its borrowers. Additionally, it is expected
that BSB's end use operations would be upgraded by impLementation of recom-
mendations flowing from the institutional review and portfolio audit. BSB's
project appraisals are comprehensive and generally satisfactory, although
weaknesses in the areas of supplyidemand projections and sectoral perspective
have been identified. To address these weaknesses, BSB has employed an
Industrial Economic Advisor and is actively recruiting experienced industrial
economists for its appraisal and economic analysis departments.
4.10       Financial Position.  In 1981 (under Credit 1117-BD) GOB/BSB3 intro-
duced a comprehensive program to reduce arrears. This program was
strengthened as a condition for lifting the suspension of Credit 1117-BD
(paragraph 4.05). Pending resolution of BSB's arrears problems, GOB wilL
assure fulfillment of BSB's obligations, and its continued functioning.



-28-
4.11       Background and Role of BSRS.  BSRS, an autoxolmous Government-owned
development bank, i8 enabled by its Charter to extend loans, invest in
equity, issue guarantees, and enter into syndication.  As of January 1983,
BSRS's long-term portfolio (Tk. 3.0 billion) accounted for about 20% of the
total outstanding long-term portfolio of the financial system.  Although BSRS
has pursued a policy of portfolio diversification, its focus on large-scale
project lending has resulted in a concentration of its operations in four
subsectors - food and allied industries, jute, textiles and chemicals - which
account for about 70% of its loan portfolio. Since 1982 BSRS has been
seriously affected by the economic recession, causing it to deploy greater
staff resources into end-use operations and collections.
4.12       Institutional Set Up and Capabilities.  BSRS's operations are
directed by a nine-member board appointed by GON, consisting of a chairman,
managing director and seven directors, including two private sector
industrialists. (An organisation charL is shown in Annex 3.3.) Six of the
directors are senior Government officials. Day-to-day operations are
administered by the managing director and two general managers supported by
four deputy general managers controlling specific operational divisions, e.g.
administration, end use, operations/appraisal and technical support. Cur-
rently BSRS has a total staff of 220 including 107 professionals.
4.13       BSRS's project appraisal and end use procedures have been the
subject of extensive review by ADB, which provided long-term technical assis-
tance in these areas.  BSRS's appraisal reports, which are well written and
presented, generally present a satisfactory evaluation of projects considered
for financing.  Currently, a weakness of the appraisals is in market evalua-
tion, with the need for more emphasis on the macro supply/demand position.
This is now being addressed by including coverage on sectorai problems and
possible solutions, existing sectotal capacity utilisation, minimum economic
plant size, and appropriateness of technology. Under ADB's third loan to
BSRS in 1980, a number of significant changes in structure and procedures
were introduced, including the creation of a separate end use division, and
the introduction of project progress reporting. Due to staff constraints,
however, BSRS' supervision efforts concentrated more on its major problem
projects, leaving collections as an area of weakness. This weakness is being
addressed under the more recent programs initiated by GOB in 1982 and 1983
(paragraph 4.05). Under the present project, BSRS would be provided with
technical assistance to upgrade its end use operations and reporting
capabilities, particularly in the areas of technical and financial progress
reporting. Additionally subborrowers under the project would be required to
submit periodic audited financial statements prepared by auditors acceptable
to IDA.
4.14       Financial Position.  With assistance from GOB in 1983, BSRS has
aanaged to maintain satisfactory debt/equity and debt service coverage ratios
well within the limits of 5:1 and 1:1 respectively over the past five
years. 1/ However, as a result of declining levels of collections, BSRS's



-29-
liquidity position has recently been strained. GOB and BSRS are taking steps
to improve loan collections and to reduce future defaults (paragraph 4.06).
The major factors contributing to the decline in collections and deteriora-
tion in the portfolio of BSRS (and BSB) are noted in paragraph 4.04. Pending
completion of the institutional review and portfolio audit for BSRS
(paragraph 4.06), GOB has given assurances that it would provide support if
necessary to enable BSRS to fulfill its obligations, and continue operations.
B. Private Sector Mills
4.15       Background.  In accordance with the initiatives announced in the
New Industrial Policy (paragraph 1.05), on September 26, 1982 GOB issued an
order in which the shares of 22 textile mills held by GOB were offered to
eligible Bangladeshi owners on specified teras and conditions (see
AnneK 3.4). These terms provide essentially that:
(a) Bangladeshi shareholders of the mills at the time of nationaliza-
tion in 1972 could have their shares returned at the same price
paid as compensation by the Government in 1972;
(b) in cases where Bangladeshi shareholders held 51% or more of the
total shares, management would be transferred to such
shareholders upon payment of the compensation price;
(c) in cases where Bangladeshi shareholders held less than 51%, they
would be required to buy additional shares to acquire a control-
ling interest of 51 percent before transfer of management; fur-
ther they would have first option to buy all remaining shares
held by GOB;
(d) the mills would remain intact as juridical entities, meaning that
the new owners would assume responsibility for all assets and
liabilities of the mills;
(e) in particular, the new owners would have to discharge the mills'
various liabilities on the same terms ard conditions as
originally contracted;
(f) further, "'Goveiniment investnments" (generally equity infusions
against which shares were not issued) would have to be repaid
over a period of six to nine years "depending on the viability
of the mills", and inclusive of a two-year moratorium.
(g) where, pursuant to (c) above, GOB were to retain shareholding in
a transferred mill, GOB would have the right to sell its remain-
ing shares to other private parties, or failing sufficient
response, to financial institutions; further, GOB would reserve
1/ Covenanted ratio under ADOI's lines of credit.



-30-
the right to nominate directors in proportion to its remairning
shareholding in any private mill.
4.16       The transfer of ownership and assumption oc managerial control of
these mills by the private owners proceeded smoothly and was completed in
February/March 1983. &s of December 31, 1983 GOB was holding directorships
in six of the 22 mills, pending the acquisition of additional shares by the
respective private shareholders.
4.17       Under the transfer terms the private mills were required to take
over all officers, staff and workers in employment of the enterprise.s on the
date of transfer along with liabilities of their service benefits. They were
also required to take over an agreed number of officers and staff of BTMC
Head Office and Shipping Office likely to be declared surplus. It was fur-
ther agreed that there would be no termination or retrenchment of staff for
one year from the date of transfer. GOB reserved the right to intervene in
the affairs of the denationalized companies in case of default on their
liabilities to the government, the financial institutions or foreign
creditors, or in case the company were to fail to operate the mills trans-
ferred for any reason not beyond its control.
4.18       Total current employment of the private textile mills is 40% to
45% of the work force in the cotton textile industry (excluding the handloom
sector). The current value of assets transferred to private ownership is
estimated at about Tk 2.7-3.0 billion (US$110-120 million). The spinning
capacity of the private sector mills represents 40% of total capacity, and
54% of total mill weaving capacity.
4.19       Capital Restructuring.  Prior to the transfer of the mills to the
private sector, financial and operating control at the mill level had
deteriorated considerably. The summarised balance sheets of the transferred
mills as of June 30, 1982 -- the end of the last fiscal year prior to trans-
fer -- are shown in Annex 4.5, where required reschedulings and equity
adjustments due to asset revaluation are also shown. Eighteen of the
twenty-two mills subsequently transferred to the private sector had aggregate
accumulated losses of Tk 599.0 million, which substantially exceeded the
original equity contributions of Tk 77.0 million. Operating deficits of
these mills were financed by government equity infusions and by BTMC borrow-
ing from commercial banks. This gave rise to a problem of inadequate
debt-equity structure on book value basis, and an excess of current
liabilities in relation to current assets. It nevertheless appeared to be in
the interest of the new owners to resume ownership and control of these
mills, as in most cases the market value of fixed assets exceeded by far the
book value, to the extent that only one of the 22 transferred mills continued
to show a negative equity position after the asset revaluation exercise
commissioned by GOB prior to the transfer. IDA has carried out its own asset
revaluation exercise which in most cases is in agreement with the GOB exer-
cise, to within a reasonable margin of error.
4.20       Further improvement to the financial condition of the transferred
mills has been secured by the agreement in principle of the commercial banks



-31-
to reschedule current liabilities owed to them by the mills to the extent
required to enable the mills to service current debt out of current earnings.
These reschedulings would be effected prior to subloan approvals by BSB/BSRS
and IDA in individual cases. As a further measure that has faciLitated
required capital restructuring of the private sector milLs, GOB has adopted
an Exchange Rate Fluctuation Burden Absorption Scheme (ERAS) under which
future borrowers have the option to seek protection against foreign exchange
rate fluctuations by paying a premium of 2.5% p.a and past borrowers with
foreign exchange loans outstanding were given the option of obtaining relief
on a specified "net excess exchange risk burden" by way of conversion of a
part of the burden into either redeemable preferential shareholding or deben-
ture holding of the lending institution in the respective borrowing entity.
Finally, although Government equity contributions to the mills during BTMC
tenure, against which shares were not issued, are to be repaid by the new
owners over six to eight years, GOB has agreed to subordinate these claims to
claims held by other creditors, and hold no collateral security in respect of
these outstanding claims. Under the new ownership, therefore, Government
contributions may be treated as quasi-equity for the purpose of assessi,g the
strength of the balance sheet. On this basis, 19 of 22 mills show a
debt-equity ratio better than 70:30 (sixteen without treatment of Government
contributions as quasi-equity). With the financial restructuring that has
been indicated, it is expected that most of the mills will meet the financial
conditions precedent to subloan approval.
4.21       BTMA.  The denationalized mills have formed an association known
as the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA). Thus far, the BTMA has
been concerned predominantly with representing the interests of its member
mills in matters arising from the recent denationalization. Its officers and
members negotiated with the Government as a collective in finalizing the
transfer terms. The BTMA has also acted collectively in arriving at a common
negotiating position vis-a-vis the banks on matters related to repayment of
dues outstanding, and as an association enjoy a much stronger bargaining
position than each mill would have acting individually. Once the problems of
capital restructuring are resolved, however, BTMA's role as (in effect) a
collective bargaining body is expected to diminish, and its potential role as
a provider of common technical services to its members is likely to take on
greater significance than at present. This transformation will be an impor-
tant one. The private sector mills have inherited the same problems faced by
their public sector counterparts \'ree discussion of BTMC below) in respect of
the need for techno-managerial improvements.  The BTvA can play a coordinat-
ing role in bringing to its member mills the services that are required
(paragraph 6.10).
C. BTMC
4.22       A detailed description of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation
(BTMC) was provided in the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 3568-BD) of
Cr.1205-BD.  In the present report the main strengths and weaknesses, and the
set of agreed actions under Cr.1205-BD are described. An update on new
developments affecting the BTMC and projected future performance also is
given.



-32-
4.23       Organizational Background.  The head office of the BTMC is located
in Dhaka, where it functions as a public sector manufacturing enterprise
under the administrative control of the Ministry of Industries and Commerce
(MOIC). 1/ It was established in 1972 to give effect to the Government Order
nationalizing the large textile industries. BTMC is headed by a six-member
Board, appointed by GOB, comprising the Chairman as the Chief Executive
Officer and five functional executive directors in the areas of Finance,
Planning and Development, Production Control, Purchase and Sales, and Inter-
nal Audit. Annex 3.6 shows the structure of MOIC, and Annex 3.7 that of
BTMC. The BTMC Board is vested with authority to control and direct the
operations of all public sector mills.
4.24       At the mill level, a management committee consisting of the Mill
Manager, Spinning Master, Weaving Master where applicable, and the Manager
Administration direct day-to-day activities in the mills. These managers
operate under the purview of a five-member Board of Directors. The Chairman
of a Mill (Enterprise) Board would normally be a BTMC Director or senior
officer. Other Board members would include a Zonal General Manager, the Mill
Manager, and representatives from the banking system and the private sector.
The organization structure of the mills is shown in Annex 3.8.
4.25       This structure of relationships among GOB, BTMC and the mills
arose essentially due to the felt need to keep the individual mill
enterprises as separate legal entities. Under Company Law, this meant that
they each had to have their own Board of Directors, even if that meant that
the authority of the Enterprise Boards was potentially in conflict with the
administrative line authority of the Corporation itself. In practice, as
might be expected given the composition of the Enterprise Boards, the line
authority of BTMC superseded that of the Enterprise Boards, which therefore
served more as advisory than managerial bodies.
4.26       Autonomy.  This organisation structure reflected a perceived
weakness related to levels of autonomy, first in the relation between BTMC
and GOB, and second in the relation between BTMC and its subordinate
enterprises. With IDA encouragement, GOB policy now places importance in
securing greater levels of autonomy in operational decision-making. On July
24, 1983, GOB announced in the Gazette a general reorganisation of the public
sector, including the manufacturing enterprises. The textile mills under the
BTMC are to be grouped into three or four companies, the shares of each of
which would be wholly vested in the BTMC. This reorganisation, when imple-
mented, should facilitate better delegation of authority down the line, and
avoid undue civil service interference in the day-to-day affairs of the
Corporation, and in turn of the Corporation in the management of the
enterprises.
1/  Originally the Ministry of Textiles (MOT) served as BTMC's supervising
ministry. MOT was absorbed into the Ministry of Industries and Com-
merce (MOIC) in 1982.



-33-
4.27   Operational Performance.  BTMC's operational performance is largely
coterminous with the performance of the mill sector as a whole over the
period FY72-FY82. To address the weaknesses, a consultancy package was
adopted under Cr,1205-BD in the areas of financial management, production
planning and control, management, organisation and succession planning, and
marketing. Despite denationalization of 23 of BTMC's mills, and the impend-
ing reorganization, BTMC still feels a need for these services.  Following
various procedural delays, the consultants are expected to be fielded by
about March, 1984.
4.28       In addition to these consultancy services, an in-service training
program at the Savar Training Institute has been set up with UNDP/UNIDO
assistance. This training program will continues BTMC feels that the coun-
terparts of the UNDP/UNIDO team can carry on the training program without
further expatriate assistance. However, there is a risk that the counter-
parts will not stay in the training function, since the opportunities and
remuneration offered in operations are generally more attractive. Addition-
ally, the range of courses offered at the Institute needs to be extended to
include courses in management accounting and production management practices
specific to the textile industry. In the circumstances, it is felt that
further strengthening of the Institute, with the possibility of continued
expatriate assistance would be necessary to assure consolidation of the gains
made at the Savar Training Institute. In the meantime, the relative
remuneration and career inducements offered to the local trainers would need
careful review, and the staffing situation would need to be carefully
monitored.
4.29       Prospects.  Following a massive loss of Tk 652 million in FY82,
BTMC rebounded in FY83 to show a profit of Tk 69 million in FY83 for the
mills it retained. As mentioned earlier (paragraph 2.15), this rebound
reflected improved operational performance, with capacity utilization, in
spinning up to 84% or an 8-point increase above the corresponding figure for
FY82 - and with capacity utilization in weaving also showing an increase from
66% in FY82 to 70% in FY83. Profitability was also helped by the elimination
of sales tax on imported raw cotton, lower cotton prices on the international
market, and price increases in yarn ex-mill. On present projections (Annex
3.9), BTMC should enjoy continued profitability, provided that the new pric-
ing policy of allowing a more rapid response by BThiC to cost increases on the
input side is continued.
4.30       Continued pricing flexibility by BTMC would also be important to
private sector profitability, as BTMC prices would tend to set ceilings on
private sector prices for comparable products. GOB has, under Cr.1205-BD,
agreed to the introduction of free-market pricing in BTMC mills according to
an agreed timetable. Actions so far taken (paragraphs 2.33 -2.34) represent
an acceleration of the timetable earlier proposed by GOB.

V. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs and Components
5.01      The proposed project would comprise the following components:
(a) BMR-Private Mills. Purchase and installation of equipment,
macninery and spares required for BMR in up to 21 private sector
mills. Taking into account the possibility of fall-out, costs
have been based on 15 mills ultimately being accepted for inclu-
sion. Provision would also be made for the technical assistance
requirements of carrying out the BMR program (see below, this
paragraph).
(b) BMR - Public Mills. Purchase and installation of equipment,
machinery and spares required for BMR in up to nine mills in the
public sector, whose requirements cannot be accommodated under
Credit 1205-BD. Costs have been estimated on the basis of seven
of the nine mills being included.
(c) Technical Assistance.
(i) Private Sector BMR. Preoperational consultancy assistance
to the mills in procurement and commissioning of equipment
and machinery.
(ii) Handloom Sector Study.  Consultancy assistance in investigat-
ing the long-term role of the handloom sector, support needs
and priorities, and the design of a program of intervention
and institutional support for this sector.
(iii) Consumer Demand and Market Study. Consultancy assistance
to carry out a demand study to lay the foundation for future
growth and possible product diversification of the industry.
(iv) Training. Provision for training advisers in the areas of
production management and management accounting to augment
training activities in the technical areas of spinning,
weaving, and finishing.
(v) In-plant Management and Productivity Counselling. Provision
with UNDP/UNIDO assistance for in-plant productivity coun-
selling for private mills.



-35-
5.02       The total cost of the project is estimated to be Tk 1,510 million
(US$61.0 million) of which Tk 160 million (lJS$ 6.5 million) is in duties and
taxes. This cost estimate is based on the assumption that roughly 15 of 21
private mills will ultimately be included, and 7 of 9 public mills. The
project costs include about Tk 212 million (US$ 8.6 million) which will be
required to bring working capital up to and maintain it at a level consistent
with efficient operation. A breakdown of project costs by major component is
shown in Table 5.1 below.

5.03       The BMR requirements of the public sector mills are based on BTMC
estimates which have been vetted by the appraisal team and IDA's technical
consultant, Geerdes International, and are considered technically sound.  The
Consultant's report is available in the Project File. Six of the nine public
sector mills had fully costed proposals which have already been appraised,
and five of these have been found aceptable (see Section 7). Cost estimates
for the three remaining mills have been based on provisional estimates sup-
plied by BTMC. BMR costs for the private sector mills have been estimated
based on mill-by-mill requirements surveys conducted by the UNDP team, their
BTMC counterparts, and mill management. These estimates are still provi-
sional and are to be vetted by the BSB/BSRS appraisal teams, and reviewed by
IDA in the course of subproject appraisal.
5.04       BMR costs comprise equipment and spare parts requirements typi-
cally for modernization and recommissioning of carding machinery, and
replacement or repair of draw frames, fly frames, spinning ring frames, blow
room lines, sizing machines, warping machines, and in few cases the replace-
ment or reconditioning of looms. Civil works costs generally involve renova-
tion of floors and ceilings of ex'sting buildings, but include building
extensions where this is thought necessary to achieve proper balancing.
Provision under the Credit also has been made for consultancy assistance to
the private mills in preparing bid specifications, in evaluating bids
received, and in setting acceptance requirements. Physical contingencies
have been estimated at the rate of 2.5% of the base estimated cost. Price



-36-
contingencies have been computed on the basis of projected domestic inflation
rates of 10% p.a and international inflation rates respectively of 9.5, 9.5,
and 8.0% in FY84, 85 and 86. Cost breakdowns by major project category are
shown in aggregate form in Annex 5.1(I).
5.05       Provision for the handloom sector study, the market and demand
survey, and the training component have been estimated. The handloom sector
study 1/ should take about six months to complete, and require three or four
experts (for a total of about 20 man-months) in the following areas: textile
technology (weaving and finishing), marketing, financial analysis, and
industrial economics. This cost is estimated at US$0.25 million, or $12,500
per man-month ;nclusive of both fees and incidentals. The consumer demand
and market study would require four or five individuals for a total of about
24 man-months in the areas of market research, statistical sample survey
methodology, textile fabric design and construction, computer analysis of
survey data. This cost is estimated at about US$30C,000, using again the
rate of $12,500 per man-month, but this may be reduced if suitable local
experts can be found. The cost of field work is estimated to cost
US$200,000, or 200-300 man-months. The study should last about one calendar
year beginning about June/Juyl 1984. The training component would make
provision for two expatriat1- Avisers for two years each in the areas of
management accounting ar''   oduction management applications specific to the
textile industry.
B. Financing Plan
5.06       The proposed financing plan is shown in Annex 5.1(II), and sum-
marized in Table 5.2 below:
Table 5.2: PROJECT FINANCING
------US$ million-------
Source             Local  Foreign    Total Share %
IDA                  2.9      42.1     45.0    73.8
UNDP                   .       1.0       1.0     1.6
Mill                 9.9       5.1      15.0    24.6
Total             12.8      48.2      61.0   100.0
5.07       The firnancing contribution by the mills is estimated at 24.6% of
total project cost. In the case of the private mills, this reflects the rule
that a maximum of 80% of the project cost should be loan financed, and that
the long-term debt to equity ratio should be a maximum of 70:30 following the
1/ See previous footnote.



-37-
BMR investment.l/ Private mill share of their component of project costs is
estimated at 25.8%. IDA loan financing is 73.8% of overall project costs.
(Fifty percent of the IDA contribution would be subject to Special Fund
provisions (paragraph 5.15) ). Equity financing would be financed to the
extent possible out of cash generation of the mills, otherwise out of equity
infusions from the owners. For the public mills, a 74.9% loan financing ratio
is estimated, although under the existing Credit for the public mills, a more
favorable financing percentage was envisaged, with the mills bearing only
17.6% of project cost. This means in effect that notwithstanding IDA disbur-
sement percentages of up to 100% in some categories for the public sector
mills, BTMC and the Government would have to adjust the list of procurement
awards for which IDA reimbursement would be sought under the proposed Credit.
C. Relending Arrangements
5.08       The IDA Credit would be onlent by GOB to participating private and
public mills. tn the case of the private mills, BSB and BSRS would act as
agents of GOB in administering the loans (paragraphs 4.01, 6.02). In the
case of the public sector mills, BTMC would act for GOB in the onlending
arrangement with participating mills.
5.09       The onlending terms for the IDA Credit and local loans are 14.5%
p.a 2/ repayable over up to 15 years inclusive of up to four years' grace.
In case loans are used for the financing of working capital, however, the
maturities of these could be shorter - five to eight years. The foreign
exchange risk on the IDA Credit would be borne by GOB against a fee of 2.5%
over and above the interest charge. BSB and BSRS would charge an administra-
tion fee of 2.5% p.a which would be withheld from interest payments received
from the subborrowers before being passed on to GOB.
5.10       The technical assistance aspects of the project (viz. handloom
sector study, market and consumer demand study, and training) would be
administered by GOB through the MOIC. No special onlending arrangements are
necessary for these components.
1/ 80:20 in less-developed areas.
2/  Subject to adjustment during the period of commitment LV renain posi-
tive in real terms. Inflation in Bangladesh is estimated at i6.5% for
FY83, and projected to remain at about 10% over the next two to ti.ree
years.

D. Procurement
5.11       Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.3.
5.12       Private Sector Component.  The arrangements made for procurement
by the private sector mills would be similar to those under o, oing IDA
Credits to BSB:
(a) for awards under US$150,000, the project sponsor would be
required to submit at least three quotations;
(L') for contracts of US$150,000 to US$500,000, the project sponsor
or BSB/BSRS would obtain quotations from known manufacturers (in
more than one country) through international shopping; and
(c) for contracts of over US$500,000, BSB/BSRS would invite interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) following procedures in accovd-
ance with IDA procedures.
5.13       Public Sector Component.  For the public sector mills, the arran-
gements now in force under the ongoing Textile Industry Rehabilitation Credit
would change only slightly. Most equipment, machinery and spares would be
procured in general through ICB following IDA Guidelines.  Exceptions to ICB
would be allowed in case of awards under US$100,000 (cf. $50,000 under the
first Credit), and for proprietary items. In the former case, procurement on
the basis of at least three quotations would be allowed. A percentage of
these awards would be selected for random post-award review by IDA.
Proprietary items would be procured through negotiated contracts or limited
international tendering (LIT) provided that a list of such items is submitted
to IDA for prior approval. Awards of less than US$50,000 (cf. $20,000 under
the first Credit) may be procured through local shopping on the basis of at
least three price quotations, and subject to an aggregate limit of
US$500,000. Finally, as under the ongoing Credit, BTMC would be allowed to
procure certain spare parts from its own workshops, subject to an aggregate
limit of US$250,000, and subject to procedures designed to ensure make-buy
decisions which are cost-effective.
5.14       Under the first Credit, BTMC has not taken advantage of the
freedom allowed with respect to proprietary items and awards under US$50,000,
preferring to put all procurement to ICB. This has simplified the tender
preparation process for BTMC, but it adds to the burden of tender evaluation.
A total of 41 tenders were received for the first batch of six mills. Fur-
ther, because BTMC is evaluating each separate item of equipment within each
tender, the evaluation process is further burdened. To avoid this difficulty
in future procurement, it will be necessary to structure procurement packages
that would eliminate at least the need for line-by-line evaluation, and take
advantage of the possibility of adopting LIT in certain cases (paragraph
5.13). The increase in the limit for LIT to $100,000, and for local shoping
to $50,000 should facilitate the procurement process in this respect, without
unduly compromising the volume of procurement put to ICB.



-40-
5.15       Special Fuad.  This project would be financed under Special Fund
provisions. Procurement of goods to be financed from the proceeds of the
Special Fund Credit would be limited ex ante to those countries which are
eligible at the time of signing of the Special Fund Credit. The determina-
tion of the source of financing (that is whether regular IDA Credit or Spe-
cial Fund Credit) would be made by IDA at the time BMR subprojects are
approved by IDA.
E. Disbursement
5.16       Private Sector Mills.  The following disburseinent percentages
would be applied to individual awards:
Equipment, machinery and spares          100% of foreign expenditures
100% of ex-factory cost
70% of off-the-shelf
cost (local)
Civil Works                               90% of cost
Raw Material (Fiber) Imports             100% of c.i,f cost
Technical Assistance                     100% of foreign expenditures
5.17       Private Sector Mills.  Taking into account the foregoing disburse-
ment percentages, and the debt-equity and loan-financing limits, BSB/BSRS
would prepare a financing plan for each mill.  Although the individual mill
financing plans are not yet available, it is estimated that the aggregate
disbursement amounts by expenditure category would look approximately as
shown in Annex 5.1(II). We estimate that IDA would disburse 80% of the cost
of equipment, machinery and spares, 80% of the cost of civil works, 100% of
the cost of incremental permanent working capital, and 100% of the cost of
pre-operational consultancy. Duties and taxes would be financed entirely by
owner contributions. Coupled with the financing contribution by the mill
owners of the cost of equipment, machinery and spares, and of civil works,
this amounts to a sponsor's share of 25.8% of project cost on average. To
meet the costs of incremental permanent working capital, IDA would disburse
against raw material imports up to an aggregate limit for each mill that
represents 100% of the estimated incremental working capital requirements.
5.18       Public Sector Mills.  For the public sector mills, the foregoing
disbursement percentages would also apply, and represent a continuation of
what they have been under the existing Credit.
5.19       Disbursement Schedule.  The projected disbursement schedule is
shown in Annex 5.1(III). It is estimated that the Credit would be fully
disbursed in four and a half years, that Ls by December 31, 1988.
5.20       Documentation.  All disbursements would be fully documented except
payments under small civil works contracts for less than US$10,000 equivalent
(about Tk 250,000) and for civil works carried out by force account, which
would be disbursed against statements of expenditures, certified by BTMC and
BSB/BSRS respectively. The relevant documentation would not be submitted
to IDA but would be retained by BTMC/BSB/BSRS at their Dhaka offices and made



-41-
available to IDA representatives for review during review missions. The
expenditures disbursed against statements of expenditure would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The reimbursement
applications in respect of contracts for US$10,000 equivalent or more would
be supported by a Statement of Works Performed which is acceptable as full
documentation under local civil works contracts. This documentation format
may also be used for payments under the smaller contracts, if desired.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Management
6.01      Private Sector Component.  The prime responsibility for the
implementation of BMR in the private sector mills would fall on mill manage-
ment.  With technical assistance from the UNDP/UNIDO Productivity Team and
BTMC counterparts, individuaL mill management is responsible for preparing
project proposals for submission to the respective intermediary banks. As of
writing, BMR requirements svrveys had been completed for 21 mills, with
individual mill managers having the responsibility of obtaining quotations
and costing the proposals. BSB and BSRS will appraise the financial and
economic viability of these proposals; IDA, in turn, will review the techni-
cal, financial, and economic analysis in each BSB/BSRS appraisal report,
prior to final approval. nill managers would have the option of capitalizing
the costs of consultants as part of subloans. It is anticipated that most
mills will utilize such consultants to assist in finalizing equipment
requirements, identifying potential suppliers, securing and evaluating bids
received, and assisting in the erection of BMR equipment, particularly in
commissioning procedures. BSB/BSRS will monitor the procurement process
according to agreed procedures (paragraph 5.12).
6.02       Under an administrative agreement to be concluded between GOB and
BSB/BSRS, respectively, each financial institution would act on behalf of
the Government in the appraisal, financing, supervision and collection with
respect to subloans to textile mills participating in this project. Annex
6.1 contains an outline draft of an admintistrative agreement. The signing of
administrative agreements between GOB and BSB/BSRS, satisfactory to the
association, would be a condition of credit effectiveness. Private mills
will apply to the institution of their choice, unless they have outstanding
loans with one institution, in which case that institution will handle th.zkr
application for BM4R financing. Each institution will make a comprehenaive
assessment of the technical, financial and economic justification of the
respective private mills' BMR proposals. Arrangements for technical prepara-
tion and review of fully-costed BMR plans of the private mills have been made
(paragraph 6.01).
6.03       The proposed administered arrangement will allow the private
sector mills to undertake much needed BMR without having to wait for the
completion of the institutional and portfolio reviews of BSB/BSRS which are



-42-
being conducted, at the initiative of IDA, ADB and KfW (paragraph 4.05). The
administered arrangement and the detailed procedures for subproject prepara-
tion and review will help insulate the proposed credit and individual sub-
projects from problems being faced by BSB/BSRS, during a period in which
organizational improvements are being made. BSB/BSRS are in a position to
assess the past performance of individual project sponsors and their
credit-worthiness, with particular attention to their capacity to provide
additional equity funds to reduce heavy debt-service burdens.
6.04       IDA staff has provided the financial institutions, private mills,
and assessment teams with a document (see Project File) giving the formats
and methodology to be used in converting the technical surveys into
feasibility studies, and project proposals. This was done to ensure an
appropriate and consistent basis for preparation and review of project
proposals.
6*03       The financial and economic criteria to be used by BSB and BSRS in
assessing and approving BMR loans (paragraph 7.10) will be reflected in the
administrative agreements between GOB and BSB/BSRS (paragraph 6.02). To
ensure the financial viability of the BMR investments and their impact on
overall operations of each mill, a review of the financial structure of each
mill is needed to determine whether steps need to be taken to restructure
equity and existing debt prior to BMR lending. This requires an asset
revaluation exercise. Such an exercise was carried out by GOB in connection
with the transfer arrangements. Although the results of this exercise will
form the basis for formal adoption by the mills of a revalued balance sheet,
IDA has performed an independent assessment, still subject to further adjust-
ment based on the extent of modernization/replacement sought. In cases where
the IDA figures are significantly less than the figures adopted by GOB, IDA
will reserve the right to use its own figures for the purposes of assessing
the financial condition of a mill applying for BMR financing.
6.06      Public Sector Mills.  For the public sector mills, arrangements
under Credit 1205-BD would be repeated. BTMC has created a Project Implemen-
tation Cell (PIC) staffed by a project manager, civil engineer, mechanical
engineer, electrical engineer, procurement coordinator, accountant, and
textile technologists in spinning, weaving, and finishing. Thus far, the PIC
has functioned satisfactorily, although there is some need for improvement in
the handling of procurement (paragraph 5.14). The PIC is supervised by a
Coordinating Committee consisting of the Directors of Planning and Develop-
ment, Production, Finance, and Purchasing. The PIC coordinates the project
teams which have been formed in each mill. These project teans consist of
the Chief Executive of the mill, the Technical Manager, and the Chiefs of
Accounting, Procurement, Stores, Production, and Maintenance. Installation
and erection of machinery and equipment will be carried out by the mills' own
fitters, augmented as necessary by teams of specialised fitters drawn from
other public mills.  Fitters will be supervised by technical personnel sent
by the equipment suppliers, monitored by the mills' project teams. These
arrangements are considered satisfactory.



-43-
6.07       Sectoral Component.  Activity related to the handloom sector
study, the market and consumer demand study, and the training program would
be coordinated by MOIC. Other public sector agencies which would be involved
are the Planning Commission which is involved in the formulation of
industrial sector strategy and policy, the BTMC, and the Bangladesh Handloom
Board (BHB). 1/ To strengthen policy and strategy formulation in the textile
sector, it was agreed under Credit 1205-BD that a Planning Cell would be
created in the then Ministry of Textiles to advise GOB on textile sector
strategy and policy. Although the Ministry of Textiles has since been merged
with the MOIC, which has a Planning Cell, there is a continuing need to give
special attention to the issues of the textile sector. The GOB has committed
itself to hiring an industrial economist, under terms of reference which have
been agreed, to strengthen the handling of textile sector issues. Action on
this matter has been delayed following procedural delays associated with the
merger of the Ministry of Textiles into MOIC, but will be taken prior to
Board pressentation.
B. Implementation Schedule
6.08    Public Sector Mills.  The implementation schedule for the public
sector mills is shown in Annex 6.2(l). This schedule shows actual progress
up to mid-November 1983 for the mills being taken up under the existing
Credit. The actual time required to prepare the tender documents has been
longer thdn expected, as has evaluation of tenders. Reasons for slower
progress than expected include the denationalization initiative which
involved a number of staff changes, and delays associated with preparation of
the tender documents following review and suggested changes by the UNDP/UNIDO
Team and IDA. Since tendering procedures may be streamlined but will not be
altered radically, the second project provides for a 48-month implementation
period, beginning in July 1984, to take into account expected delays in
tender evaluation, placement of orders, and opening of L/Cs. It is expected
that shipment of machinery will be the most variable element, particularly in
the case of made-to-order equipment. No major civil works are contemplated,
and what is planned can be carried out in parallel with procurement, leaving
substantial slack time for civil works. Erection and installation of equip-
ment is vulnerable to scheduling difficulties, as roving teams of fitters
and mechanics need to be used. It is anticipated that trial runs would
commence typically about two months after the commencement of erection and
installation, and proceed for about six weeks, after which commercial produc-
tion would begin. Preparation of tender documents will proceed prior to
credit effectiveness. BTMC should therefore be in a position to float
tenders as soon as the proposed Credit becomes effective, that is by August
1984, enabling the public sector component of the Credit to be physically
completed by June, 1988. Disbursements should continue for some time there-
after, until about December, 1988.
1/ Soon to be merged with the Cottage Industries Corporation.



-44-
6.09       Private Sector.  The implementation schedule for the private
sector mills is quite similar (Annex 6.2(II)). With private BMR subprojects
there are three additional activities - BMR plan preparation, BSB/BSRS
appraisal, and IDA review of the appraisal reports. 3MR plan preparation was
completed in April, 1984 for all 21 private mills. Thirteen of these had
been prepared with technical asssistance from the UNDP/UNIDO Productivity
Team. The remaining eight were prepared by BTMC experts attached to the
Savar Training Institute. The technical survey reports would form the basis
for fully costed project proposals to be submitted by the respective mill
managers. The project proposals are to be appraised by BSB and BSRS follow-
ing general guidelines developed by the IDA appraisal team (see Project
File). Several of these should have been completed by the time the Credit
becomes effective, that is by about August, 1984. The first set of equipment
specifications would be sent for tender/quotation immediately thereafter.
Taking this as the start date of the Project, it is expected to be physically
completed within a 40-month period, that is by December 1987, with the first
mill finishing perhaps as much as a year earlier than this date. Final
disbursements should be made some time after this date.
C. Technical Assistance
6.10       Private Sector Component.  To facilitate project implementation,
provision has been made for consultancy assistance to the mills (paragraph
6.01), focusing on procurement. In addition, to ensure that needed
techno-managerial improvements are secured, the project will provide for
general technical assistance to the private mills. This would take the form
of in-plant productivity counselling. Four advisers in the areas of spin-
ning, weaving, finishing and industrial engineering would constitute a roving
team of productivity advisers funded by UNDP grant under a project to be
executed by UNIDO. The Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA), of which
all the participating private mills are members, would provide coordinating
support. The services of the advisers would be made available at rates at
par or slightly higher than those charged by local management consultants.
6.11       Public Sector Mills.  Provision for advisory services to the
public sector mills has been made under the ongoing Credit. In addition to
the work performed by UNDP/UNIDO Productivity Team, BTMC and the public
sector mills will benefit from consultancy assignments aimed at strengthening
BTMC's management systems in the areas of finance and production.
6.12       Sectoral Issues.  Technical assistance also is necessary in
addressing sectoral issues. Under Credit 1205-BD, provision has been made
for an Industrial Economist who would assist in coordinating policy analysis
and strategic studies pertaining to the textile sector. In addition,
specific expertise is to be provided for the proposed studies of the handloom
sector and of consumer demand (paragraph 3.04). Finally, the activities of
the Savar Training Institute will continue, and the project will make provi-
sion for expatriate assistance requirec to fulfill projected traininig
requirements. Draft terms of reference for each technical assistance com-
ponent are available in the ?roject File. Terms of reference, qualifications



-45-
and terms and conditions for each consultancy will need to be satisfactory to
IDA. Consultant selection procedures will follow IDA Guidelines.
De  Konitoring and Evaluation
6.13       The individual BMR plans for each imill would provide the basis for
monitoring and evaluation of the rehabilitation component of the project.
Implementation progress would be monitored by the individual mills and by
BSB/BSRS on the basis of the implementation schedule that would be prepared
as part of the BMR plan for each mill. BTMC and BSB/BSRS in turn would
provide quarterly progress reports to IDA which would be summary statements
of progress on the individual projects. Overall progress would be reviewed
by regular supervision missions on at Jeast a six-monthly basis. The basis
for project evaluation would lie in the operational performance reports which
public sector and private sector mills alike prepare on a monthly basis.
Projected and actual efficiency, output, and. quality improvements due to BMR
would be provided in these reports. Progress in the preparation of sector
studies would be monitored by supervision missions, and the regular dialogue
with the Government on sectoral issues would be maintained.
VII.  COST-BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
A. Benefits
7.01      The direct benefits of m4ll rehabilitation include increased output
due to greater utilization of operating spindles and looms, as well as
improved quality with improved operating condition of machinery.
7.02       The impact of expected BMR investments on the output and produc-
tivity of the textile sector as a whole are indicated below:

B. Cost-Benefit Analysis
7.03    Local market requirements (paragraph 2.22) provide more than enough
opportunity for the increased output of yarn and cloth resulting from the
proposed BM4R investments. The proposed project includes potential invest-
ments in about seven public and 15 private mills for BMR.
7.04       In analyzing investment opportunities, four indicators are used
(Annex 7.1): internal financial rate of return; internal economic rate of
return; profit before tax and interest as a percentage of total assets
employed, in the first year in which the full impact of BMR is to be felt;
and debt-service coverage ratio in the year in which the repayment burden is
highest.
7.05    Of fifteeen mills analyzed under the First Credit, three (Adarsha,
Mohini, and Dhakeswari) were found to have insufficient profit before inter-
est and taxes as a percentage of total assets, even after BMR.  GOB de' ided
to wind up these units. Apart from these three, all indicators of project
viability were attractive, with average internal financial rate of return
of BMR plans estimated at 16%, and the internal economic rate of return
estimated at 27%. Indicators of earnings and debt service coverage also were
adequate.
7.06       The substitute mills proposed by BTMC after denationalization
(paragraph 3.03) showed similar results. Overall, indicators of viability
are attractive, with only one exception, Monnoo Textile Mills. Among the six
BTMC mills to be included, for whicai BMR plans have been prepared, the
aggregate internal financial rate of return is 29%. The economic rate of



-47-
return averaged 24%, with returns from individual BI4R investments ranging
from 11% to 51%. While there are individual BMR plans and mills which cannot
be considered viable, the results indicate that BMR is an attractive option
in increasing productivity and output, since incremental investment results
in more than proportional expansion of output, unleashing existing capacity
which is relatively idle due to imbalances in equipment. There are
individual cases of old mills, poorly located facilities, or operations with
poor capital structures. Such mills, for example Adarsaia, Mohini, and
Dhakeswari (paragraph 7.05), will not be financed.
7.07       The assumptions used in carrying out these analyses are detailed
in the Project File. These assumptions contain refinements and revisions of
those used in the mill-by-mill analysis conducted under the first textile
project (Report No. 3568-BD, Annex 7.1). The more important of these assump-
tions are that: (a) all extra output can be sold (paragraph 7.03); (b) input
price increases will be passed on to the consumer in the form of output price
increases without affecting sales; (c) allowances for lost capacity due to
power failures, repair and maintenance, absenteeism, machinery breakdown have
been made; (d) post-BMR spin and weave plans are considered technically
feasible, and have been validated by IDA's technical consultant, Geerdes
International; (e) project cost estimates arc considered realistic and have
been reviewed by IDA's consultant 'paragraph 5.03); and (f) the costs and
expected benefits of technical assistance efforts have not been taken into
account.
7.08        In the economic analysis, the usual adjustments for duties and
taxes have been made. Output prices have been scaled down by a factor of
0.75 to represent the mission's best estimate of a weighted average of border
prices for imports of comparable products. A factor of 0.89 has been applied
to cotton raw material costs to adjust for duty on raw cotton. Labor has
been shadow-priced at 75% of wage costs. 1/ Duties and taxes on imported
machinery account for 17.3% of cost, and these have been removed in the
economic analysis. Conversior. costs have been converted using a factor of
0.66, based on a weighted average of the inputs making up these costs.
7.09       As an illustration of the financial and economic analysis, and
of the nature of the impact of BMR on projected performance, the results for
Olympia Textile Mills (IFRR=29%; IERR=17%) are shown in Annexes 7.2-7.5.
Annex 7.2 provides the picture with the project, Annex 7.3 that without the
project, and Annex 7.4 shows the incremental effect of the project in terms
of cash flows and rates of return. Projected financial ratios are shown in
Annex 7.5.
7.10        For the 21 mills now in the private sector, technical BMR plans
have been completed for all mills. The financial and economic aspects of
these plans are being appraised by BSB/BSRS in their role as intermediaries.
I/ Estimates of the shadow prices of labor have ranged from .875 (A.R.
Khan, The Economy of Bangladesh) to .3 (Boston University Study).



-48-
These appraisals will all be subject to IDA review and approval. Acceptance
criteria for the private sector Bt4R plans will be similar to those applied to
the public sector mills. Both incremental financial and incremental economic
rates of return will need to exceed 15%. Debt-service coverage will need to
be greater than 1.2, and earnings power (profit before interest and taxes as
a percentage of total assets) should at least exceed prevailing interest
rates on term deposits. In addition, debt-equity ratios would not exceed
70:30 after the BKR invcstment,l/ to ensure adequate stake and commitment on
the part of the owners. It is anticipated that some capital restructuring of
the private sector mills prior to BMR would be required (paragraph 4.19)
before some of the mills would be considered creditworthy.
C. Domestic Resource Cost Analysis
7.11       Domestic resource costs have been analyzed for two mills, Olympia
and RR. The estimated DRC ratio for spinning and weaving activities in FY83,
and projected for FY87 with BMR, are shown in Table 7.2. Assuming a shadow
exchange rate of Tk 30 per dollar, 2/ the DRC coefficients before BMR and
projected for FY87 with BMR are less than one, suggesting no lack of compara-
tive advantage, and potential competitive advantage in both spinning and
weaving activity. These results suggest no reason to doubt the conclusions
of the Boston University Study (June, 1980). This study, which contained
comparisons of DRC coefficients for 69 subsectors, concluded that Bangladesh
had both short-term and long-term comparative advantage in cotton textiles.
The shadow exchange rate for Bangladesh used in that study was Tk 36 per
dollar, at a time when the official exchange rate for Bangladesh was Tk 15
per dollar.

D. Sensitivity Analysis
7.12        Sensitivity analysis has been carried out on the BMR proposals of
the BTMC mills to be taken up under the proposed Credit. The results are
summarized below:
Table 7.2: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
(Aggregate Results for Six BTMC Mills /a)
IRR      ERR

/a   Eagle Star, Monnoo, Olympia, Pahartali, quaderia, and RR.
7.13       As under the First Credit, the incremental financial and economic
rates of return are most sensitive to cost-price relations. The IRR drops
from a base-case of 29% to 14% if a sales prices decrease of 10% is coupled
with a raw material price increase of 10%. A sales price decrease of 15%
coupled with a raw material price increase of 15% leads to a drop in IRR to
4%, and in the ERR to zero (or possibly negative). The results are not too
sensitive to other adverse changes. The project is therefore sensitive most
to the assumption that output price increases in line with raw material price
increases can be passed on to the consumer.
E. Project Risks
7.14       Technical risks are considered manageable.  In the case of the
private sector mills, plan preparation and procurement are being reinforced
by the use of the advisers. Difficulties could arise in the erection and
installation of equipment, due to the potential need to use outside fitters
and mechanics as in the public sector mills (paragraph 6.06). However, this
could lead at worst to delay, not to improper installation, since the equip-
ment suppliers would send technicians who would direct local fitters and
mechanics. Provi"ion also has been made for consultants to advise the mill



-50-
owners at the trial run stage, before equipment is accepted as meeting agreed
performance criteria. For the public sector mills, the Project Implementa-
tion Cell would continue to oversee technical implementation, with backup
assistance from the advisers. This arrangement should prove adequate.
7.15       In the case of private mill investments, there is a risk that the
owners will not be able to produce the equity financing required to meet the
requirements that sponsors contribute 30% to BMR subproject costs, and that a
70:30 debt-equity ratio be maintained for the mill operation overall. 1/
However, owners indicate strong interest and ability to meet equity financing
requirements. BSB/BSRS would take all reasonable steps to satisfy themselves
and IDA of the financial standing of the individual project sponsors, prior
to project approval. Also, overall project costs have been calculated on a
conservative basis, recognizing that a few of the expected BMR investmants
may not materialize.
7.16       To compensate for managerial weaknesses, and related performance
risks, the project provides for consultancy services to be provided to
individual private mills, and to public mills through BTM4C. The lack of
adequately trained manpower, in the numbers required, is perhaps the greatest
single weakness of the Bangladesh textile industry. Therefore efforts under-
way to upgrade skills will be maintained and accelerated.
7.17       There is always a risk that GOB will reverse its commitment to
taking successive actions to improve public enterprise efficiency and intro-
duce free market pricing. However, actions taken to date -- privatizing 21
public sector mills, introducing commercial profitability and efficiency
criteria in the remaining public mills, and adoption of free market pricing
-- would indicate that GOB recognizes that the best way to ensure good
quality cloth at reasonable prices is to take actions to improve efficiency
and increase reliance on market forces.
VIII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
8.01      During negotiations, GOB agreed that it would:
(a) maintain its policy oL free-market pricing for both the public
and private textile mills as agreed under Credit 1205-BD
(paragraphs 2.33, 4.30);
(b) adopt prudent limits on expansion of new spinning capacity given
uncertainty in the demand picture (paragraph 2.29);
1/ 20% of project cost and 80:20 debt-equity ratio in less-developed
areas.



-51-
(c) adopt appropriate measures to address the capital restructuring
needs of the denationalized mills (paragraph 4.20);
(d) employ a consultant by December 31, 1984 to carry out a consumer
demand and market study of the textile sector according to terms
of reference aceptable to IDA (paragraph 3.04);
(e) employ a consultant by December 31, 1984 to analyze the optimum
role, problems and specific assistance needs of the handloom
sector, with recommendations for specific programs to assist in
the efficient development of the sector (paragraph 3.04);
(f) employ an industrial economist as agreed under Cr. 1205-BD to
assist the Planning Cell of the then Ministry of Textiles, since
merged with the Ministry of Industries, to assist in the monitor-
ing, coordination, and execution of Government activities bear-
ing on the formulation of textile sector policy and strategy
(paragraph 6.07);
(g) adopt, by December 31, 1984, an appropriate health, safety, and
environmental standard for textile mills, based on the survey
reports of the Environmental Pollution Control Department (EPCD)
and the Factories Inspectorate (paragraph 3.06);
(h) seek the assistance of UNDP to provide funding for the technical
assistance requirements of the private sector mills in in-plant
productivity and managerial counselling (paragraph 6.10);
(i) enter into Administrative Agreements with BSB/BSRS for the pur-
pose of lending to the private mills which are to be
beneficiaries of the project (paragraph 6.02).
(j) maintain or cause to be maintained an adequately staffed Training
Institute at Savar to carry out a program of training responsive
to the needs of the industry as previously identified (paragraph
4.28); and
(k) make adequate provision at reasonable rates of reinbursement for
trainees nominated by privately owned textile mills.
8.02       Under Cr. 1205-BD ongoing, BTMC has already agreed to:
(a) employ consultants to carry out studies according to agreed terms
of reference in the areas of organization, management succession
and manpower planning; marketing management; financial management
systems; production planning and control (paragraph 4.27);
(b) maintain a properly staffed Project Implementation Cell;
(paragraph 6.06);



-52-
(c) ensure that BTMC mills' accounts are audited within six months of
the fiscal year end, and audit reports are forwarded to IDA
within that time.
8.03       Of the agreements to be sought above, the following would be
required as conditions of effectiveness:
(a) seeking of UNDP or other funding for a program of in-plant
productivity and managerial counselling for the private sector
mills (paragraph 8.01);
(b) employment of an industrial economist for the Planning Cell of

NOTES:
/a  With BMR, quality of the product vill be upgraded which reflected in import of
equivalent quality of product in FY87.
/b  Take into account the converoin from FOB to CIF, the depreciation of Taka from
FY81 - FY83 and the increase in raw material cost from F81 - PY83.
L/c Take into account the very minimal 1% increase in raw material cost from FY83 - FY87.
Id  In weaving sector, the contribution of BMR vill be on quantity increase rather than
quality improvement.  Therefore we assume the  same category of imported product in
Ff87 .
je  The price expected by the mill owners after 3MR. The increase in price due partly
to the increase in raw material price and partly to the quality improvement.
/f import content of raw materials:
- TaW cotton in spinning sector                  1002
raw cotton in weaving sector (approx)          45%
La  Import content of Parts and Components            752
Lh  FX content of Pover & Fuel                        252
