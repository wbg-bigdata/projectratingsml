1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

Senegal is located on the west coast of Africa, and is a member of the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The country's economy has been stable since the difficult 1994
CFA franc devaluation. The population is estimated at 10 million and the economy is heavily
dominated by a few strategic sectors including groundnuts, fisheries and services. The role of
agricultural sector has declined over time, from almost 15 percent of GDP in 1960 to 7 percent in
2004. The informal sector accounts for about 60 percent of GDP. The average per capita income
is about US$710 and is ranked 153 out of 177 countries in the 2007 UN Human Development
Index. The rural economy frequently suffers from drought, and lacks access to basic services and
infrastructure, leading to low productivity, high emigration and higher poverty rates in the rural
areas. As a result, it is estimated that almost half of the population lives in cities and the ratio is
projected to increase to 60 percent by 20151. In addition, Government was able to reduce poverty
in households by 15 percentage points between 1994 and 2002 and a further decline was reported
in 2005/6. Despite these achievements, the Senegalese Government still faces a lot of challenges.
These include maintaining the economic growth above 5 percent per annum and lowering its
fiscal deficit to less than 2 percent of GDP while at the same time grappling with the global crisis.

Senegal's political environment has been relatively stable during the PSAC implementation
period. Long hailed as a symbol of democracy in Africa, Senegal is going through some changes
in its political landscape. Recent local elections were an illustration of Senegal's respect for
democratic principles, and were widely viewed as fair and transparent. However, President
Wade's coalition lost control of the city council in capital Dakar and other key cities in the
country. The elections took place against a backdrop of social tensions and of last years' higher
fuel and food prices ­ which led to localized demonstrations in peri-urban areas on more than one
occasion in 2008. In this environment, it could prove rather difficult for the authorities to
implement reform on which a broad consensus is not reached2.

Economic performance weakened again in 2008. Real GDP growth is estimated at 2.5 percent for
2008 while inflation remained elevated, at 6 percent. Construction and commercial activity
slowed sharply in the second half of 2008, with combined effect of substantial payment delays by
the Government to domestic suppliers, and the negative impact of surging oil and food prices on
the demand for domestic output. However, looking at the medium term forecast for 2010 -2015,
the country is expected to improve its macroeconomic outlook as the global economic condition
changes.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) for Senegal was prepared at a time when the
country's political environment was conducive to undertake reforms to establish critical
foundations for a private sector led growth. Senegal had a sustained macroeconomic stabilization
from 1994 to 2003 while achieving a steady 5 percent GDP growth per annum. This good
performance was progressively being reflected through improvements in achieving sustainable
development and poverty reduction targets embodied in the Millennium Development Goal.
Earlier reforms that started in the mid-1980's were mostly reversed or undermined by early

1990's, as vested interests fought to retain their privileged status across a range of areas. It was
therefore, the intention of the Government to re-channel the energies of these often competent
and energetic elites from rent seeking and defense of the status quo, to private sector job-creation
and wealth generation.

In the late 1990s, the Government decided to prepare a Private Sector Development (PSD) strategy.
To this end, with the support of the World Bank and other donors, a consultation process was
launched. In mid-1999, a draft strategy was presented to and endorsed by all stakeholders. In
parallel, detailed diagnostic work was undertaken with technical collaboration of the World Bank.
The resulting output included three studies of the investment climate (in collaboration with FIAS)
as well as studies and diagnostics of infrastructure reform (Country Framework Report (CFR)),
pensions, trade policy (Integrated Framework for Trade Policies (IFTP), tourism, the financial
sector (Financial Sector assessment Paper (FSAP)), the postal sector and macroeconomic and
poverty issues (Country Economic Memorandum). Following extensive public consultations which
were driven largely by the studies, the Government used the opportunity and elaborated its detailed
reform program in support of its private sector led development strategy. The strategy's overall
objective was to help achieve and sustain steady private sector-based GDP growth of about 8
percent per annum, to result into an increased formal sector employment which had been stagnant at
200,000 jobs.

The implementation of the strategy was based on three themes: (i) improving the investment
climate, notably through legal and judiciary capacity building, business environment
enhancement, administrative barriers and tax reform, trade facilitation, infrastructure regulation,
and a strong private­public consultative process; (ii) facilitating private participation and
enhancing competitiveness, broadening private participation in economic activities, and
increasing the productivity of the local private sector; and (iii) stimulating sector investment, both
domestic and foreign, and implementing policy reforms in areas of pensions, the information
technology sector, postal services, tourism and culture, and the edible oil sector.

In this regard, The Private Investment Promotion Project (PIPP) was designed to support the
implementation of the strategy and its financing capacity building and investments while PSAC
was designed for the implementation of key actions required upfront, regarded as difficult policy
reforms requiring a significant amount of financial restructuring that would result in large
one-time charges to the Government budget. PSAC focused its support on implementation of
sector reforms in the tax regime, edible oil, postal services and pension. The selection of the four
sector reform areas/components was based on the broader agenda set forth in CAS and spelled
out in the FIAS report, CFR report, the IFTP, FSAP and ESW for pensions. The choice of policy
components to support was evidently determined on a residual basis and consisted of those
elements not already covered through other on-going or proposed work and projects. The other
common feature of these components was that they imposed a one-time fiscal cost and thus
merited Bank's support through an adjustment program. Therefore, the credit was intended to
provide budgetary resources through generation of counterpart funds from balance of payment
support to ensure no disruption of ongoing social and poverty alleviation programs. It had four
tranches, three of which were floating tranches, in order to allow Government flexibility to
accelerate the reform program in the selected areas while providing the possibility to disburse the
Credit more quickly, if needed.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the credit is to support the Government of Senegal in the implementation of
subsector reforms aimed at improving the investment climate and accelerating private sector
growth and employment. The private sector adjustment program thus supports the Government's
Poverty Reduction Strategy, through improving the investment climate and implementing key
sector reforms by: (i) supporting the implementation of a private enterprise tax regime that
stimulates investments through a level playing field and lower taxes, and allocates user fees for
the private sector promotion purposes for which they are levied; (ii) restructuring the edible oil
sector by improving the competitive environment in which it operates, through the elimination or
reduction of policy distortions associated with non-tariff barriers and other domestic protection
mechanisms, and of public interventions; (iii) reforming postal services by introducing greater
competition in the sector, restructuring the postal enterprise so as to enhance its sustainability and
to create an autonomous financial subsidiary that would provide savings, and payment and
transfer services; (iv) bringing changes to the pension system to make it financially sustainable
and to improve its corporate governance.

The last two reforms entail substantial financial restructuring, involving clearance of arrears that
would need to be financed by the public budget. In the same vein, the proposed tax reforms,
while revenue neutral or enhancing in the medium-term may entail short-term revenue shortfalls.
The proposed credit aims to provide budget resources through counterpart funds generated by
balance of payment support it provides, and help ensure that social and poverty alleviation
programs are not disrupted.

Key indicators: (i) Tax reform: (a) Marginal Effective Tax Rate (METR) reduced to 28 percent,
tax exemptions eliminated from the investment and /or other codes; special arrangements may
still prevail for export activities. By end of 2005 revenue base from taxes expanding and revenues
increasing. (b) Contribution forfaitaire a la charge de Employeur (CFCE ) reduced to 3 percent.
Matching-grant fund become financially sustainable.

(ii) Edible Oil sector Reforms: (a) SONACOS (groundnut processing public enterprise) is sold a
private operator, and (b) Distortions reduced (more detailed indicators will be developed once the
action plan is ready) and (c) Government liabilities in the sector are settled.

(iii Postal Services reforms: (a) Provisions of law implemented, including lower the monopoly
threshold to 500 grams and all operators licensed, (b) Agence de Regulation des Telecoms (ART)
regulates sector, (c) performance contract indicators, including: (i) number of "postal outlets"

Reasons/Justification

implementation.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

     The PSAC supported the Government of Senegal in four components for each major policy
     areas: (i) taxation; (ii) edible oil sector; (iii) postal services; and (iv) pension system. Each of
     the policy area/component is briefly described below. As in all other adjustment (development
     policy) credits, the PSAC required the Government of Senegal to maintain a satisfactory
     macroeconomic performance and implementation of the private sector strategy. In addition, the
     Government was required to demonstrate that progress was being achieved in actions outlined
     in PSAC's letters of sector policy for Edible Oil, Postal Services and Pension3. PSAC was
     intended to alleviate the fiscal impact of these reforms.

     (i) Tax Reform: while supporting the implementation of the tax reform program of Senegal,
     the PSAC focused on reducing the METR to levels low enough to stimulate private investments
     and encourage formal activities without using specific tax exemption. In addition, the CFCE, a
     key user fee levied on the private enterprises, was to be redirected towards its intended use.

     (ii) Edible oil Sector Reform: the PSAC focused on the elimination of the most serious trade
     policy and domestic distortions and supported the Government in implementation of its Edible
     Oils Sector Policy Letter dated May 23, 2003. This meant reduction and/or elimination of a
     surtax imposed on imported edible oils to among other things, protect domestic manufacturers
     of the same goods.

     (iii) Postal Services Reform: the PSAC supported (i) reforms aimed at increasing competition
     in postal services, strengthening corporate governance, and restructuring the postal corporation
     to improve its sustainability and quality of services; and (ii) implementation of the required
     financial restructuring of the postal corporation. Specifically, PSAC's objective was to support
     the improvement of the postal legal and regulatory framework, financial restructuring of La
     Poste, the implementation of the corporate strategy which was to be monitored through a
     performance contract, and the creation of the subsidiary for financial services.

     (iv) Pension Reform: the PSAC was intended to support an ongoing and multi-phase reform
     process that would completely restructure the pension system of Senegal. Specifically, the
     PSAC was to support the shift to automatic indexation of key parameters of the pension scheme
     and an increase of the retirement age to 60 as immediate measures applied to the IPRES
     scheme. These measures were to be followed by the resolution of outstanding arrears in a way
     that restores pension rights to a significant group of workers and clarifies their status with
     IPRES. Moreover, the PSAC was to support the creation of a commission to supervise the

  Each policy reform area had a Letter of sector Policy which was guiding overall reforms. (i) Lettre de Politique

Security Sociale.

       activities of the sector, in particular when a new policy to encourage private pension schemes
       was put in place.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

The policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes

The PSAC closing date was extended three times. The first extension was from the original
closing date of December 31, 2005 to February 28, 2007 to enable Government to meet all the
conditions for the postal services and pension tranches. The second closing date extension from
February 28, 2007 to November 30, 2007 was granted to enable Government to meet the
remaining conditions for the last tranche on pension reforms which was the largest representing
more than 44 percent of the credit proceeds. However, there was a need for a third extension from
November 30, 2007 to January 31, 2009, to further enable the Government to secure adequate
dialogue and consensus on critical issues for the establishment of a suitable corporate structure
for IPRES as agreed in the Development Credit Agreement. All three extensions were requested
by Government and were granted to facilitate completion of the partially met conditions in
taxation and postal services (involving transfer of funds from the budget); provide opportunity to
address possible policy reversal on edible oil and achieve the key unmet condition on pension
reforms which required adoption of a new investment policy for IPRES. By January 31, 2009, the
Credit was allowed to close and the fourth tranche of US$20 million was not disbursed4.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The PSAC had four tranches. The first tranche of US$8.5 million was fixed as it was set to
initiate the implementation of reforms in the tax regime, edible oils, postal services and pension
system which took Government additional seven months to complete. The other three were
floating tranches, designed to support specific reforms in each of the above mentioned areas. The
first floating tranche of US$7 million equivalent was to support tax reform and was met three
months before scheduled date demonstrating readiness of reforms in the sector. The second
floating tranche of US$9 million equivalent was to support postal services reforms but was
released after a nine months delay which arose due to changed leadership in the sector. The third
floating tranche, to support the pension reform representing 44.4 percent of the credit of US$20
million equivalent was not released as Government failed to meet all the respective conditions.

The PSAC's fifteen conditions were grouped into four tranches and each group of conditions was
treated as a package for which all conditions had to be achieved prior to release of the tranche.
Only nine of the PSAC conditions were fully met but with difficulties resulting into the need for
several extensions of credit closing date while another five conditions were partially met.

The five conditions that were regarded as having been partially met are as follows: (i)
Government was required to harmonize the treatment of the CFCE (vocational training tax)
levied on national and foreign workers to 3 percent (was done) and then to redirect 1 percent of
the generated revenue from the budget to the matching grant fund for its sustainability.

    The USD 20 million was reallocated to two food crisis-related projects for Senegal.




                                                            5
Government included a budget line for the CFCE funds in its 2005 budget but failed to make the
annual transfers to the fund. In this regard, the condition is partially met. (ii) the second partially
met condition required Government to eliminate the import surcharge on all imported edible oils
irrespective of origin. This condition was met at effectiveness. Conversely, during
implementation, the condition was reversed when Government reintroduced the import surcharge
on all edible oils. With Bank intervention, the import surcharge was formally removed but there
is a high probability for its reversal. (iii) The third partially met condition required Government,
as part of the performance contract, to recapitalize La Poste by using the postal reform tranche in
order to ensure its sustainability. Government failed to transfer the funds and the condition is
partially met. (iv) The fourth partially met condition required Government to establish a social
security commission among other things to have "adequate numbers of suitably qualified staff'.
The Commission de Supervision et de Regulation des Institutions de Securite Sociale (COSRISS)
was established but has only one professional staff and the Board of Directors, making the
condition partially met. (v) The fifth partially met condition required Government to implement
the newly adopted policy for private pension schemes. Government did not create required
regulations to enable establishment of private pension schemes in Senegal (see table below).

Since the conditions for each tranche were treated as a package, they all had to be achieved before
tranche release; one out of five conditions under the third floating tranche was not met. As a
result, the pension reform tranche was not released. The credit closing date was extended twice to
accommodate the activities towards achieving pension reform conditions but without success.
The unmet condition "Adoption by the IPRES Board of Directors of a new IPRES investment
policy" was very important to the pension reform as it involved introducing good governance,
professional management of IPRES's reserves and transparency towards realization of its
investment policy. Its implementation would have enabled IPRES to make robust investments
that would have led to a financially viable and sustainable institution. Instead, IPRES
commissioned a study to develop a new investment policy which was completed and approved by
the Board of IPRES but was not utilized to develop and adopt a new investment policy. As a
result, IPRES continues to make its investment decisions in a non systematic and transparent
manner. Hence, there is high risk of unsustainability of IPRES and the rest of the pension
reforms

                               restitution of affected workers rights to pension.


          2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

          Tough Economic Developments: Economic performance weakened in 2006 and it continued to
          2008 where the real GDP was reduced to 2.5 percent and with an inflation rate of 6 percent. The
          economic activities in the country slowed down including construction and commercial activities.
          This resulted into a narrow revenue base for Government leading into financial and budgetary
          difficulties. In addition, export performance was weak generating a negative impact on the
          balance of payment in the midst of a surging oil and food prices. Senegal is one of the sub-
          Saharan African countries seriously affected by food prices as it imports a large part of its staple
          food (rice), leading to several mass demonstrations against increases of food prices in Dakar.

          Factors within government control that contributed to the delays in meeting the benchmarks

          Lack of Transfer of Funds to Intended Institutions: The Government failed to transfer funds
          released from the credit to recapitalize La Poste as agreed under the performance contract of La
          Poste. Therefore, the reforms undertaken under the postal services sector might be affected if La
          Poste is not able to sustain current performance due to its inability to make new investments.
          Moreover, Government was supposed to transfer 1 percent of CFCE tax to the matching grant
          fund to support vocational training of the private sector employees. This annual transfer has never
          been implemented, resulting into unrealized benefits on the fund. The main attribute to failure of
          these transfers was due to the financial and budgetary difficulties Government encountered since
          2006.

          Loss of Reform Champions: At the beginning of the reform program, committed champions
          were identified for each subsector. However, immediately after effectiveness, the champions were
          removed and left Government. The loss of champions resulted into delays in implementation of
          the reforms, in particular, pension and postal services sectors.

          Inadequate Follow up from Government: The Bank had been proactive in trying to encourage
          the Government to accelerate action on outstanding conditions to ensure full disbursement of the
          credit. However, there was lack of follow up within Government and most of Bank requests went
          unanswered. For example, the Bank made numerous requests for documentation on IPRES's new
          investment policy and transfer of funds to La Poste and matching grant fund but went unanswered.

          2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

          M&E design - the PSAC contained specific actions to be undertaken for each of the four reform
          areas as stated out under Schedule 2 of the Development Credit Agreement and is attached as
          Annex 2. These were very specific and appropriate to enable judgment of outcome. The design of
          the floating tranches provided a clear conditionality for each tranche release. The extensive
          analytical work to base the operation coupled with strong ownership by government coupled with
          champions for each reform area, provided a conducive environment for monitoring progress of



                                                            9
the supported reforms. In addition, the indicators in the Policy Matrix were considered by QAG
to be highly likely and practical for an adjustment credit.

M&E implementation: Supervision missions paid attention to the Policy Matrix/Result
Framework and used it to monitor expected outcome and results and was updated after every
mission. The Result framework was not modified and the performance indicators were used to
monitor progress. Some indicators were later considered as too detailed, e.g. they required a lot of
time to collect information and data to assess progress, for example in relation to the postal
service's reforms. Since the credit was supervised alongside PIPP, any technical support for data
collections was provided under the project.

M&E utilization: The Supervision team used the M&E framework continuously as the basis for
discussions with Government and provided advise on policy actions as needed. Moreover, even
after a tranche is released, the team continued to monitor the status of reforms in those areas and
was thus able to capture attempts to reverse the edible oil policy.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

None.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

As an integral part of the 2003/5 CAS and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP), the
PSAC was relevant as its objectives were to support the Government of Senegal in the
implementation of key subsector reforms aimed to improve and promote investment climate and
accelerate private sector growth and employment which is part of pillar one of the strategy.

The credit was scrutinized under the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) - at Entry in 2005 and was
rated satisfactory. The panel rated the overall quality at entry of PSAC as satisfactory although
the Region suggested a highly satisfactory rating as some aspects of the credit were exemplary, in
particular, the dimension of strategic relevance and approach which provided clarity and focus of
the development objectives, level of country and sector knowledge and ownership and
participation of the Senegalese government.

The overall design of the PSAC supported its development objectives. The selection of the four
sector reform areas/components was based from the broader agenda set forth in CAS and spelled
out in the analytical work completed at the time. The choice of policy components to support was
evidently determined on a residual basis and consisted of those elements not already covered
through other on-going or proposed work and projects. The other common feature of these
components was that they imposed a one-time fiscal cost and thus merited Bank's support
through an adjustment program. The credit was design to provide budgetary resources through
generation of counterpart funds from balance of payment support to ensure no disruption of
ongoing social and poverty alleviation programs. The four tranches were designed with simplicity
in order to allow Government flexibility to accelerate the reform program in the selected areas
while providing possibility to disburse the Credit more quickly, if needed.

The risks were properly identified during the design of the credit. The assessment of risks during
preparation was adequately done and the identified risks were provided with mitigation measures



                                                10
which were considered manageable as they suggested a combination of upfront actions and
consensus building during implementation. The linkage with PIPP also mitigated the risk arising
from lack of capacity. The PIPP provided mechanism for institutional strengthening in order to
achieve efficient and transparent operation for the reformed pension system and postal services.
The design enabled PSAC to focus on policy dialogue and their actions while technical support
was provided through PIPP. Implementation arrangements were also considered to be adequate as
the four components were distinctively different; a focused coordinator in the Ministry of Finance
was put in charge of monitoring progress within the implementing agencies to ensure that all
benchmarks were met with their intended results.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The PSAC's two major objectives were to: (i) promote investment climate, and (ii) accelerate
private sector growth and employment ­ the outcomes of which both are rated unsatisfactory.

The expected benefits from PSAC were to:

        Eliminate tax induced distortions, stimulate investments and implement a leveled
        playing field for businesses. The action required was to rationalize the tax system and
        reduce certain taxes, while at the same time, eliminating distortions. This was achieved
        by lowering the METR tax from 45 percent to 25 percent beyond PSAC goal. The tax
        system was simplified by reducing the number of taxes, rationalization of investment
        code waivers with regards to consumption tax and import duties. Coupled with other
        reforms, Senegal's investment climate has become competitive and is reflected in the
        World Bank's 2009 Doing Business as one of the top 10 world reformers and the best in
        Africa moving from 168 in 2008 to 147 in 2009. The level of private investment shows
        an upward trend since 2005 averaging at 19 percent of GDP per annum although the
        target was 22 percent of GDP. The expected benefits have been largely achieved.

        Rationalize user fees and ensure they are allocated for the purposes intended: This
        action was part of the PSD strategy. The action required Government to reduce the CFCE
        to 3 percent and reallocate at least 1 percent of the revenues towards private sector
        capacity building through matching-grant fund. The CFCE was reduced to 3 percent but
        the reallocation of 1 percent of the tax revenues to the matching-grant fund was not
        achieved due to Government budgetary difficulties since 2006. In this regard, the level of
        support envisaged towards a sustainable capacity building mechanism for the private
        sector employees was not achieved.

        Government exits the groundnut sector as an operator. Government liberalized the
        sector and privatized the groundnut processing public enterprise ­ SONACOS in
        December 2005. The expected outcome of the privatization has yet to be seen visible
        since there are no changes in the sector in terms of increased efficiency and volumes of
        production. The privatization was intended to support reforms in the sector including
        removing monopoly in the edible oil sector. The continued presence of Government and
        vested interest groups in the sector undermines the intended benefits. Therefore the
        benefits expected from this reform have not been achieved.

        Implement edible oil sector policy reform: Government was required to eliminate/reduce
        trade, domestic and financial sector distortions. Distortions were reduced by passing the
        law eliminating the taxes which provided protection to domestic edible oil (groundnut)



                                               11
   producer. Law No.2004-34 was passed and it eliminated import surcharge levied to
   imported process and unprocessed edible oils. Government also settled its arrears
   amounting to CFAF 12 billion with the sector. However, there had been some
   inconsistency with edible oils reforms as Government reverted to its earlier protectionist
   stance. In 2006, it reversed the removal of the import surcharge on imported edible oils.
   Due to Bank's and UEMOA's intervention the surcharge was removed again in 2007 but
   as recent as December 2008, Government made attempts to reinstate the surcharge. Since
   30 percent of Senegalese population derives their livelihood from the groundnut sector,
   the reinstating of distortive taxes undermined their activities and deprived them of
   income. Therefore, the benefits expected from this reform have not been achieved.

   Improve the legal and regulatory environment for the postal services. Two laws were
   passed in 2006 modifying the postal sector law and the telecommunication sector law. As
   a result, the new postal law transferred the regulatory function to Agence de Regulation
   des Telecoms (ART) which changed its name to Agence de Regulation des Telecoms et
   des Poste (ARTP) and at the same time removed the monopoly on letter segment up to
   500 gm. ARTP is effectively regulating the sector.

   Clarify and formalize relationship between La Poste and Government: The 2005-7
   performance based agreement was signed between Government and La Poste. The
   performance contract indicators, included: (i) number of "postal outlets" doubled, (ii)
   internet access in 100 post offices, and, (iii) a 50 percent increase in productivity in terms
   of letters/employee. These indicators have not been fully met. There are only 165 postal
   outlets and postal offices up from 140 in 2004 although the target was 280. Only three
   post offices had internet access in 2004 and 2009 all 165 have access to internet with 5
   postal offices modernized and directly linked to the headquarters in Dakar. Productivity
   did not increase by 50 percent but remained the same at $11,600 per employee.
   Nevertheless, the performance contract resulted into an effective governance structure
   which allowed La Poste to focus more on postal services. Operational and financial
   performance of La Poste slightly improved but continues struggling to introduce an arm's
   length and clearer relationship with the Government. The expansion of La Poste services
   was expected to benefit the rural areas by increasing access to postal and financial
   services. Additional 200 staff was employed and accessibility has increased.

   Improve financial and institutional viability of postal services: La Poste created a
   subsidiary - PosteFinance in 2006 to deal with its finance mandate which includes
   dealing with savings accounts, payment transactions and transfers. The subsidiary was
   expected to show by 2005: (i) turnover is 20 percent higher, (ii) with a 50 percent
   increased in the number of accounts and savings collected, (iii) number of accounts and
   savings collected increased by 50 percent. Regular audits are undertaken and are
   unqualified. By end of the program, PosteFinance with 17 agents and 5 service outlet
   showed a turnover 20 percent higher than before; recorded net profits of FCFA 70 billion
   for 2006/7, FCFA 88 billion for 2007 and FCFA 90 billion for 2008; the number of
   accounts and savings collected have increased by 50 percent to 25,000 for current
   accounts, 150,000 for savings accounts of which 90,000 are active. PosteFinance is
   audited annually by external auditors and has received unqualified reports for 2006/2007.
   The expected benefits have been achieved.

   Enhance corporate governance: Action required establishment of a new commission -
   COSRISS to supervise and monitor the sector. This was done by passing the law in 2005



                                            12
        and COSRISS became operational in 2005. It is however still understaffed and plays a
        limited role in the sector. IPRES was expected to adopt a new investment policy. The
        Government was not able to make IPRES adopt and implement a new investment policy
        which would have led to a financially secured and sustainable institution. Therefore, none
        of the expected benefits have been achieved from these reforms.

        Rationalize schemes: The merger of the two pension schemes ­ IPRES and Fond
        National de Retraite (FNR) did not take place due to lack of consensus within
        Government on the method to constitute the merger. These institutions are now under the
        supervision of the under-staffed pension commission ­ COSRISS. The lack of
        rationalization of the schemes failed to provide similar benefits to their clients, but
        encouraged disparity between the two schemes. The expected benefits from these reforms
        were not achieved.

        Allow for private provision of pension funds. The reforms in the pension system were
        implemented through liberalization and putting in place provisions to allow private
        pensions to operate. The necessary decrees to allow the actual establishment of such
        institutions were not provided. As a result, none has been created. It was expected that the
        sector would benefit by creating more players providing choice and reliable pension
        benefits to the retirees. This was not achieved.

        Complete financial restructuring of IPRES: Plan to resolve arrears between
        Government and IPRES were finalized and the liabilities were settled. It enabled IPRES
        to make its statutory obligations to its clients the retiree. The expected benefit from this
        reform action was achieved.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The PSAC's overall rating is unsatisfactory which reflects the ratings on the individual
components and their subcomponents, difficulties on meeting the conditions on timely basis,
reluctance in completing the partially met and unmet conditions, lack of sustainability for most of
the reforms and as well as the likelihood of reversing some of the reforms. The performance of
the four components was mixed. The taxation component was rated moderately satisfactory;
postal service component is rated moderately unsatisfactory with the remaining two components
edible oil and pensions rated unsatisfactory. The rating reflects the level of achievement of the
outcome and its impact. The details are provided below.

Tax Reform. This component is rated moderately satisfactory.             The support towards
implementation of the tax reform program of Senegal under the PSAC was a continuation of the tax
reform process which commenced under a prior Trade Reform and Competitiveness Credit (Cr.
3419). It assisted in the implementation of reforms covering VAT, tariffs and business taxation.
Therefore, the PSAC extended the reforms to simplify and reduce a number of taxes, rationalization
of investment code waivers with regards to consumption tax and import duties. This tax reform
agenda was widely supported by Government and the private sector.

(a) Eliminate tax induced distortions, stimulate investments and implement level playing field for
businesses: The main support was focused on reducing the private enterprise tax METR to low
levels to stimulate private investment and encourage formal activities by creating a level playing



                                                13
field for the sector without using specific tax exemptions. This measure was undertaken and the
METR was reduced from its original 45 percent to 25 percent, beyond the agreed 28 percent. It was
expected that there would be a slight short-term shortfall in revenues due to change of the tax rate.
However, the revenue base has increased from 18.3 percent in 2004 to 21 percent of GDP in 2007
and 19.4 percent in 2008. This subcomponent produced satisfactory outcome.

(b) Rationalize user fees and ensure they are allocated for the purposes intended: government was
required to introduce harmonization of the CFCE rate to 3 percent and (c) utilize at least 1percent
of the revenues collected to finance the matching grant fund for its sustainability and continuous
benefit to the private sector employees. The CFCE was lowered to 3 percent but the 1 percent of the
revenues was not transferred to the matching grant fund. The Government made an attempt to make
the transfer during its 2005 budget but did not disburse and failed to disburse on annual basis. The
matching grant fund continues to receive support from PIPP while its sustainability is at risk. In this
regard, the condition is regarded as partially unmet. The outcome from this subcomponent is
moderately unsatisfactory.

Edible Oil Sector Reform: This component is rated unsatisfactory. About 30 percent of the
population of Senegal depends directly or indirectly for their livelihood on the groundnut sector.
The Government embarked on groundnut sector liberalization in the 1990s and more recently in
2001 when the seeds distribution subsidiary of the monopolistic groundnut processing public
enterprise (SONACOS) was privatized. PSAC supported the Government in implementation of its
groundnut subsector, Edible Oil Sector Policy Letter dated May 23, 2003. The PSAC focused on
three key reforms of the sector: (i) the elimination of the most serious trade policy and domestic
distortions which were seen as key to effective development and diversification of the groundnut
sector; (ii) privatization of SONACOS and the (iii) elimination of Government accumulated
liabilities estimated at CFAF 10 billion from the sector. Therefore, required actions from
Government were:

(a) Government exits the sector as an operator: In order to further improve the business
environment of the groundnut sector and complete its liberalization agenda, Government
undertook to exit its operations from the groundnut sector through privatization of SONACOS.
SONACOS was privatized in April 20056. Privatization ensured Government exit from the sector
and opening up competition through elimination of the import surcharge on imported edible oils.
However, Government and vested interest groups continue to interfere in the sector which
undermines the reforms. Therefore, this subcomponent is considered as moderately unsatisfactory.

 (b) Implement sector reforms: by elimination of distortions by removing the exercise tax (TCI ­
Taxe Conjoncturelle d'Importation) on edible oil and to harmonize the import surcharge on
processed and unprocessed edible oils (Taxe Specifique). The Government suspended the
application of the TCI through an administrative action at the level of Director General of Custom
in order to meet the effectiveness condition. Thereafter, in December 2004 the law No 2004-34 was
passed replacing Article 360 of General Import Code with a revision that eliminates the import
surcharge on processed and unprocessed edible oils. This law was scheduled to be effective on
December 31, 2005, the original closing date of PSAC. Due to an upsurge of palm oil imports in
2004 and 2005, the Government, additionally sought further protection to the domestic edible oil
industry and passed, on December 16, 2005, a new protective law that extended protection against



6
    Government had previously made two attempts to privatized SONACOS and failed.




                                                       14
all imported edible oils, regardless of origins. This law, however, did not comply with WAEMU
and WTO provisions regarding safeguards measures and constituted from the Bank's view, a
potential reversal of policy commitments made under the PSAC. In addition, Cote d'Ivoire filed a
complaint to UEMOA against Senegal's imposition of the import surcharge on its products.
UEMOA decided in favor of Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal was asked to refrain from using the import
surcharge. Following extensive consultations between the Government and the Bank, Government
passed a corrective legislation on July 31, 2006 providing for transitory protection which conforms
with WTO and UEMOA rules.

However, the Bank was recently informed, that, Government has intentions to reverse the policy
again. A new bill to reinstate the import surcharge was prepared and approved by parliament in
December 2008. Due to Bank's interventions, the approval by the Senate and signing of the bill into
law was suspended but not annulled giving very strong indications that there could be a policy
reversal on the import surcharge in the near future. Moreover, it seems that the import surcharge
was still being enforced as the cost of imported edible oils is higher in Senegal than its neighboring
countries e.g. the Gambia. There is cause for concern on this subcomponent as policy reversal
happened and there is potential for another policy reversal which will negate the edible oil sector
reforms. Therefore, the outcome under this subcomponent is considered to be highly unsatisfactory.

Postal Services Reform: the component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The postal sector reform
in the PSAC is based on the Government's Letter of Postal Sector Policy of April 17, 2003, which
included actions to: (i) improve overall performance through a progressive sector liberalization and
increase private sector participation; (ii) modernize the legal and regulatory framework and
strengthen sector regulator; (iii) safeguard the right to basic communication for all citizens through
a funding mechanism to support cost of universal postal services obligations; (iv) transform
historical postal operator into a modern and performing corporation through the definition and
implementation of a new corporate strategy; and (v) promote the sustainable development of postal
financing services in order to improve access of the population to basic financial services, and
channel these savings towards private investment funds.

In this regard, the PSAC supported (i) reforms aimed at increasing competition in postal services,
strengthening corporate governance, and restructuring the postal corporation so as to improve its
sustainability and quality of services; and (ii) implementation of the required financial restructuring
of the postal corporation. Specifically, PSAC was to provide support towards the improvement of
the (a) postal legal and regulatory framework, (b) financial restructuring of La Poste, (c) the
implementation of the corporate strategy which was to be monitored through a performance
contract, and (d) creation of the subsidiary for financial services. Implementation of postal sector
reforms started at a satisfactory progress and then slowed considerably at the end of 2004, for about
eight months, mainly due to change of managing director and lack of sustained support from
Government. Implementation progress picked up in 2005 but at a slower pace.

(a) Postal legal and regulatory framework: In January 2006, two laws (No.2006-01 on postal sector
and N. 2006-02 modifying the 2001 telecommunication sector law) were passed. The laws opened
up the sector to competition on letter segment up to 500 gm. Therefore, with the new legal
framework, ART was transformed into ARTP. ARTP received technical assistance from PIPP to
strengthen the new regulator in postal universal service obligation and funding mechanism,
licensing and liberalization process. As a result, ARTP is effectively regulating the sector where all
competitors to La Poste are licensed. The outcome of this subcomponent is considered to be
satisfactory.




                                                  15
(b) Financial restructuring of La Poste: The cancellation of cross debt/arrears amounting to CFAF
12 billion between the Government and la Poste was completed. As part of the effectiveness
conditions, Government had presented to IDA a recapitalization plan for La Poste. It was expected
that the Second tranche of US$9 million would be transferred to La Poste as part of its
recapitalization. The transfer was not done. In this regard, La Poste, though it has slightly improved
its financial performance, runs a risk of remaining undercapitalized and could encounter operational
difficulties in the future. This subcomponent is rated unsatisfactory.

(d) Financial restructuring of la Poste: Government was required to implement a new corporate
strategy to be monitored under the performance-based agreement. The 2005-2007 performance-
based agreement was signed in November 16, 2005 between the Government and la Poste. The
agreement provided a platform for an improved performance-based monitoring of la Poste
providing crucial information on its cost structure and financial performance. For the first time in 10
years, in 2005, La Poste recorded a surplus of FCFA 241 million while in 2006 the surplus was
FCFA 283 million. Today, there are 165 outlets and post offices up from 140 with internet access of
which 5 have been modernized and are electronically connected to the headquarters. Over the 2003-
2007 period, La Poste's staff increased by 16 percent (about 200 new employees) bringing the
number up to 2062 while mail volume decreased by 14 percent, and the number of savings accounts
increased by 23 percent. Between 2003 and 2006, revenues increased by 5 percent. Therefore mail
productivity (mail volume/staff) decreased by 26 percent whereas savings products productivity
increased by 6 percent and average revenue per staff remained at the same level at about
$11,600/head. Overall productivity gains from La Poste remained limited over the past 5 years as it
lacks control over its large number of staff which is highly unionized. However, Burkina Faso and
Morocco have managed to defy the international trends of declining mail volumes recording a 37
percent and 27 percent increases respectively over the same period (2003-2007) while La Poste
had a 14 percent decrease.

(d) Creation of the subsidiary for financial services: Therefore, action required from Government
was creation of the subsidiary for financial services. A new subsidiary- PosteFinance for the
financial services was created and it has shown significant improvements in its financial and
operational performances. For example, its turnover was 20 percent higher than before; recorded net
profits of FCFA 70 billion for 2006/7, FCFA 88 billion for 2007 and FCFA 90 billion for 2008; the
number of accounts and savings collected have increased by 50 percent to 25,000 for current
accounts, 150,000 for savings accounts of which 90,000 are active. PosteFinance is audited
annually by external auditors and has received unqualified reports for 2006/2007. This
subcomponent is rated satisfactory.

Pension Reform: This component is rated unsatisfactory. The government of Senegal saw the
need to reform its formal pension system since in the late 1990s. In this regard, in 2002, the
Government took measures to curtail the deficit in the civil service pension scheme (FNR)
through changes in the formula, contribution rates and retirement age. These changes were made
through consultations with stakeholders. As a result, the motivation of the reforms went beyond
fiscal policy in the public sector and drew attention to the inadequacies in the managing of the
private sector workers pension scheme (IPRES). Workers were concerned on the stagnated and
low rate of return on their contributions with IPRES. This had reduced credibility of the pension
scheme IPRES. To respond to the proposed changes in the pension system, the Government
developed a pension reform strategy which was described in the sector policy statement dated
June 6, 2003.

The PSAC was designed to support the conclusions and recommendations of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) in the implementation of an ongoing multi-phased pension reform


                                                  16
process stated in the sector policy statement that would completely restructure the pension system
of Senegal. The pension reform tranche had five conditions of equal weight indicating the
importance of the reforms in achieving development objectives. The reforms demanded changes
in the way IPRES was managed, in particular, with regards to its reserve's investment practices.
Specifically, the PSAC was to support improvement in: (a) the management of IPRES to: (i) shift
to automatic indexation of key parameters of the pension scheme and (ii) an increase of the
retirement age to 60 as immediate measures applied to the IPRES scheme. (b) Resolution of
outstanding arrears in a way that it restores pension rights to a significant group of workers and
clarifies their status under IPRES. (c) The creation of a commission to supervise the activities of
the sector, in particular when (d) a new policy to encourage private pension schemes is put in
place. And, (e) the rationalization of pension schemes. The performance of the subcomponents
was as follows:

(a) Management of IPRES: IPRES shifted to an automatic indexation of key parameters of the
pension scheme and increased the retirement age to 60. This subcomponent is rated satisfactory

(b) Resolution of outstanding arrears to restore pension rights to a group of workers:
Government paid CFAF 8 billion to IPRES in arrears and IPRES was able to restore pension
rights to a significant group of workers. This subcomponent is rated satisfactory

( c) The creation of a commission to supervise the activities of the sector: As part of improvement
in management of pension schemes, PSAC supported Government in the establishment of a social
security commission (COSRISS) to oversee pensions system. Its key mandate was to supervise
FNR, IPRES and any other new private pension scheme. However, its role and sustainability
remains questionable as the critical structural changes (merger of FNR and IPRES) did not take
place. COSRISS is currently responsible for supervising the two pension schemes and providing
advisory services to Government. It does not have adequate number of staff to provide adequate
oversight for investment of IPRES's reserves.

The second action required by Government under this subcomponent was to ensure that IPRES
adopts a New Investment policy. The condition was unmet as it required IPRES to adopt a new
investment policy satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank received a copy of the study on how to
develop a new investment policy for IPRES which was approved by its Board of Directors. The
Bank learnt that no action was taken by IPRES to develop and adopt a new policy using the
recommendations of the study. The inability to adopt the new investment policy put IPRES in a
more precarious financial vulnerability and political interference. IPRES continues to make its
investment decisions in a non transparent manner. This subcomponent is rated unsatisfactory.

(d) Allow for Private provision for private pension schemes: a law to allow private pension
schemes was put in place in 2007. There was no follow up by Government to ensure that the
necessary decrees and regulations are prepared and put in place to encourage participation of the
private investors in the sector. Although the sector has been liberalized to allow private pension
funds to operate, none has been created. Therefore, the outcome from the subcomponent is rated
unsatisfactory.

(e) Rationalization of pension schemes: a report to explore options on how to merge the two
schemes ­ FNR and IPRES was commissioned and completed. The recommendations from the
report were against the merger and the other options were not agreeable to Government. The
implementation of the merger was a key step towards structural reforms in the sector. This
subcomponent is rated unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

PSAC had direct impact on poverty, gender inequities and imbalances and social development.
The failure of reforms under edible oil affected the population negatively as the domestic prices
of edible oil remained high. From a recent simulations on poverty assessment for Senegal, it was
estimated that a 25 percent decrease in vegetable oil price would have brought 144 000
individuals above the poverty line, representing a decrease in poverty headcount of 1.2 percent.
Therefore, with edible oil policy reversal meant that the Program was not able to bring about a
permanent decrease in edible oil prices or remove protection of domestic edible oil and thus
limiting its social impact to the society. At the same time the privatization of SONACOS did not
yield the expected outcome and the groundnut sector remain highly dependent on the protected
private monopoly putting the livelihood of at least 30 percent of the population in a constrained
environment. There were employment loss due to the privatization of SONACOS but there are no
records for increased employment creation in the sector.

The establishment of PosteFinance and its ability to expand to the rural areas benefited its women
clients due to the increased accessibility and availability of services. This is reflected in the
increased number of outlets and accounts of PosteFinance.

Senegal's political environment was relatively stable during the PSAC implementation period
although it is undergoing some changes in its political terrain. The economic performance was
weakened due to the impact of fuel and food price crisis and the recent global economic recession.
Since PSAC provided budget resources through counterpart funds generated by balance of
payment support, the modality ensured that social and poverty alleviation programs were not
disrupted. In this regard, the released tranches from PSAC, though not directly, did somewhat
contribute to the welfare of Senegalese population at large.

Private Investment had increased from 16.3 percent of GDP in 2004 to 20.2 percent of GDP in
2008. With a competitive investment climate in Senegal, foreign direct investment is expected to
increase sharply as Government has signed a number of contracts with important international
companies in various sectors including mining, port infrastructure, and special economic zone,
Dakar­Diamniado Toll highway PPP project and tourism. These contracts have contributed to
creating the much needed employment in the country.

The PSAC was not expected to result into any negative impact on the environment, and for the
purposes of OP 4.01, it was ranked as a U, which meant it did not required an environmental
assessment.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development impact of the credit was moderately satisfactory. PSAC
contributed to the establishment of two institutions ­ COSRISS and PosteFinance. Additionally,
it helped start the restructuring of three other institutions ­ ARTP, La Poste and IPRES. Some
capacity was built which enabled the institutions to increase their competence in preparing laws
that advanced changes in the legal and regulatory framework of the postal services sector
including ARTP and to some extent the supervision of technical work on pension system. The
Ministry of Finance was able to harmonize taxes for the private sector by reducing METR to
improve investment climate and business environment. This led to improvement in Senegal's

ranking in World Bank Doing Business from 168 to 147 and recognized as one of the top ten
reformers in 2009.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

Not applicable

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Neither a survey nor a stakeholder workshop was held.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The QAG reported that the risks under PSAC were well handled and contentious actions were put
upfront as conditions of effectiveness; e.g. removal of distortions in edible oil stemming from
trade policy. However, the risks of deterioration of macroeconomic and difficult governance
environment were overlooked due to the fact that there was a consecutive five year stable
performance of the macroeconomic environment and strong government ownership and
commitment during credit preparation stage.

An Ambitious reform program: The first identified high risk was that the reform program
supported under PSAC was ambitious and could encounter resistance from vested interests due to
political reasons. This risk was mitigated through consensus building before project
implementation and the confirmation of the support of champions who played leading roles in the
key areas. Consultations were held with key stakeholders for familiarization with the reforms.
Most reforms were implemented during the first two years of the credit. The completion of
conditions for the last tranche on pension reforms was delayed for three years because of
consensus building and consultations activities with key stakeholder without success resulting
into failure to disburse the tranche and because turnover resulted in the replacement of key
champions.

Policy reversal after tranche release: During implementation there was always the risk of
policy reversal on the elimination of import surcharge on edible oils. Due to pressure from vested
interest parties in the sector a new law to reinstate the surcharge was passed. After Bank and
UEMOA intervention, it was repealed. As recently as December 2008 another bill to reinstate the
same import surcharge was prepared, submitted and was approved by the lower house of
parliament. It was not presented to the Senate due to Bank policy dialogue. However the potential
for the import surcharge law to be submitted to the Senate is very high.

Insufficient institutional capacity: The third identified risk was the insufficient institutional
capacity to implement the reforms due to imperfect analytical capabilities or absence of
consensus among stakeholders. In this regard a parallel project PIPP was developed and approved
at the same time to provide implementation support to the institutions conducting the reforms.

Failed privatization for SONACOS was sighted as one possible risk during PSAC design. The
public enterprise was successfully privatized. Privatization of SONACOS was ensuring that




                                               19
Government exits the sector. However, the successor company7 is not operating efficiently and
depends heavily on government subsidies to operate.

Performance of La Poste: The financial restructuring through cancellation of cross debt/arrears
between the government and La Poste was completed. However, it was also expected that the
Second tranche of US$9 million would be transferred to La Poste as part of the recapitalization
plan by its shareholder. This was not done. In this regard, La Poste, though it has slightly
improved its financial performance, is undercapitalized and runs the risk of having future
operational difficulties.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall quality at entry is rated satisfactory. In 2005, the Quality Assessment Group (QAG)
rated PSAC`s quality at entry as satisfactory although the Region felt that it should have been
rated highly satisfactory due to the dimension of strategic relevance and approach, in particular,
the clarity and focus of the development objectives, the level of country and sector knowledge
that existed in the task team. There was also a reasonable amount of government ownership
through the reform champions. The Bank team designed the credit with flexibility and firmness
where it mattered, and developed clear conditionalities.

In addition, the selection of reform components (taxation, edible oils, postal services and pension)
was driven by sound analytical base for the credit drawing on the elements of the CAS,
recommendations spelled out in the Financial Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) report, the
Country Framework Report, the Integrated Framework for Trade Policies, the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) and a pension Economic Sector Work (ESW). The components
were seen as needing a one-time fiscal cost and thus merited Bank support through an adjustment
program and thus better supported under an adjustment credit.

The assessment of risks during preparation was adequately done. It was considered that the risks
were manageable and the mitigation provided would be adequate to resolve any emerging
problems. The mitigation measures included a combination of upfront actions and consensus
building during implementation. As a result, when the edible oil policy reversal occurred, Bank
was able to use dialogue at different levels to convince Government to remove the reversal of
import surcharge on imported edible oil.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The overall quality at supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank undertook regular
missions and reports were prepared to inform management of progress on the ground. At the
same time, the team worked closely with the implementing agencies to achieve program's
conditions. Technical and policy support was provided to the authorities in timely manner. Three
tranches were released within a period of two years indicating satisfactory levels of engagement
with the government. PSAC and PIPP were complementary projects and thus held joint missions.

The pension reforms warranted a lot of discussions as the reforms were introducing a completely
new system in a francophone country. The merging of the two pension schemes ­ FNR and
IPRES was not agreeable to various stakeholders and a study to examine the possibilities and
modalities for the merger was carried out. Government position towards carrying out a merger of
the two pension schemes changed during implementation and therefore the study concluded that
it was not possible to have a merger of the two institutions resulting into an overall mediocre
performance of the pension reforms.

The Bank team was optimistic and had high levels of confidence in Government. Therefore,
taxation and postal tranches were released before Government actually transferred the agreed
funds to the intended third parties (taxation - matching grant scheme and postal services' La
Poste). The Bank held numerous difficult discussions on these transfers but without success
mainly due to the fact that Government encountered budgetary difficulties from 2006.

The three project closing date extensions showed the Bank's belief that the pension tranche
conditions could be met and thus extended several opportunities for it to be achieved. The
Country Management Unit and the Country Team provided support to the team in different ways
by interacting with Government Officials at different levels. However, Government officials did
not make adequate effort to meet the remaining condition.

Despite the lack of implementation progress, the Bank team continued to rate credit
implementation progress and the development objective performance as satisfactory with the
hope that all pending issues would be resolved. This disconnect was corrected with proactive
PSAC supervision by relocation of the Bank's Task Team Leader (TTL) to Senegal. The
proximity of the TTL enabled the Bank to supervise the program on continuous basis and at the
same time provided a realistic rating of the DO as unsatisfactory, in particular, on completion of
the partially met and unmet conditions. Despite all these efforts to engage in policy dialogue and
provide Government with additional time to complete the program, the fourth tranche of US$20
million was undisbursed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall rating for Bank performance is moderately satisfactory. Although the quality at entry
is rated satisfactory at supervision, Bank performance was affected by certain decisions which
should have been differently relying on the overall risk-return balance instead of good will. This
includes the numerous closing date extensions and the disconnected DO and IP ratings.




                                               21
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The Government performance is rated unsatisfactory. The rating is showing that, although, most
of the conditions were met, there was lack of action towards the partially and unmet conditions.
Despite three extensions of credit closing dates, Government was no able to complete the agreed
actions or provide the requested documentations to ensure that the remaining conditions were met
as scheduled. This demonstrated a change of policy stance in Government between credit
preparation and implementation.

Implementation was marked by interference from political concerns and continuous resistance
from vested parties. It resulted among other things, in delays in completing the reforms in the
pension system, almost two policy reversals on import surcharge on edible oil and the inability
transfer funds to La Poste and matching grant fund. Even with the extensions of closing date,
Government did not make progress on the remaining unmet conditions of pension reform. The
constant changing of leadership for the pension reforms exacerbated the situation contributing to
an unsatisfactory performance. The officials in the Ministry of Finance did not change; however,
those at the Ministry of Labor and Communication were changed almost annually which led to
lack of continuity and commitment to pension reforms. There were strong signs that vested
interest were able to preempt certain aspects of the reforms, e.g. edible oil and adoption of new
investment policy for IPRES.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The division of responsibilities within the Government was appropriate, however, performance of
the three agencies was mixed. The Ministry of Finance was responsible for overall program
coordination, ensuring a stable macroeconomic framework and at the same time responsible for
the Taxation and Edible Oil reforms. The Ministry of Labor was responsible for the Pension
reforms while the Ministry of Communication was responsible for the Postal service's reforms. In
two years most of the conditions were fully met or partially met, except for those under pension
reform. Despite three extensions of the credit closing date, no efforts were made by these
institutions to meet the remaining unmet conditions. Moreover, PIPP Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), responsible for technical assistance for the PSAC, was poorly managed resulting in a
suspension of disbursements for the PIPP project8. The PIU was restructured and senior staff
were replaced. The PIPP PIU's management problems did affect the timely availability of
resources to PSAC activities In this regard; the general performance of the agencies is rated
unsatisfactory.


8
  The PIU of the PIPP provided the technical assistance required to carry out the reform agreed upon under the PSAC.
The PIU's performance has been unsatisfactory, including as it relates to fiduciary functions. The Bank had to suspend
the project in July 2008 for unsatisfactory project management as evidenced by the following: (i) six violations of the
Development Credit Agreement; (ii) mis-procurement and (iii) numerous ineligible expenditures. In light of the PIU's
continuous unsatisfactory performance, the conditions for lifting the suspension - which were met in December 2008 -
included the adoption of new project implementation arrangements, including the closing of the former Project Unit
and the appointment of a new Steering Committee satisfactory to the Association.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

In view of the unsatisfactory rating for the government and the implementing agencies, the
overall borrower's performance is rated unsatisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

If the Bank is pursuing an ambitious reform program it becomes imperative to look into the
political economy aspects and all other aspects it entails. The Bank should also sharpen and
strengthen its political economy skills and assessment in response to complex programs with
tough reforms. Therefore, preparation of the country owned strategies or statements should not be
misread as readiness for politically difficult reforms. Consensus by key stakeholders across the
political arena is essential and not only by technocrats and a few decision makers. Therefore,
continuous local ownership by both political representatives and other stakeholders is key during
implementation. In this regard, the Bank should be prepared to spend more time in building local
ownership and coalition for specific reforms through broader dialogue and improve its ability to
react faster when signs of reluctance appear. The Bank should move fast and develop a toolkit or
guidelines on "stakeholder analysis" how to identify and analyze vested groups as some are not as
obvious as others due to cultural divergence within a country.

There is a need to manage vested interest up front and continuously during implementation.
With a strong presence in a country, the Bank will be able to effectively monitor implementation
progress of the reforms at the same time monitor and counteract on vested interest groups to
prevent "capture" and reversal of policy reforms.

Strong government ownership and champions are crucial to deep reforms: Such deep
reforms needed the continuous presence and support of champions to accomplish the actions
within a short period. Once the champions were removed the pace of implementation was slowed.

Reforms in subsectors if perceived as social services or public good take a long time to
implement. The social sector reforms normally take longer to implement as they need a lot of
consultation and consensus building. The reforms in the pension sector were completely new to a
francophone country. The reforms intended to revolutionize the existing systems by introducing
new structures and good governance. It thus took a long time to try to get acceptance in particular
from the affected population including the workers and the labor unions which are very strong in
Senegal.

Sequencing of actions to achieve a condition: It is important to build adequate incentives to
ensure completion of actions to complete reforms. Therefore, sequencing of activities within a
sector and a tranche is critical for achieving and sustaining reforms, and disbursements should be
released only upon full completion of a tranche condition or explicit waivers for only partly met
commitments.

The Bank needs to know when to cut its losses: The balancing act between making tough
decisions and being flexible to encourage tough reforms is difficult. Therefore, the Bank needs to
learn to take tough decisions on a difficult reform by taking remedies like cancellation or refusal
to extend closing dates and let the project close to minimize losses and negative exposure.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Government and the implementing agencies did not comment on the ratings but explained
why the reforms were not completed. The first reason was that, economic circumstances changed
and Government encountered fiscal difficulties since 2006 so that it was not able to make
transfers to recapitalize La Poste or contribute to the matching grant fund. The second reason
was the fact that edible oil sector, postal services and pension sector reform have always been
difficult sectors to reform in Senegal. The Borrower's report is attached in Annex 3.

I. Introduction.

The loan agreement for the Private Sector Adjustment Credit Project concluded by the Republic
of Senegal and the International Development Association of the World Bank Group in the
amount of SDR 30.2 million entered into force in June 2004. The purpose of the loan was to
support the implementation of reforms in the groundnut sector, the postal services sector, and in
the tax and retirement pension systems.

2. Submission of the Private Sector Adjustment Credit Project


As indicated in the private sector development policy statement sent by the Borrower to the IDA,
the Project is part of a global strategy aimed at (i) improvement of the business climate; (ii)
promotion of an efficient regulatory framework for the participation of private enterprise in the
financing and development of infrastructure services; (iii) implementation of appropriate
strategies in the main sectors of productive activity or sectors that support production; (iv)
establishment of a viable private sector support mechanism; (v) promotion of fuller integration
into the subregional and global economies; and (vi) communication and dialogue between the
public sector and the private sector.

Between 2000 and 2009, this strategy led, in particular, to the establishment of the National
Agency for the Promotion of Infrastructure Investment (APIX), now known as APIX SA, the
National Agency for the Development and Supervision of Small and Medium Enterprises
(ADEPME), and the Senegalese Export Promotion Agency (ASEPEX), as well as the definition
and launch of the Accelerated Growth Strategy, in the context of implementing the Poverty
Reduction Strategy.

The PSAC was also paired with a Private Investment Promotion Project (PIPP) with a view to
building private sector capacities and consolidating the gains of a previous IDA-supported
project.


II. Objectives of the project at the time of the assessment

Overall objective: The private sector adjustment project was identified in 2003/2004 as part of a
global approach to promoting the private sector and reducing poverty. Its aim was to contribute to
improvement of the investment climate by easing the tax burden on businesses. At the same time,
it was designed to contribute to expansion of the reach of private initiative by spinning off the
financial services of SN La Poste and introducing private pension funds in Senegal's social
security system. In this latter connection, the Project was also intended to help strengthen the
viability of both SN La Poste and the country's social security system and institutions.

Specific objectives of the Project: The Project was designed to provide budgetary support to
mitigate the effect of revenue losses, which were apparently due to the implementation of reforms
in the groundnut sector, the tax system, postal services, and the retirement pension system.
Implementation of the Project included, in particular: (i) easing the tax burden on businesses and
reallocating the proceeds of the employer's flat rate contribution (CFCE) to promotion of the
private sector, (ii) eliminating or reducing competitive distortions in the groundnut sector, (iii)
stimulating competition in the postal sector and reestablishing relations between the Government
and SN La Poste, and (iv) strengthening the equity and financial viability of the retirement
pension system in Senegal.

III.    Description of the components

The Project includes four components:


"Tax system reform" component: the Project emphasized reduction of the marginal effective
tax rate (TEMI) by reconciling the promotion of private investment and revenue targets,
rationalization of the system of investment incentives, and the use of CFCE proceeds.


Identification of the measures included in the "tax system reform" component was based on a
study of the tax burden on businesses requested by the Borrower and carried out by the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) of the World Bank. Examination of the recommendations of
this study was facilitated by the launch of the various commissions of the Presidential Investment
Council (CPI).


"Groundnut sector reform" component: the Project focuses on the elimination of competitive
distortions in the edible oils sector by abolishing the specific tax on vegetable oils and the
conjunctural tax on imports of such oils.


Owing to the different approaches to the privatization of SONACOS advocated by the Borrower
and the IDA, the scope of the "groundnut sector reform" component was substantially reduced.


"Postal services reform" component: the Project was aimed at (i) stimulating competition in the
postal sector and strengthening the corporate governance, viability and quality of services of SN
La Poste; and (ii) the financial restructuring of SN La Poste, together with improvement of the
relevant legal and regulatory framework as well as implementation of the enterprise's strategic
plan by means of a performance contract and the spinning off of financial services.


The "postal services reform" component was the subject of a sectoral policy statement sent to the
IDA.


 "Retirement pension system reform" component: The Project was aimed at rehabilitation of
the financial bases of the National Retirement Fund (FNR) and IPRES (private sector pension
scheme). For the FNR, this objective was attained primarily through the parametric reforms of
2002. For IPRES, the preferential parametric reforms were: (i) transition to the automatic
indexation of benefits to wage growth with a view to offsetting the erosion of real benefits
experienced in the past; (ii) permanent indexation of all other parameters to wage growth; (iii)
raising to 60 the regular progressive retirement age of men and women; (iv) settlement of the
contribution arrears owed to IPRES by liquidated public enterprises; (v) adoption of a new
reserves investment policy; (vi) setting up of a social security commission to design and
implement systemic reforms aimed, in particular, at reducing administrative expenses and
eliminating duplication of effort, as well as the introduction of private retirement pension funds.




                                                34
The "retirement pension system reform" component was the subject of a social security policy
statement sent to the IDA.

Mobilization of the budget support loan attached to implementation of the Project was organized
into four tranches:

        A fixed tranche of USD 9 million to be released upon the entry into force of the Project;

        A floating tranche of USD 7 million, the release of which was contingent upon
        satisfactory execution of the tax reforms;

        A floating tranche of USD 9 million, the release of which was contingent upon
        satisfactory execution of the postal reforms;

        A floating tranche of USD 20 million, the release of which was contingent upon
        satisfactory execution of the retirement pension system reforms and the project as a
        whole.

Consequently, the drawing conditions for the tranches were as follows:

Fixed tranche, prior to the entry into force of the credit agreement:

        the IDA must receive proof that the credit agreement has been duly authorized (copies of
        legal documents, corresponding budget law, attestation from the Minister of Finance that
        the ceiling has not been exceed, publication in the Journal Officiel, etc.); and
        Elimination of the TCI (conjunctural tax on imports) and the specific tax on edible oils.

Floating tranche: Tax reform

        the TEMI (marginal effective tax rate) applicable to the industrial sector has been brought
        to 28% or less;

        certain specific exceptional tax regimes have been eliminated, particularly the
        inconsistencies between the TEC (common external tariff) and the VAT, without this
        affecting the exceptional tax regimes applicable to certain exporters, the extractive
        industries sector and the tourism sector, as agreed with the IDA;

        the rate of the CFCE has been harmonized at 3%, and at least a third of the revenue derived
        from the said contribution has been used to fund a co-financing mechanism (matching
        grant) in favor of businesses and training.

Floating tranche: Postal services reform

        responsibility for the regulation of postal services has been effectively transferred from
        SN La Poste (SNP) to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (ART);
        the Borrower has concluded an agreement with SNP based on the results of providing
        postal services;
        a subsidiary of SNP has been created to take charge of the financial services previously
        provided by SNP.



                                                35
Floating tranche: Retirement Pension System Reform

        establishment of the social security commission;

        a report on integration of the existing retirement funds in the Borrower's retirement reform
        program has been prepared and put into effect, i.e., the study on integrating the FNR and
        IPRES systems has been concluded and the recommendations approved by mutual
        agreement of the parties have been implemented;

        a new policy introducing elements of private management in the retirement funds has
        been adopted and implemented, i.e., the study on the introduction of capitalization
        mechanisms has been concluded and the recommendations approved by mutual
        agreement of the parties have been implemented;

        the Board of Directors of IPRES has adopted a new policy for the investment of IPRES's
        reserves;

        The Borrower has repaid all arrears owed to IPRES, so that employees whose rights to
        retirement were affected now benefit from the complete restitution of their rights.



IV. Implementation of the Project and fulfillment of the tranche conditions


A. Conditions governing the entry into force of the Project and the fixed tranche

There were two negotiations concerning the Project. The first concluded on May 16, 2003 in Dakar
but had to be resumed in February 2004 to deal with the lack of consensus between the Borrower
and the IDA on the method of privatizing SONACOS, and to take the following actions:

     elimination of any reference to SONACOS and the edible oils tranche;

     reduction of the loan amount from SDR 39 million (USD 55 million) to SDR 30.2 million
      (USD 45 million);

     introduction of a new condition governing entry into force, related to reduction of the
       protection afforded the oil mill in the groundnut sector.

The project was submitted to the Executive Directors of the IDA on March 18, 2003 and declared
effective after the IDA received proof that the credit agreement had been duly authorized (copies
of legal documents, corresponding budget law, attestation from the Minister of Finance that the
ceiling had not been exceeded, publication in the Journal Officiel, etc.) and that the TCI and the
specific tax on edible oils had been abolished.




                                                36
B. Tax Reform

To bring the marginal effective tax rate to 28%, a series of measures was adopted within the
framework of Law 2004-12 of February 6, 2006:

    (i)      the rate of the corporate tax was lowered from 35% to 33% (Article 19 of Law 2004-
             12);

    (ii)     the investment tax credit was eliminated (Articles 171 et seq.);

    (iii)    the provision for the replacement of machinery and equipment (PROM) was
             eliminated (Article 1- repeal of Annex IV of Book 1 and Article 2 of Annex V of
             Book 1);

    (iv)     business license tax: the method of calculation was simplified and the equilibrium
             rate of the proportional duty was lowered from 24% to 19% (Article 245 of Law
             2004-12);

    (v)      property tax: the abatements were eliminated, the rates were lowered, and the
             temporary exemptions were standardized and reduced (Articles 226 and 218 of Law
             2004-12);

    (vi)     the minimum flat-rate tax was replaced with the composite tax for "small" enterprises
             (with turnover of less than CFAF 50 million for industrial and commercial
             enterprises and CFAF 25 million for service providers) and revised for "large"
             enterprises with the establishment of three brackets based on the amount of turnover
             (Article 24 and Articles 74 et seq. of Law 2004-12);

    (vii)    tax on securities (IRVM) income: extension of consideration of the 10% withholding
             as payment of the tax on securities income (dividends) and exemption of 60% of the
             gross dividends received by companies liable for corporate tax;

    (viii)   registration fees: the rates were reduced and their application simplified (Articles 490,
             492 and 495 of Law 2004-12);

    (ix)     investment tax subsidy: nonrenewal of the investment subsidy mechanism, which
             authorized depreciation based on the new value of assets following a legal
             revaluation of the balance sheet (instead of depreciation based on the historic value)
             if the enterprise committed to investing prior to December 31, 2000 a net amount
             equal to the special revaluation provision.

The composite tax and the action plan to bring the marginal effective tax rate (TEMI) applicable
to the industrial sector to 28% or less were established in Law 2004-12 setting out the new
general tax code.

The elimination of certain specific exceptional tax regimes, particularly the inconsistencies
between the TEC and the VAT, which was to have taken effect without affecting the exceptional
tax regimes applicable to certain exporters in the extractive industries and tourism sectors, was
accomplished as agreed with the IDA by the approval of Law 2004-06 of February 6, 2004
setting out the (new) Investment Code and Law 2003-36 of November 26, 2003 establishing the
(new) Mining Code.


                                                 37
The new investment code simplified exemptions from import duties and consumption tax in order
to bring them into line with the provisions governing the VAT and the WAEMU Common
External Tariff (CET). The new mining code eliminated discretionary exemptions from duties.
Law 2004-34 of December 14, 2004 amending the general tax code had also standardized the
taxation of edible fats.

Regarding corporate tax, the Government of Senegal lowered the rate from 35% to 25%, going
beyond the reduction commitment of 33% under the Project.

Concerning the CFCE, by letter No. 03268/MEF/CEPOD of April 27, 2005, the Borrower agreed
to make appropriations to the shared-costs fund mechanisms equivalent to one-third of the
proceeds of the CFCE, in two semiannual installments for the year under consideration. Formerly,
Law 2004-34 of December 14, 2004 amending the general tax code had fixed the CFCE rate at
3%.

Once the preconditions were deemed fulfilled to the IDA's satisfaction, the "tax reform" tranche
was released in the amount of SDR 4.7 million.


C. Reform of postal services

        1.      Transfer of responsibility for the regulation of postal services from SNP to ART

Law 2006-01 of January 4, 2006 setting out the postal code and Law 2006-02 of January 4, 2006
amending the law setting out the telecommunications code, promulgated in January 2006, defined
the regulatory and supervisory framework for postal services. Decree 2006-822 of September 14,
2006 amending Decree 2003-63 of February 17, 2003 establishing the rules governing the
organization and operation of ART, delegates the task of regulating the postal sector to the
Telecommunications and Postal Regulatory Authority (ARTP).

        2.      Conclusion of an agreement between the Borrower and SNP based on the results of
                providing postal services

The performance contract between La Poste and the Government of Senegal signed on November
16, 2005 commits La Poste to diversifying and qualitatively improving its range of mail, package,
and funds transfer services as well as the collection of deposits from customers, while at the same
time facilitating access throughout the national territory.

In return, the Government will support La Poste's efforts to provide quality services at prices that
are affordable for the most disadvantaged populations.

The performance contract assigns performance indicators to both parties, with targeted levels during
the contractual period.


        3.      Creation of an SNP subsidiary to take charge of the financial services that were
                previously the responsibility of SNP.

The corporation Poste Finances was created on February 20, 2006 and its articles of incorporation
were filed on March 17, 2006. The purpose of Poste Finances is to collect savings through postal


                                                38
checking accounts and the Caisse nationale d'Epargne (national savings bank), transfer funds,
and to provide the other services of financial institutions.

The composition of the initial capital of Poste Finances took into account the recommendations of
the report on the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) prepared by the IMF and the
World Bank for 2005. This report recommends that Poste Finances begin by strengthening its
current operations before seeking private sector participation or granting loans.

With the prior conditions satisfied, the postal reform floating tranche was released in the amount
of SDR 6 million.


D. Reform of the retirement pension system

Fulfillment of the conditions for disbursement of the "retirement pension system reforms" tranche:

1.       Establishment of a consultative social security commission.

The condition was fully satisfied with the creation, by Decree No. 2003-1000 of December 2003,
of the Social Security Institutions Supervisory and Regulatory Commission (COSRISS),
established in May 2005. The objectives of COSRISS are to:

-    help define social security policy rules based on the results of in-depth studies, following a
     dialogue between labor and management;
-    help monitor implementation of the reform measures agreed in the area of social security and
     related fields: social welfare and health insurance, in particular;
-    help supervise and regulate the decisions or deliberations of the executive authorities of social
     security institutions;
-    prepare and monitor the schedule of independent audits to be carried out in social security
     institutions on a regular and coordinated basis;
-    monitor the reserves investment policy of social security institutions.

The supervision mission that visited Dakar from April 8 to 17, 2007 considered this condition
fully satisfied, based on the following criteria: "(i) the mandate is deemed acceptable by the
Association; (ii) the members in question have the necessary qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Association; and (iii) the staff, in sufficient number, has a satisfactory level of
qualification."

2. The Borrower has repaid all arrears owed to IPRES, so that employees whose retirement
   rights were affected now benefit from the complete restitution of their rights.

The arrears owed to IPRES and the Social Security Fund by liquidated public enterprises have
been effectively cleared. More than CFAF 8 billion was paid to IPRES and the Social Security
Fund. The supervision mission of April 2007 deemed this condition fully satisfied.

3. A new policy introducing elements of private management in the retirement funds has
   been adopted and implemented.


                                                 39
The law amending Article 13 of Law 75-50 of April 3, 1975 on social security institutions and
authorizing the establishment of privately managed, fully funded retirement systems was
approved on November 28, 2007.

The supervision mission of April 2007 had commented on the wording of the draft law and had
given assurance that receipt by the IDA of confirmation of the adoption of the new policy, which
included the opening up of retirement funds to the private sector, meant that the condition was fully
satisfied.

4. The Board of Directors of IPRES has adopted a new policy for the investment of IPRES's
   reserves

In its meeting of December 11, 2007, the Board of Directors of IPRES adopted the policy for the
investment of IPRES's reserves recommended by COSRISS. Following discussion, the measure
received 19 votes in favor and 3 abstentions from the 22 members of the IPRES Board of
Directors, which proposed the creation of a reserves investment committee to implement this
policy.

Notification of the Board's decisions was made to the supervisory Ministry by letter
No. 2008/0015/PCA/MRS/sc of April 30, 2008.

The supervision mission of April 2007 had given assurance that receipt by the IDA of a
"document attesting to the adoption of the new investment policy" meant that the condition was
fully satisfied.

5. A report on integration of the existing retirement funds in the Borrower's retirement reform
   program has been prepared and put into effect

The study on integration of the FNR and IPRES systems was completed but did not recommend an
immediate merger of the two systems. Harmonizing the IPRES system was recommended instead.
In this connection, it should be noted, first, that the supervision mission of June 2006 had
recommended a study of the impact of maintaining the two retirement systems on the main
objectives of the ongoing reforms, namely, equity and long-term financial viability. In making this
recommendation in response to the findings of the study on merging the two systems, the mission
seems to view such a merger as the solution to achieving equity and long-term financial viability.
This is not borne out by international experience. The June 2006 mission also seems to overlook the
fact that identification of the project necessitated the preparation of an IDA report published in June
2002, entitled: "Building a secure, sustainable and modern retirement-income system."

The measures necessary to make each system as well as the overall system viable were thus
identified before the project was designed, based on a combination of parametric reforms and
systemic reforms.

The systemic reforms mentioned in the report are limited to the following topics:

-   extension of the coverage of the retirement pension system;
-   establishment of private pension funds;
-   determination of a minimum retirement age to take better account of the role of redistribution in
    favor of seniors;
-   appropriate organization of a multi-pillar system;


                                                  40
-   the importance of quality supervision of social institutions.

Nevertheless, a supplementary study was conducted to examine the impact of maintaining the two
retirement systems on the objectives of equity and long-term financial viability. However, the
assessment of the impact on the equity and viability of the two systems of expanding the scope of
the changeover to include employees in the so-called emerging categories could not be completed
before the closing date of the project. It should also be noted in this regard that implementation of
the project ran into the same difficulties encountered in 2007 and 2008 in implementing the Private
Investment Promotion Project.

Moreover, the release of the "retirement pension system reforms" tranche was also subject to
overall success in executing the project. However, two measures were assessed differently by the
Borrower and the IDA:

        Reduction of the protection afforded the refining of unprocessed groundnut oil;
        The allocation of CFCE resources to the shared costs fund mechanisms.

Regarding the CFCE proceeds, despite the Borrower's obligation, evidenced by the inclusion of
the sum of CFAF 500 million in the initial budget law for 2006, pressures on the public accounts
in 2006, 2007 and 2008 hindered the transfer of those resources to the PIPP shared costs fund.
The following considerations should be noted in this regard:

-   first, the pressures weighing on the public accounts in 2006;
-   second, the priority that the IDA assigned in 2007 to reconfiguring the team and the system
    for managing the PIPP shared costs fund.

Moreover, the IDA's different assessment of satisfaction of the measure concerning reduction of
the competitive distortions in the edible oil sector ruled out any solutions anticipating the release
of the tranche. Lacking a more reliable means of taking account of the health risks associated
with the consumption of palm oil and controlling the origin of imports, the Borrower decided to
continue relying on methods compatible with the safeguard clauses of the World Trade
Organization.


VI. Comments on the conditions not met

In deciding to maintain the measure on edible oils despite the major decision to eliminate the
related tranche and any reference to SONACOS, the IDA put the project at risk of a second
negative sanction following the USD 10 million reduction of the loan amount.

Concerning the merger of the two retirement pension systems, it should be noted that this
measure was the third version of a recommendation that had failed to win consensus in the project
identification phase. First, a proposal was made to entrust the task of collecting social
contributions to those responsible for collecting State taxes. That proposal was then replaced by
another consisting of merging IPRES and the Social Security Fund, before remaining in the
project objectives in the form of a merger of the IPRES and FNR systems so as to reduce
administrative expenses and eliminate duplication of effort.




                                                  41
This lack of consensus from the outset concerning the different versions of this measure was
confirmed by the study that recommended a prior harmonization, to which the ongoing
parametric reforms had already contributed.

Finally, the IDA interpreted the CFCE as a user right in order to recommend preferential
allocation of the proceeds to the shared costs fund mechanisms. However, as a user right of the
labor force, first preference should go to strengthening the capacities of that same labor force,
particularly by financing vocational and technical training.

In this regard, the State annually allocates to the National Vocational Training Office (ONFP), the
Vocational and Technical Training Development Fund (FONDEF) and other vocational training
entities approximately CFAF 2 billion out of the sum of CFAF 2.9 billion comparable to 30% of
the CFCE proceeds, which averaged CFAF 9.6 billion per year in 2005, 2006 and 2007.


VII. Project execution

We will begin by reporting on project execution by component, before assessing the performance
of the various stakeholders.


1. Project execution component by component

"Tax system reform" component: the project emphasized reduction of the marginal effective
tax rate (TEMI) by reconciling the promotion of private investment and revenue targets,
rationalization of the system of investment incentives, and the use of CFCE proceeds.

Attainment of the objectives of this component involved the approval of Law 2004-12 of
February 6, 2004 setting out the (new) General Tax Code, Law 2004-06 of February 6, 2004
establishing the (new) Investment Code and Law 2003-36 containing the (new) Mining Code.

The approval of Law 2004-12 of February 6, 2004 setting out the (new) General Tax Code was
preceded by extensive consultations between the State and the private sector within the
framework of the Presidential Investment Council. Identification of the measures was also based
on the recommendations of a study on the corporate tax system and incentive arrangements in
Senegal, conducted at end-2000 by the World Bank Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS).
The approach to calculating the marginal effective tax rate was also adopted by the Directorate
General of Taxes and State-Owned Property (DGID) as the framework for assessing reform
projects.

Preparations for the approval of Law 2004-06 of February 6, 2004 establishing the (new)
Investment Code were managed, in consultation with the World Bank, by APIX, which also
relied on its experience in promoting Senegal as an investment destination.

The approval of Law 2003-36 was spearheaded by the Directorate of Mines with support from the
Economic Policy Unit (future CEPOD), which kept the Minister of Economy and Finance up to
date on the scope of the proposed reforms.




                                                42
"Groundnut sector reforms" component: the project focuses on the elimination of competitive
distortions by abolishing the specific tax on vegetable oils and the conjunctural tax on imports of
such oils.


The objectives selected for this component in the negotiations of May 2003 were pursued outside
the project. Of particular note is the fact that SONACOS was privatized. The groundnut sector
reforms were also the subject of a sectoral policy statement. However, the IDA had required
making measures included in this component a condition for submission to its Executive
Directors, because it was convinced that all the elements necessary for a decision were in place.
The aide-mémoire of the World Bank mission that visited Senegal from April 22 to 30, 2003 had
concluded that different approaches to levying the TCI and the specific tax on unprocessed and
refined oils, as well as the exemption of imported groundnut oils, contributed nothing to
protection of the groundnut sector, made the consumption of vegetable oils more expensive on
the domestic market, and resulted in substantial transfers to the oil mills at the expense of
Senegalese taxpayers.


"Postal services reform" component: the project was aimed at: (i) the introduction of greater
competition in the postal sector, the improvement of corporate governance and of the viability
and quality of SN La Poste services: (ii) the financial restructuring of SN La Poste together with
improvement of the legal and regulatory framework, as well as implementation of the enterprise's
strategic plan by means of a performance contract and the spinning off of financial services.


The appointment of a new Director General of La Poste after the political handover in March
2000 paved the way for a process of adjustment and modernization of the postal sector. With this
in view, a strategic plan was prepared and its implementation begun before the entry into force of
the project. This action plan served as the basis of the sectoral policy statement that was adopted,
as well as the action plan chosen for the project. In particular, the action plan had included the
establishment of a postal savings bank. The difficulties encountered in making this initial option a
reality suggest that closer attention needs to be paid to the lessons of the political economy of
reforms in sectors such as postal services.

Moreover, cash flow pressures beginning in 2006 limited the possibility of the State building on
the progress made in the wake of the reforms, as agreed within the framework of the project, by
recapitalizing La Poste.

"Retirement pension system reform" component: The project was aimed at rehabilitation of
the financial bases of the National Retirement Fund (FNR) and IPRES. For the FNR, this
objective was attained primarily through the parametric reforms of 2002. For IPRES, the priority
parametric reforms were: (i) transition to the automatic indexation of benefits to wage growth
with a view to offsetting the erosion of real benefits experienced in the past; (ii) permanent
indexation of all other parameters to wage growth; (iii) raising to 60 the regular progressive
retirement age of men and women; (iv) settlement of the contribution arrears owed to IPRES by
liquidated public enterprises; (v) adoption of a new reserves investment policy; (vi) setting up of
a social security commission to design and implement systemic reforms aimed, in particular, at
reducing administrative expenses and eliminating duplication of effort, as well as the introduction
of private retirement pension funds.




                                                43
A retirement pension reform workshop was held in 2000/2001, partly to find a solution to the
FNR's structural deficit, but more particularly to modernize and improve the equity and financial
viability of the entire system. The preparation and implementation of the parametric reforms
benefited from the strong support of the ministries responsible for Finance and Labor, which
together organized the dialogue with labor and management.
Subsequently, the delay in establishing COSRISS deprived the project, between 2003 and mid-
2005, of a proven supporter of the design and success of systemic reforms.
In countries that have successfully carried out systemic reforms, the effort was supported by a
broad, well-organized public outreach campaign. The issues of expanding the coverage of the
retirement pension system, the changeover of government employees from the IPRES system to
the FNR system, the granting of managerial autonomy to the FNR and the reduction of its impact
on public finances, the reclassification of the IPRES information and management system, the
rate of growth of the pensions paid by IPRES as well as that of the private retirement pension
funds would benefit from inclusion in a comprehensive and balanced public outreach approach.



2. Assessment of the performance of the various parties

Implementation of the project included the participation of actors such as representatives of
ministries and supervised agencies and services, as well as consultants and IDA representatives.


A. Performance of executing agencies and project monitoring

The Private Investment Promotion Project (PIPP) Management Unit and the Development Policy
Research Center (CEPOD) served as secretariat without having any staff assigned exclusively to
that task. The adverse effect of this situation was mitigated each time that the unit responsible for
the sector concerned evinced a high degree of ownership of the reforms. Beginning in 2006,
changes in the implementing units and pressures on government cash flow led to delays in the
ownership, programming, and implementation of reforms.


B. Performance of the consultants

Overall, the consultants hired during project implementation enabled the stakeholders to reach
consensus-driven decisions, except with regard to the edible oils sector. However, it is possible
that some consultants may have been influenced more by their past experience in the project
identification phase than by local realities.


C. Performance of the IDA

The IDA team also had its share of instability, except with regard to the postal services sector.
The reforms of the retirement pension system in particular were vulnerable to a kind of mismatch
between the time needed to see the basic measures through to a successful conclusion and the
time an expert is able to devote to them, based on his or her career plans.




                                                 44
It was undoubtedly instability within the IDA technical team that led to assigning too great a role
to the merger of the two retirement pension systems as a guarantee of the equity and long-term
financial viability of the system as a whole.



VIII. Conclusions and lessons learned

With the project, the Borrower and the IDA committed to undertaking reforms in sectors that had
resisted the wave of first-generation reforms, which reforms had made it possible to liberalize the
goods and nonfactor services sectors between 1980 and 1995. Consequently, these reforms need
more time to mature, more communication, and a greater commitment on the part of those
involved. The shortfall in each of these areas had a definite impact.

Moreover, in terms of its adjustment aspect, the project came at a time when the focus of general
government was on capacity building. This justified pairing up with the PIPP, but needs in this
area were not always sufficiently anticipated and met.

Similarly, the legal aspects of the commitments undertaken, especially in the case of the
Borrower, act as a constraint on adapting to changes in the environment and in viewpoints as
measures are being implemented.

Finally, the reforms carried out within the framework of the project were undertaken more for
their intrinsic value. But any failure to take due account of the political economy of the reform
measures could later prove prejudicial to their success.
