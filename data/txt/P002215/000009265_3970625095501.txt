FOURTH BRD PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Rwandese Republic.
Beneficiary:              Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD).
Amount:                   SDR 8.5 million (US$9.0 million equivalent).
Terms:                    Standard IDA terms.
Relending terms:          The Borrower would onlend the Credit proceeds
to BRD on the following terms and conditions: (i)
IBRD interest rate in effect at the time of
distribution of Credit documents to the EDs, with
a flexible amortization schedule that would
substantially conform with the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of subloans made by BRD and
financed under this project (subject to a maximum
of 15 years, including a grace period not to
exceed 5 years) on the portion of the line of
credit allocated for medium-sized projects (US$5.0
mill'on); (ii) 7% p.a. wsith a fixed amortization
schedule of 10 years, including 5 years of grace
on the remaining US$4.0 million to be used for
small-scale enterprises (SSEs). The weighted
average cost of IDA funds to BRD would be about 8%
p.a. The Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
Objectives and Project   The project would continue IDA's support to BRD as
an effective financial intermediary -- and the
Deseription:              main instrument in Rwanda for developing the
private sector -- to provide term financing for
well-designed development projects. The project
would also assist the Government in improving the
policy framework for SSEs through the
establishment of a special regime for them in the
investment code, improving the operation of the
Special Guarantee Fund for SSE lending, and would
provide a vehicle for reviewing with Government
the recommendations of the ongoing tariff study.
The project would provide a line of credit of
US$9.0 million to BRD, of which US$5.0 million
would be used for financing medium-sized
enterprises and US$4.0 million would be for SSE
projects.

Benefits and Risks:        The project would provide term investment
resources to help the development of Rwanda's
private sector and particularly SSEs. It would
enable IDA to continue to support BRD in its
efforts to improve its effectiveness and would
play an important role in improving the policy
framework for SSEs and initiating a dialogue with
Government on the reform of the tariff system.
The project would help create about 1,500 jobs at
an estimated average cost of US$10,000 per job.
The main risk in this project relates to the
possible deterioration of BRD's financial position
because of an increase in its arrears. This risk
is, however, limited (i) because BRD has developed
a sound program for assisting SSEs, the first
phase of which has yielded encouraging results;
and (ii) because of the actions BRD has already
initiated to deal with its two major problem
projects and the measures proposed in the context
of this project to improve its collection
performance and which will be closely monitored by
IDA.

I. THE ENVIRONMENT
A.  The Manufacturing Sector
The Setting
1.01      Rwanda is a small landlocked country which depends on Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania for its access to the sea.  More than 5.5 million
people live in about 26,000 km2 of hilly to mountainous land, making Rwanda
the most densely populated country in Africa. GNP per capita, estimated at
USS270 in 1983 (Atlas method), is among the lowest in the world. The
population, overwhelmingly -.ural (90%), is increasing at a rare of 3.6% per
annum and derives its livelihood mainly from subsistence agri,ulture and
coffee cultivation.
1.02      Despite the predominantly rural nature of its economy (47% of GDP
and 70% of foreign exchange earnings), Rwanda has a relatively active
modern sector. Services (excluding public administration) have grown fast
over the last six to seven years and now account for 21% of GDP. Mining,
although small in terms of its contribution to GDP (about 1%), is an
important foreign exchange earner (nearly 20X of total export receipts) and
employer (6,000 salaried workers plus 12,000 artisan miners). Rwanda's
mined resources include cassiterite (a tin ore), wolgram (a tungsten ore),
columbG-tantalice (produced with cassiterite), and some gold. Industry has
also emerged as an important sector, contributing about 17% to GDP and
employing 40,600 people. The sector is geared toward meeting the domestic
demand for basic goods. Manufacturing exports are negligible. Another
major sector of the economy is public administration which accounts for 9%
of GDP and employs 22% of the total salaried labor force. Construction and
public works make up the remaining 5% of GDP.
1.03      Rwanda's recent economic history has been one of considerable
progress. Following a period of stagnation due to bad weather conditions
in 1970-74, GDP grew at a rapid rate of 5.4% p.a. in real terms between
1974 and 1980, spurred by high mineral and coffee prices. The income gains
for the population were impressive as evidenced by the tripling of the GNP
per capita (from US$74 in 1974 to USS220 in 1980) which, in Rwanda, is
fairly evenly distributed. Inflation, which averaged 14% during 1977-79,
abated with the return to normal supply conditions following the reopening
of the Uganda border in 1980.
1.04      From 1981 to 1983, GDP continued to grow, albeit at a lower rate
than in the past (4.0% p.a. :.n real terms). Mining production stagnated
due to the financial and managerial problems of SOMIRWA (Societe Minie're du
Rwanda), hut agriculture expanded at a real rate of 4.5%. The highest
growth was posted by the construction sector (10% p.a.), followed by public
administration (9%) and manufacturing (7%).



- 2 -
1.05      Tn contrast to previous years, the 1981-83 growth was accompanied
by a weakening of the budget and the balance of payments, reflecting
unfavorable exte.rsql conditions and some relaxation of the Government
policy of expenditu-e restraint. The budgetary deficits in 1981-83
depleted the Treasu-y's cash balances (US$32 million in deposits with the
banking system in 1'80), and turned the Government's position vis-a-vis the
banking system into a debtor position. The emphasis given to control of
public expenditure in the austerity program announced in January 1984 and
the efforts made since then to reduce the budgetary deficit show that the
Government has understood the gravity of the problem. To reduce the
appreciation of its currency, the Government also delinked the Rwanda Franc
from the US dollar and tied it to the SDR at the rate of SDR 1 = RwF 102.7
in September 1983.
1.06      In 1984, the balance of payments recovered and registered a
surplus as a result of high prices and exports of coffee and tea and some
restraints on imports. Gross foreign exchange reserves increased to US$139
millioni (equivalent to about 5 months of imports of goods and non-factor
services) at the end of 1984, while the debt service burden was negligible
(less than 3% of exports of goods and non-factor services). Inflation
remained noderate (about 6%) and the relatively good performance of the
agricultural sector suggests that GDP in real terms increased by about 3.5%
to 4.0% in 1984.  Prospects for 1985 are favorable as the coffee harvest
looks promising, and the investment climate is good.
Structure and Performance
1.07      During the period 1977-83, manufacturing expanded at an average
rate of 8.7% p.a. in real terms, aided by a growing economy and a stable
environment, and reached 17% of GDP in 1983, a high share by sub-Sahara
African standards. Most of the growth was registered by modern enterprises
and was due in part to the start of production of new enterprises, such as
cigarettes and matches, plastic tubes, galvanized iron sheets, etc. By
contrast, the growth of the SSE/artisan sector has been modest (about 3%-4%
p.a. in real terms), with the exception of the non-metallic minerals branch
(bricks, tile, etc.), which recorded an average rate of 12% p.a., mainly as
a result of a high demand for bricks and other local materials due to the
construction of few large buildings.
1.08      This high growth yielded little structural change.  The sector
remained mostly composed of artisans and small enterprises producing basic
goods for the domestic market. There are a total of only 80-100 medium and
large enterprises with more than 30 employees, including some 20 public and
mixed enterprises. According to surveys conducted by the Ministry of
Mining, Industrv and Artisanat (MINIMART), about 26,000 people work as
artisan or in small industry, 1/ as compared to 14,000 employed in medium
and large enterprises. The SSE sector also generates about 60% of the
industrial value added.
1/ Small scale industry is defined as an enterprise having net total
assets of less than RwF 30 million and employing less than 30
employees.



1.09      Modern manufacturing is mainly concentrated in Kigali, the
capital where infrastructure is more developed, although some secondary
towns are becoming more active and important. With the exception of food
processing, modern manufacturing relies mainly on imported inputs.
Production is typical of the first generation of import substitution, with
official exports limited to processed coffee, tea, pyrethrum and a few
other products. Most firms enjoy a relatively high level of tariff
protection (50% to 80% for most competing imports) and some have access to
the benefits granted by the investment code. Those managed by private
owners are generally profitable, but rely to a large extent on expatriate
personnel. With some exceptions, they operate at relatively high capacity,
but the quality of their products is often low by international standards.
1.10      Perhaps the greatest change since 1977 occurred in ownership
patterns of modern industry. The Covernment did not limit its ro]e to
improving the institutional framework as it had declared but also financed
a number of industrial ventures. Out of the 22 industrial projects
completed during 1977-82, 13 were fully or majority-state owned. At
present, about a third of the capital in modern manufacturing belongs to
the public sector. The Goverament's increased intervention in
manufacturing resulted from the desire to step up economic growth by
increased investment in industry, the necessity to be present in companies
of national interest, and, last but not least, the availability of
bilateral aid to finance state-owned projects. However, most of these
interventions were poorly planned and implemented. Many became part of the
administration when completed as no structure was created to operate them.
They do not have an independent management and function as public
services. All important decisions are taken at the ministry level,
accounting is neglected and cost control practically non existent. Most
public industrial enterprises are in deficit and work at very low
capacity. In view of these disappointing results, the Government recently
decided to reduce its direct involvement in industry. It is reviewing the
public investment program and is trying to reorganize and improve the
operation of public industrial enterprises with a view to finding private
investors to share in the ownership or acquire in full some of them.
1.11      Rwanda's SSE sector is diverse and dynamic and has, compared to
other African countries, developed without much institutional assistance.
Small industries are mainly in brick and tile making, grain milling,
bakeries, garment-making, wood and metal products. At the artisan level,
production includes banana wine, baskets, bricks, wood furniture,
butchering, masonry and blacksmithing. Manufacturing represents only about
25% of SSE activity in Rwanda, with agriculture, commerce and other
services remaining the dominant activities. Virtually all SSEs are owned
by Rwandese nationals and are either family businesses or cooperatives.
Exceptionally few SSEs are limited liability companies. Unlike modern
manufacturing, which is mainly concentrated in Kigali, SSEs are spread
countrywide. About 70% are almost equally divided between the four major
urban areas (Kigali, Gitarama, Butare and Gisenyi), and the remaining 30%
are found in the other, more rural areas. They are productive, labor
intensive and less dependent on imported inputs than many modern
enterprises.



- 4 -
1.12      To improve Rwanda's knowledge of this sector, its constraints and
potential, IDA financed a comprehensive study on SSEs in Rwanda under the
Third Credit to BRD. The work was carried out by BRD and the Centre
Africain de Statistiques et d'Economie Appliquee, and covers 220
enterprises, 146 of them located in rural areas and 74 in Kigali, and in
the other three major cities of Rwanda. The study, which was submitted to
the Government for consideration in December 1984, revealed that the
development potential for SSEs in Rwanda is significant. SSEs are less
constrained by the small size of the local market and there is ample scope
for development in such diverse areas as food processing, agricultural
tools, livestock, construction materials, etc. However, the sector also
faces severe constraints. More than modern enterprises, SSEs suffer from
the lack of incentives, limited availability of training facilities and
difficult access to bank credit, although they appear to have substantial
borrowing capacity as their debt/equity ratio is generally low. These
issues will be addressed in the proposed project (paras. 1.20 to 1.24).
Industrial Policies and Issues
1.13      In Rwanda, the responsibility for the formulation and
implementation of industrial policies is shared between four institutions.
The Ministry of Mining, Industry and Artisanat (MINIMART) has the
responsibility for overall industrial policy formulation but mainly
concentrates its efforts on industrial promotion, including SSEs, and on
delivering industrial licences. It also plays a role in the granting of
benefits under the investment code and has under its control the Bureau for
Industrial Promotion (BPI), created in 1977 to prepare industrial projects
and assist enterprises in difficulty. The Central Bank (Banque Nationale
du Rwanda - BNR) controls import licensing and all foreign exchange
transactions, sets interest rates charged by most financial institutions,
and manages the country's exchange rate. The Ministry of Finances and
Economy (MINIFINEC0) influences industrial development through taxes and
import tariffs and approves the benefits proposed by MINIMART under the
invTestment code. Finally, the Planning Ministry (MINIPLAN) coordinates the
preparation and follows the execution of the country's industrial
investment program. Other institutions also affect industry, such as the
Ministry of Social Affairs, which fixes minimum wages and salaries for
different levels of skill.
1.14      To regulate and assist the industrial sector, the Government
relies essentially on the same policy instruments used by most other
African countries, but applies them with a certain liberalism, allowing
some competition from imports and often amongst local producers. Recent
measures taken to protect the country's foreign exchange reserves have,
however, increased the level of protection accorded to local industry.



1.15      Import licencing.  All imports are subject to licencing, but
licences are usually granted.  Restricting imports of competing goods to
protect local producers has not been Government policy, though, in 2 few
cases, imports have been temporarily banned. However, in an effort to
reduce the level of imports in the face of balance of payments
difficulties, the Government introduced in March 1983 a scheme requiring
importers of certain goods to place a 100% local currency deposit with the
central bank at the time the import license is issued. The deposit earns
interest but since imports take four to six months to arrive, this measure
imposes a considerable strain on the liquidity of importers. Goods covered
by the regulation include those carrying high import duties as well as most
goods produced locally. Industrial inputs are not affected. Applications
for import licences have fallen since the scheme, which is operated by the
BNR, was introduced.
1.16      Import tariffs.  Imports are subject to a customs duty varying
from 5% to 20%, a fiscal duty of up to 130% of the cif value, and a bonded
storage tax of 3% cif value. A preferential rate of 1% is applied to items
exempted from import duties. The tariff structure shows a familiar
pattern: exemptions or low duties on raw materials, intermediate and
capital goods, as well as consumer goods not produced locally; and high
rates on consumer goods not produced locally and luxuries. Generally,
duties increase with the stage of processing.
1.17      The large differences in duty rates result in widely different
rates of protection to various manufacturing activities. The fact that
industrial inputs attract low duties (or are exempted) provides little
incentives to develop local substitutes and may discourage industries that
could be viable in Rwanda. On the other hand, high duties on consumer
goods encourage local production that is economically inefficient. The
Government is aware of the need to reform the tariff system and has
initiated a comprehensive study of the tariff structure with a view to
encouraging efficient import substitution and exports.  During appraisal of
this project, IDA staff advised the main officials responsible for the
tariff review on the approach to be used and prepared for them a note
outlining the objectives and methodology of a tariff study in Rwanda. The
study is expected to be completed by early 1986. Given its importance for
the industrial sector, it was agreed at negotiations that Government would
review the study's recommendations as well as the proposed timetable for
introducing changes with IDA by July 1, 1986 (para. 4.02(a)(i)).
1.18      P:ice controls.  Since March 1983 a form of ex-ante price control
(Homologation des Prix) has been in force in Rwanda. According to the
Ministerial Decree, prices of imported goods and those manufactured locally
should be approved before goods are sold. Manufacturers can claim a net
margin of 15%, while traders are allowed a gross margin of 15% (wholesale),
or 25% (retail).



- 6 -
1.19      The price control system, however, is not applied strictly.
Although importers are required to submit price information to the Commerce
Department, their proposed prices are approved automatically within 24
hours. With regard to local manufacturers, only two enterprises having a
special agreement with the Government have had their prices reviewed by the
administration. Twenty others (all large enterprises) have submitted the
information requested, but are in fact free to sell their products at
prices deemed reasonable. SSEs are not affected at all as the Commerce
Department does not even request them to provide price information and does
not intend to do so in the future. As applied now by the Finance Ministry,
the system is directed at obtaining information necessary to analyze
developments in the economy rather than at controlling prices. It operates
as a price registration system and does not appear to be a constraint for
importers and manufacturers.
1.20      Investment Code.  The code offers eligible foreign and local
investors the following guarantees and fiscal advantages: (i) repatriation
of interests, dividends, and the original capital invested at the official
exchange rate; (ii) exemption from payment of import duties on imported
inputs and equipment; (iii) tax holiday for five years, and reduced taxes
for the subsequent two years; and (iv) a wide range of benefits in the case
of projects that are of special importance to the country and involve large
investments. These benefits include, inter alia, relief from various
duties and taxes for a period up to 15 years, restrictions on competing
imports, and guarantee of Government orders. The administration of the
Code is divided between MINIMART and MINIFINECO. Finance has a decisive
voice in the granting of the benefits.
1.21      To qualify for the advantages, a project should have a minimum
investment of RwF 10 million (US$95,250) for local investors and RwF 20
million (USS190,500) for foreign investors. Twenty eight enterprises (all
of them large enterprises) have benefitted from the advantages of the
code. The SSE study shows that only 15% of the surveyed SSE companies
fulfill the minimum investment requirement and that 94% had never heard
about the code. Recently, the Government created an interministerial
committee to work on a special regime for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) within the existing code. At negotiations, the Rwandese delegation
informed IDA that the preparatory work was fairly advanced and that the
final draft would be submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval by
June 1986. The SME regime would emphasize the tax exemption aspect of the
benefit package as small and medium entrepreneurs are less interested in
the other advantages: thev do not repatriate profits and generally do not
import directly to benefit from the duty exemptions on equipment and
imported inputs. Tax exemptions are also important to induce SMEs to
contract bank loans and expand their business. Under present regulations,
a borrower should produce evidence that he has paid all due taxes. Many
SSEs do not borrow because they prefer to remain unknown to the tax
authorities. The SME regime would also have clear eligibility criteria
such as the size of the enterprise (net total assets of less than
RwF 75 million) and the use of local raw materials (more than 60% of total
raw materials).



- 7 -
1.22      Special Guarantee Fund.  The major action taken by the Government
in favor of SSEs was the creation of the Special Guarantee Fund to help
enterprises unable to meet normal security requirements to obtain loans
from financial institutions. Contributions to the Fund come from a 10%
levy on the pre-tax profits of participating institutions, which comprise
BRD and the commercial banks. To obtain a guarantee, a request must be
submitted, accompanied by a substantial amount of documentation, to an
interministerial committee composed of 15 members and chaired by a Director
General of the MINIFINECO. Because of its aemanding and cumbersome
procedures, the Fund is not functioning well. Over the last six years,
only a handful of guarantees were issued and the more than RwF 160 million
(US$ 1.5 million) contributed to the Fund have remained largely idle in a
central bank account.
1.23      Although some measures have been taken to improve the operation
of the Fund such as reducing the number of committee members to seven, it
is still necessary to make access to the Fund guarantee more automatic if
it is to encourage commercial banks' lending to SSEs.
1.24      At negotiations of this project, the Government outlined the
changes it intended to introduce in the Policy Statement and procedures of
the Special Guarantee Fund: (i) establishment of clear eligibility
criteria. Access to the Fund would be reserved to promoters of productive
projects (agriculture, fisheries, induistry and mining) with insufficient
security; (ii) simplification of the documentation requested from
applicants which would be limited to a description of the borrower, the
purpose of the loan and the security offered; and (iii) automatic payments
by the Fund when a loan is more than one year in arrears. However, these
payments would be limited to 80% of the principal arrears to keep
participating institutions interested in pursuing recovery of arrears.
These proposed changes are adequate and are expected to improve the
functioning of the Special Guarantee Fund.
B. The Financial Sector
Description
1.25      Rwanda's financial system is simple and consists of the following
institutions: the Central Bank (BNR), three commercial banks (Banque
Commerciale du Rwanda, Banque de Kigali, and Banque Continentale Africaine
- Rwanda - BACAR), a network of cooperative banks (Banques Populaires), a
Savings Association (Caisse d'Epargne du Rwanda), a mortgage bank (Caisse
Hypothecaire) and a development bank (Banque Rwandaise de Developpement -
BRD). BRD is described in detail in the following chapter. All these
institutions have headquarters in Kigali, but some of them have branches in
the interior of the country. With the exception of the commercial banks,
all the other institutions are totally, or to a significant extent,
Government-owned. Under the sponsorship of BACAR, a new private financial



- 8 -
institution (African Continental Holding of Rwanda - ACHOR) is being
created to take equity in existing companies and to establish new
companies. The majority of ACHOR's share capital would be held by the
Banque Continentale du Luxembourg and the rest by private Rwandese
Businessmen. ACHOR is not yet in operation.
1.26      Financial institutions are supervised by BNR which requires
them to submit regular financial statements and monthly information
regarding their activities, and sets strict criteria for their lending
operations 2/, the most important of which are as follows: Institutions
taking deposits from the public should, at all times, maintain their equity
to at least 10% of their liabilities. Equity participations by banks
cannot, unless approved by BNR, exceed 10% of the bank's net worth and 20%
of the company's share capital. Finally, the financial institutions'
exposure limit to any single enterprise is fixed by BNR at 25% of their net
worth. No financial institution may exceed this limit without BNR's
express authorization.
1.27      Another characteristic of Rwanda's financial system is its high
degree of specialization. Because of the short-term nature of their
resources, commercial banks may not, unless authorized by BNR, engage in
long-term lending (more than four years) which Ls the domain of
institutions such as BRD and the Caisse Hypothecaire. They are mainly
active in import and export financing and overdrafts to local companies.
At the end of 1984, about 88% of all short-term credits were extended by
the three commercial banks.
1.28      BRD is the most important long-term lender, accounting for 72% of
the RwF 2,712 million (US$25.8 million) long-term credit outstanding at the
end of December 1984. The rest is mostly held by commercial banks which
are allowed by BNR to provide long-term housing finance, given the still
relative inactivity of Caisse Hypothecaire in this field. On the other
hand, BRD and Caisse Hypothecaire are not, in principle, allowed to grant
short-term credits. Commercial banks' medium-term lending (one to four
years) is limited to a maximum determined by their net worth plus deposits
of more than a year duration minus fixed assets, equity participations,
doubtful debts and losses. Among commercial banks, Banque Commerciale du
Rwanda is the most active in medium-term lending, holding about 30% of
total medium-term credit outstanding at the end of December 1984.
Availability of Finance for Industry
1.29      Credit to the economy is controlled by BNR which sets global
ceilings on short-term credits for the whole banking sysEem, and for each
of the three commercial banks. BRD is not subject to credit control as its
resources (mainly foreign exchange) come from abroad. The credit ceilings
for the commercial banks are set on a quarterly basis and the allocations
per bank depend on their deposits and BNR's growth projections of the
economy.
2/ BRD's lending policy is not subject to BNR regulation, but is set by
its Board.



- 9 -
1.30      BNR's control over credit extended by the banking system is tight
but does not appear to have been a constraint for manufacturing
development. Ceilings assigned to commercial banks have not prevented them
from meeting manufacturing firms' short-term credit needs. Term credit is
more limited and mainly provided by BRD through lines of credit from
foreign donors. IDA is the main lender to BRD and the proposed credit
would help it continue supporting the growth of the industrial sector.
1.31      SSEs have more difficulty than large enterprises finding
financing for their projects. According to the SSE study, less than 25% of
the surveyed enterprises have obtained a bank loan, although about half of
them have at one time or another applied for credit. Credit to SSEs is not
well organized or developed. Short-term credit, mainly to small
enterprises in commerce, transport and construction, is provided to a
limited extent by the commercial banks, and by the Banques Populaires, a
decentralized cooperative banking system akin to credit unions and created
in 1975 with Swiss aid. It is only since 1982 that BRD, the major term
lender in Rwanda, is giving high priority to SSE lending and has developed
a program to assist their development. The Banques Populaires are also
active in term lending, but most of their loans have been to individuals
for housing improvements and car purchases. Expansion of credit for
directly productive activities is hindered by the Banques Populaires' lack
of appraisal capability and the high administrative costs of processing and
supervising a large number of small loans. The commercial banks are
reluctant to enrage in term lending to SSEs because of the high risks
involved. However, with the improvements in the operation of the Special
Guarantee Fund sought under this IDA credit (paras. 1.22 and 1.24), it is
expected that the Commercial banks will be more active in SSE lending. The
proposed project, by allocating US$4.0 million to SSE projects, would also
substantially improve the availability of term credit for SSEs.
Interest rates
1.32      With the exception of those charged by BRD, interest rates are
regulated by BNR, which put into effect a substantial upward revision in
November 1979 (Annex 2). Since then, interest rates have remained
unchanged, except for minor modifications such as the introduction in 1980
of penalty interest on defaulters. Tuie maximum rates for term deposits of
one month to one year vary from 7.5% to 8.75% and range from 8.75% to
11.87% for savings bonds of one to five years maturity. These rates
include a tax equivalent to 20% of the rate to be paid by the banks to the
Treasury. On the lending side, short-term credits for general imports and
overdrafts, which represent the bulk of commercial banks' lending, carry
rates of 14% and 14.5%, respectively. Other lending rates are 4% for tea
exports, 5% for mining exports and 9% for coffee collection and imports of
essential goods. The lending rate for productive investments approved by
BNR is 11%. Other term loans carry rates between 12% and 14%. In view of
the present and projected inflation (about 6% to 6.5%), the present
interest rate structure is considered generally suitable for Rwanda. All
the rates are positive in real terms, except for those on short-term
credits for tea and mining exports.

Foreign Exchange System
1.33      Despite the establishment of the import deposit scheme
(para. 1.15) which is aimed at protecting the country's foreign exchange
reserves, Rwanda remains a relatively open economy compared to other
African countries. The foreign exchange system is virtually rree of
restrictions on current international transactions. Repatriation of
distributed dividends is allowed and resident expatriates can repatriate
up to 60% of their net annual income. Since 1981, restrictions on
transfers of net rental income by non-residents and resident expatriates
were lifted. Manufacturers can obtain foreign exchange at the central bank
for payments of imports of equipment, inputs and spare parts. Finally,
with the approval of BNR, foreign investors can repatriate the capital
invested after sale or liquidation of the comparny.

II. THE INSTITUTION
A. Relationship with IDA and Performance under Previous Bank Group
Projects
2.01      The Banque Rwandaise de Dgveloppement (BRD) was established in
1967 as a limited liability company to encourage the creation and
development of enterprises in Rwanda, to promote the diversification of the
country's economic structure, and to help attract foreign investment into
the country. So far, BRD has received 3 credits from IDA: US$4.0 million
(Credit 655-RW) in FY76, US$5.2 million (Credit 896-RW) in FY79, and
SDR 6.5 million (Credit 1344-RW) in FY83. IDA's main objectives with these
credits have been to help BRD develop into a strong development institution
and to provide term financing for sound productive investments. Under the
third credit, IDA also helped start an effort to assist SSEs by providing
funds to implement BRD's SSE pilot program and by financing a comprehensive
study of that sector. As of September 30, 1985, about SDR 5.5 million (85%
of the total) had been committed under the third IDA credit, and about
SDR 2.6 million (39%) had been disbursed. The third IDA credit is expected
to be fully committed by early 1986.
2.02      After the first credit had been fully disbursed, a Project
Completion Report was prepared in 1983 which concluded that the major
objective of strengthening BRD as Rwanda's major term lending institution
had been substantially met, but that there was scope for improved
performance, particularly in the area of economic analysis of projects.
The PCR also noted that IDA funds only financed six large projects, which
was due to the fact that IDA was the only lender providing BRD with untied
resources. OED did not carry out an audit of the first BRD project. Under
the second and third IDA credits, BRD was requested to calculate economic
rates of return for all non-services sector projects above the free limit
of US$200,000. Funds under these two credits were also spread over a
larger number of projects. As of September 30, 1985, IDA funds under the
three credits financed 74 projects distributed over several economic
sectors, with about 30% in industry, 40% in agriculture and the remaining
30% in services, including hotels and restaurants. The projects were all
judged to be viable with economic and financial rates of return in most
cases above 15%. Individual project size varied from US$10,000 to
US$250,000 for SSE operations with an average cost per job of about
US$7,000 and up to US$4 million for larger enterprises with an average cost
per job of US$26,000. Annexes 19 and 20 give the characteristics and
performance of a sample for projects financed with IDA funds.

B.  Institutional Aspects
BRD's Objectives and Role
2.03      BRD's main objectives are to maintain its position as the major
source of term lending in Rwanda and, by working within the Government's
framework of economic policies, to finance the development of Rwandese
enterprises. To fulfill these objectives, BRD is authorized to grant term
loans or guarantees and take equity participation in enterprises. It can
further receive deposits from enterprises it assists, administer funds,
issue notes, and borrow in Rwanda or abroad. The institution is
autonomous. Decisions are made on the basis of BRD's own appraisal results
deriving from financial, economic and technical merits of projects.
Share Capital and Ownership
2.04      BRD's share capital consists of "A" stares which must account for
at least 55% of total share capital and are reserved for the Government and
public Rwandese agencies and institutions, and B- shares for private and
foreign shareholders (Annex 4). There are no differences between the
rights and privileges of either category of shareholders. Since the
commencement of operation in 1967, five share capital increases have taken
place. They demonstrate BRD's ability to convince its shareholders to put
up fresh resources to strengthen the institution's capital base. The last
increase took place in June 1983, when the Board approved to raise the
authorized capital from RwF 1.0 billion to RwF 1.12 billion (US$10.7
million). RwF 96.0 million of the increase consisted of the subscription
of a new shareholder, the Dutch Development Finance Corporation
(Financierings Maatschappij Voor Ontwikkelinglanden - FMO), which now holds
8.6% of the total share capital. The remaining increase was provided by
the Government to maintain the 55% minimum and by the DEG. Ownership of
BRD's share capital is presently distributed as follows: public sector
55.1%, domestic private sector 12.5%, and foreign institutions 32.4%.
Board of Directors
2.05      BRD's Board of Directors consists of 13 members, seven of whom
represent the  A  shareholders (public sector), and six the  B"
shareholders (Rwandese private sector and foreign institutions). The
President of the Republic appoints the Board Chairman. The current
chairman, a high level official of the Ministry of Finance, was appointed
in July 1982.  The seven  A" Directors represent the Government, OCIR-THE,
OCIR-CAFE and the Caisse Sociale du Rwanda. The six B" Directors
represent CCCE, DEG, FMO, the Belgian Government, SONARWA (the Rwandese
Insurance Company) and the two commercial banks. As with the shareholders,
there are no differences between the authority and responsibility of either
category of directors. The Board meets on a regular basis to determine
BRD's policy and to approve equity participations, guarantees and loans



- 13 -
exceeding RwF 3 million. Overall, the Board's performance is satisfactory.
It operates in a business-like manner and has helped develop BRD into a
sound institution.
Management, Staffing and Training
2.06      In July 1982, the Government appointed a new Managing Director
for BRD, after the predecessor's third three-year term expired. The
current executive, who is experienced and competent, served previously as
Chairman of the Board of one of Rwanda's three commercial banks. He had
also been advisor to the President on Economic and Social Affairs. In the
day-to-day management of BRD, he is assisted by two competent Rwandese
directors, one in charge of Finance and Administration and the other
responsible for Investments. There are also two expatriate technical
assistants: a Belgian management specialist recruited in 1984, who works in
BRD's project supervision division and advises clients on management
mattera; and a German development banker (financed by German bilateral aid)
who has worked in various capacities at BRD since 1975. He has contributed
substantially to the on-the-job training of BRD's local staff and has been
instrumental in helping make BRD the strong financial institution it now
is. However, his contract will expire at the end of 1985. As BRD moves
into SSEs, it intends to rely on his wide experience and has recently made
him advisor to the Managing Director. The Rwandese Government has agreed
to request the Federal Republic of Germany to extend this expert's contract
for another year.
2.07      BRD's staff totals 90.  Thirty-nine (including the chief
executive) are professionals, all of whom have formal training in banking,
agriculture, accounting, economics, finance, business administration, or
social sciences. BRD's staff has almost doubled within the last 3 years in
line with the expansion of operations. About 12 new recruitments (of whom
4 professionals) are planned during 1985-86, mainly to reinforce the SSE
and Supervision Divisions. The staff situation is stable without notable
turnover. Salaries are adequate and help retain the generally hard working
and dedicated staff.
2.08      BRD's training program relies mainly upon practical on-the-job
training by the advisor to the Managing Director and other BRD senior
staff, although a number of junior professional staff have also benefitted
from specialized courses in project evaluation and financial management
organized by the Centre d'Etudes Financieres Economiques et Bancaires
(CEFEB) in France, or other organizations. Such training has yielded good
results. However, with the increasing complexity of its operazions, BRD
would like to expose its staff more to external training to keep them
abreast of developments in their field of expertise, and is proposing to
improve its staff development program. Under this expanded training
program, three staff per year are eApected to participate in seminars and
development finance related courses of up to 3 months each for the rtxt two
to three years. The courses envisaged relate to small enterprises



- 14 -
development, appraisal of agro-industrial projects, economic analysis of
projects, financial aspects of rural industry and management of development
finance institutions. The proposed training program, which BRD will
finance from its internal cash generation, is adequate for the level of
BRD's needs.
Organization
2.09      BRD is organized in two major departments (Annex 5): (i) the
Investment Department is responsible for project appraisal (incl. SSEs) in
all aspects, as well as for supervision and provision of technical
assistance to enterprises assisted by BRD. it is staffed with 20
professionals. A separate SSE division within the Investment Department
has been created in 1982 and consists of two units, one for agricultural
projects and one for other small projects; (ii) the Administration and
Finance Department is responsible for disbursement, loan collection, and
relations with foreign donors. It also maintains BRD's accounts and
administers the local and foreign resources. It Is staffed with 14
professionals and headed by a department director.
2.10      In addition to the existing departments, a third department - the
Studies and Development Department - is currently being organized at BRD.
This department will (i) focus on BRD's new area of activity (agriculture)
and conduct sector studies as a basis for new operations; (ii) undertake
macroeconomic studies; and (i} i) help appraise the development impact of
BRD financed projects, paying particular attention to their economic
merits. The new department is now staffed with two professionals. The
appointed department director, an agronomist by training with some economic
background, is undergoing a nine month training program in economics and
agricultural project lending in Europe.
2.11      BRD is considering a phased establishment of small regional
offices to provide assistance to its clients in the interior of the
country, an area which it now gives a high priority. Although its project
supervision has so far been satisfactory (para. 2.14), BRD's increased
activity and exposure in the regions have resulted in a wide geographical
dispersion of its client base (para. 2.32), a factor that has made it
difficult to provide adequate assistance from Kigali. BRD therefore
intends to set up two small "bureaux regionaux' staffed with one
professional each in Gikongoro and Cyangugu 3/ this year to provide
on-site assistance to clients. The "bureaux regionaux" will also identify
and preappraise future projects. They will report to the head of the
Investment Department. The cost of this regionalization program is
estimated at RwF 500,000 (US$4,800) per office and per year. BRD's
ultimate preference would be to have a field office in each province, but
3/ Gikongoro and C3angugu provinces are considered to have the least
access to BRD support services because of difficult access.



- 15 -
it realises that the financial risks involved call for caution. BRD wiil
therefore use the experience of these two offices to decide on a future
course of action. BRD estimates that the bureaux regionaux" will start
yielding profits from 1988. BRD's approach to regionalization is
pragmatic, its caution reasonable, and its organization structure adequate
for its purposes.
Operating Policies and Procedures
2.12      Policy Statement.  BRD's policies are decided by its board and
documented in a formal policy statement which was amended in May 1985 to
reflect (i) the reorientation of lending towards SSEs and agriculture; (ii)
greater emphasis given to the economic impact of projects; and (iii) the
decision not to assume the exchange risk on foreign loans. The amendments
also clarified BRD's procurement and dividend policies. With these
changes, the policy statement is fully satisfactory.
2.13      Appraisal.  Appraisal reports are prepared by the staff and
reviewed and discussed within the Investment Department at an Appraisal
Team meeting (Reunion des Evaluateurs). In a second step, they are
presented to the Projects Committee (Comite des Projets), which is composed
of all BRD's senior staff and chaired by the Managing Director before they
are finally recommended to the Board for approval. The financial and
technical aspects of appraisal are handled in a satisfactory manner.
Although BRD has progressed in strengthening the economic standard of its
appraisal work, there is still room for improvement. During the period of
the proposed project, BRD plans to improve its staff in economic analysis
of projects (para. 2.08), and project supervision by IDA, including
subproject reviews, will pay special attention to this issue.
2.14      Supervision.  BRD's supervision procedures are satisfactory.  The
supervision function was strengthened and centralized during the late 1970s
under the first IDA credit. BRD's staff visits projects under supervision
twice a year. Those under construction are systematically visited after
the first disbursement. Projects encountering difficulties receive
additional visits. Following each visit, a letter summarizing the findings
is sent to the promotor in which actions to be taken, if any, are pointed
out. BRD requires client companies to submit annual reports, quarterly
reports and financial statements and reviews them thoroughly. At present,
the supervision unit has five professionale working full time on project
follow up, but in view of the expanding portfolio and greater involvement
in SSE lending, BRD plans to reinforce this unit with two additional staff
in 1985/86.



- 16 -
2.15      Promotion.  BRD's promotional efforts have been effective over
the last 5 years. As the institution grew, this function became
centralized into a special division - the Project Identification division.
Staff of this division have over the years examined the economic
characteristics of each region, identified project promoters, and developed
a data base of potentially viable projects for possible BRD financing.
BRD's decisions to increase SSE and agricultural lending as well as to
promote more projects from the regions outside Kigali were direct results
of this division's work. The proposed field offices will, in addition to
their assistance work, also undertake some project promotion in liaison
with the Identification division.
2.16      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procedures for procurement and
disbursement are adequate. Although the primary responsibility for
selecting suppliers lies with project sponsors BRD requests clients to
submit at least 3 quotations and ensures that the items to be purchased are
suitable for the planned operation. In cases where substantial
construction is involved, BRD usually requires competitive bidding. BRD
also insists that equity funds are paid first. Disbursements are made
against presentation of invoices or relevant documentation, with direct
payments being made to equipment suppliers whenever feasible.  Payouts are
checked by follow-up site visits at the various project stages.  As
mentioned in para. 2.12, BRD has formally documented its procurement
procedures in its revised Policy Statement.
2.17      Auditors.  In 1976, it was agreed under the first IDA credit that
an independent auditing firm would verify BRD's accounts. Since then, and
because of a shortage of audit firms in Rwanda, the Nairobi based firm of
Pannell, Kerr, Foster and Co., which has French speaking staff, has been
auditing BRD's accounts. The audits have been unqualified and in line with
IDA's requirements. Under the proposed credit, BRD will continue to have
its accounts and financial statements audited by Pannell, Ke-r, Foster and
Co. or by other independent auditors acceptable to IDA. BRD will also
continue to furnish to IDA certified copies of its audited financial
statements and its annual report within six months after the end of each
fiscal year.
Terms and Conditions of Lending
2.18      BRD's loans have maturities typically ranging from four to
fifteen years, depending on the type of projects being financed. The
average loan maturity is about 7.5 years, including a grace period of 1.3
years. Normally, BRD does not finance more than 50% of the total cost of
the project. This limit has recently been extended to 80% for SSE
projects. BRD takes adequate security and does not accept subordination to
any other lender.



- 17 -
Interest Rates
2.19      BRD's interest rates are not regulated by the rentral bank but
set by its board, in which the Government has a majority vote. Over the
time of its association with BRD, IDA's efforts concerning interest rates
have been to (i) simplify BRD's rate structure which was characterized by
differentiations by sector, term and project profitability; and (ii) set
rates at a positive level in real terms so as to improve resource
allocation and maintain BRD's profitability. IDA's dialogue with BRD and
the Government on this issue has been fruitful.  Under the first three IDA
credits, BRD's interest rates were raised from 7%-9% to 10%-13%. BRD also
accepted (i) to eliminate the financial rate of return as a criterion for
determining interest rates, (ii) not to give any interest rate preferential
to SSEs; and (iii) to maintain all interest rates at positive terms in real
terms. BRD's present interest rate structure appears in the Basic Data and
consists of six rates ranging from 10% (medium term loans for agriculture
and livestock) to 13% (long-term loans for service projects).  At negotia-
tions of this project, BRD agreed to further simplify its interest rates by
adopting two rates: one for the productive sectors and one for services
projects. As the average cost of funds under this IDA credit, as well as
some of BRD's other important prospective borrowing, would be about 8%
p.a. (para. 2.53), BRD further agreed to set these rates at 12J%
(productive sectors) and 13J% (services), levels necessary for BRD to
remain profitable and highly positive in real terms as inflation is
projected to be about 6-6.5% in the next few years. These rates are also
competitive with Rwanda's market rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage
2.20      Under the first three IDA credits, the Government assumed the
foreign exchange risk (without a fee) because it recognized that BRD, like
other DFCs which rely mainly on foreign borrowing, cannot bear this risk.
Under the proposed project, it is also recommended that the Government
assume the foreign exchange risk as it is difficult for BRD to pass on this
risk to its smaller clients - and 45% of this operation will go to SSEs --
because they are inexperienced in foreign exchange dealings. At negotia-
tions the Government insisted on assuming the foreign exchange risk without
a fee as it has done in the past, and to minimize subsidies it was agreed
that the average onlendirg rate from the Government to BRD would be
increased to 8% (from the current average of about 7%). For all of its
loans under this project, except loans to SSEs, funds would be passed on to
BRD at IBRD interest rate, while those to be used for SSEs would carry an
onle;nding rate of 7%.



- 18 -
C. BRD and SSEs
BRD's SSE Strategy
2.21      Until 1982, BRD did not put any particular emphasis on SSEs in
its lending strategy and required them to provide the same information
asked from larger enterprises. Since many SSEs could not comply, their
applications were not processed. According to a review of its own
experience with SSE financing conducted in 1981, during the six year period
ending in 1981, BRD received an average of 63 SSE loan applications per
year amounting to about RwF 140 million/year (US$1.3 million/year), but
only financed 15% of them because of staff constraints and a higher
priority given to the processing of large loans.
2.22      BRD's past reluctance to finance SSEs was due to the higher
administrative costs and bad debt losses associated with such lending in
earlier years. The 1981 SSE review showed that, at March 31, 1982, most of
the arrears over three months was due to small enterprise clients.
However, BRD analysis also concluded that several factors could alleviate
the negative financial impact of SSE lending. First, more experience in
the sector was expected to lead to improved repayment performance through
better criteria for selecting projects and promoters. Second, streamlining
of loan processing procedures for SSEs could hold down administrative
costs. Third, an increase in BRD lending rates would help improve its
average spread. Andfourth, access by BRD to an effective guarantee scheme
would help minimize the financial impact of bad SSE loans. On the basis of
the above, BRD estimated it should be able to break even on SSE lending
with a spread of about 7%. If this proves insufficient, BRD nevertheless
enjoyed sufficient profitability on lending to large enterprises that it
could absorb some of the costs of an expanded program for SSEs.
2.23      Gi-ven the structure of Rwanda economy, BRD knew it had to move
more forcefully into SSE lending. As indicated in para. 1.08, 60% of
industrial value added is generated by small enterprises which also provide
employment for 26,000 people, i.e., about 65% of the industrial labor
force. The devei.,pmen- potential for SSEs is significant and this sector
can help solve Rwanda's pressing unemployment problem. However, given the
risks involved and the need for more experience with this type of lending,
BRD decided to proceed with caution and developed a two phase program to
assist the SSE sector. In the first phase, the main emphasis was put on
(i) selecting and financing the large number of unsatisfied SSE loan
applications which have not been investigated in the past, and (ii)
adapting BRD's loan processing procedures and organization structure to
facilitate SSE lending. In the second phase, which is expected to begin in
late 1985, BRD intends to take a more active, promotional role with more
emphasis put on assisting small entrepreneurs. The first phase of BRD's
SSE program was supported by the third IDA credit to BRD (Cr. 1344-Rw)
which also provided funds to help the Government carry out a study on the
issues affecting SSEs (para. 1.12). The proposed project will help BRD
carry out the second phase of its SSE program. The results of the first
phase are analyzed below.



- 19 -
Organization and Procedures
2.24      In March 1982, BRD's board approved the SSE program and
authorized revisions of policies for SSE lending. A small enterprise
lending division was created in BRD's Investment Department (para. 2.09).
It consists of four analysts, of whom two are responsible for appraising
manufacturing and services projects and two for agro-industrial and other
projects. The four staff approved 45 SSE projects in 1984, i.e., more than
11 projects per staff, which is a good performance considering that only
about 20Z of projects submitted by promoters are finally approved.
2.25      To accommodate small borrowers, BRD also increased its financing
limit for SSEs to 80% of total project cost, while it normally lends only
up to 50%-65% for large and medium-sized projects.
2.26      With regard to procedures, BRD simplified application forms,
appraisal reports and loan contracts. While promoters of larger projects
are required to prepare and present appraisals on their own, BRD's SSE team
is providing assistance in this area free of charge to its SSE clients.  It
also follows a tightly monitored and very active supervision schedule. All
active SSE projects are visited between one to three times per year,
depending on their implementation status and performance. Should a loan
have arrears of over six months, it will be monitored much closer and
clients who are one year and more behind in repaying can be taken to court
_/ upon the decision of the Managing Director.
2.27      To protect its SSE portfolio against risks, BRD established its
own guarantee fund in 1982 as a complementing measure of the SSE pilot
program, using counterpart resources under KfW lines of credit. 5/
Beca-.se many promoters of small enterprises have insufficient assets to
offer as security for loans, BRD believed that such a guarantee scheme
would serve as an important measure to support an expanded SSE lending role
by reducing the provision costs, which can be high for this type of lending
and would have to be made out of its income from loans, thus depressing
profits. The equivalent of US$190,000 are currently available in BRD's
guarantee fund. Compared with the Special Guarantee Fund (paras. 1.22 to
1.24), which guarantees only 80% of outstanding principal, BRD's own fund
covers IOOX plus interests. Because the SSE portfolio is still young (most
SSE loans were approved in 1982-84) and of good quality, BRD has not
actively drawn on the scheme. When the functioning of the national Special
Guarantee Fund is improved, BRD intends to review with KfW the future use
of the funds under A ts guarantee scheme.
4/ The legal processing time varies in Rwanda. To get a judgement takes
between six months and three years. So far, BRD has prosecuted ten
of its clients and actually sold goods of delinquent clients to
compensate for outstanding repayments.
5/ BRD charges its clients an average interest rate of 12%. The cost of
KfW funds is about 4% but BRD can only take 5% to cover its lending
cost. The remaining 3% is put into a special account and can only be
used with KfW's agreement. BRD requested and KfW agreed to use these
funds for the guarantee scheme.

Preliminary Results of the SSE Pilot Program
2.28      As of December 31, 1984, BRD's SSE portfolio amounted to
RwF 277.3 million (US$ 2.6 million). The SSE portfolio is healthy, with
arrears of more than three months representing only 7% of the total
portfolio (para. 2.37). Despite this good performance, BRD did not make
any profit from its SSE lending as a result of a relatively low average
lending rate of 11.5X. 6/ Although SSE related administrative costs
decreased from 7.9% of SSE portfolio in 1983 to 6.1% in 1984, the remaining
margin of 5.4% was barely sufficient to make adequate provisions (3%) and
cover financial charges. 7/ BRD believes there is still room for
improvement as a result of increased productivity of its SSE staff and
forecasts a reduction in SSE related administrative costs to 4.5%-5.0% in
1985 and 1986. This, coupled with the proposed increase in BRD's lending
rates to 121% and 13+% (paras. 2.19 and 3.05(ii)) under this credit, should
improve the profitability prospects for SSE lending.
D. Operations
2.29      Over the past six years, BRD's operations have undergone a
significant shift in four respects: (i) loan maturities have moved from
medium-term towards relatively longer terms; (ii) the average size of
projects has decreased because of an increase in SSE lending; (iii) the mix
of projects has become more evenly distributed among sectors; and (iv) the
geographical distribution of projects has widened.
2.30      As of December 31, 1984, BRD had approved loans and equity
investments totalling RwF 3.8 billion, or the equivalent of US$36.2
million. Virtually all of BRD's financing has gone to private (or majority
private) enterprises. While most of the equity investments were made
before the mid 1970s, loan approvals started to become important in 1974
when they amounted to RwF 163 million (US$1.6 million). Since then, they
have risen rapidly to reach RwF 616 million (US$5.9 million) in 1984. This
growth in approvals has mainly been the result of a surge in long-term
lending. As Table I shows, medium-term loans, which in 1979 made up 74% of
total approvals, represented only 1.3% in 1984.
6/ BRD does not give any preferential treatment to SSEs. The relatively
low interest rate for SSEs compared to larger projects is due to the
fact that most SSE projects were for processing of agricultural
?roclucts and carried lower interest rates.
7/ BRD does not yet have a separate accounting system for SSEs but since
1982 it keeps, to the extent possible, separate operational data for
SSEs, which enabled it to make this retroactive analysis of the cost of
SSE lending.

2.31      The size of the projects financed by BRD varies from less than
RwF 1 million (US$9,520) to over RwF 200 million (US$1.9 million). The
volume of BRD's operations has thus fluctuated from year to year, depending
on the financing of a few large projects. Since 1982, SSE lending has
become an important part of BRD operations. Loans to SSEs averaged 83% of
the number and 21% of the amount of all BRD operations for the three years
to December 31, 1984. With the increase in activities, the sectoral mix of
BRD-financed projects has also changed significantly. In the early
1970s, the transport and tourism sectors were the main focus of BRD's
lending. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, manufacturing predominated and
by 1982 accounted for 92% of approvals. Over the last 2 years, however,
the sectoral mix of BRD's project approvals has been more evenly
distributed among manufacturing and agro-industry (34%), agriculture and
livestock (22%), hotels and tourism (21%), and other services (23%).
2.32      At the same time that BRD began its thrust into SSE lending, the
institution decided to decrease its hitherto geographical concentration in
Kigali by accelerating activities in other regions and diversifying into
agriculture. This has resulted in a shift in the regional distribution of
BRD's projects. Prior to 1982 all BRD projects originated from 3 regions
(Kigali, Kibungo and Byumba). In 1982, coverage was expanded to 7 regions
and, by 1983, all 10 regions were covered. The rate of commitments and
disbursements have kept pace with the rate of approvals.
2.33      Generally BRD limits its total lending to a single enterprise
at 20% of its own net worth in order to spread the risks over its
portfolio. During 1982-84, BRD approved 129 projects with a total cost of
RwF 2.8 billion (US$26.7 million); it financed RwF 1.4 billion (US$13.3
million) and thus helped mobilise an additional RwF 1.4 billion (US$13.3
million) worth of investments. The projects typically have financial rates
of return in excess of 15% and an estimated investment (including initial
working capital) per job created in the range of $3,000-$8,000 for small
projects, and $20,000-$30,000 for medium and large projects.

E. Portfolio and Provisions
Loan Portfolio
2.34      BRD's loan portfolio as of December 31, 1984 amounted to
RwF 1,975 million (US$18.8 million) and is distributed as follows: industry
including mining 28%, agro-industry 16%, agriculture 8%, transport 9%,
hotels and tourism 4% and other sectors 35%. Long-term loans made up RwF
1,577 million (US$15.0 million) and accounted for 80% of the portfolio.
The majority of BRD's projects (77%) are totally owned by private Rwandese
entrepreneur- About half of the projects wpre approved recently, and the
portfolio is thus relatively young, with many projects just starting
operations. Those in operation are generally profitable, with the notable
exception of two large projects: Rwakina (US$2.0 million) and SOMIRWA
(US$0.8 million). These two problem projects account for 76% of the
portfolio affected by arrears and 69% of actual arrears
(para. 2.38).
2.35      The Rwakina project (Annex 21), approved in 1980, was designed to
use cinchona rinds to produce quinine sulphate and other pharmaceutical
products. However, the project was poorly designed and incurred
substantial cost overruns during construction. Total cost, estimated at
about US$4.4 million in 1980 and financed by US$2.4 million equity (of
which 51% provided by Isochem, a French manufacturer of pharmaceutical
products and promoter of the project) and a US$2.0 million BRD loan,
increased to US$6.6 million when the project was completed in 1983. The
large cost overrun was covered by short-term loans from local and foreign
banks and caused the company to become overleveraged, thus straining its
financial base. The project also encountered management, technical,
marketing and supply difficulties and ceased operating in November 1983,
three months after the factory opened. In mid-1984, BRD reexamined the
project's feasibility and developed an action program to put Rwakina back
into operation. The main elements of that program are: (i) rescheduling
of about RwF 104 million (US$1.0 million) debt arrears to banks, including
BRD; (ii) injection of about RwF 56 million (US$0.5 million) for working
capital and plant cleaning; (iii) appointment of a new management; (iv)
establishment of a system to ensure availability of cinchona; (v) signing
of a marketing and technical assistance agreement with a pharmaceutical
manufacturer; and (vi) agreement with a local bank for export credit. BRD
is cuTrently discussing this action program with the shareholders and
Rwakina's lenders which have in principle agreed to the debt rescheduling
and injection of about RwF 34 million new equity.
2.36      SOMIRWA is the largest company in Rwanda with a share capital of
RwF 893 million (US$8.5 million) held by the Government (49%) and Geomines
S.A. of Belgium which also manages the company. SOMIRWA dominates the
mining sector in Rwanda and employs about 6,000 people. The project,
which was approved in 1979, aimed at rehabilitating SOMIRWA's mining



- 23 -
operations and carrying out further mineral exploration. BRD's original
loan of RwF 150 million (US$1.8 million at the 1979 exchange rate)
represented 46% of the project's estimated cost of US$4.0 million. As in
the Rwakina case, implementation encountered difficulties. Due to high
inflation in suppliers' countries, technical problems, but also
underestimation of costs, total investment cost was 75% more than the
amount forecast at appraisal. SOMIRWA financed the cost overrun with its
cash generation which was high during the late 1970s as a result of
favorable world market conditions. Since the last three years, however,
SOMIRWA's financial situation has been deteriorating steadily due to lower
market prices, management problems, declining production, high production
cost and the compounding effect of an acute cash shortage. As a result,
the company has been accumulating substantial losses and has recently
filed for bankruptcy. The Government is studying the feasibility of
rehabilitating the mining sector. For its part and consistent with its
prudent financial policy, BRD has started to write off the SOMIRWA loan.
BRD provided for 502 of the US$0.8 million outstanding in 1984 and plans to
provide for the rest in 1985.
SSE Portfolio
2.37      As of December 31, 1984, the SSE portfolio amounted to RwF 277.3
million and accounted for 11.5% of the total portfolio outstanding. The
composition of the SSE portfolio is diverse and contains projects of the
following nature: livestock (30%), agriculture (24%), industrial activities
such as metal workshops, printing, food processing etc. (15%), bakeries
(10%), services such as hotels and garages (8%), mills (6%) and others
(7%). All SSE projects are owned and managed by private Rwandese
entrepreneurs. The SSE portfolio is healthy, with total arrears of more
than 3 months amounting to RwF 17.0 million (7% of SSE portfolio) as of
December 31, 1984, and with only one SSE project considered doubtful or
bad. This doubtful project 8/ accounted for 45% of the SSE arrears and
BRD plans to write it off.
8/ The KABALIRA artisan project was financed in 1980 out of BRD's own
resources with a subloan of US$80,000 equivalent to produce tools.
After its one year grace period, the enterprise was unable to service
its debt beyond the first instalment because the establishment of
several new tool making cooperatives in Kigali (assisted by ILO)
rendered it overdimensioned and unprofitable.



- 24 -
Arrears and Provisions
2.38      Total arrears of more than three months at the end of 1984
amounted to RwF 138.4 million (US$1.3 million) and affected 39 projects
with a total loan amount outstanding of RwF 374.9 million (US$3.6 million)
(Annex 17). Nineteen percent of the portfolio was thus affected by arrears
and total arrears amounted to 7% of loans outstanding. Fifty ;our percent
of the arrears was in manufacturing including mining. anrd almost wholly
comprised the overdue principal and interest on the aOMIRWA account.  There
were no arrears on transport sector projects and the rest was made up of
projects in agro-industry (18%), hotels and tourism (1X), agriculture and
livestocks (1%) and other projects (26%). BRD has made specific provisions
of RwF 73.6 million (US$700,000). Also, there is a reserve for general
risk of RwF 64.8 million (US$620,000), representing 3.3% of the outstanding
portfolio.
2.39      Although the quality of BRD's portfolio is good and adequate
provisions have been set aside for possible losses, its collection
performance has not improved much over the last two to three years and has
remained under 100%. In 1984, of the RwF 305.9 million (US$2.9 million) in
principal billed, only 89% (US$2.6 million) was collected as compared with
an average of 86% over the previous three years (Annex 19). If the
collection ratio remains at this level, arrears are bound to increase at a
time when BRD is reorienting its lending strategy towards SSEs, a sector
known to be more risky. Against this background, a major objective of this
project is to assist BRD in improving its arrears positicn. At
negotiationis, BRD agreed to set targets for gradually improving its
collection ratio 9/ as follows: 95% in 1985, 100% in 1986, 102% in 1987
and 105% in 1988 Tpara. 4.02(b)(i)). The results obtained will be
submitted to IDA quarterly. During supervision missions, IDA will also
closely monitor BRD's collection performance, assist BRD in implementing
the action program for the Rwakina project and ensure that the SOMIRWA
project is adequately provided for.
Equity Portfolio
2.40      At year end 1984 BRD held eqvity investments totalling RwF 335
million (USS3.2 million) in 14 companie.3. According to its Policy
Statement, BRD's participation should not exceed 50% of an enterprise's
share capital unless the Board unanimously decides otherwise. Accordingly,
BPD has minority holdings ranging up to 25.2%, except for MAGERWA, a

collections during the year (including collection of arrears) and new
amounts coming due during the year.

large warehousing company, where BRD holds 68.7% of the capital. This
project is also BRD's largest equity investment (RwF 82.5 million, or
US$785,000) and has been providing BRD with consistent and substantial
income. Over the past seven years total cash and stock dividends of RwF
202.3 million (US$1.9 million) received from MAGERWA were almost two and a
half times BRD's initial investment. Two other investments yielded
dividends in the last three years and two more are expected to start doing
so in 1986.
F. Financial Results and Condition
Profitability
2.41      Financial Results.  Annexes 9 to 11 show BRD's income statements,
balance sheets and the relevant financial ratios for 1980-84. Income from
loans showed strong growth over the last 5 years, surging at an annual
compound growth rate of 22Z from RwF 99.9 million (US$950,000) in 1980 to
RwF 223.6 million (US$2.1 million) in 1984. The surge in loan income was a
result of two factors: (i) the loan portfolio almost doubled between 1980
(RwF 1,016 million, or US$9.7 million) and 1984 (RwF 1,975 million, or
US$ 18.8 million); and (ii) BRD interest rates went up by an average of two
points during the 1980-84 period. Consequently, BRD's total income for
1984 increased to RwF 274.8 million (US$210,000), or 15.4% above the 1983
figure. BRD's 1984 net profits (RwF 22.1 million) were, however,
significantly lower after a strong showing in 1982 (RwF 72.5 million, or
US$690,000) and 1983 (RwF 70.4 million, or US$670,000). This was primarily
due to record provisions of RwF 107.4 million (US$1.0 million) to reflect
the condition of the RWAKINA and SOMIRWA projects. In 1984, BRD provided
for half of SOMIRWA's RwF 80 million (US$762,000) outstanding loan and
intends to provide for the remainder in 1985. The 1984 provisions amounted
to 5.7% of the average loan portfolio, up from 2.5% in 1983. BRD's
dividend income was unchanged at RwF 21.0 million (US$200,000) for the
third year in a row. As in the past, most of the dividend income came from
the MAGERWA investment. In 1984, income from loans as a percentage of
average total assets was 7.6% and that from dividends was 0.7%, as compared
to 7.4% and 0.8% respectively for 1983.
2.42      Total expenses rose 51% from RwF 167.7 million (US$1.6 million)
in 1983 to RwF 252.7 million (US$2.4 millidn) in 1984, mainly as a result
of the increased provisions. Financial charges as a percentage of the
average debt increased from 4.1% in 1983 to 4.7% in 1984 and reflected the
increasing cost of BRD's borrowings. Administrative expenses were,
however, tightly controlled, and amounted to 2.3% of the average total
assets, down from 2.5% in 1983. Following a long standing provisions
policy, an amount equivalent to 3% of the increase in the actual
outstanding loan portfolio was charged against income to maintain a reserve
account for general risks. In addition, RwF 38.9 million (US$370,000) was
set aside to increase specific provisions for doubtful and bad loans.
Total provisions therefore reached 5.7% of average loan portfolio as
compared to 2.5% in 1983 and reduced the return on average net worth to
1.6%.



- 26 -
2.43      SSE Impact on BRD Performance.  In order to assess the impact of
SSEs on its performance, BRD undertook in early 1985, an analysis of its
small scale operations. This analysis revealed that financing SSEs was
more costly than lending to larger enterprises, but that SSEs performed
equally well, and sometimes better, in servicing their loans. As a
percentage of the average SSE portfolio, the cost of lending to and
administering SSE loans was 6.7% in 1984 (compared to 4.2% for BRD's total
loan portfolio). The level of provisions considered adequate was however
lower for SSE loans (3%) than for the total portfolio (5.7%). In order to
compensate BRD for the higher cost of SSE lending, it was agreed at
negotiations that the onlending rate for the portion of this Credit
allocated to small scale financing be 7%, about one and a half percentage
points lower than that for larger enterprises (para. 3.05(i)).
2.44      Financial Condition.  BRD is a financially sound institution.
Over the past 5 years, its term debt/equity ratio has never exceeded 1:1
and at December 31, 1984 stood at 0.9:1.0, well within the 3:1 limit agreed
with IDA. BRD's debt service coverage ratio is also good at 2.0. The
institution is immune to exchange rate fluctuations on its borrowings
because the Government bears the foreign exchange risk on the portion of
term debt which comes from foreign sources. BRD has substantial equity
resources and 47% of all assets were financed from net worth. Its loan
portfolio is protected because it has made adequate provisions for possible
losses.
Resources
2.45      The Basic Data show BRD's resource position as of December 31,
1984, when resources available for iew approvals totalled RwF 221.7
million (US$2.1 million). RwF 11.6 million (US$110,500) of this was in
local currency and the foreign currency portion of RwF 210.1 million
(US$2.0 million) comprised mainly the uncommitted balance of Cr. 1344-Rw.
The low local currency resources should improve with the expected
collection of RwF 313 million (US$3.0 million) in loans repayments in
1985, of which only 75% have to be immediately reimbursed to lenders. In
addition to its equity, BRD's local resources include loans from the
central bank and Government, two investment funds and retained earnings.
2.46      BRD's foreign exchange resources consisted of eight lines of
credit from four different donors (KfW, CCCE, IDA and EIB) totalling
RwF 1.3 billion (US$12.6 million) and a large credit line provided by the
BNR (Annex 6). Interest rates on the foreign loans range from 0.75% to
6.9% and maturities are from 9 to 50 years, with grace periods of up to 10
years. The CCCE loan is tied to French procurement and was intended to
finance a specific project at 9% interest rate. The BNR line of credit has
relending rates of 8-12% depending on the maturity of subloans and the
sector. All other loans are relent at BRD-established rates and carry no
restrictive conditions. The Government bears the exchange risk on all
foreign currency loans.

G. Prospects
BRD's Strategy
2.47      In its formative years, BRDts main objectives were to build up a
strong project appraisal and supervision capability and a solid financial
base through the financing of relatively large quality projects. Now that
these objectives have been achieved, BRD's strategy is to take a lead role
in the financing and promotion of SSEs and agriculture, two sectors
essential to the development of Rwanda. As part of this strategy, BRD took
the lead in the SSE study financed under the third IDA credit and is
involved in Government proposed improvements of the policy framework for
promotion of Rwandese SSEs. It also intends to carry out a phased
establishment of small regional offices to better assist clients in the
interior of the country. The attention being given to SSEs by the
Government shows that BRD's focus is appropriate and a recent review of its
SSE experience coupled with its continued tight supervision of small
projects indirate that BRD's portfolio quality is not likely to be lowered
by its new chrust. With regard to agriculture lending, BRD has so far a
successful record, with loans arrears in this sector representing only 1%
of total arrears (para. 2.38). Two of its professional staff are
experienced agronomists and BRD is planning to increase its technical
expertise in this area. Finally, BRD has indicated its intention to
improve its technical capability in agro-related lending.
Projected Operations
2.48      Projects Pipeline.  As Rwanda's major institution providing term
finance for development projects, BRD has a strong project pipeline for the
next two years which far exceeds its resource availability for that
period. Although it is still reviewing its pipeline, BRD's tentative list
of projects includes 23 medium and large operations with a total investment
cost of about US$70 million and numerous SSE projects. Although the level
of possible BRD financing is yet to be decided for a number of large
projects, BRD has already been approached for about US$14 million. Over
the last two years funding requests from SSEs had increased at a high rate
(BRD approved an average of US$1.5 million/year of SSE loans in 1983-84)
and BRD expects this trend to continue, especially after the establishment
of its two field offices this year. The majority of the projects in the
pipeline are in industry and agriculture and include carpentry,
brickmaking, soft drinks, plastics, metal working, vehicle repair, cattle
ranching and grain milling.



- 28 -
2.49      Forecast Operations.  BRD's operational forecast is shown in
Annex 12. Despite the strength of its project pipeline (para. 2.48), BRD
plans to maintain a prudent approach to approvals, particularly because it
recognizes the potential risks in proceeding too fast with SSE operations,
its new area of activity. Because of this and the fact that forecasts are
based on the operations of a particularly active year (1984), the
projections assume a steady but cautious 5% growth in current terms in loan
approvals over the next 3 years. The level of commitments and
disbursements is related to the level of approvals on the basis of BRD's
experience in recent years. Total approvals are projected to grow from
RwF 700 million (US$6.7 million) in 1985 to RwF 795 million (US$7.6
million) by 1988. Commitments over the same period (which is equivalent to
the commitment period of the proposed credit) are expected to total US$28.5
million of which about 66Z is in foreign exchange. Disbursements over the
period total about US$26.5 million. BRD's forecast of operations is
realistic.

2.51      As of December 31, 1984, BRD had foreign exchange resources
available for commitment of US$3.4 million equivalent. Foreign exchange
commitments by BRD for the 1985-1988 period are estimated at about
US$18.9 million equivalent. BRD thus has a foreign exchange resource gap
during this period amounting to US$15.5 million. The proposed credit
(US$9.0 million equivalent) will help meet 58% of BRD's foreign exchange
gap during 1985-1988. BRD has obtained from the African Development Fund



- 30 -
a line of credit in the amount of US$5.0 million equivalent and from EDF
(European Development Fund) about US$0.4 million. It is actively pursuing
other sources of funds such as the FMO to cover the remaining gap
($1.1 million equivalent).
2.52      BRD's local resources will be sufficient to meet its
local financing needs over the next 3-4 year . In addition to the
US$2.9 million equivalent available for commitments at December 31, 1984,
BRD expects large inflows of local currency resources coming from loan
repayments by clients. Therefore, BRD's total net cash generation would be
enough to finance loan repayments and the local currency component of
projects.
Projected Financial Condition and Results
2.53      Annexes 13 to 16 show forecasts of BRD's income statements,
balance sheets, sources and uses of funds, and financial ratios for the
period 1985-1988.   These forecasts are presented in current terms and
assume an increase in the cost of BRD's new borrowings to 8% p.a., which is
realistic considering the proposed average onlending rate under the
proposed IDA credit (8% p.a.) and the lending conditions of other BRD's
important potential lenders. In the face of increasing cost of resources
and given the necessity to continue making substantial provisions mainly
for two large bad loans, BRD will have to increase its interest rate, the
major source e_ its income. An increase in BRD's lending rate is also
necessary to improve the profitability of its SSE operations (paras. 2.28
and 2.43). At present BRD charges clients an average interest rate of
about 12% which, if remained unchanged, would leave it with a spread of
only 4% on its new borrowings. Even taking into account the low cost of
existing debt and the comfortable local resource position, such a spread is
insufficient to maintain profitability in the medium-term. For these
reasons, at negotiations of this credit, an agreement was reached with BRD
to increase the interest rate charged to clients to 121% for productive
projects and 131% for services projects, levels which would permit BRD to
have an average spread of about 5% on its new borrowings (para. 3.05(ii)).
2.54      On the basis of the above assumption regarding the cost of new
borrowings and BRD's final rate to clients, BRD's net income is expected to
resume a steady rise from its low point in 1984-85 (a result of the
conservative provisions policy), until it reaches about RwF 54 mil'lion
(US$514,000) in 1988. Although this is still depressed in real terms
compared to past years, it conceals an underlying financial strengthening
of BRD reflected in the conservatism of its provisions and gives the
institution substantial upside cash flow gains, while minimizing its
downside risk potential.



- 31 -
2.55      Loan income is expected to grow from RwF 258 million (US$2.5
million) to RwF 370 million (US$3.5 million) between 1985 and 1988 and to
range between 12.3% and 12.7% of the average loan portfolio. BRD's other
sources of income are small compared to loan income and consist mainly of
dividends and incouie fronm renting out part of its new headquarters. These
increase from RwF 47 million (US$450,000) in 1985 to RwF 52 million
(US$495,000) in 1988. The cost of debt, although still low as a percentage
of average loan portfolio (4.1% in 1988), would increase from 5.5% of
average debt, in 1985 to 6.6% in 1988 reflecting the higher cost of new
borrowing. Administrative costs are, however, expected to be tightly
controlled and kept within 2.5% - 2.6% of average total assets.  Provisions
and depreciation taken together remain at a high level of 4.1% of average
assets. As a result, net income as a percentage of average net worth will
rise gradually from 1.9% in 1985 to 3.6% in 1988.
2.56      Despite the modest net income levels compared to past years the
projections indicate that BRD's financial structure will remain sound.
Over the period 1985-88, BRD's debt to equity ratio is not expected to
exceed 1.2 to 1, well within the 3 to 1 limit currently imposed in legal
agreements with IDA. This limit will be retained under the proposed
project. The debt service coverage ratio should also remain satisfactory
and above 2 at all times. As with most of the DFCs in the region, BRD's
asset/liability structure is expected to retain its current favorable
characteristics (i.e. debt liabilities will continue to have much longer
maturities than loan assets). This should contribute to BRD's financial
strength, allowing the institution to remain liquid over the forecast
period, and enabling it to overcome any portfolio problems in the
foreseeable future.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Justification
3.01      The proposed credit would represent a continuation of IDA's
support to an effective financial intermedia-y -- the main instrument in
Rwanda for developing the private sector and, particularly, the SSE sector
-- to help it continue prwviding term financing to well-designed
development projects. Specifically, the objectives of this project are:
(a)  to assist BRD as it moves more forcefully
into the areas of SSE and agricultural lending, two
sectors essential to the development of Rwanda;
(b)  to improve BRD's economic evaluation of projects;
(c)  to provide the needed foreign exchange resources for
priority capital investments promoted by private
entrepreneurs; and
(d)  to help improve the policy framework for SSEs and to
develop indigeneous entrepreneurial capabilities in
Rwanda;
3.02      The rationale for IDA's involvement in the project is to assist
the Government in developing SSEs, a sector which has the potential to help
solve Rwanda's pressing unemployment problem. IDA's continued assistance
to BRD is also necessary to sustain this institution's effectiveness as it
is going through a major reorientation of its operations towards SSEs and
agriculture.
B. Description and Conditions of the Project
The Proposed Line of Credit to BRD (SDR 8.5 million)
3.03      The proposed IDA credit of SDR 8.5 million would be made to the
Government of Rwanda which would onlend it to BRD under a Subsidiary
Agreement satisfactory to IDA, the signing of which would be a condition of
credit effectiveness.



- 33 -
3.04      The Credit would finance the foreign exchange costs of capital
investments, including initial permanent working capital, in subprojects
approved by BRD. The funds would be available to finance all subprojects
that are within BRD's scope of operations. Of the total amount of
SDR 8.5 million, SDR 4.7 million would be used for financing medium-sized
projects and SDR 3.8 million would be for SSEs, defined as enterprises with
net total assets before the project of less than RwF 30 million
(US$285,000). The maximum loan size for SSE subprojects would be
US$230,000. Subprojects financed will have to be of high economic
priority, be selected by BRD in accordance with its investment strategy and
he justified on the basis of a full economic analysis, including
calculation of the economic rate of return for all non-service sector
projects above US$200,000. SSE projects will be selected and appraised
according to BRD's simplified format.
3.05      Lending Conditions.  The following agreements were reached with
Government and BRD at negotiations:
(i)  Onlending rates and foreign exchange risk fee.  Consistent with
Bank policy for IDF operations, funds for lending to large
enterprises (US$5.0 million) would be passed on by Government to
BRD at IBRD's interest rate in effect at the time of
distribution of credit documents to the EDs. However,
recognizing the higher administrative costs and risks associated
with SSE financing, funds for lending to small enterprises
(US$4.0 million) would be onlent at a lower rate of 7% so as to
afford BRD a greater spread. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by the Government. The average cost of IDA funds for BRD
would be about 8%, compared to about 7% under the third IDA
credit. The 8% average cost of IDA funds to BRD is positive in
real terms as inflation in Rwanda is estimated at about
6.0%-6.5%.
(ii)  BRD's lending rates.  BRD's present interest rate structure
(Basic Data), which consists of six rates differentiated 'y term
(medium- and long-term loans) and sector (agriculture, including
livestock, industry and services), would be further simplified.
There would be only two rates: one for the productive sectors
which BRD agreed to set at 12+%, and one for services projects
which would be 13+%. These new rates would represent an
increase of 0.5 to 2.5 percentage points over the present rates
and are highly positive in real terms with inflation forecast to
be about 6%-6.5% in the next few years. They would give BRD ar.
average spread of about 5% which is necessary to cover
administrative costs and make adequate provisions. ERD's level
of interest rates would be reviewed with IDA at least once a
year to ensure that they remain positive in real terms and that
the resulting spread is adequate for BRD's continued financial
soundness and profitability.
(iii)  Commitment charge.  As under the previous IDA credits, BRD would
pay to Government a commitment charge of 0.75% from the
respective dates of subproje't approval by IDA.



- 34 -
3.06      Free limit.  The free limit for individual subprojects would be
increased from US$200,000 under the third IDA credit to US$300,000 in
recognition of the good quality of BRD's appraisals. The aggregate free
limit would be US$3.5 million, or 39% of the total amount of the Credit.
As all SSE subloans would be below that free limit, IDA would review in
detail the first 10 SSE subprojects submitted by BRD.
3.07      Amortization schedule.  In conformity with the normal Bank Group
lending policy to DFCs, funds for lending to large enterprises (US$5.0
million) would have a flexible amortization schedule that would
substantially conform with the aggregate of the amortization schedules of
the subloans approved by BRD and financed under the proposed credit,
subject to a maximum of 15 years, including a grace period not to exceed
five years. Given the large number of small loans expected to be financed
under the SSE component, the portion of the credit onlent to BRD for this
purpose (US$4.0 million) would have a fixed amortization schedule of 10
years, including five years of grace, starting from the date of credit
effectiveness.
3.08      Commitment period.  The funds would be available for commitment
by BRD until December 31, 1988.
3.09      Debt/equity ratio.  The limit on BRD's debt/equity ratio would
remain at 3:1.
C. Total Project Costs
3.10      As discussed in paras. 2.50 and 2.51, total subloan commitments
by BRD during the period covered by this project are estimated at US$28.5
million, of which US$18.9 million would be in foreign exchange. In the
past, BRD financed on average about 50% of the total investment cost of
large projects and about 80% of the cost of SSE projects. Thus, the
US$28.5 million forecast commitments would result in about US$53 million of
investments. As in the past, projects financed under this proposed credit
are expected to show high economic and financial rates of return.
D. Project Implementation
Reporting Requirements
3.11      As it was done under previous IDA credits, BRD would be requested
to submit to IDA quarterly reports, which would include, inter alia,
financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears, collection
targets and results obtained and notes on major projects in difficulty,
including the conclusions and recommendations of BRD's supervision staff.
Annual reports and audited annual accounts prepared by qualified
accountants acceptable to IDA will be submitted to IDA within six months
after the end of the year. BRD would also submit a draft Project
Completion Report when the project is completed.



- 35 -
Procurement and Disbursement
3.12      Procurement for the subprojects financed would be in accordance
with BRD's procedures which require clients to submit at least three
quotations. These procedures are adequate for the size of procurement
packages expected.
3.13      Proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed as follows:
(i)  100% of the cif cost of goods and services for eligible
subprojects;
(ii)  80% of the cost of previously imported equipment purchased
locally for the subprojects;
(iii)  70% of the cost of equipment produced in Rwanda from imported
components and raw materials; and 65% of the local cost of
construction works included in subprojects and carried out by
locally based contractors.
3.14      Special Account.  To expedite disbursement of funds, a special
account would be set up at BNR or other financial institution acceptable to
IDA into which Ir. would make an initial deposit of US$300,000 equivalent
from the proposed credit immediately after effectiveness. This amount
represents an estimated average disbursement of funds over a three-month
period. The account would be replenished when funds are below US$150,000.
Its establishment was discussed and agreed with BRD and Government at
negotiations.
3.15      Disbursem2nts and Documentation:  Withdrawal of subloan funds not
exceeding US$25,000 would be made out of the special account on the basis
of statements of expenditure (SOE's). The documentation for withdrawals
made under SOEs would be reviewed by supervision missions and by
independent auditors. Disbursement of funds for subloan withdrawals in
excess of US$25,000 could also be made from this account, but will be fully
documented to the Bank. The projected disbursement schedule is shown in
Annex 22 and is based on the disbursement profile for IDF projects in
Eastern and Southern Africa Region, but modified to reflect the experience
of the relatively fast disbursing first and second BRD credits.
Disbursements are expected to be completed over seven and a half years, by
December 31, 1993.



- 36 -
E. Benefits and Risks
3.16      The proposed project would provide term investment resources to
help the development of Rwanda's private sector and particularly SSEs. It
is expected that the US$9 million Credit would support investments
totalling about US$15.0 million and would help create more than 1,500 new
jobs in the Rwanda economy at an average cost per job of US$10,000. The
project would enable IDA to continue supporting BRD, the major term lender
in Rwanda, in its efforts to assist small enterprises. Continued IDA
support would also enhance BRD's capability to mobilize additional foreign
exchange resources from other lenders and enable it to play a more
significant role in the development of Rwanda economy. Finally, the
project would play an important role in initiating a dialogue with the
Government on the reform of the tariff structure and in improving the
policy framework for SSEs.
3.17      The main risk in this project relates to the possible
deterioration of BRD's arrears position. This risk is, however, limited
because (i) BRD has developed a sound program for assisting the SSE sector,
the first phase of which has yielded encouraging results; and (ii) BRD has
already initiated actions to deal with its two major problem projects and
additional measures are proposed in the context of this project to improve
its collection performance, which will be closely monitored by IDA. This
should ensure that BRD will remain an effective term lending institution
that promotes economically justified investment projects.

IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
4.01      This report recommends an IDA credit of SDR 8.5 (US$ 9.0
million), to be onlent to BRD for financing the foreign exchange cost of
its subloans.
4.02      At negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(a) From Government that it will:
(i) review with IDA by July 1, 1986 the recommendations of the
tariff study including the proposed timetable for
introducing changes (para. 1.17);
(ii)  onlend to BRD the line of credit on the conditions specified
in para. 3.05; and
(iii)  establish a special account at the central bank or other
bank acceptable to IDA to facilitate disbursement of the
credit funds (para. 3.14).
(b) From BRD that it will:
(i) set targets for improving its collection ratios and submit
the results obtained to IDA (para. 2.39);
(ii)  onlend the proceeds of this credit at terms and conditions
specified in para. 3.05(ii);
(iii) review regularly with IDA the level of its interest rates to
ensure that they remain competitive and positive in real
terms and that its spread is adequate to ensure continued
financial soundness and profitability (para. 3.05(ii));
(iv)  continue to have its accounts audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and furnish to IDA certified
copies of its audited financial statements along with its
annual reports within six months after the end of each
fiscal year (paras. 2.17 and 3.13);
(v) continue to maintain its debt/equity ratio below the 3:1
limit (para. 3.09); and
(vi)  submit to IDA a draft Project Completion Report when the
project is completed (para. 3.11).
(c) Condition of Effectiveness: Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
(para. 3.03).

Performance of Selected SSE Subprojects
Below is a summary on the performance of SSE projects, selected
at random, which BRD has financed under the previous IDA lines of credit.
Most of them have only recently been implemented but so far, their status
seems sound and they show positive results. However, specific financial
information was for most of then not yet available.
IMPRIPARWA: US$61,250 subloan
(71% of US$86,750 total cost)
IMPRIPARWA is one of 12 printing firms in the country, of which
four are large, five medium and two quite small. With a total project cost
of US$86,750, the company was established in 1984, and belongs in the
"small" category. IHPRIPARWA is a new project which started its business
after receiving the machinery financed from BRD/IDA proceeds. During the
first 6 months of operation, total sales amounted to US$55,000 equivalent,
resulting in a value added of US$37,000 equivalent and a gross profit of
U$13,000 equivalent, thus exceeding all expectation at the time of
subproject appraisal. IMPRIPARWA is doing well as the market for its
products I/ is steadily growing. Clients are equally divided between
Government and private firms.  Being profitable with a return on equity
estimated by BRD at 18% in 1984, the company already applied for an
expansion with BRD to finance an offset printer.
The company was formed by three individuals, two of whom were
previously printing instructors with the Rwandese army. IMPRIPARWA is one
of the very few companies in Rwanda, which works two shifts. Thirteen
people are employed with an average cost per job of approximately US$6,700
equivalent. This subproject is problem free and well-managed.
1/ printing of administrative documents, accounting sheets, invitation
and business cards, music notes, etc.

Usine de pates alimentaires: US$32,300 Subloan
(60% of total US$53,000 project cost)
The usine de pates alimentaires is, apart from a few artisans,
the only noodle producer in the country. The promoter, a former high
Government official is a rather wealthy businessman with additional
commercial activities in Kigali. He started the noodle production in late
1983, which now faces strong import competition. Operating at 50% of
capacity, the production process utilizes eggs and water (apart from
electricity and labour) as local ingredients while flour is imported.
Already highly protected with import duties of 100%, retail
prices of imported noodles (RwF 188 for 500 grams) dropped below ex-factory
prices (RwF 200 for 500 grams) in the course of project execution, which
caused the promoter to ask for higher protection. It is questionable
whether he will reach the efficiency of larger scaled noodle production of
his European competitors. The project's profitability has declined to 7%
of total sales partly because the expected switch of local comsumers from
foreign brands to the local brand has not yet materialized, apart from the
fact that noodles do not constitute part of the traditional Rwandese
nutritional base.
SOREVERWA (Soci4tE de Rgparation et d'Entretien de Vehicules au Rwanda):
US$102,000 Subloan
(68% of total US$150,500 project cost)
This large garage and repair shop (40 employees) operates in the
industrial park of Kigali. The BRD loan helped finance the foreign
exchange portion of an expansion program undertaken in 1984 to construct a
welding workshop, a body repair shed and housing for engine and
transmission maintenance 2,. Despite many competitors in the vehicle
repair service, the project is highly profitable, even though receivables
are at times overly large, as about 70% of the firm's clients are
Governmental agencies, which pay unduly late.
A portion af the credit was used to construct a reception area,
which was not part of the original plan and is probably unnecessary. With
a closer cooperation between BRD and its clients during the implemenration
period of the project this type of inadequate application of funds (and
deviation from original intentions) will be avoided in the future.
2/ Exclusively carried out with imported construction material.

Annex 20
Hotel - Bar - Restaurant GAPARAYI:  US$102,900 Subloan
(40% of total US$257,350 project cost)
This subloan was to finance the foreign exchange component of a
20 room hotel with adjacent bar and restaurant in the commercial center of
Kigali. The promoter is a self-made man who started out with
transportation services and commercial activities. Expanding the business
gradually, he owned several years later the best bar-restaurant in Kigali,
which he sold at the right moment in 1980. The hotel caters to the regular
Rwandese businessmen with an occupancy rate close to 100%.
The promoter is a good entrepreneur who designed and built the
hotel himself. As owner-manager, he seems to be exceptionally
enterprising. Financially, the project, which is closely supervised by
BRD, produces a 15Z financial rate of return. It will most likely
maintain its high occupancy rate even once fully completed, because of
steadily increasing business.

RWAKINA Subproject
Project Cost Estimated at
Appraisal (9/80):                RwF 148.4 million PLUS FF 23 million.
Actual Project Cost (10/83):   RuF 294.1 million PLUS FF 25.4 million.
BRD Loan Amount:                 RwF 211.0 million.
BRD Loan Outstanding (12/84):  RwF 206.0 million.
The RWAKINA project was conceived in 1973 to use cinchona rinds
to produce quinine sulphate and other pharmaceutical products. The project
was to be set up ia the Cyangugu province of Rwanda near Lake Kivu, an area
of intense cinchona production. An agreement to that effect was reached
between the Rwandese Government and ISOCHEM of France for the establishment
of RWAKINA. The company was set up in September 1960 with a paid in equity
base of RwF 225 million (US$2.4 million), of which 49% was local. ISOCHEM
was retained to implement the project by (i) building the factory, (ii)
supplying the equipment, (iii) managing the enterprise, and (iv) purchasing
the output.
The total cost of the project was estimated at appraisal in 1980
to amount to RwF 148.4 million (US$1.6 million) in local currency as well
as FF 23 million (US$2.8 million) in foreign exchange. To finance the
project, BRD lent RWAKINA RwF 211 million (US$2.3 million), 98% of which
was outstanding as of 2ecember 31, 1984. Construction started in February
1982 and the factory began operations in August 1983. The actual cost of
the project was RwF 294.1 million in local currency plus FF 25.4 million
which if ccaverted at exchange rates prevailing in August 1983 resulted in
a cost overrun of 43%.
Production began in August 1983 and during the next three months,
four tons of quinine sulphate was produced. The company then ran into
difficulties, briefly summarised as follows:
(i) The large cost overrun and the depreciation of the Rwandese franc
vis-A-vis the French franc caused the company to become
overleveraged thus straining the financial base of the new company
and preventing it from yielding a profit;

Annex 21
Page 2
(ii)  The managemei - of the company was inept and unsatisfactory, and
this was worsened by the fact that the Administrateur-Dclegue
seconded by ISOCHEM was non-resident, prefering to pay brief
visits to the factory from his base in France. In addition, the
fact that this manager was concurrently Deputy General Manager of
ISOCHEM made that company simultaneously the managers, the
suppliers and the clients of RWAKINA, with all the ominous
implications this arrangement carried for RWAKINA. The technical
management of the plant was also suspect.
(iii)  In July 1983, just as the new company was coming on stream, there
were problems with the acquisition of essential inputs: (a) the
supply of methyl benzene was interrupted; and (b) the output of
cinchona used in the appraisal turned out to be substantially
overestimated and the production level was only enough to supply
about a third of the factory's cinchona needs. In addition,
marketing of cinchona in Rwanda was poorly organized, and the
Government-determined price of RwF 110 kg was too high to make
RWAKINA's production profitable. 1/
(iv)  The appraised market share for RWAKINA's maximum proposed output
(8.3%) far exceeded the market share held to date by ISOCHEM (6%).
Also, despite the relatively lower priced quinine sulphate from
RWAKINA, the strength of the market leaders 2/ prevented ISOCHEM
from making siginificant headway on the world market with a
pharmaceutical drug prodtuced by a new and unproven company -
RWAKINA.
As a result of these problems, operations at RWAKINA came to a
halt on November 15, 1983, three months after the factory opened.
Obviously the company's financial position at this time was such that
substantial equity infusion was necessary. The shareholders however agreed
to additional equity subscription totalling only RwF 34 million.
In August 1984, BRD reexamined the project's feasibility and
concluded that even if the management was rendered efficient and the supply
of inputs available, at least RwF 236.8 million in supplementary funding
was needed before operations could resume. This was made up of (RwF
million):
Overdue and Immediately Payable Debts             104.2
Working Capital Supplies                          114.6
Plant Inspection, Cleaning etc.                    18.0
RwF  236.8 million
1/ Cichona produced in Zaire and smuggled into Rwanda was then selling at
RwF 55 to 60 per kg.
2/ Three companies (Boehringer Mannheim of West Germany, ACF of Holland
and BKF of Indonesia) held 71% of the world market and were steadily
capturing the rest.



- 63 -
Annex 21
Page 3
To finance this there was available working capital of RwF 80 million.
Consultations between suppliers, the Government, shareholders and
financiers also resulted in substantial rescheduling of RWAKINA's overdue
indebtedness to BRD (RwF 28.6 million), Banque de Kigali (RwF 11.3
million), the Treasury (RwF 7.8 million), ISOCHEM (RwF 9.4 million), the
Banque Nationale de Paris (RwF 29.3 million) and other suppliers
(RwF 14.3 million'. These however still left RwF 22.1 million unfunded,
and it was agreed to use available standby suppliers' credits totalling
RwF 70 million for this purpose.
BRD's review of the project revealed that although RWAKINA's debt
burden was heavy, the goodwill demonstrated so far by all the participants
was salutary. Also, while the project's FRR was now negative, the
incremental FRR was positive and satisfactory, given the high sunk cost
level. Before the project could resume with any chance of success however,
the following conditions need to be satisfied:
(i) establishment of a price stabilization fund for cinchona rinds;
(ii)  organization of a purchasing system for cinchona;
(iii) notarization of the real estate offered as guarantee for the
largest loan (BRD's RwF 211 million);
(iv)  appointment of an effective Directeur General by the Board and
the termination of the non-resident Administrateur-Delegue;
Cv) certification that the factory is technically operable;
(vi)  update of the accounting and financial records of RWAKINA;
(vii) written agreement of creditors to the reschedulings negotiated;
(viii)  signature of marketing, technical assistance and management
agreements; and
(ix)  agreement with a local bank for export credits and for overdraft
facilities to meet RWAKINA's needs.
These conditions were proposed by BRD and are the subject of ongoing
discu                      _ _:ipants.
