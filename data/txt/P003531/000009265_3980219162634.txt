VOLUME I: EXECUTIVE SUMINIARY
INTRODUCTION
The Henan Provincial Power Grid, an element of the Central China Power Grid, possesses an
installed capacity of 5,492 megawatts (MW) between 11 thermoelectric and one hydroelectric
station. Power load is expected to increase threefold over the next decade as economic growth in
Henan keeps pace with that in the rest of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).
The Electric Power of Henan (EPH) has developed a comprehensive expansion plan to meet the
rising demand. As part of this plan, EPH has sought and received approval from the PRC
Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) to assess the feasibility of constructing a coal-fired power
plant, known as the Qinbei Power Plant Project, in Wulongkou Township, Jiyuan, northwestem
Henan province. The EPH is proposing World Bank financing for the first phase of the project
(Phase I) which consists of two 600 MW units and an associated 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission
line for bulk transfer of power to the Henan Provincial Power Grid. The subsequent phases (II
and III) of the project call for the construction of two additional pairs of 600 MW units, to
achieve a final design size of 6x600 MW. The World Bank has classified the Qinbei Power Plant
Project as Category A. Therefore a comprehensive environmental assessment will be prepared in
accordance with Operational Directive (OD) 4:01 guidelines.
In accordance with the Thermal Power Plant Project Preparatory Stage Environmental Protection
Regulation (MOE, 1989), the EPH, with the assistance of the Northwest Electric Power Design
Institute (NWEPDI), prepared an environmental assessment of the first phase of the Qinbei Power
Plant Project, submitting the document to both the MOEP and World Bank in 1993. The 1993
NWEPDI Environmental Assessment was approved by the MOEP for the 2x600 MW size, and
submitted to the National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with the PRC
Environmental Protection Law of 1989.
After the 1993 EA submittal, the proposed mixture of coal for the Qinbei plant was modified at
the request of PRC authorities in order to lower the average sulfur content. This change, as well
as the World Bank's interest in the assessment of impacts arising from the project's final design
size of 3600 MW, led to the preparation of a modified EA, which was submitted to the Bank in
1994. Continuing World Bank concern regarding potential environmental issues led to the
ES-I



14435CIES-2
0/1 1/95
recommendation that the EPH contract an international consultant skilled in the preparation of
environmental assessment reports according to World Bank standards. In this manner, the World
Bank seeks assurance that the project's potential for adverse impacts to the natural resources and
human populations of Henan Province are identified and appropriate measures taken to reduce
impacts.
This document contains the summary assessments of KBN Engineering and Applied Sciences
regarding environmental impacts of the Qinbei project and recommended mitigating actions. The
report is divided into volumes I and II addressing the power plant and transmission line
respectively.
DESCRTPTION OF THE PROJECT AND AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
The proposed Qinbei Power Plant site is located in northwestern Henan province at 175 to
185 meter (m) elevation, near the south face of the Taihang Mountain escarpment. The proposed
site is adjacent to the Qinbei station of the Jiozhi railway, which assures ready access to the
enormous coal deposits of Shanxi Province to the north.
The plant is a coal-fired thermal power plant, which in Phase I is comprised of two units, each
with a sub-critical, drum-type boiler, single shaft condensing turbine and 600 MW generator,
sharing a single 240-m stack. The plant's design coal is a blend. in the ratio of 1 part bituminous,
2 parts lean and I part washed middlings, having an aggregate sulfur and ash content of
0.41 percent and 24.95 percent, respectively. Emission controls consist of electrostatic
precipitators with an efficiency of 99.6 percent for removal of dust from flue gas emissions.
The plant will employ a recirculating water system for cooling, with a single, hyperbolic, natural
draft cooling tower for each pair of 600 MW units. Makeup water will be obtained from two
wellfields near the Qin River, located below the Qin River valley upstream of Wulongkou
Township and Jiyuan City, and which also includes the Qin River buried alluvial plain
downstream of Wulongkou. Tlese two zones are referred to collectively as the Wulongkou
Aquifer.
Qinbei is located within the warm, temperate, arid zone of north central China, which receives an
average of 629 millimeters (mm) precipitation and 1564 mm evaporation per year. The proposed
ES-2



14435CIE53
041111X95
site is on uninhabited, rocky, sparsely vegetated land that lies above the irrigated agricultural
areas of the Loess Plain to the south, and the ro.ky, steep escarpments of the Taihang Mountains
to the north. No intact vegetative communities exist on the site, or within the immediate vicinity
of the plant.
The boundaries of two Category C Forest Department protected areas, the Taihangshan and
Baisongling, are within 10 to 15 km of the proposed power plant site. Category C has the lowest
protective status within the three-tiered system employed in the PRC, and designates areas that
were created to conserve ecosystems within each province that are representative of the area's
original floral and faunal communities. The Baisongling and Taihangshan protected areas are
located entirely within the Taihang Mountains.
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMIPACTS AN) RECOMMIENrDED ACTIONS OR
MITIGATION MEASURES
Air Resources
Principal impacts to air resources were identified in terms of
*    the incremental effect of power plant pollutants on background air quality,
-    actual anticipated effects to human and ecological health resulting from predicted pollutant
concentrations, and
-    comparison of predicted pollutant concentrations to PRC, World Bank and other published
guidelines.
Values for ground-level concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and Total Suspended
Particulates (SOn, NO,, and TSP) due to power plant emissions were predicted using USEPA-
approved modeling methodologies that incorporate data representing worst-case atmospheric
conditions. These conditions will occur at nighttime with wind speeds under three knots,
circumstances that should occur with a frequency of 6.3 percent or less. Information regarding
background air quality was obtained from prior monitoring programs conducted by the EPH in
the lowland, populated areas to the south of the proposed site. Effects on human and ecological
health are assessed by comparing the predicted pollution concentrations to research findings
available in public literature. Air quality standards to which modeled pollutant concentration
values were compared to World Bank and PRC Grade I and 11 annual and 24-hour averages. The
PRC Grades I and 11 are applicable to ecologically sensitive areas and for assuring human health
ES-3



144)5C/ES-4

and welfare respectively. Since PRC air quality standards are much stricter than those of the
World Bank-, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards are also
included to provide an added perspective to interpretation of the project's impacts to air quality.
Summary findings are presented below. Note that findings presented are based on 1 year's
meteorological data adapted from Asheville, North Carolina.
*    No adverse impact to human health or important natural communities is expected due to
incremental SO2 and NO, contributions to local air quality from the Qinbei Power Plant.
*    Review of 1993-1994 monitoring data for TSP and SO2 indicates that background TSP
concentrations of non-point, non-industrial origins are frequently in excess of the Annual
and 24-hour standards of the World Bank, PRC and USEPA in the populated, lowland
areas. Concentrations of SO2 are less than 50 jg/m3, which classifies the area as
"unpolluted" according to World Bank guidelines for this pollutant.
e    The maximum incremental contribution of the Qinbei Power Plant to lowland TSP
concentrations will be less than 12 percent of the maximum background values, according
to modeling results. This corresponds to a background of 404 jig/m3 and a contribution of
45 pg/m3 24-hour averages for 6x600 MW.
*    Emissions rates for S02 and PM are well within World Bank standards (500 TPD and
100 fg/m3 respectively).
*    World Bank air quality standards for SO2 or NO, annual and 24-hour averages are not
exceeded in any lowland, populated area or in either of the two protected areas at either the
2x600 MW or 6x600 MW sizes. 1
*    Predicted ground-level concentrations of SO, and NO, are well within PRC Class II annual
and 24-hour standards for lowland populated areas at both 2x600 MW and 6x600 MW
sizes, although PRC Class II 1-hour standards are exceeded at 6x600 MW.
*    PRC Class I air quality standards may be exceeded within the two protected areas for both
SO, annual and 24-hour, and NO. 24-hour averages at both the 2x600 and 6x600 MW
sizes. As previously stated, no damage to vegetation or wildlife is expected based on
literature review of exposure effects on similar organisms.
*    Thouglh World Bank noise criteria (dBA) are exceeded at some locations within the plant at
both Phase I and Phase II sizes, the noise levels drop sharply outside the plant's boundary
and will not affect local populations.

Recommended follow-up actions include:
*    The collection of comprehensive meteorological data at the Qinbei site for at least I year,
which will allow more accurate modeling and prediction of pollutant concentrations and
impacts prior to initiation of Phases II and III.
*    The monitoring of atmospheric SO. and TSP concentrations on the elevated terrain north of
the Qinbei site, in order to validate modeling results and obtain long-term data.
*    Inventory of plant species on the Taihano Mountains to assure that the endemic, rare
species Taihangia rupestris does not occur within the zone of maximum impact from
atmospheric pollutants.
Alternatives considered include:
*    Location of the power plant at the alternative Niezhang site, which was rejected because of
predicted increases in concentration of atmospheric pollutants within the Baisongling
protected area.
*    Flue gas desulfurization (FGD), which was rejected as an immediate option since World
Bank emission standards are not exceeded, adverse local impacts are not anticipated, and
FGD is a costly control technology. It is recommended that sufficient space be reserved
within the power block layout to accommodate FGD in case this option is required at a
future date.
*     Other combustion and emission control SO, and NO, control technologies, which may be
required based on repeat modeling employing the comprehensive meteorological data
mentioned above.
Impacts to Water Resources
The environmental assessment identifies four potential areas of concern to water resources that
arise from:
*   Withdrawal of groundwater from the Wulongkou Aquifer for cooling-system makeup,
*   Discharge of plant wastewater streams to the Baijan River bed,
*   Siting of the ash disposal area in the Qin River floodplain, and
*   Leaching of pollutants from ash piles into groundwater.
The demand for makeup water is 3.864 cubic meters per hour (m3/h) and 11,592 m3/h [3.22 cubic
meters per second (m3/s)] at the 2x600 MW and 6x600 MW sizes respectively, for which the
ES-5



14435C/ES-6
0411l/95
Qinbei project has received approval from the Henan Water Conservation Survey Bureau
(HWCSB). The HWCSB based their approval on assessments conducted by the National Mlineral
Reserve Commission (NMRC), who characterized the aquifer as "large" and capable of
supporting withdrawals up to 6.0 m3/s. Additional modeling studies were conducted by the
Henan Electric Power and Design Institute (HEPSDI) to predict drawdown on the Wulongkou
Aquifer that may result from withdrawal at the 3.22 m3 rate needed by the 3600 MW phase of the
Qinbei project. The model indicates that the aquifer could withstand withdrawals at these rates, at
least over the 150 day period considered during the study. However the modeling did not extend
beyond the 150-day period, and did not take rainfall recharge or the complex nature of the aquifer
into account.
The scope of modeling conducted to date will therefore be expanded to consider effects beyond
150 days, the target aquifer's complexity in terms of the number, areal extent and hydrological
characteristics of the various water-bearing and confining layers, plus the generally positive
effects of infiltration recharge from both rainfall and the Qin River.
The HWCSB modeling, and the supporting NMRC groundwater survey, may in fact be of
sufficient scope to validate the proposed withdrawal rate. although this could not be determined at
the time of the KBN environmental assessment.
A separate consideration results from the discharge of industrial wastewater and cooling tower
blowdown to the Baijan riverbed. The hourly estimated volume of wastewater and treated
sanitary effluent is 692 m3/h for 2x600 I,IW, and 2.076 m3/h for 6x600 MW; including cooling
tower blowdown, ash wetting runoff, plant drains, domestic wastewater, gland seal cooling water,
and coal sluice wastewater. All effluent streams will be treated in order to bring water quality
into compliance with PRC Class 11 Integrated Industrial Wastewater Standards prior to disposal.
The proposed disposal method is discharge to the Baijan riverbed. Since the Baijan is dry over
90 percent of the year, the proposed disposal method is essentially a discharge to groundwater
that is upgradient of the Qinbei welltield. The primary parameter of concern resulting from the
introduction of wastewater is high dissolved solids.
Finally, coal ash leachate may contain heavy metal ions that can represent a low-grade source of
environmental contamination to groundwater. In the case of the Qinbei Power Plant, ash for the
ES-6



14435CIES-7
CM 14/95
2x600 MW facility will be trucked to a 117 hectare disposal yard located on the Qin River
floodplain at a distance of 4 km from the power plant site. Ash absorption tests conducted by the
NWEPDI indicates that the ash pile will be wet only to a depth of 0.6 m, even during the historic
maximum rainfall events. Since ash will be ramped to a height of 11 m, little direct risk is
believed to exist to ground water resources as a result of leaching. Despite this situation, the
highly permeable sand and cobble of the Qin River floodplain, and the abundance of shallow
groundwater argue for the implementation of leachate containment measures.
Recommended mitigations to protect groundwater resources include:
*   The introduction of a liner for the ash disposal yard that will assure impermeability of
at least 10' centimeters per second (cmls). Final ash yard design may include either
compacted clay or membrane type liners, pending final determination of cost.
*   The installation and operation of monitoring wells outside the perimeter and liner of
the ash yard to assure that leachate is not penetrating the impermeable barrier and
contaminating local groundwater.
Recommended actions needed to identify potential impacts to water resources with greater
precision include:
-   In-depth review of supporting studies to assure that the aquifer's complexity has been
properly accounted for,
*   As deemed necessary by the above assessment of the adequacy of background studies,
employ 3-D models for complex aquifers (e.g. MODFLOW) to better characterize the
impacts of groundwater withdrawals,
*   Modeling to identify any risk to the Wulongkou Aquifer posed by wastewater
discharge,
*   Water conservation measures within the plant,
*   Study to characterize any potential risk for upstream flooding posed by the ashyard's
location in the Qin River floodplain, and
*   Collection of supplementary data regarding aquatic biota of the Qin River to verify
presence or absence of significant resources.
Following review of NMRC background studies, additional modeling using three dimensional
groundwater flow may be deemed necessary to better characterize the degree of risk posed by
ES-7

groundwater withdrawal rates of the proposed magnitude. Trhe model will be equivalent to the
MODFLOW program developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The modeling
will be conducted prior to the installation of production wells, and will incorporate recharge from
rainfall and the Qin River as well as address any effects the multi-layered nature of the subsurface
may have on the percolation and lateral movement of groundwater within and around the source.
The model will assess both the 2x600 MW and 6x600 MW cases.
With regards to wastewater discharge, additional modeling will be conducted prior to initiation of
plant operations to assure that no adverse impacts will occur to either the Wulongkou Aquifer or
surrounding groundwater resources. A three-dimensional groundwater transport model such as
FLOWPATH, MOC or MT3D will be used to assess the potential migration of contaminants
discharge to the subsurface, and their impacts on the target resources.
Additional water conservation measures will be implemented which will serve to reduce overall
water consumption by 5 to 10 percent. These measures include the use of cooling tower
blowdown for cooling pump glands and other applications, the installation of supplementary drift
eliminators to reduce drift from the cooling tower, and the implementation of comprehensive and
continuous auditing system for water consumption practices.
Finally, close attention will be given to the potential for increased upstream flooding as a result of
siting the ash disposal yard in the Qin River. Attention will focus initially on studies prepared by
EPH that may quantify potential for upstream flood impact. If not sufficient, additional field
assessment will be performed. Compensatory floodwater storage areas will be created as part of
the Qinbei Power Plant project if significant risk is identified as a result of the study.
WATER MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES
Water quality management alternatives that were considered include:
*   Water sources other than the Wulongkou Aquifer,
*   Discharge scenarios, including direct discharge to the Qin river and zero discharge
technologies,
*   Ash disposal site locations, including one potential site to the northwest of the Qinbei
site.
ES-8



14435C/ES-9
041/ 1/95
No alternative to the Wulongkou Aquifer is readily identifiable as a water source for the Qinbei
Power Plant, since no other aquifer of sufficient size or proximity has been identified. Storage of
surface water from the Qin River would require the construction of a dam that would require
inundation of a large area, a course of action that would carry significant risk of adverse
environmental impact in its own right.
One alternative to the discharge of wastewater into the Baijan riverbed is to direct effluent to the
Qin River via pipeline or canal, where flow and dilution would occur most of the year to reduce
impacts. The adaptation of zero discharge technology is an alternative to either of the two
proposed discharge location. However capital costs for such systems are typically twice the cost
of conventional systems and significant energy penalties also apply during plant operation for final
processing of briny waste to solid state. Therefore if modeling indicates high risk associated with
the Baijan discharge, the Qin river discharge will be adapted as the alternative of choice.
An alternative ash disposal site, northwest of the power plant, was considered. However the
site's location upstream of the Qin River and upgradient from the Wulongkou wellfield introduces
risk of overflow and leachate contamination of these resources. Protection measures sufficient to
assure the security of these water resources would make this site far more expensive than the
proposed site, which is the preferred alternative.
SOCTO-CULTURAL RESOURCES
There are no identified socio-cultural resources within the Qinbei Power Plant construction area of
impact. The principal impact of concern relates to the volume of truck traffic between the plant
site and the ash disposal yard. The NWEPDI (1994) identifies a volume of 30 trucks per hour
during the 2x600 MW size, which increases to 90 trucks per hour during Phase IL. Impacts
associated with this high volume of traffic include the release of significant amounts of engine
exhaust and fugitive dust within close proximity to villages along the route, plus safety issues
associated with pedestrians, bicycles and other users of the road.
Recommended mitigation for this impact is the routing of ash disposal roads away from any
population center and the use of larger capacity trucks that will reduce the number of trips to 13
and 39 per hour for 2x600 MW and 6x600 MW facilities, respectively. The trucks will
furthermore be limited to daytime operation and will wet and cover ash cargo to reduce dust. If
ES-9



14435C/ES- 10
04/1 1/95
transport roads cannot be routed away from population centers, alternative ash transportation
technologies will be implemented such as the establishment of a temporary ash disposal pile to
reduce dependency on frequent truck traffic, the use of large vehicles to reduce the number of
trips, or the use of a dust-free conveyor belt.
EPH has informed the local public of the proposed power plant development. In a meeting held
on March 8, 1993, in the Wulongkou Township Meeting Hall, local residents met with EPH and
EPA authorities. Given the opportunity to express their viewpoints, the villagers expressed a
desire to see the project succeed, since no revenue was being realized from current land uses.
During an informal meeting held in Wulongkou Township on February 12, 1995, villagers again
expressed enthusiasm for the project's realization before EPH, Jiyuan City, and KBN personnel.

1.0 BACKGROUND
Electric Power of Henan (EPH) has received approval from the Ministry of Electric Power
(MOEP) to assess the feasibility of constructing a 6x600 megawatt (MW), coal-fired power plant
named the Qinbei Power Plant. The plant will be located in Wulongkou Township, Jiyuan City,
in northwestern Henan province. The EPH is proposing World Bank financing for the first phase
of project, which consists of a 2x600 MW unit and an associated 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission
line. The World Bank is tentatively proposing an April 1995 appraisal date for the loan project,
and a 1996 construction start-up.
This document contains the summary assessments of potential environmental impacts arising from
the proposed project. Impacts are reviewed in terms of the initial 2x600-MW World Bank
financed project (Phase I) as well as the final design size of 6x600 MW (Phase 111). The report is
structured in two main sections that address the Qinbei Power Plant and the associated 500 kV
transmission line independently. Each report section is divided into chapters that present
i.  Descriptions of the policy, legal, and administrative framework for the project and
project description,
2.  Descriptions of the affected environment,
3.  Characterization of potential impacts arising from construction and operation,
4.  A review of alternatives for the proposed project, and
5.  Recommended actions to mitigate environmental impacts.
1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE ENVIRONNIENTAL ASSESSMENT (EA) MISSION
1.1.1 WORLD BANK TREATMENT OF THERNIAL POWER DEVELOPMENT
The World Bank has established guidelines for ensuring that borrowers have adequately
characterized the environmental impacts of proposed actions, considered alternatives to a proposed
project, developed measures that would mitigate unavoidable impacts, and identified training and
monitoring requirements to assure implementation of those measures. Environmental assessment
(EA) guidelines for the World Bank are specified in the World Bank Operational Directive (OD)
4:01 (1991); which provides general guidance in the preparation of EA reports. Via the
Sourcebook series (1990), OD 4:01 is supported by supplementary guidelines that address sector
specific issues. Specific environmental assessment guidelines exist for thermoelectric projects.
l-l



14435CI 1 -2
03,!9195
Finally, Operational Policyv Notes (OPN) assure treatment of topics of particular importance to the
Bank; including possible impacts to biodiversity, indigenous peoples. wildlands. and wetlands.
During the identification phase, the World Bank screens projects with regards to their potential
for causing adverse envirorunental impacts, assigning the projects to one of three categories: A, B
or C. The Qinbei Power Plant project, like virtually all thermal power projects, was rated as
Category A, meaning that significant potential exists for adverse environmental impacts and that
an EA must always be performed.
1.1.2 EA BY THE NORTHWVEST ELECTRIC POWER DESIGN INSTITUTE (NWEPDI)
AND KBN ENGINEERING AN-D APPLIED SCIENCES, INC. (KBN)
The design of thermal power plants and associated facilities in Henan Province is the
responsibility of the Northwest Electric Power Design Institute (NWEPDI), a public organization
that provides technical assistance services to utilities in several additional provinces as well. The
NWEPDI prepared an EA of the first phase (2x600 MW) of the project, which was approved by
the MOEP in June 1993, and submitted to the World Bank in October of the same year.
Subsequent to changing design coal, and on the basis of World Bank recommendations that
environmental impacts from the final design size of 3,600 MW be considered, a second EA was
prepared by the NWEPDI and submitted in August of 1994 prior to a World Bank pre-appraisal
mission.
Ongoing World Bank concern regarding potential environmental issues led to the involvement of
KBN Engineering and Applied Sciences, Inc. (KBN) in January of 1995. Through KBN
collaboration with EPH and the NWEPDI, the World Bank seeks (inter alia) assurance that:
1. Potential impacts from atmospheric pollution are clearly understood,
2. Proposed levels of groundwater withdrawal are feasible without adverse impacts,
3. Flyash waste disposal issues are adequately addressed,
4. Adequate public participation was sought, and
5. The OPN special topics are addressed.
The objective for KBN's participation is to provide assistance to EPH and NWEPDI in the
preparation of a final EA report that addresses these areas of particular World Bank interest and
allows the timely execution of the Appraisal Mission.

03/13195
A three-person team of KBN scientists traveled to Henan province February 9 through 19, visiting
the Qinbei site and surrounding areas, interviewing local officials and residents, and identifying
additional data through a series of working meetings with EPH and NWEPDI staff.
An updated version of the 1994 EA document (NWEPDI, 1994) was used extensively by the
KBN team as an information reference during EA preparation.
1.1.3 QINBEI POWER PLANT GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE
The potential area of environmental impact is determined by the aggregate scope of construction
and operational impacts.
Construction Impacts
Construction impacts are derived principally from the occupation and alteration of land for power
plant infrastructure, including the switchyard, power block, coal handling facilities, associated
railway and water resource infrastructure, and ash disposal areas. Additional impacts to local
populations can be anticipated in the form of increased road and rail traffic, as well as from the
influx of temporary labor. These impacts were considered within the area encompassed in
Figure 1.1-1).
Onerational Impacts
Operational impacts for thermal power projects can be derived from the discharge of atmospheric
and aquatic pollutants, withdrawal of water from surface and underground sources, and the
generation of other waste streams. These impacts were considered within a range of
15 kilometers (km) surrounding the power plant site.
1.2 ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PRO.TECT
DEVELOPMENT
1.2.1 PRC LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
1.2.1.1 PRC Laws
The principal laws and regulations related to environmental impacts of thermal power plants in
China are provided in Table 1.2-1. According to the Thermal Power Plant Project Preparatory
Stage Environmental Protection Regulation (MOE, 1989) promulgated by the Ministry of Energy
(MOE), an EA is required during the feasibility study stage of project development. For projects

with an investment potential in excess of 200 million yuan (RMB), the EA should be submitted to
MOEP by the main administrative unit of the project. In the case of the Henan Qinbei Power
Plant, this administrative unit is EPH. After previewing the document, MOEP submits the EIS to
the national Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval.
The appropriateness and sufficiency of the environmental mitigation proposed for the facility is
the responsibility of MOEP according to Document DJ No. 131: Acceptance of Regulation for
Thermal Power Plant Environmental Mitigation Devices after Completion (MOEP, 1988). The
organizations responsible for monitoring the impacts associated with the project are determined by
MOEP according to regulations that specify in detail the monitoring organization, personnel,
installations, duties, monitoring parameters, station locations, and monitoring periods,
methodology to be used, among other details.
PRC air and water quality standards are summarized in Tables 1.2-2 and 1.2-3.
1.2.1.2 PRC Environmental Protection Agencies
Environmental protection in China is implemented on three principal levels: national (or state),
provincial, and the municipal (or local). Therefore, there exists a national EPA, provincial EPA,
and an EPA at the local level for the nearest city of significant size. For the Henan Qinbei Power
Project, the relevant environmental protection agencies include the following:
1.  The national EPA,
2.  The Henan provincial EPA,
3.  The Jiozou City EPA (representing the closest city with significant size that has a
fully staffed EPA), and
4.  The Jiyuan City EPA (which apparently serves only to operate intermittent air
monitoring stations).
While the local and provincial EPAs are consulted as part of the EIS process, the ultimate
decision on the approval of the EIS rests entirely with the national EPA. Moreover, the published
environmental regulations provide no detailed guidance on prioritization of impacts and how
decisions on resource use are made. A list of all agencies contacted is the EIS process is
provided in Appendix A.

1.2.2 W 'ORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS
In addition to guidelines referenced in Section 1. 1. 1, the World Bank also has specific industrial

1.3 OINBEI POWN'ER PLANT PRO.JECT
The Qinbei site, approved by the MOEP Design and Planning General Institute, is located in
Wulongkou Township, Jiyuan City, Henan Province. This area borders Shanxi Province to the
north, and is located approximately 140 km northwest of the Provincial Capital of Zhengzou,
60 km northeast of Luoyang, and about 17 km northeast of Jiyuan City (Figure 1.3-1).
The site is within 2.0 km of the south face of the Taihang Mountain escarpment, 4 km north of
the Qin River and adjacent to the Qinbei North railway station. The Jiozho-Kejing highway and
Jiozhi railway pass on the south side of the site, and the seasonal Baijian river drainage passes
along the site's western boundary Figures 1.1-1 and 1.3-2). The Jingluoyang national highway
that passes along the west bank of the Baijan channel is a major transportation artery for Shanxi
coal.

According to NWEPDI (1994), the Henan Provincial Economic Development Planning Bureau
anticipates that energy resources, communications, raw materials industries and non-ferrous
metallurgical sectors will show the strongest development over the next several years. The
document further states that predicted power load in the whole province will be 15,600 MW by
the year 2005, and 22,800 MW by the year 2010. With installed capacity of 1,200 MW planned
for cormrnercial operation by the year 2001, the Qinbei Power Plant is a significant component of
MOEP's plan for alleviating an anticipated energy shortfall.
1.3.2 QINBEI POWER PLANT PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is a condensing-type, coal-fired thermal plant, consisting of two units of 600 MW
each during for the first construction phase, and a final buildout to six units of 600 MW as
approved by the People's Republic of China (PRC) state planning agencies. The layout is in a
three-block mode comprised of the coal-yard, main power building and switchyard arranged in
south-to-north orientation (Figure 1.3-3). The first phase will be constructed on the westernmost
portion of the site, with future expansion occurring in an easterly direction.
1.3.2.1 Fuel
Fuel for the Qinbei Plant will be supplied by rail from mines of the Huozhou, Linfen and Chanzhi
fields in Shanxi Province. Shanxi has the greatest coal resources of any other province in China,
having predicted reserves of 871 billion metric tons (MT) of brown, bituminous, lean, and
anthracite coal types.
According to data presented in NWEPDI (1994), fuel quality has been approximated at this phase
by a mix of 1:2:1 bituminous, lean and washed middlings; plus a mix of 0:2:1 bituminous and
lean and washed middlings for the design, and the checking qualities respectively (Table 1.3-1).
NWEPDI anticipates that 3.46x106 and 1.04x107 MT per year will be consumed by Qinbei at the
Phase 1 1.200 and Phase III 3,600 MW sizes, respectively.
1.3.2.2 Power Block
The main equipment is described by NWEPDI (1994) as:
Boiler:    a sub-critical, single-reheat, drum-type boiler with a maximum rating of 2,020
tons per hour (TPH)

Turhine:    a sub-critical, intermedliate re-heat. single-shaft condensing turbine with four
cylinders and exhausts and a rated output of 600 MW
Generator:  rated output of 600 NM' at 22 kV. with water-hydrogen-hydrogen cooling
1.3.2.3 Water Supplv and Treatment
Makeup Water Svstem
The required amount of makeup water for the Phase I (2x600 M`vW) units is 3,864 cubic meters
per hour (m3/h) [1.07 cubic meters per second (m3/s)] (Table 1.3-2). A water balance for the
proposed plant is provided in Figure 1.3-4; the makeup water amount for Phase III (6x600 MW)
units will be 11,592 m3/h (3.22 m3/s). Makeup water will be supplied from the two linear
wellfields of the Wulongkou Aquifer. One wellfield is located near the villages of Xiyaotou and
Liu along the left bank of Qin River. A reservoir and boost pumphouse will be provided between
Xiyaotou and Liu to store and subsequently boost the makeup water to the power plant area.
Groundwater from the other wellfield near the village of Luzhai will be pumped from the well
directly to the power plant. Cooling tower makeup will be treated initially by a weak acid cation
exchanger and then routed to the cooling tower.
Circulatina Water Svstem
The project will utilize a recirculating cooling water system with a natural draft cooling tower.
The total circulating water flow for Phase I is 143,465 m3/h (40 m3/s), whereas the Phase III
capacity (6x600 MW) will require a circulating flow of 430,395 m'/h (120 m3/s). A unit system
with one cooling tower per each 600 MW generatina unit, as well as one pump house for each
cooling tower will be used. The cooling towers will be the hyperbolic natural draft type, each
with a cooling surface of 9,250 square meters (m2). After evaporative cooling in the tower, the
cooling water will be pumped via circulating water pumps to the condenser in the main power
building to cool the exhaust steam of turbine, after which the heated water will be returned to the
cooling tower.
1.3.2.4 Wastewater Treatment and Disnosal
Two primary wastewater streams will be generated by the Qinbei power plant. The first, referred
to as industrial wastewater. will combine a number of plant effluents and include demineralizer
waste streams, sanitary sewage, oil-contaminated wastewater, washwater from the coal

conveyance system, and coal pile runoff. The second wastewater stream will consist of cooling
tower blowdown.
The power plant industrial wastewater treatment system will handle sanitary wastewater, oily
wastewater, coal handling system wash water, coal pile runoff, and some roof runoff. Industrial
wastewater includes both continuous and intermittent discharges. Continuous discharges consist
of the demineralizer reject wastewater of the boiler makeup and cooling tower makeup water
treatment systems, laboratory wastewater, condensate polishing reject, and the regenerative
wastewater of the circulating water treatment system. Intermittent discharges include boiler acid
cleaning washwater and air preheater flushing water.
Industrial wastewater will be routed to the industrial wastewater treatment plant for collective
treatment. Treated water will be discharged to two 1,000 cubic meter (m3) capacity treated water
ponds for potential reuse. Surplus treated water will be discharged to Baijian River.
Continuous industrial wastewater streams will be treated by pH adjustment, coagulation and
precipitation, and final pH adjustment. Intermittent wastewater streams will also include an
oxidation step as well as pH regulation, coagulation and precipitation, and final pH adjustment.
The boiler acid-cleaning water treatment method will be determined after the acid medium is
proposed by the boiler contractor.
Sanitary wastewater will be pumped by sewage pump to the sanitary wastewater treatment station
for treatment. This wastewater will be subjected to primary and secondary treatment using the
biological contact oxidation method. Treated sanitary wastewater will be discharged to the treated
water ponds for potential reuse or discharge to the Baijian River.
Oily wastewater will be pumped by a sump pump to the oil-contaminated wastewater treatment
station for treatment by a forced air flotation unit. The treated water then will be routed to the
treated water ponds for reuse or discharge to the Baijian River.
Any sludges generated by these wastewater treatment systems will be thickened and dewatered to
make sludge cake and subsequently trucked to the ash disposal yard.

The coal handling system washwater and coal pile runoff will be routed into a settling pond for
coagulation and precipitation prior to discharge to the Baijian River.
Roof runoff from the main power building and other large structures on the site will be collected
by rainwater piping and discharged directly to Baijian River. Blowdown from the circulating
water system also will be discharged to the river.
The hourly estimated volume of non-cooling wastewater and treated sanitary effluent is 350 m3/h
for 2x600 MW (919 m3/s), and 1,050 m3/h for 6x600 MW (2,756 m3/s).
Cooling Water Treatment and Disposal
In order to control the growth of microbes and bacteria-algae; sodium bichloride will be applied
to the cooling water circulation system. The dosing of sodium bichlorite shall be conducted
periodically depending on the extent of microbial and bacterial-algae growths in the system. Two
sets of sodium bichlorite generators, with the output of 10 kilograms per hour (kg/h) (electrolyte
salt solution), shall be set in first stage of the project, and will be installed in a separate building
next to the cooling tower. The chlorine concentration in the circulating water will be maintained
at a level below 0.5 milligrams per liter (mglL) to prevent condenser corrosion.
The circulating water make-up water treatment is designed according to weak acid double flow
bed system. Two sets of mixed-bed weak acid cation exchanger and auxiliary systems of acid
storage and metering regeneration will be provided and set in a separate weak acid treatment
room. The cation regeneration unit will utilize 88 percent sulfuric acid, with regenerant
wastewater discharged to the industrial wastewater treatment station for treatment.

Ash Handling! Svstem
Boiler bottom ash and flyash will be managed by separate handling systems. The boiler bottom
ash handling system will utilize water-sealed sludge hoppers. After passage through the sludge
breaker, the bottom ash and water mixture will be discharged by a water jet to the dewater bin for
dewatering. Following dewatering, bottom ash will be either trucked to the ash disposal yard or
shipped to a reuse customer for comprehensive utilization. Overflow water from the dewater bin

will be clarified prior to routing to the retention pond for reuse in the bottom ash handling
system.
The flyash handling system will utilize a low-pressure pneumatic dry handling system. Flyash
from the electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and economizers will be discharged periodically into air
lock valves and conveyed by low-pressure air through piping into the flyash bin. Each boiler will
be provided with two sets of low-pressure pneumatic ash handlers. Flyash from the economizer
and the flyash hoppers of the first ESP field will be conveyed to the coarse ash bin, while flyash
from the second, third, and fourth ESP field hoppers will be conveyed to the fine ash bin. Fine
ash also can be switched over to the coarse ash bin. The practice of separately managing coarse
and fine ashes will facilitate comprehensive reutilization of flyash. Beneath the ash bins, wet
stirring devices (known as pugmills) will be provided to wet the ash to 20 to 30 percent water
content before removal to the ash disposal yard. Removal will be effected by enclosed self-
dumping trucks. Flyash can also be conveyed by tanker or truck directly for sending to potential
customers for reutilization.
The total ash amount (both flyash and bottom ash) expected to be generated by the initial
2x600 MW units is 133.4 TPH [86.7xlO' tons per year (TPY) based on 6,500 hours of operation
per year]. The ultimate ash generation volume of 6x600 MW units is expected to be 400.2 TPH
(260.1x1O0 TPY). Flyash will constitute 85 percent of this total volume and bottom ash will
comprise the remainder.
Ash Disposal Strategv
The amount of ash to be disposed of in the ash disposal yard is assumed to result from the
burning of 90 percent design coal and 10 percent checking coal. The total annual flyash and
bottom ash generation rate of the first project stage will be 867,100 tons. The area of ash
disposal yard occupied in the first stage of the project will be 117 hectare (ha). The ash pile
height ultimately will reach 11 meters (m), and the total ash volume will be approximately
1,120x 104 m3 which would handle ash disposal from the first stage units for 11 years. The final
ash disposal yard will be 452 ha in size and will be capable of storing ash for up to 17 years for
the 6x600 MW facility.

The ash disposal yard will be constructed step bv step according to project stages. For the first
stage project, the ash disposal yard will be located along the left bank of Qin River
(Figure 1.3-3). A flood dike will be constructed along the river faces (south and west) of the
proposed ash disposal yard, and dikes will be placed on the east and north sides to form a closed
ash disposal yard. In addition, a management station, fence enclosure, and auxiliary structures
will be built to complete the ash disposal yard structure. Flyash and bottom ash will be both
dumped, rolled out, compressed in layers, and stacked with an outside slope of I vertical:
3 horizontal. The ash will be disposed in series from west to east on 8 parcels of land in
sequence. Flyash and bottom ash will be disposed on separate sides of the disposal yard (west
and east, respectively) to facilitate reutilization.
According to the Division of Design Standards as stipulated in China's Thermal Power Plant
Water Supply Engineering Technical Regulation (NCT5-88) Item No 10.2.3, and in conjunction
with the Design Standard of the dike on the right bank of the Qin River in Jiyuan City section,
the ash disposal yard dike design standard will be treated as Grade 1. The corresponding
recurrence interval for wind and flood maxima will be 50 years. The checking flood standard
will be for a 100-year recurrence interval. The design of the dike will be the design flood level
plus 1.5 m for 50-year recurrence intervals for flood and wind. The dikes will be built utilizing
sand fill from within the ash disposal yard perimeter. The river-facing sides of the disposal yard
will be made of mortared stone blocks as a protective slope and the dike foot will be protected by
riprap.
The disposal of ash within the yard will be performed in a manner intended to reduce the amount
of ash left exposed to the elements. After being rolled out, the ash will be pressed to increase
compaction. During the stacking process, water will be sprayed on the stack surface to maintain
an ash surface layer with sufficient water content to minimize fugitive emissions. Following
attainment of ultimate stack height, the ash will be covered with soil and planted with trees and
grass.
1.3.2.6 Air Emission Controls
Particulates will be collected by ESPs, for which a 99.6 percent efficiency is claimed. The first
two 600 MW units will share a single stack 240 m high, a configuration that will be repeated for
each of the other two 2x600 MW blocks.

1.3.2.7 Transmission
To deliver power to the Henan grid, two 165-km transmission lines of 500 kV capacity are
proposed to connect the Qinbei plant to the Xialou substation to the southwest of Zhengzhou.
One additional 750-kV substation will be constructed near Nanyang, to the east of the Qinbei site.
Environmental impacts arising from transmission line construction are discussed in Part II of this
report.

2.1 PHYSICAL ENIrRONMIEN'T
2.1.1 TOPOGRAPHY, PHYSIOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY AN-D SEISNIICITY
Power Plant Site
The proposed plant site is located in the piedmont of the Taihang Mountains and covers 73.7 ha
(see Figure 1.3-2). An additional 6.4 ha will be used for the workers colony for the facility. Site
topography is gently sloping, ranging in elevation from approximately 175 to 200 meters above
mean sea level (m-msl). The site area is arid and is not used for agricultural production of any
significance. The plant site is situated on alluvium along the east side of the Baijian River as it
flows from the Taihang mountain range. Immediately to the north and west of the plant site is
mountainous terrain with elevations 300 to 925 m higher than at the plant site. Riverine
floodplains lie south and east of the site.
The uppermost geological stratum in the vicinity of the plant site is alluvial sediments deposited
during the Quaternary Period. These sediments overlay a conglomerate layer of the Tertiary
Period. Tertiary conglomerates are underlain by a series of the Ordovician Period containing
Majiagou limestone.
Ash Disposal Yard
The ash disposal yard is located south of Liucun and Huacun villages approximately 4.5 km south
of the proposed power plant site along the left bank of Qin River (see Figure 1.1-1). The
proposed disposal site varies in width from 800 m to 1,700 m and consists of a low river beach
terrace. Topography within the ash disposal yard is generally flat and ranges in elevation from
132.8 to 136.0 m-msl. Much of the site is arid with the exception of some low-quality farm land
and fruit orchards in the north end. During flood season, the area may be flooded by the Qin
River. The ash disposal yard for the initial 1,200 MW plant capacity will cover 117 ha. An
additional 335 ha has been reserved for the final buildout capacity of 3,600 MW.
The ground surface in the southern portion of the ash disposal yard along the Qin River is
primarily fine sand, whereas the surface layer of the northern area is a light clay. In general, the
soil at the site is composed of two different units, the upper unit being sandy in appearance with
medium sand, fine sand, silt, and silty sand interlavers, while lower strata consist of cobbles with
2-1

clayey interlayers. Groundwater at the ash disposal yard location is siruated approximately 3-5 m
below ground surface. The average value of the field-measured permeability for light mild clay
in the ash disposal yard area is 8.4xl0" cm/s. that of fine sand is 8x10' cm/s.
Seismicitv
China is situated in the southeastern part of the Eurasian plate and is bordered to the east by the
western Pacific seismic belt and the Himalaya-Mediterranean seismic belt to the south. In
general, the country is particularly vulnerable to large and frequent earthquakes. Since 1901, 648
earthquakes of Richter Magnitude (M) 6 or greater have occurred, among which 95 were greater
than 7M and nine were greater than 8M. Twenty-one of 30 provinces in China, including Henan
Province, have been stuck by 6M earthquakes in this century.
The project site is located near the southern end of a Quaternary (i.e., recently active) fault zone
along the piedmont of the Taihang mountain range. The zone runs through Beijing, Hebei
Province, and the northern part of Henan Province. The zone is composed of a series of faults
oriented in a south-southwest to north-northeast direction, with a southern section deflecting to the
southwest close to the proposed project site. Few traces of the faults are evident on the ground
surface. The zone has acted intensely during the present era. Sixty strong earthquakes have
occurred along the zone and in its vicinity, the strongest being 7.5 M (Institute of Seismology,
1990). At least two large earthquakes in northeastern China in the last 30 years have been felt in
northern Henan province. On March 8, 1966, an earthquake of 6.8M struck Xingtai in Hebei
province. This earthquake was followed by a 7.2 M earthquake at Ningjin, approximately
325 km north-northeast of the proposed power plant. The felt effects of this aftershock at the site
was approximately Modified Mercalli (MM) Scale IV. The 7.8 M 1976 Tangshan earthquake, in
northern Hebei province, was also felt in northern Henan province, some 750 km away (Yong
et al., 1988), indicating an intensitv at the site of at least MM 111. Prior to the 20th century, two
8.0+ M earthquakes struck near Linfen in Shanxi Provinee on the Fen River approximately
150 km to the northwest of the site, while two earthquakes of roughly 6.0 M struck near the cities
of Luoyang and Jiaozou, roughly 60 km south and 70 km east of the proposed project site.

2.1.2 AIR RESOURCES
2.1.2.1 Climatolo2v
Geographically, China, including its neighbor Mlongolia, is roughly circular in form and lies east-
northeast of the Indian subcontinent. China extends from 22 to 52 degrees north (N) latitude
and 74 to 134 degrees east (E) longitude and is 9,561,000 square kilometers (kmr)
[3,692,000 square miles (mi2)] in area. This vast expanse of land gives fill opportunity for
continental weather conditions to develop a cold area of high barometric pressure in the winter as
well as low-pressure hot areas in the summer. The Himalaya Mountains on the southwest border
of China blocks the monsoon weather patterns that India experiences during the summer from
reaching western China. For this reason, most areas of northern and western China average less
than 1,000 millimeters (mm) of rain per year. The exception to this rule is the coastal area of
China which annually has precipitation values greater than 1000 mm. Rainfall amounts decrease
rapidly from the southeast to the northwest. The reason for this decrease is the movement of the
summer monsoons, in which the interior of China is beyond the reach of the Pacific air mass
flow.
In China, the winds are generally from a northerly direction in winter and from the southeast in
summer. The causes of the reversal of the wind system are related to both the large size of the
Asian continent and adjacent oceans, and the very high and extensive Himalayan mountain range
(Tibet Plateau) of the continent. This range is oriented in an east-west direction and forms a
barrier between tropical (monsoonal) and polar air masses.
2.1.2.2 Site Meteorologv
The Qinbei Power Plant site, located directly south of the Taihang Mountains in the warm zone,
has a continental season wind climate. The Jiyuan City Meteorological Station, located 12 km
southwest of the plant site, provided the statistic meteorological data for the period of 1961-1990,
with the annual values as follows:
Average annual atmospheric pressure            999.9 hPa
Average annual temperature                      14.2 degrees Celsius (C)
Maximum period temperature                      43.40C
Minimum period temperature                     -20.0C
Average annual pr,ecipitation                   629.8 mm
Average annual relative humidity                67 percent

Figure 2.1-1 illustrates the 12-month windrose depicting wind speed and wind direction
frequencies for the months August 1992 through July 1993 (based on daily measurements
collected every third hour) at the Jiyuan City meteorological monitoring station. This windrose
confirrns the predominant bimodal wind frequency pattern suggested for this area of the country,
which is light easterly winds as well as westerly winds and calms occurring approximately 30
percent of the time.
2.1.2.3 Amhient Air Qualitv
Background Concentrations
There are no significant major sources of atmospheric pollution in the area of the proposed power
plant. An initial short-term (7 consecutive days of data collection, with analysis performed once
per day), eight-station ambient air quality monitoring network was established in 1985 by the
local (Jiyuan City) environmental monitoring agency in the vicinity of the plant. The parameters
measured were sulfur dioxide (SO,), oxides of nitrogen (NO2), and total suspended particulates
(TSP). These measurements were initially conducted in and to the east of Jiyuan City towards the
power plant site. The analytical methodology employed to determine pollutant concentrations
during the monitoring programs were the wet chemistry bubbler method for SO, and NO., and
gravimetric for TSP. The data collected during this short-term monitoring effort indicates that
neither SO. nor NO, exceed the World Bank guidelines for SO2 and NO.. However, the TSP
concentrations measured routinely exceeded both the World Bank and PRC Grade II standards for
particulates, which are 0.500 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) and 0.300 mg/m3, respectively.
The data collected from this short-term monitoring effort are summarized in Table 2.1-1
Subsequent to the short-term 1985 air quality monitoring study, a comprehensive, 2-year air
quality study was conducted at the Qinbei Power Plant site and Jiyuan City. From August 1992
through July 1994, a two-station air quality monitoring network collected and analyzed daily (i.e.,
eight 3-hour samples per day) samples for both SO, and TSP. A summary of the SO, and TSP
data collected during this period is presented in Table 2.1-2.

The data indicate that daily (24-hour) back-round SO. concentrations in the proposed Qinbei
Power Plant area, ranging from 0.008 mg/mrn to 0.079 mgr/m3, are below both the World Bank
and PRC Grade II ambient air quality standards of 0.500 mg/m3 and 0. 150 mg/m3, respectively.
The annual average ambient background SO, concentrations are 0.047 mg/m3 for the period of
August 1992 through July 1993 and 0.033 mg/m3 for the next 12 months (August 1993 through
July 1994). Again, these annual average background ambient concentrations for SO, do not
exceed either the World Bank or PRC Grade 11 ambient standards of 0. 100 mg/m3 and 0.060
mg/m3, respectively.
The data indicate that the 24-hour background TSP levels range from 0.065 mg/m3 to 0.404
mg/m3. This range exceeds the PRC Grade 11 TSP standard of 0.300 mgy/r3. However, in the
absence of major regional industry, this concentration is believed to be a result of natural sources
and consists of relatively non-respirable particles.
From the data collected during the air quality monitoring studies, it is evident that the winter
months (i.e., heating season) produce higher SO, and TSP values. The elevated ambient
concentrations of both SO. and TSP during the winter season directly corresponds to increased
emissions of SO, due to the combustion of home heating fuels (mainly coal) and to increased
fugitive dust emissions due to reduced ground cover (agricultural plantings) in the area.
2.1.2.4 Noise
There are no significant industrial developments in the project area. While no industrial noise
sources are near the project area, the main railway line connecting Luoyang and Xinxiang is due
south of the proposed site. These mobile noise sources (cars, trucks, and trains) are intermittent
in nature and are the only significant sources of noise in the area.
Baseline (background) noise monitoring was conducted onsite February 28 and March 1, 1993 at
the proposed plant site. Background noise levels were monitored at three sites along the property
boundary both during the daytime and nighttime. The measured noise levels were less than or
equal to 45 A-weighted decibels (dBA) (well below World Bank noise guidelines for agricultural
land use areas), except when a train passed within 200 m of the monitoring site (when the noise
level measured in the field was 62 dBA). Table 2.1-3 summarizes the background noise
monitoring data collected at the property boundary during the 2-day noise study.

2.1.3 *WATER RESOURCES
2.1.3.1 Surfnce Water Resnurcec
Precipitation
The proposed power plant is located in an arid region of north China where evaporation is high
and precipitation is relatively low. Annual average evaporation is 1,564.5 mm and annual
average precipitation is 629.8 mm. There are approximately 70 rainy days per year. The plant
site is situated in the warm zone and has a continental season and climate. A summary of
meteorological data from Jiyuan Meteorological Station is provided in Section 2.1.2.2.
Qin River
The Qin River is a major tributary of the Yellow River and issues from the Taihang Mountains
approximately 2.5 km west of the proposed project site (Figure 1.1-1). The Qin originates from
Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province and passes west and south of the plant site, through Qinyang
City, then flowing into the Yellow River in Wuzhi County.
According to 34 years of monitoring data available from the Wulongkou Hydrologic Station west
of the plant site, the Qin River has a measured maximum flow is 4,240 m3/s and a perennial
average flow of 39.2 m3/s. Yearly runoff of the Qin River is distributed unevenly, with higher
flows during the peak rainfall months of July through October and lower flow periods during
January and February. Flood levels in Qin River range from 136.9 to 138.1 m-msl in reaches
nearest the plant site. Projected flows for the 50-year and 100-year floods on the Qin River are
4,480 and 5,430 m3/s, respectively (NWEPDI, 1994). Long-term flow data for the Qin River are
provided in Table 2.1-4 and are summarized in Table 2.1-5.
Although 35 years of flow data was available for the Qin River, for approximately the last
20 years of data it is evident that some obstruction (i.e., a dam) was placed on the river around
1970. This obstruction has served to significantly limit downstream flows of the river.
Water quality monitoring of the Qin River was carried out during February 22 through 24, 1993.
A subsequent monitoring program was conducted during March 1994 in four cross-sections across
the Qin River. Water samples were taken from the center of each section daily for a 3-day
period. In the sampled river sections, surface water quality was within PRC drinking water
quality standards, as provided in Table 1.2-3. Monitoring results are presented in Table 2.1-6.

Baijian River
The Baijian River flows roughlv from north to south along the west side of plant site and joins the
Qin River approximately 2 km downstream. The Baijian is a seasonal river and does not flow
during the dry season. The 100-year flood flow is 1,430 m3/s, with a corresponding flood level
of 179.3 m-msl. Since flow in the river is sporadic in nature, no comprehensive flow data are
available for the river. However, some measurements were made during the period from 1986-
1989 and are presented in Table 2.1-7.
2.1.3.2 Groundwater Resources
Water Source
The proposed water supply source for the project is groundwater. The groundwater sources are
located below the Qin River valley upstream of Wulongkou Township and also include the Qin
River buried alluvial plain downstream of Wulongkou. Together, these two zones are referred to
as the Wulongkou Aquifer (see Figure 1.1-1).
The main water-bearing layers of the Wulongkou Aquifer are composed of loose sandstone and
cobbles in the Quaternary alluvial stratum and are characterized by relatively large pore size and
high permeability in water bearing layers. The water bearing strata of the aquifer are located at
15 to 20 m, 35 to 55 m, 65 to 74 m. 77 to 100 m, 102 to 137 m and 145 to 150 m below ground
surface. The upper water-bearing layers are phreatic in nature, while deeper layers are confined.
The phreatic surface of groundwater is located 3 to 5 m under ground surface, depending on
season and location. The coefficient of permeability is 100 to 150 meters per day (m/d); tubewell
output is reportedly greater than 50 m3/h (NWEPDI, 1994).
The aquifer is delineated on Figure 1.1-1 and covers a subsurface area of approximately 3.34
km2. Based on the number and depth of the water-bearing strata described previously, it has a
total depth of 103 m. Sand and cobble (gravel) aquifers typically have a porosity of between 10
and 35 percent (Driscoll, 1986). If the aquifer has an average porosity of 22.5 percent, the
maximum amount of water in the aquifer at any one time will be about 77,300,000 m3.
Ash Disposal Yard
The depth of groundwater in the ash disposal yard area ranges from 3 to 5 m, of which the upper
layer is phreatic water and lower layers are confined water-bearing strata. As at the power plant

site, the main makeup source of groundwater is from upper-stream phreatic water and
atmospheric rainfall infiltration. The tlow direction of groundwater in ash disposal yard region
tends from northwest to southeast.
Groundwater quality
Groundwater quality is bicarbonate in nature, and contains approximately 500 mg/L of solids.
Six wells near the proposed project site were used as monitoring points for groundwater
background quality. The monitoring was conducted during March 26 through 27, 1993. Sampled
parameters and results are presented in Table 2.1-8. Overall groundwater quality was good and
met PRC Sanitary Standards for Drinking Water.
The primary makeup source to the Wulongkou Aquifer is bed infiltration from Qin River water as
well as seasonal streams, precipitation and deep percolation of irrigation water. The allowable
exploitation of the aquifer has been estimated to be 6.0 m3/s (NWEPDI, 1994). The groundwater
source survey report for the power plant has been reviewed and approved by the National Mining
Resources Commission Report No. SF 126 (1991).
2.2 ECOLOGICAL ENXVIRONNTENT
2.2.1 EXISTING VEGETATIVE COMIMUNITIES
The area to the south of the Qinbei plant site is part of the Loess Plain of the North China Plain.
The Loess Plain in general has been continuously and densely inhabited for thousands of years,
and holds few intact natural communities of significance as a consequence. Present estimates are
that 93 percent of Henan's original forest cover has been removed, with most remaining
fragments located in the Taihang Mountains and other rugged areas (Mackinnon, 1992). Virtually
all land south of the Taihang Mountains in Jiyuan county has been converted from the original
dry, temperate, lowland deciduous scrub to cropland. No stands of either natural forest fragments
or plantation timber were observed in the project area during the site visit. River drainages were
generally channelized or levied, highly braided with large volumes of accumulated silt, and held
no identifiable stream corridor communities.
The plant site proper is located at the foot of the Taihang- Mountain range on elevated tableland
50 to 100 m above the Loess Plain's irrigated croplands. The site property, described as

wasteland in the NWAIEPDI report', was cleared of all original vegetative cover has been used for
rainfed agriculture or pasrure. At the time of the site visit the property held only a sparse cover
of weedy, annual vegetation principally comprised of cockleburr (Xanthium C?) sibiricum) and
wormwood, (Artemisia scoparia) intermixed with small, terraced parcels of plowed land (see
Appendix C, Photograph 2).
Steep escarpments of the Taihang Mountain Range are located approximately 2 km north of the
plant site. The Taihangs, and the associated drainage systems, originally held extensive,
temperate, broadleaf, deciduous forest communities dominated by oak, elm and ash (Mackinnon,
1992; Table 2.2-1); which have been largely cleared by logging. Although the KBN team
observed only a sparse cover of scrub vegetation on the mountainsides (Appendix C,
Photograph 1), the mountains are believed to be 27 percent forested with mixed broadleaf and
conifers and have been designated as one of six priority re-forestation areas in the PRC2.
Ruderal scrub vegetation of the Taihangs consists principally of broadleaf, deciduous shrubs
(families Rhamnaceae and Anacardiaceae), with ground covers of grasses and verbenas
(Gramineae and Verbaenaceae) (Table 2.2-1).
No evidence was seen of wildlife communities in the vicinity of the plant site, though it is likely
that the scrub of steep slopes and dry drainage channels in the mountains hold populations of
small reptiles and mammals. The Qin River, which originates in the Taihang Mountains north of
the site and which borders the proposed ash disposal yard in lower elevations (Figures 1.1-1 and
1.3-3 and Appendix C, Photograph 4), was said by the NWEPDI report as well as local scientists2
to hold no exploitable populations of fish. No evidence of fishing activity among local
populations was observed during the field visits. No birds at all were observed in the vicinity of
Jiyuan except for an occasional magpie (Pica pica).
The term "wasteland" is a formal land-use term in the PRC, interpreted by KBN to indicate
untilled, unirrigatable rocky lands with marginal or no economic utility and little vegetative cover.

2.2.2 BIOLOGICAL DIN'ERSITY' A.ND ENDANGERED SPECIES
Back!round
The NWEPDI EA report states, as did representatives of the Henan Agricultural University Eco-
Environmental Research Branch, that no endangered or threatened plants and animals exist within
the project impact area.
Mackinnon (1992) provides a figure of 4,000 species overall for Henan province, including 40
endemics. This World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) study states that there are three Grade I
and 16 Grade II species and that the only first-class protected animal, the Chinese leopard
(Panthera pardus) has long been extinct in Henan Province.
Threatened or Endangered SRecies in the Project Area
Li-Kuo (1992) describes four regional endemic plant species that are of concern; including an elm
(Ulmaceae) and a shrub (Taihangia rupestris, Fam. Rosaceae) that are considered rare; in
addition to a walnut (Juglandaceae) and another broadleaf shrub (Ranunculaceae) that are
classified as vulnerable (Table 2.2-1). According to the International Union for the Conservation
of Nature and Natural Habitats (IUCN)-derived Red Book classification system, rare describes
organisms that are not endangered or vulnerable, but are at risk due to restricted geographic
range or thin population distributions. Vulnerable indicates that the species may move into the
endangered category unless current population trends are reversed and causal factors mitigated.
The endemic Taihangia rupestris, representing a unique genus, is apparently very rare according
to both Li-Kuo and Mackinnon. Though actually known to occur in only two stands, the current
range of this shrub is described by Li-Kuo as the south slope of the Taihang Mountains in
northwest Henan, where it is found on sheer precipices and overhanging rocks or crevices
between 1,000- and 1,300-m elevation. Li-Kuo further describes the species as "short, small and
unnoticeable to nonspecialists," indicating that an expert, focused effort is needed to determine
presence or absence. These descriptions of both range and appearance indicate that the presence
of Taihangia rupestris in the project area cannot he ruled out in the absence of directed search.

Protected Areas
According to the WWNIF report, approximately 3 percent of Henan province is under some
protective status, including three protected areas clustered along the ridges of the Taihang
mountains in the northwestern part of the province in the region of the Qinbei Power Plant
Project. All three of these protected areas are under the administrative auspices of the Provincial
Department of Forestry, and are listed as Category C. In the three-tiered system described by
the WWF report, Category C has the lowest protection status and indicates an area of local
significance, whose protection is important in order to assure the continued existence of
representative ecosystems in each province. The Baisongling protected area of approximately
30 km2 and created for the protection of Rhesus macaque monkeys (Rhesus macaque), begins
approximately 5 kmn northeast of the Qinbei site, covering the mountain ridge and extending down
the southern slopes to an elevation of approximately 200 m (Figure 1.3-2). The Taihangshan
protected area of approximately 40 km2 and created to protected representative forest ecosystems,
lies along a narrow band of ridges that extend to within 10 km northwest of the Qinbei site at
elevations above 800 m (Figure 1.3-2).
2.2.3 WETLANDS
Three internationally important wetlands exist in Henan, none of which are in the vicinity of the
Qinbei Power Plant Project;
1.  The Dangiangkou Reservoir located approximately 95 km west-southwest of Nanyang;
2.  The Suya Hu Wetland, approximately 20 km east of Zhumadian; and
3.  The Old Huang He Marshes near Kaifeng, approximately 70 km north of Kaifeng
city.
No wetland sites were observed in the vicinity of the power plant. As mentioned in
Section 2.2.1, the Qin River has been extensively diked or channelized, and probably contains
few if any natural wetland communities along its entire length. The river banks and bed are
exploited for the extraction of construction sand (Appendix C, Photograph 4), and areas disturbed
by this practice have been recolonized by sparse stands of weedy vegetation (Xanthium (?)
sibiricum and Artemisia scoparia).

2.3 SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMNIENT
2.3.1 LAND USE
A detailed description of physical and biological resources at the site is provided in previous
sections of the EA. The areas allocated for the power station and supporting facilities, the
workers colony during construction,and the ash disposal facility are located on unpopulated
parcels of land that are, for the most part, not in current use by the surrounding villagers.
Considered not suitable for agriculture by local populations, due to the predominant ground
surface (gravel and cobble), small components of the power station site specifically are
periodically aerated to allow grass growth for livestock grazing. Local villagers have access to
the site informally through permission of EPH for this purpose. While evidence of such aeration
(i.e., plowing) was evident on a few scarce patches of soil, no livestock grazing was observed
during the site visit, although grazing was observed on cultivated sites with better access to water
southeast of the site and closer to the existing villages.
Land use in the proximity of the project site is comprised primarily of agricultural production,
predominated by winter wheat. Other crops cultivated within 5 km of the project site include
spinach, rice, peanuts, apples, pears, and watermelon. A small cluster of walnut trees were
observed within 0.5 km of the project site. Production occurs mainly on small plots amounting to
approximately 700 m' per farmer.
There are no systematic laws that specify how a particular parcel of land is categorized for land
use. Approval on the appropriateness of land acquisition for the power station was provided by
the Land Acquisition Bureau of Jiyuan Municipality. Throughout the project development
process, EPH has coordinated the proposed change in land use with local populations. During the
public meeting conducted by EPH on March 3, 1993. and an informal followup meeting
conducted while the EA team was at the site, the villagers expressed an eagerness to see the site
developed since they were not benefiting from the current land use and they perceived that the
power station would improve the standard of living for the surrounding villages. Records of both
meetings are provided in Appendix A.
2.3.2 SOCIOECONOMICS
Henan Province offers excellent potential for economic growth due the state of its infrastructure,
roads, railways, and communications. As noted in previous sections, the Henan Province Power
2-23



1435C!2.24
04106/95
Grid is considered an important part of the Central China Power Grid and critical to future
economic development throughout Central China.
Jiyuan city is rich in mineral reserves, classified as metal, non-metal, and construction materials.
The main industries within Jiyuan City larger urban area include metallurgy, coal electrical
devices, chemical manufacturing, machine building, construction materials, food processing,
textile production, and paper and plastics manufacturing. The closest large- to medium-sized
industry occurs approximately 10 km from the power plant site.
There are three villages within 2 km of the power plant site: Shang Zhuan, Xi Yao Tou, and
Bailong Mao. Economic activities of the villagers range from crop production and animal
husbandry to stone masonry. The villages also have clusters of small merchant shops which
provide goods and services to the local populations.
2.3.2.1 Demographv
Jiyuan, the nearest city to the project site, controls five towns, eight communities, and 515
villages. The population of the area exceeds 600.000, with nearly 8,796 living in rural areas.
The villages surrounding the power plant are indicated in Figure 1.1-1. Approximate populations
for the three nearest villages follow:
Village          Distance to Site    Population
Shang Zhuang          1.5 km             3,000
Xi Yao Tou            1.5 km               800
Bailong Mao           700 m                300
2.3.2.2 Emplovment and Oppnrtunitv
In keeping with the principal economic activities of the surrounding areas, most villagers earn
their livelihoods from agricultural related activities, low-skilled labor-related professions such as
masonry works, and merchandising for local inhabitants. The poor road conditions and low skill
level of the work force reduces the potential for economic opportunities outside of the village
communities.

2.3.2.3 Transportation
The Jio(zho)-Ke(jing) highway and the Jiozhi railwav pass on the south side of the site. There is
currently poor road access to the site from the highway, with current road conditions consisting of
two-lane, unpaved roads that connect the surrounding villages. The site is traversed by two small
earthen paths that are covered in loose stone and used predominantly for foot traffic. While road
transportation to the power facility is currently poor, the site has excellent access to rail
transportation, through which supplies, fuel, and construction materials will be provided to the
facility. The Qinbei Rail Station is currently used for passenger and commercial transport
amounting to two trains passing through Qinbei in each direction daily (a total of four trips).
Vehicular traffic on roads between villages is scarce; the roads are predominated by foot and
bicycle traffic. The roads are predominantly earthen impacted and approximately two-lanes in
width.
2.3.2.4 Facilities and Services
Jiyuan City offers the nearest major hospital, firefighting, and security (i.e., police) facilities. In
addition to primary and secondary schools, Jiyuan City hosts a well-respected technical college.
Each village has its own clinic or hospital and most have at least a primary school. The largest of
the three nearest villages, Shang Zhuan, has approximately 20 doctors at its medical facility and
offers both a primary and secondary school.
2.3.3 CULTURAL RESOURCES
Jiyuan city is a famous ancient cultural city, with Wangwushan (northwest of the city) a famous
tourist attraction. The Jiyuan City Cultural Bureau has issued the project a certificate stating that
the project site does not exist in a protected area from the stand point of cultural relics.

3.0 E.NVIRONMlENTAL I,MPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
3.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONvMENT
3.1.1 AIR QUALITY
3.1.1.1 Introduction
An air quality impact assessment was performed to predict maximum SQO and PM impacts due to
the proposed power plant operation. These impacts were predicted in the lower terrain areas in
which the proposed plant is to be located, and in the nearby mountain areas. Impacts predicted in
the lower areas represent those to which the general population would be exposed. Impacts in the
mountainous areas generally represent those which may affect the soils, vegetation or animal life
in those areas. Although the mountainous areas in the vicinity of the proposed plant site have not
been previously identified as environmentally sensitive, the Taihangshan to the west and the
Baisongling to the east of the proposed plant site are two Category C protected areas under the
Forest Department.
3.1.1.2 Air Modelin! Methodoloyv
3.1.1.2.1 General Modeling Approach
Because the PRC environmental regulatory agencies have not established procedures or policies
for performing air quality impact assessments, the general modeling approach followed U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (IJSEPA) modeling guidelines using USEPA-approved air
dispersion models. These models and guidelines were used because they offer validated
techniques for estimating maximum ground-level concentrations and are used extensively for
comparing air quality impacts with air quality standards. For comparison to World Bank
standards and the PRC standards, highest predicted concentrations from the modeling analysis are
reported.
3.1.1.2.2 Model Selection
The areas to the southwest, south, and east of the proposed site are generally at or lower than the
elevation of the proposed plant site. Areas to the northwest, north, and northeast of the proposed
site are mountainous. Areas lower than the proposed stack top elevation are referred to as simple
terrain. Those areas with elevations above the proposed stack top elevation are referred to as
complex terrain areas. Models selected were capable of performing in both simple and complex
terrain areas.

14-35C.'3 1 -'
Because of the limited meteorological data available in the area of the proposed site (see
Section 3.1.1.2.5), maximum air quality impacts of air pollutants from the proposed power plant
were primarily predicted in the lower elevation areas with the SCREEN2 model (Version 92245).
The SCREEN2 mode] predicts maximum 1-hour concentrations for a range of meteorological
conditions and range of distances directly downwind from an emissions source. SCREEN2
determines a maximum impact by considering a range of potential combinations of wind speed
and atmospheric stability class. SCREEN2 was used to predict maximum 1-hour impacts at areas
that are at or below the power plant's base elevation. This represents nearly all areas located to
the east clockwise to the southwest from the proposed plant site.
Predictions of maximum air quality impacts in the mountainous areas surrounding the proposed
power plant were made using the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term Model (ISCSTDFT,
latest version, draft). This model is a USEPA-approved model and is based on proposed
modeling approaches presented in Supplement C to the Guideline on Air Quality Models
(December 1994). The ISCSTDFT model predicts impacts in both simple and complex terrain
areas. However, the model was primarily selected in this analysis for its ability to predict
impacts in complex terrain. The current version of the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term
Model (ISCST2, Version 93109) does not predict impacts in complex terrain. For this analysis,
the ISCSTDFT model was used to predict impacts in both simple and complex terrain area.
The ISCSTDFT calculates hourly impacts using hourly meteorological data including wind
direction, wind speed, ambient temperature, atmospheric stability class, and mixing height. The
model calculates maximum impacts for several averaging times.
Because of limited meteorological data available near the proposed site, the ISCSTDFT modeling
analysis was performed in two phases. The first phase involved using the model in a screening
mode by using a constructed meteorological data set designed to produce worst-case impacts. For
this phase, maximum 1-hour impacts were obtained and then adjusted to estimate maximum
impacts for other averaging times. Impacts for the annual average, 24-hour and 3-hour averaging
times were obtained by multiplying the maximum 1-hour impacts by factors of 0.05, 0.4, and
0.9, respectively.

The second phase involved using an annual meteorological database to determine maximum
impacts for the annual average. 24-hour, 3-hour, and 1-hour averaging times. Additional detail
concerning the two modeling phases is provided in Section 3.1.1.2.5.
3.1.1.2.3 Model Options
The terrain is rural within 3 km from the proposed plant site, Therefore, rural dispersion
parameters were selected for both the SCREEN2 and ISCSTDFT model. This is the only option
setting required for the SCREEN2 model.
USEPA regulatory default options were used with the ISCSTDFT model. These include:
1.  Final plume rise at all receptor locations,
2.  Stack-tip downwash,
3.  Buoyancy-induced dispersion,
4.  Default wind speed profile coefficients for rural or urban option,
5. Default vertical potential temperature gradients,
6.  Calm wind processing, and
7.  Reducing calculated SO, concentrations in urban areas by using a decay half-life of
4 hours (i.e., reduce the SO, concentration emitted by 50 percent for every 4 hours of
plume travel time).
3.1.1.2.4 Source and Emission Data
Emission data for SO2 and particulate matter (PM) were provided to KBN for both the 2x600 and
6x600 MW design power plants. Emission rates for NO. were developed from USEPA emission
factors. All the model runs were performed using the SO, emissions for a 2x600 MW power
plant burning design coal. Impacts for PM and the 6x600 MW case were calculated by
multiplying the maximum modeled concentration by the appropriate emission ratio. A listing of
the emission rates and stack parameters used in the modeling analysis is presented in Table 3.1-1.
Dimensions for three building structures were provided to KBN. The three building structures
are the turbine house, the boiler room, and the natural draft cooling towers. The heights of these
structures are 29.9, 78, and 71 m, respectively. Since the proposed power plant stack(s), at
240 m, are more than 2.5 times the height of the tallest structure, the structures will not cause

plume downwash from the proposed stacks. Therefore, the effects of building downwash were
not considered in the modeling analysis.
3.1.1.2.5 Meteorological Data
For the simple terrain analysis, the SCREEN2 model does not require any external meteorological
data. All combinations of potential worst-case hourly meteorology are contained in the model.
Meteorological data needed to perform the complex terrain modeling analysis using the
ISCSTDFT model consist of the following five meteorological parameters:
1.  Wind direction-determines the transport directions toward which the plume-will travel
and potentially affect receptors downwind of the plant,
2.  Wind speed-determines the amount of dilution of plume concentration and height to
which the plume will rise,
3.  Temperature-affects the height to which the plume will rise and also is used in
estimating afternoon mixing heights,
4.  Atmospheric stability-determines the extent of plume spread or dispersion in the
vertical and horizontal directions, and
5.  Mixing height-determines the maximum vertical extent or volume of air in which the
plume can disperse.
Meteorological data from Jiyuan City were evaluated for use in the dispersion modeling analysis.
A comparison of ISCSTDFT model requirements to the parameters available from Jiyuan City are
presented in Table 3.1-2. Based on this assessment, the data from Jiyuan City were not
considered complete enough to be used in the ISCSTDFT modeling analysis. Therefore,
maximum impacts from the ISCSTDFT model were obtained using two separate methodologies.
1.  Construction of Hourlv Meteorolosical Records
Hourly meteorological records consist of 52 combinations of wind speed and stability
class that are considered as likely to occur. The wind direction, ambient temperature
and mixing height are held constant each of these hours. The wind direction is
assumed to always blow directly from the source to the receptors. A maximum
1-hour concentration is determined from the 52 combinations of meteorological data.

2.  Development of a Representative I-Year Hourlv Database
To ensure that the maximum impacts produced by the SCREEN2 model and by the
ISCSTDFT model using the constructed meteorological hours from Item I are
reasonable, I year of hourly meteorological data from a representative United States
city was used in a separate modeling analysis. The shape of the windrose from
Asheville, North Carolina for the year 1984 (see Figure 3.1-1) very closely matches
the 12-month windrose from Jiyuan City (see Figure 2.1-1) except that the prevailing
wind directions are rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from the Jiyuan City
prevailing wind directions. Therefore, to use this meteorological data set in the
modeling analysis, the receptors selected to represent locations around the proposed
Henan Qinbei plant were rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around the proposed
plant.
3.1.1.2.6 Receptor Locations
SimRle Terrain
For predicting impacts in the lower terrain areas with the SCREEN2 model, all receptors were
assumed to be at the same elevation as the proposed power plant. Impacts were predicted along a
line of downwind receptors at distances from 100 m to 10,000 m from the proposed plant. From
100 to 3,000 m, the maximum impacts are output by the model for every 100 m, while beyond
3,000 m, the impacts are determined at every 500 m.
For predicting impacts in the lower terrain areas with the ISCSTDFT model, arrays of 36
receptors, at 10 degree intervals around the circle, were located along radials from the plant at
distances of 300, 500, 700, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000, 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 m from the proposed
plant.
ComRlex Terrain
For predicting impacts in the mountainous areas around the proposed plant with the ISCSTDFT
model, 32 receptors were selected which represent significant peak elevation points in all
mountainous areas around the proposed plant. The locations and elevations for each of these
receptors were obtained from a topographical map of the area. A listing of the elevated terrain
receptors used in the ISCSTDFT modeling analysis is provided in Table 3.1-3. A map showing
the locations of these receptors is provided in Appendix D (Figure D-l). Of the 32 receptors, 15

receptors are located in the Baisongling and Taihanashan Protected Areas, which are sensitive
land areas to the east and west of the proposed power plant, respective]k.
3.1.1.3 Air Modeling! Results
Maximum impacts are provided for the lower areas, the non-protected mountains near the
proposed power plant, and the protected mountainous areas to the east and west of the proposed
plant. Impacts are provided for the following four cases:
1.  Design coal for a 2x600 MW facility,
2.  Design coal for a 6x600 MW facility,
3.  Checking coal for a 2x600 MW facility, and
4.  Checking coal for a 6x600 MW facility.
3.1.1.3.1 S02
The maximum SO. impacts from the SCREEN2 and ISCSTDFT models are presented in
Tables 3.1-4 and 3.1-5. The maximum predicted SO, impacts obtained using the constructed
meteorological data set are presented in Table 3.1-4, while Table 3.1-5 summarizes impacts using
the 1-year meteorological data set. The maximum impacts in both simple and complex terrain
areas for both types of meteorological data are very similar. Therefore, the maximum impacts
from the constructed meteorological data set will be used as the primary impacts for the proposed
power plant for the remainder of this section.
2x600 MW Facilitv
Simple Terrain
Maximum predicted impacts in the lower areas are below the World Bank and PRC Grade II
standards, with the exception of the 24-hour PRC standard for burning checking coal, which is
marginally exceeded. The predicted area of the exceedance is located 1.5 to 1.9 km from the
power plant in the lower areas.
Complex Terrain
Maximum impacts in complex terrain near the proposed power plant exceed some World Bank
and PRC standards. The areas of the World Bank 24-hour and PRC once and 24-hour
exceedances are provided in Appendix D, Figure D-2. ne areas of the annual averaged standard
exceedances are provided in Figure D-3. The highest impacts occur along two 600 to 700 m

peaks located 1.800 to 2.000 m from the proposed power plant. The impacts occur under very
stable stability conditions (i.e., nighttime Class F) with light winds which are expected with a
frequency of 6.3 percent or less. Under these conditions, the height of the proposed power plant
plume is between the 600 and 700 m elevation. The modeling analysis indicated further that
impacts at terrain areas below 500 m and above 800 m are generally more than an order of
magnitude lower than the maximum impacts shown in the Table 3.1-4.
Impacts on the protected mountainous areas are generally in compliance with the PRC Grade I
standards, which are intended for application to ecologically sensitive areas. For the Taihangshan
Protected Area, one receptor at 606 m exceeded the Grade I standard. The elevation of that
receptor is near the stable plume height of the power plant. At the Baisongling Protected Area,
the 24-hour standard was exceeded at two receptors, located at heights of 890 and 842 m.
6x600 MW Facility
Simple Terrain
Maximum predicted impacts in the lower areas exceed both the World Bank and PRC Grade II
standards. The area of the maximum impacts is from 1.5 to 1.9 km south of the power plant in
the lower areas (Appendix D, Figure D-4).
Complex Terrain
The areas of exceedance for the PRC Grade 1I standard in complex terrain are shown in
Appendix D, Figure D-3. The areas of the World Bank and PRC 24-hour exceedances are shown
in Figure D-5. The maximum impacts for a 6x600 MW facility area 3 times those for a 2x600
MW facility. The maximum impacts are at the same areas as for the 2x600 MW plant except that
the areas of the exceedance are more extensive.
Impacts at the protected mountainous areas exceeded the P.RC Grade I once and 24-hour standards
for all receptors modeled.
3.1.1.3.2 PM
The maximum predicted PM impacts obtained using the constructed and annual meteorological
data sets are summarized in Tables 3.1-6 and 3.1-7, Tespectively. The maximum impacts in both
simple and complex terrain areas for both types of meteorological data are very similar.

meteorological data set. Tne maximum impacts in both simple and complex terrain areas for both
types of meteorological data are very similar. Therefore, the maximum impacts from the
constructed meteorological data set will be used as the primary impacts for the proposed power
plant for the remainder of this section.
2x600 MW Facility
Simple Terrain
Maximum predicted impacts in the lower areas are below the World Bank standards but are above
the PRC Grade II standards. The area of the PRC standard exceedance is from 1.5 to 1.9 km
from the power plant in the lower areas.
Complex Terrain
Maximum impacts in complex terrain near the proposed power plant exceed the World Bank and
PRC standards. The highest impacts occur along two 600- to 700-m peaks located 1,800 to 2,000
m from the proposed power plant. The impacts occur under very stable stability conditions (i.e.,
nighttime Class F) with light winds.
Maximum NO impacts at the protected mountainous areas exceed both the PRC Grade I 24-hour
and once standards.
6x600 Mw Facilitv
Simple Terrain
Maximum predicted impacts in the lower areas comply with the World Bank annual standard but
exceed the PRC Grade II standards.
Complex Terrain
The maximum impacts in the non-protected mountainous areas exceed both the World Bank and
PRC Grade II standards over a wide area.
The maximum impacts at the protected mountainous areas exceed the PRC Grade I 24-hour and

3.1.1.3.4 Sumrmars
The predicted maximum air quality pollutant concentrations due to the power plant include both
the impacts of the facility by itself and the inclusion of the existinc baseline (ambient) pollutant
concentration. The SO2 impacts presented are combined with the existing ambient air SO:
concentrations at all receptors since Sa is a gaseous pollutant and, therefore, its ambient
concentrations is expected to be uniformly dispersed throughout the predicted impact area. The
ambient SO, concentrations are typically higher in the impact area in the winter months due to
home heating emissions during the winter.
However, ambient TSP concentrations in the area are typically higher in the summer months due
to the lack of precipitation and increased agricultural cultivation (i.e., non-point, non-industrial
sources). TSP is non-gaseous and subject to physical forces (i.e., gravitational, etc.), thus
limiting its dispersion to the higher elevations. Therefore, only the ground level impacts for TSP
take into account ambient TSP concentrations.
3.1.1.4 Conclusions
The modeling analysis indicated that for a 2x600 MW facility, exceedances of the PRC SO,
Grade B1 and Grade I standards would occur in the mountain areas around the proposed plant.
The areas that exceed the standard are generally at elevations from 600 to 800 m-msl. The lower
terrain areas are also expected to exceed the PRC Grade 11 standard at distances from 1.5 to 2.0
srm from the plant.
For a 6x600 MW facility, additional areas of exceedance were obtained in the lower and mountain
areas around the proposed plant. All maximum impacts in the protected mountain areas were
predicted to exceed the PRC Grade I standards.
For PM, compliance with all standards is predicted in the-lower and protected mountain areas for
both the 2x600 MW and 6x600 MW plants. For the 6x600 plant only, exceedance of the PRC
Grade 11 standard occurred in the nearby mountain areas.
For NO,, the modeling analysis indicated that for a 2x600 MW facility, exceedances of the World
Bank and PRC Grade 11 and Grade I standards would occur in the mountain areas around the
proposed plant. The areas that exceed the standard are generally at elevations from 600 to
3-20

800 m-msl. The lower terrain areas are also expezted to exzeed the PRC Grade II standard a.
distances from 1.5 to 2.0 km from the plant. The World Bank- standards will be met in the lower
areas.
For a 6x600 MW facility, additional areas of exceedance were obtained in the lower and mountain
areas around the proposed plant. All maximum impacts in the protected mountain areas were
predicted to exceed the PRC Grade I standards.
3.1.2 NOISE
Noise resulting from human activities can impact the health and welfare of both workers and the
general public. The level of impact is related to the magnitude of noise, which is referred to as
sound pressure level (SPL) with units in decibels (dB). Decibels are calculated as a logarithmic
function of SPL in air to a reference effective pressure, which is considered the hearing threshold,
or:
SPL = 20 log.0 (PelPo)
where:   Pe = measured effective pressure of sound wave in micropascals (juPa), and
Po = reference effective pressure of 20 jPa.
To account for -the effect of how the human ear perceives sound pressure, sound pressure level is
adjusted for frequency. Tlis is referred to as A-weighting (dBA), which adjusts measurements
for the approximated response of the human ear to low-frequency SPLs [i.e., below 1,000 hertz
(Hz)] and high-frequency SPLs (i.e., above 1,000 Hz). This section addresses the potential noise
impacts of the project to the surrounding area.
3.1.2.1 Reiulations and Criteria
World Bank Guidelines
The World Bank has developed noise guidelines related to annual average sound levels that are
designed to protect public and welfare. These levels are applicable to indoor and outdoor areas
and certain types of land use. The World Bank guidelines correspond to sound levels
recommended by USEPA. These recommendations are discussed in the following section.
3-21

U.S. Environmental Protection Aaencv
USEPA (1974) has developed indoor and outdoor noise criteria for various land uses as a guide
for protecting public health and welfare (see Table 1.2-5). These criteria relate to short-term and
day-night average SPLs. The L., is the equivalent constant SPL that would be equal in sound
energy to the varying SPL over the same time period. The L. is the 24-hour average SPL
calculated for two daily time periods, i.e., day and night, but has 10 dBA added to nighttime
SPL. The equation for Ld, is:
L, = 10 log 1124 [15 x 10(UhO) + 9 x io(LA '"']
where:   Ld = daytime L,, for the period 0700 to 2200 hours, and
Ln = nighttime L.* for the period 2200 to 0700 hours.
For residential areas, EPA recommends an outdoor L,, of 55 dBA.
3.1.2.2 Existing and Pronosed Noise Sources
The noise levels and sound power levels associated with the proposed power plants were
calculated using equipment-specific octave band data developed from Edison Electric Institute
(EEI) Electric Power Plant Environmental Noise Guide (2nd edition. 1984). The sound power
levels and octave band data for the proposed Phase I (2x600 MW) and Phase HI (6x600 MW)
configurations are presented in Table 3.1-10.
3.1 .3 Noise ImRact Methodology
The impact evaluation of the project was performed using the NOISECALC computer program
(NYDPS, 1986). NOISECALC was developed by the New York State Department of Public
Service and modified by KBN to assist with noise calculations for major power projects. Noise
sources are entered as octave band SPLs. Coordinates, either rectangular or polar, can be
specified by the user.
All noise sources are assumed to be point sources; line sources can be simulated by several point
sources. Sound propagation is calculated by accounting for hemispherical spreading and three
other user-identified attenuation options: atmospheric attenuation, path-specific attenuation and
barrier attenuation. Atmospheric attenuation is calculated using the data specified by the

American National Standard Instirute's (ANSI's) meThod for the calculation of the absorption of
sound by the atmosphere (ANSI, 1978). Path-specific artenuation can be specified to account for
the effects of vegetation, foliage and wind shadow. Directional source characteristics and
reflection can be simulated using path-specific attenuation. Attenuation due to barriers can be
specified by giving the coordinates of the barrier. Barrier attenuation is calculated by assuming
an infinitely long barrier perpendicular to the source-receptor path. Total and A-weighted SPLs
are calculated. Background noise levels can be incorporated into the program and are used to
calculate overall SPLs.
NOISECALC was perforrned to predict the maximum noise levels produced by the proposed and
existing noise sources with and without background noise levels. Only atmospheric attenuation
was assumed.
The noise impact was determined in a radial pattern around the existing and proposed facilities.
3.1.2.4 ITM1act Analvsis Results
Figures 3.1-2 and 3.1-3 represent isopleths of SPLs (given in dBA) that are predicted for the
proposed Phase I and Phase III power plant project, respectively: As noted from the figure, the
noise levels exceeds the World Bank guidelines of 70 dBA at the northwest corner and southern
power plant property boundaries for the Phase I configuration. Likewise, the Phase m
configuration also exceeds the World Bank noise guidelines at the northeast corner, as well.
However, these noise levels drop off sharply with distance from the power plant and the nearest
residential areas are more than I km away.
Based on these results, no significant impact to public health and welfare from noise levels is
predicted.
3.1.3 WATER RESOURCES
Circulating Water System
The project will utilize a recirculating cooling water system with a natural draft cooling tower.
The total circulating water flow for the first stge of 2x600 MW is 143,465 m'/h (40 m'/s), while
for the ultimate planned capacity of 6x600 MW the circulating flow will be 430,395 nm/h
(120 m'ls). lThe unit system with one cooling tower for each 600 MW generating unit, as well as

one pump house for each cooling tower will b- used. The cooling towers will be of the
hyperbolic natural draft type, each with a cooling sur.aze of 9.250 m . After evaporative cooling
in the tower, the cooling water will be pumped via circulating water pumps to the condenser in
the main power building to cool the exhaust steam of turbine, following which the heated water
will be returned to the cooling tower.
MakeuR Water System
The required amount of makeup water for the first stage 2x600 MW units is 3,864 m3/h
(Table 1.3-2). A water balance for the proposed plant is provided in Figure 1.3-4; the makeup
water amount for 6x600 MW units will be 11,512 m3fh (32 m3Is). Makeup water will supplied
from the two wellfields of the Wulongkou Aquifer. One wellfield is located near the villages of
Xiyaotou and Liu along the left bank of Qin River. A reservoir and boost pumphouse will be
provided between Xiyaotou and Liu to store and subsequently boost the makeup water to the
power plant area. Groundwater from the other wellfield near the village of Liizhai will be
pumped from the well directly to the power plant. Cooling tower makeup will be treated initially
by a weak acid cation exchanger and then routed to the cooling tower.
Industri2l Wastewater Treatment and Disgosa
The hourly estimated volume of wastewater and treated sanitary effluent is 692 m3/h for
2x600 MW (919 m3Is), and 2,076 m3'h for 6x600 MW (2,756 m3's). Expected volumes of
wastewater streams to be generated by the Qinbei power plant are shown on the facility water
balance (Figure 1.3-4).
Water quality of the expected Qinbei wastewater discharge has been assumed to be roughly
equivalent to the wastewater presently generated by the existing power plants of Jiaozuo, Dan He,
and Xin Xiang, which are situated in the region of the proposed plant. Water quality results from
these facilities are presented in Table 3.1-11.
According these wastewater quality analyses, all wastewater streams discharged from the main
outlet of the three power plants comply with the PRC Grade I standard of integral wastewater
discharge (GB8978-88). The item of most concern in the wastewater discharge of the Jiaozuo
Power Plant (which is nearest to Qinbei Power Plant) CODcr, which is shown to be 32 mgIL,
slightly higher than Grade III standard of surface water.

It is experted that the final wastewater qualitv o ithis effluent will be lower than the PRC
Grade III water quality standards for surface water. After treatment, the wastewater will
discharged into the treated industrial water basin for recovery and reuse as appropriate. Excess
industrial wastewater of Qinbei Power Plant, will be discharged after treatment into the Baijian
River/riverbed. Since the B,ijian is a seasonal river, it typically has no flow for much of the year
except following a heavy rain or flood period.
Following intermittent organic acid cleaning of the boiler, boiler washwater will be routed to the
boiler furnace to be incinerated, after pH value adjustment and filtration.
3.1.3.1 Groundwater Impacts
Groundwater Withdrawal ImRacts
The ultimate 6x600 MW project requires the provision of 1 1,592 m31h of groundwater from the
Wulongkou Aquifer for condenser cooling and other plant water requirements. Computer
modeling of this ultimate withdrawal was conducted by the NWEPDI to assess the potential
drawdown of the aquifer in response to this demand.
Drawdown was modeled for I I pairs of production wells arranged in a line through the center of
the production zone of the aquifer, located from 2 to 4 km southwest of the proposed plant site.
Drawdown (in meters) in the aquifer is shown for 30-day and 150-day modeling scenarios
(Figure 3.1-4). This modeling, as well as background studies conducted by the National Mineral
Reserve Commission (NMRC), indicates that 3.22 m3/s could be withdrawn from the aquifer for
this period of time.
The modeling conducted by NWEPDI covers a period of 150 days. The drawdown effect from
welifield pumping, however, has not reached steady-state conditions by the end of this period so
that consequently, actual drawdown and adverse impacts resulting from a depressed water table
may be greater than indicated by modeling conducted to date.
Groundwater withdrawal modeling reviewed for this EA did not include a number of factors that
could either reduce or exacerbate assessed impacts. For example, no recharge to the aquifer from
either bed infiltration from the Qin River or from rainfall was utilized. Consideration of
infiltration would serve to lessen expected drawdown over the long term. Also, based on review

of geologic cross-sections of the area, the presenze of a number of confining lavers in the
subsurface has been noted. These confining lavers and their possible effect on subsurface
groundwater flow, both horizontal and vertical, has not been taken in account in the groundwater
modeling. As a result, modeling results may not be sufficiently accurate to determine if
significant adverse impacts will or will not occur. In summary, it cannot be determined based on
model output available during EA preparation, if the Wulongkou Aquifer is capable of sustaining
the proposed demand for the project life at the 6x600 MW level.
Nevertheless, these modeling results show that, after 150 days, drawdown at the village of
Xinzhuan some 3 km west of the center of the wellfield is about 11 m. Two potable water wells
(Well Nos. 429 and 430) are located near Xinzhuan. These wells are each about 30 m deep, with
the upper 15 m in the productive gravel/cobble layer, while deeper layers are sub-clay. Sub-clay
layers are not expected to be very productive. Consequently, some impact to the ability of these
wells to supply water for potable use on a long-term basis appears likely. Similarly, drawdown at
Well No. 485 near the town of Wulongkou near the northwestern end of the wel1field appears to
be at least 10 m for the 150 day modeling scenario. Some adverse water supply impact at this
well location also seems likely as a result of proposed long-term pumping in the wellfield. No
other potable water wells have been identified within the cone of depression of the proposed
wellfield.
Withdrawals for the 2x600 MW first phase project were not modeled. However, potential
impacts would be proportionately less and may not cause significant impacts at nearby potable
water supply wells. Modeling for impacts at reduced water supply levels associated with the first
stage of generation capacity at Qinbei would still require that factors discussed previously be
considered.
Based on information obtained to date, the total amount of water in the aquifer was estimated to
be about 77,300,000 m3. This represents about 2.45 m'ls if the water was completely withdrawn
over the course of a year, a value less than the required amount for the 3,600 MW final buildout
(3.06 m'/s), even assuming all water in the various water-bearing strata of the aquifer is available
for pumpage and is being pumped. Obviously, some recharge to the aquifer will occur during the
course of the year, primarily through the Qin River bed. However, quantification of this recharge
has not yet been determined.

Impacts or wastewater Discharaec on Groundwater
A separate groundwater consideration relates to the discharge of industrial wastewater and cooling
tower blowdown to the Baijian River/riverbed (see Appendix C, Photograph 5). For the first
stage of the project (2x600 MW), approximately 692 m"Ih of wastewater will be discharged to the
riverbed (see Figure 1.3-4). This discharge includes cooling tower blowdown (102 m3/h), ash
wetting runoff (240 m'/h), plant drains (110 m3/h, domestic wastewater (100 m'/h), gland seal
cooling water (30 m'/h), air conditioning condensate (30 m3/h) and coal sluice wastewater
(80 m'/h). Non-blowdown portions of the discharge will receive treatment as indicated. Water
quality of the discharge is estimated in Table 3.1-11. Estimated total dissolved solids (TDS)
content of the discharge after four cycles of concentration and pretreatment of cooling tower
makeup is expected to be approximately 1,000 mg/L. This parameter will be dependent on the
quality of the intake water for the power plant and the effectiveness of the pretreatment regime.
As noted in Section 2.1.3, TDS levels in the wells supplying the plant ranges from 250 to
700 mg/L.
Although wastewater discharge is routed to the Baijian River, this river is usually dry over 90
percent of the year on average. As a result, the wastewater discharge from the facility is
essentially a groundwater discharge and an assessment of the potential impact to groundwater
resulting from this discharge, in the form of groundwater transport modeling is an appropriate
measure. Primary. parameters of concern in the potential discharge are TDS, lead, and fluoride.
Even TDS levels meeting potable water standards (1,000 mg/L) have the potential, in the long
term, to raise the levels of dissolved solids in the aquifer. Since the discharge will be upgradient
of the project wellfield, this may have the effect of raising the level of incoming dissolved solids
in the source groundwater, both raising pretreatment costs to the facility (for examnple,
demineralization, cooling tower makeup, and other processes and units requiring ultra-high water
quality) as well as reducing the efficiency of other systems (cooling tower).
Naturally occurring lead and fluoride are also of concern since they are shown by sampling
results to be somewhat elevated in background groundwater quality samples (Table 2.1-8).
Average lead in background water quality is 0.015 mglL and average background fluoride is
0.41 mglL, with several individual readings above 0.5 mg/L. An increase of concentration in the
cooling system and other plant systems of at least 100 percent (2 times) may be expected for all
3-32



14435Cn I - 
04/ 14/95
parameters present in the source water. Consequently, lead levels in the wastewater discharoe
may attain at least 0.03 mg/L and fluoride mav atain 0.8 mg/L on average and could exceed
1.0 mg/L with relative frequency given the variability in background water quality. Both of these
levels can exceed international standards for maximum acceptable concentrations in drinking
water, which range from 0.01 to 0.05 mglL and 0.8 to 4.0 mg/L for lead and fluoride,
respectively.
Discharge of the plant's wastewater to groundwater may be expected to result in a long-term
increase in the dissolved solids content of at least some portion of the water supply aquifer
downgradient of the proposed discharge. No characterization of the movement in the subsurface
of the proposed wastewater discharge nor the transport of pollutants contained in it has been
undertaken. As noted above, the proposed discharge will occur upgradient of the Wulongkou
Aquifer, which is the water supply for the project. The presence of a hydraulic connection
between the area of the proposed discharge seems likely. Consequently, the potential for the
discharge to adversely and significantly affect the quality of the water source in the long term
exists.
Potable water quality wells in the immediate area appear to all be on the opposite (right) bank of
the Qin River. Consequently, adverse impacts at such wells resulting from the introduction of
wastewater to the water table aquifer containing high dissolved solids and other potential
pollutants (lead, fluoride) would not be expected to occur.
3.1.3.2 Surface Water Impacts
As noted in Section 3.1.3.1, the plant's wastewater discharges will be directed to the Baijian
River/riverbed. For the first stage of the project, approximately 692 n'/h (0.19 m'ls) will be
discharged to the riverbed. Water quality of this discharge is presented in Table 3.1-11.
Imnacts to Baiiian River
Since the Baijian River is dry for much of the year, most of-the time wastewaters will reach
groundwater. However, during summer months, flow in the river may range from a peak flow of
4.68 m'/s to a lowest measured flow of 0.013 rn/s. The proposed wastewater discharge would
represent from 4 to 1,400 percent of this flow. Since the Baijian is ephemeral in nature, no
significant impacts to the Baijian River itself are expected to result from this discharge.
3-33



1443sC31.31-
Ot411'95
Impacts to Oin River
Wastewater discharges to the Baijian River during its flow periods can be assumed to reach the
Qin River. During times when the Baijian River has enough water to generate flow in the
riverbed, it may be assumed that the Qin River will be at relatively high flow as well, since both
rivers are subject to the same meteorological phenomena. The wastewater discharge of 0.19 m'/s
would represent approximately 3.3 percent, 1.6 percent, and 2.7 percent of the minimum average
monthly flows for the period of record for the months of July, August, and September,
respectively. On this basis, there would appear to be sufficient dilution in the Qin River during
periods when wastewater discharges would reach the Qin and that significant levels of the
pollutants of concern would not be expected in the water body.
Water Use Considerations
Groundwater withdrawals are likely to result in reduced flows in the Qin River as a result of bed
infiltration. The possible impact may be as high as 2 m'l/s on a continuous basis. During periods
of normal flow, this will not constitute a significant impact. However, during periods of low
river flow, bed infiltration may be relatively significant. Table 3.1-12 shows a Weibull Type II1
probability distribution function for flows in the Qin River from 1970 through 1989'. The
Weibull distribution shows that monthly average flow in the Qin River can be expected to be as
low as 2 m3/s every 4 to 5 years. Flow in the river downstream has virtually stopped on three
occasions in the last 15 years. Consequently, impacts to downstream irrigation uses may ensue if
bed infiltration is as high as suggested.
Water Reuse Issues
The NWEPDI has indicated that industrial water from the cooling water system for bearings and
air conditioning condensate will be recovered for reuse in the cooling tower circulation system, an
appropriate reuse. Similarly, cooling tower blowdown, plant industrial wastewaters and treated
sanitary effluent are proposed to be used for dust suppression in the coal pile and the ash disposal
yard, water for the bottom ash hopper, ash wetting, and landscape irrigation water. These
conservation measures could reduce water consumption and wastewater disposal volumes by a
'As noted in Section 2.1.3.1, the period of record for Qin River flow is from 1954 to 1989.
However, river flow at the Wulongkou Hydrologic Station just upriver of the plant site was
substantially curtailed around 1970. Consequently, flows since that time are more representative
of actual conditions.

significant amount at the proposed power plant. However, these conservation measures are not
shown on the water balance for the proposed facilitv.
Many of the non-cooling water uses initially described for the proposed power plant may be
reduced. For example, the maximum projected domestic water use for the first phase of the
project is estimated to be 130 m'/h [824,000 gallons per day (gpd)]. Since approximately 500
employees will be onsite and in the workers colony with their families (assuming 5 individuals per
family), this would imply that a water consumption of over 325 gpd per capita (gpcd), far in
excess of standard consumption rates for the United States of 80 to 130 gpcd. Maximum daily
demand usually can be assumed to be 150 percent of the average annual rate, or 120 to 195 gpcd,
still far below the estimated consumption rate (Kawamura, 1991). Similarly, the use of additional
drift eliminators would reduce water consumption by approximately 3.3 percent (130 m3/h) in the
first stage and by a total of 390 m'/h for the final phase.
3.1.4 LAND RESOURCES
Storage of coal will take place in the coal storage yard, located on the south side of the proposed
power plant site (Figure 1.3-3). The coal pile will be equipped with a settling pond to handle
runoff as well as coal transfer system washwater. Overflow from the settling pond will be
discharged to the Baijian River following coagulation and precipitation.
Standard engineering practice in China for lining of coal piles involves the laying and compaction
of a loess (silt) liner, followed by a layer of coal waste byproduct for additional stability. The
permeability of the loess liner is on the order of 10' to 10 cm/s (NWEPDI, 1995), or a
minimum of 3.15 m/y if water were to be present in the pile on a continuous basis. However,
since only 630 mm of rain falls in the region annually, this would represent the maximum amount
of possible annual leachate from the coal pile, assuming that proper management of rainfall is
occurring. Evaporative losses will remove most of this water from the coal pile.
Since impacts from coal pile leachate typically are expected to be suspended solids and pH, no
significant impacts to groundwater from this potential wastewater source are expected.

Ash Handling and Disposal System
Impacts generally associated with ash disposal include the potential for groundwater contamination
from leachate or overflow. Since the proposed ash disposal vard will be constructed within the
Qin River floodplain, the restriction of the river channel upstream during peak flows is a potential
concern.
3.1.4.1 ImRacts to Water Resources
The project will use a dry flyash disposal method. Other than wetting for dust control, water
inputs to the ash disposal yard will be derived from precipitation. The power plant is located in a
region of China in which evaporation is high (1,564.5 mnrnlyr) and precipitation low
(629.8 mmlyr). Consequently, most of the time the ash will be in a relatively dry state.
According to 1983-1992 rainfall data compiled from the Jiyuan Meteorologic Station, 12 km
southwest of the power plant, the longest period of continuous rainy days [days with more than
0.1 millimeter per day (mm/d)] is 10 days, occurring from August 6 through 15, 1988, and with
a total precipitation of 182.5 mm. Under normal conditions, the ash will have a 25 percent
moisture content. The ash's maximum absorptive capacity is 57.6 percent (NWEPDI, 1994). If
rainfall of 182.5 mm over 10 days occurs, it is estimated that slightly more than a 0.5-m-thick
layer of ash would absorb the rainfall (without taking into account evaporative losses). Since the
ash will be stacked up to the design height of 11 m, only the upper 0.5 m of the ash would
become saturated under such adverse condition.
Therefore, there will be little potential for overflow of the ash yard. In the extremely unlikely
event that such an overflow would occur, it would be the result of very intensive rains which
would be expected to result in sufficient dilution of any pollutants contained in the
leachate/overfiow.
In order to prevent impacts to groundwater from leachate, a liner will be used that will achieve
10V impermeability or less. If clay is used, a liner 30 centimeters (cm) thick will be placed on
the ash disposal yard base. Tbe permeability coefficient of the clay is 3.1x105 centimeters per
second (cm/s), and will be reduced to 1xl 0 to lx 10' cm/s after vibrating and ramping. If a
polymer membrane is employed, permeability could be achieved as low as 10'- cm/s. Final
selection of liner type will be based upon cost factors.

These measures are intended to prevent impacts to groundwater resulting fTom potential leakage
from the ash disposal vard. Nearby villages are to the north of The ash disposal yard. and are
situated upgradient of the yard in terms of groundwater flow. Based on the groundwater flow
direction, any leachate from the ash disposal yard would be expected to encounter the water table
aquifer under the Qin River as well as the Qin River itself.
Ash disposal yard contaimnent dikes will be constructed of locally available soil materials. Since
soil in the area is highly permeable, it may be concluded that the dikes themselves will allow
ready seepage of liquids from within the ash disposal yard. The impact of such seepage both to
groundwater and the Qin River is difficult to quantify; however, extension of the liner to cover
the interior face of the dikes will minimize this possibility.
3.1.4.2 Ash Disposal Yard Overflow Potential
The proposed facility is located in an area of high evaporation and relatively low rainfall.
3.1.4.3 Flood Potential
There is some concern that the placement of the ash disposal yard within the floodplain of the Qin
River may create upstream flooding potential. This issue is addressed in Section 3.1.5.
3.1.4.4 Ash Reutilization Plan
EPH has identified that the development of a comprehensive reutilization of flyash and slag
(bottom ash) is necessary to minimize impacts associated with the disposal of combustion
byproducts. 7he power plant will utilize a dry handling system for flyash and will manage flyash
and bottom ash separately to preserve flexibility in ash reuse and disposal options. The following
three comprehensive utilization approaches of ash and slag are under consideration by the local
government:
1. Increase fabricated ash brick manufacture, estimated to consume 100,000 tons of
flyash and 50,000 tons of slag per year,   -
2.  Expand an existing cement factory in nearby Jiyuan City, utilizing flyash as an
aggregate material, estimated to consume 100,000 to 120,000 tons annually, and
3.  Soil improvement using flyash as a soil amendment, potentially using up to
6,000,000 TPY.
3-38



14435C/3 1 -39
041141t95
The use of flyash as a soi] amendment on such a potentially large scale is not recommended
without benefit of prior study on a pilot basis. Several potential drawbacks may be associated
with this practice, including soil alkalinization, leaching, or uptake of heavy metals, and hard setup
of silty or clay soils.
While data on the acid/base nature of soils in the area are not available, flyash should be used
with great caution on soils that are not acidic. Arid environments such as those near the proposed
site tend toward alkaline soils. The application of such materials would be expected to contribute
to soil alkalinization. This process may exacerbate the potential leaching of heavy metals or
metals compounds from the ash into the environment in a relatively uncontrolled form. Lastly, if
clays or silts are present in the soil matrix in sufficient quantity, the mixture may hard set,
thereby impeding gaseous and liquid transfer processes in the soil and inhibiting agricultural use
of the land.
3.1.5 NATURAL HAZARDS
3.1-5.1 Flood Potential
Flood levels in Qin River range from 136.9 to 138.1 m-msl in reaches nearest the plant site. The
plant site, at over 180 m-msl, lies above the floodprone zone of the Qin River.
The ash disposal yard is proposed to be placed on a river beach terrace within the floodplain of
the Qin River. The construction of the dikes for ash containment would displace about
2.93 million m' and 3.63 million m' of floodplain storage for the 50- and 100-year storms,
respectively, for the first stage of project construction activities. No hydrologic modeling has
been presented to determine if significant upstream flooding will result from this filling within the
floodplain. Expansion of the ash disposal yard from 117 ha to 452 ha for subsequent stages of
the project would displace about an additional 6 million m' and 7.2 million m' of floodplain
storage for the respective design storms of 50 and 100 years.
The 100-year flood flow of the Baijian River nearest the proposed plant site is 1,430 m'/s, with a
corresponding flood level of 179.3 m-msl, and is lower than the elevation of the plant site
(181.1 m-msl). Consequently, when flowing, this river would not pose a flood risk for the
project site or the ash disposal yard.

3.1.52 'arthhuake Risk
The largest magnirude earthquake recorded within 150 km of the site was an earthquake
measuring 6.0 M, which struck near Luoyang and Jiaozuo cities. The greatest effects from two
large earthquakes in Hebei Province have measured MM Scale IV. The estimated potential
seismic intensity associated with 6.0 M earthquakes ranges from VII to VIII on the MM Scale.
According to the Henan Seismology Bureau, the Qinbei site is of seismic intensity VI on the
Chinese scale, which is equivalent to MM VI. A description of MM felt effects is provided in
Appendix E. Horizontal acceleration typically associated with earthquakes of this magnitude and
intensity could range from 0.07 to 0.20 g. An intensity potential of MM VII or VIII would
require that project structures be built to Unified Building Code (UBC) Zone 2 criteria or the
equivalent.

3.2 ECOLOGICAL EsXTRO I\%TEN7
Potential impacts to natural communities, biodiversity. wedlands and aquatic ecology from the
development of thermal power projects include the following:
1.  Removal of vegetation during construction with consequent loss of wildlife habitat;
2.  Dredging and filling of wetlands during construction;
3.  Adverse impacts to vegetation caused atmospheric and aquatic pollutants discharge.
during operation;
4.  Desiccation of wetlands caused by lowering of groundwater levels as a result of
withdrawals for process water; and
5.  Water quality impacts to aquatic resources.
3.2.1 VEGETATION REMOVAL AN'D LOSS OF WILDLIFE HABITAT
As described in Section 2.2, the proposed construction site for the Qinbei Power Plant consists of
disturbed land that presently holds only a sparse cover of ruderal, weedy vegetation and which
has long, been used for grazing or sporadic, rainfed agriculture. Leveling and clearing the
construction site will not result in the loss of any notable plant communities, and, therefore, is not
expected to impact wildlife habitat in a significant way.
The proposed ash disposal yard is located within a barren, sandy region that falls.outside the local
irrigation perimeter and partially within the floodplain of the Qin River. The area is virtually
without vegetation, and is not believed to contain wildlife habitat of any significance.
3.2.2 IMPACTS TO BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND ENDANGERED SPECIES
Because of the lack of any significant vegetative and wildlife resources including endangered
species, the clearing of the proposed power plant site and ash disposal yard during construction
area is not expected to cause any impacts to local or regional biodiversity and endangered species.
As mentioned in Section 2.2.3, the range of the rare. endemic plant Taihangia rupestris includes
the rocky escarpments of the Taihang Mountains to the north of the site. As further mentioned in
Section 2.2.3, two protected areas, one of which was created to conserve representative Taihang
forest communities, are also to the north of the power plant site (Figure 1.3-2). The potential for
adverse impacts to these areas from atmospheric emissions during power plant operation are
described in Section 3.2.4.

3.2.3 IMPACTS TO WETLANDS
As mentioned in Section 2.2.3, no wetlands arb tound within the p-oposed site of the Qinbei
Power Plant, or within the proposed ash disposal vard.
No wetland areas were observed within a radius of several km around the proposed power plant
wellfield (Figure 1.1-1), although the entire area was not examined exhaustively. However, the
land within a 5-km range downgradient of the wellfield is used in its virrual entirety for irrigated
agriculture or occupied by villages, and the presence of significant wetlands is unlikely.
3.2.4 AIR QUALITY INIPACTS
3.2.4.1 ImRacts to Ve!etation
As described in Section 2.2. 1, native vegetation in the project area has been highly altered. The
lowlands have virtual no forest or native vegetation besides grasses and shrubs, forest species
include hardwood trees such as popular. elm. beech and bamboo. Numerous orchards including
walnut exists. Principal agricultural crops include winter wheat, corn, corn, carrots, spinach, and
cabbave. The Taihang Mountains were originally covered by temperate broadleaf forest, though
only 27 percent of the area is now covered by forest, comprised of poplar, oak, ash, elm,
hackberry, and pistchio. Some evergreen species are also occur including pine and an
evergreens shrub, Plarydadus orientalis.
In veneral, the effects of air pollutants on vegetation occur primarily from SO2, nitrogen dioxide
(NO.), ozone (03), and PM. Effects from minor air contaminants such as fluoride, chlorine,
hydrogen chloride, ethylene, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide (CO), and pesticides
have been reported in the literature. The effects of air pollutants are dependent both on the
concentration of the contaminant and the duration of the exposure. The term injury, as opposed
to damage, is commonly used to describe all plant responses to air contaminants and will be used
in the context of this analysis. Air contaminants are thought to interact primarily with plant
foliage, which is considered to be the major pathway of exposure.
Injury to vegetation from exposure to various levels or air contaminants can be termed acute,
physiological, or chronic. Acute injury occurs as a result of a short-term exposure to a high
contaminant concentration and is typically manifested by visible injury symptoms ranging from
3-42



14435CM_3
041 13t9S
chlorosis (discoloration) to necrosis (dead areas). Pbysiological or latent injury occurs as the
result of a long-term exposure to contaminant comnentrations below that which results in acute
injury symptoms, whereas chronic injurv results from repeated exposure to low concentrations
over extended periods of time, often without an) visible symptoms, but with some effect on the
overall growth and productivity of the plant. In this assessment, a very conservative analysis was
used including using air quality modeling with constructed meteorological data as well as
assuming 100 percent of the particular air pollutant in the ambient air interacted with the
vegetation.
Sulfur Dioxide
SO", at elevated levels in the ambient air has long been known to cause injury to plants. Acute
SO, injury usually develops within a few hours or days of exposure and symptoms include
marginal, flecked, and/or intercostal necrotic areas which initially appear water-soaked and dullish
green. This injury generally occurs to younger leaves. Chronic injury usually is evident by signs
of chlorosis, bronzing, premature senescence, reduced growth and possible tissue necrosis.
Background levels of sulfur dioxide range from 2.5 to 25 Ag1m3 (Woltz and Howe, 1981).
Studies that address air quality effects to specific vegetative species native to the project area do
not exist, therefore, a review of the literature was made on air quality effects to similar species.
For short-term acute exposure in the United States, plants are grouped into three groups
depending upon their sensitivity to foliar injury: sensitive, intermediate and tolerant species
(Table 3.2-1). Tables 3.2-2 and 3.2-3 presents the reported response to SO, of several other crop
species and natural vegetation found in semi-arid areas. Not included in these groups are more
primitive plants such as lichens and mosses which are the most sensitive species to SOa. SO2
levels as low as 200 to 400 Aguml for 6 hours are reported to cause injury to such species (Hart et
al. 1988). For chronic exposure concentrations greater than 45 to 115 pg/rn are considered to
cause vegetation effects (USEPA, 1982). These and other reports show that broadleaf deciduous
trees are less tolerant than evergreen species. Plants from more arid areas are more tolerant to
SO, than plants from more temperate areas. A number of the plants in Tables 3.2-1
through 3.2-3 are similar to species or varieties of plant found in the project area.
The predicted maximum SO. concentrations for the lowland areas in the vicinity of the proposed
plant and the protected and unprotected mountain areas (Table 3.2-4) are compared to the

reported SO: effects to vegetation. 1 zan be con.luded tha: no vegetation effects in the lowland
areas surrounding the plant or in the two prote:ted mounmain preserves from shon-term exposure
to SO: are predicted for the 1.200 MW facility or the 3.600 MfW facility.
Modeling of SO2 in the mountain areas reveals a sharp difference in SO, concentrations depending
upon the direction, elevation and distance from the plant. Very high short-term concentrations of
SO, capable of causing acute effects to vegetation are predicted to occur 2 km north and
particularly at an elevation range of 650 to 700 m for both Phase I and Phase III of the project.
Above and below this elevation, SO. concentrations drop significantly. Preliminary observations
indicate that the vegetation is very sparse in this impact area. Vegetation that occurs there will
show acute injury possibly resulting in death to vegetation in localized areas at least between 650
and 700 m.
In contrast, the Baisongling and Taihangshan protected areas to the east and west are predicted to
have SO, concentrations the same or lower than in the vicinity of the plant. No effects to
vegetation in these protected areas are predicted.
Nitrogen Dioxide
A review of the literature indicates areat variability in NO: dose-response relationship in
vegetation. Acute NO, injury symptoms are manifest as water-soaked lesions, which first appear
on the upper surface, followed by rapid tissue collapse. Low-concentration, long-term exposures
as frequently encountered in polluted atmospheres often do not induce the lesions associated with
acute exposures but may still result in some growth suppression. Citrus trees exposed to
470 pg/rm' of NO2 for 290 days showed injury (Thompson et at., 1970). Sphagnum exposed for
18 months at an average concentration of 11.7 pg/mr showed reduced growth (Press er a., 1986).
The maximum ground-level NO: concentration (Table 3.2-5) predicted to occur in the vicinity of
the power plant and in the protected mountain areas during the operation of the proposed project
(both 1,200 and 3,600 MW facilities) are well below reported effects levels. However, predicted
NO, concentrations in the non-protected mountain areas are above concentrations reported to
cause effects.

SO, - NO, Sy.neroism
It has been demonstrated that NO: in ombnination, with certain con:entrations of SO: can result in
synergistic plant responses (i.e., leaf injury is observed at concentrations below the injury
thresholds for each of these air contaminants in isolation). A visible injury threshold may occur
at 2-hour SO. and NO, exposures of 1.310 .gIm' and 940 sgIm', respectively (USEPA, 1982).
Maximum predicted shon-term concentrations are below the range of concentrations where
SO,_NO. synergistic effects have been reported to occur for the vicinity of the plant and in the
protected mountain areas. Predicted concentrations are above the reported effect levels in the
non-protected mountain areas.
Carbon Monoxide
Concentrations of CO even in polluted atmospheres are not detrimental to vegetation (USEPA,
1976). CO has not been found to produce detrimental effects on plants at concentrations below
114,500 Fg/m' for exposures from I to 3 weeks (USEPA, 1976). The predicted maximum
concentrations are well below levels reported to cause detrimental effects.
Particulates
By comparing predicted concentrations (Table 3.2-6) with the few injury threshold values reported
in the literature (Darley, 1966; Krause and Kaiser, 1977), no potential effects on vegetation in the
lower valley or protected areas are predicted. because this concenration is below the values
reported to adversely affect plants. Non-protected areas may be affected.
3.2.4.2 Imoacts to Human Health
The major human health effect of SO: is bronchoconstriction, reflected in increased airway
resistance and decreased expiratory flow rates. Chemically induced bronchitis and tracheitis can
also occur. Because of the high solubility of SO. in aqueous solutions, it is readily absorbed upon
contact with moist surfaces of the nose and upper respiratory tract. Absorbed SO, is rapidly
transferred into the circulatory system from all regions of the respiratory tract. Factors that can
increase penetration and deposition of SO. in the respiratory tract include mouth and oronasal
breathing, increased ventilation rates. and presence of airborne particles that may act as carriers
of SO.. As a consequence, exercising individuals are more sensitive to SO. than resting
individuals. Because of sensitive air passages. asthmatics and atopic individuals are more

sensitive to SO: than healthy inJividiuals. In addition, it has been obsenred that a rapid 'step
fiunction" increase in SO. exposure is more likely to result in a reflex bronchoconstriction than a
gradual increase in SO, [USEPA, 1982a; World Health Organization (WHO), 19871.
Human health standards are set to provide a mar-in of safety to protect human health and public
welfare from significant adverse effects. The human health standards are also set to protect
sensitive ponions of the population. i.e., asthmatics and atopics. Asthmatics are individuals with
recurrent episodes of coughing, wheezing, and breathlessness resulting from reversible airway
obstruction caused by constriction, bronchial wall swelling, and accumulated secretions
(USEPA, 1982a). Individuals with non-asthmatic atopic disorders have allergies such as
hayfever, etc. Such individuals have more sensitive air passages than healthy individuals.
In healthy populations, the range of sensitivities includes mouth breathers who inhale and are
exposed to larger doses of SO.. The effects also depend upon breathing rate and its relationship
to dosage. Individuals who are exercising show greater sensitivity than people who are resting
because their higher ventilation rates increase SO: exposure to the respiratory system. Children
are considered a sensitive segment of the population since they are generally more active outdoors
and as a group contain a somewhat higher percentage of asthmatics and atopics.
A review of the health effects literature shows that three levels of effects are used in determining
human health effect criteria and in setting standards: no-observed-effect level (NOEL), lowest-
observed-effect level (LOEL), and significant effect level for peak human exposure (see
Tables 3.2-7 through 3.2-9). Exposure to less than 655 Ag/ml SO, for up to 60 minutes is
considered the NOEL for free-breathing individuals. Exposures to concentrations of 1,965 Fg/m3
for the same period will cause significant effects in asthmatics.
Increase in morbidity in persons with bronchitis occurs when SQ concentrations exceed
500 gg/m' for 24 hours. Increase in morbidity as reflected in the number of hospital admissions
(                    is considered to occur when SO, concentrations range from 300 to 500 Fg/ma   for 24 hours
(Federal-Provincial Advisory Committee on Air Quality, 1987).
An increase in mortality rates is considered to occur when the 24-hour concentration is greater
than 1,000 gglm' (Federal-Provincial Advisory Committee on Air Quality, 1987). Other studies

suggest that mortalitv car. increase an *'nn.:ntra:ions as louk as 500 gA'. but no threshold ha-
been defined (USEPA, 1982b).
Mortality has been observed in combinations of SQ and PM and smoke (Table 3.2-9). This
relationship cannot clearly establish a threshold etfect. Because of the uncertainty in the exposure
conditions and the synergistic relationship of SO, and PM, WHO (1987) recommends a protection
factor of 2 be placed on the morbidity and mortality data to account for this uncertainty. As a
result, WHO recommends a protection level from the combined effects of SO, and PM of
125 ;Lg/m3 for 24 hours for both SO. and PM (Table 3.2-10).
Based on the conservative modeling, no effects to human health are predicated in the lower valley
or the protected mountain areas from SO. (Table 3.2-4) emitted from the 1,200 MW facility. At
the 3,600 MW designed facility, no significant human health problems from SO, are predicted for
the lower valley and protected mountain areas. If there are inhabitants in the non-protected
mountain area, significant human health effects will likely occur. This is an area that is assumed
to be uninhabited.
Combined predicted PM concentrations (Table 3.2-6) and SO, concentrations are not expected to
cause human health effects in the lower valley or protected areas. 'Effects to human, if they occur
in non-protected mountain areas, are high enough to cause human health effects.
3.2.4.3 Impacts To Wildlife
Air pollution effects from fossil fuel energy facilities to wildlife have included mortality and
injury to animals exposed to high levels of emissions to subacute physiological and behavioral
changes from lower exposures (Newman. 1979). Exposure can be from the inhalation, ingestion,
or adsorption of pollutants.
Secondary USEPA standards have been set to protect public welfare, but physiological and
behavioral effects have been observed at and below these standards. The primary effects at
subacute levels include:
1.  Respiratory stress involving alteration in respiratory physiology,
2.  Reduction in the immune response of animals, and
3.  Decreased abundance of vertebrate and invenebrate animals.

Studies have established an apparen: ceneti- va7iabili:v in the sensitivitv of animals to low levels
of SO-. Insects including pollinators have be-en shown to be sensitive to SO. Fliht activity in
bees is reduced by SO. At Colstrip, Montana. in the United States, simulated field studies using
low levels of SO, have demonstrated ecological effects at concentrations below the standard,
including reduced trappings and movements of small mammals and invertebrate consumers in a
grassland ecosystem.
Insect pest infestation in trees is sometimes intluenced by SO-. Wentzel and Ohnesorge (1961,
Forstarchiv 32:177-186) report insect pest infestation of spruce forests in Germany by sawflies.
This infestation was correlated with SO. and other emissions. The reported values fall within the
3-hour and 24-hour annual standards. Besides the population increase in response to SO, and
other emissions (either direct or indirect effects), a significant reduction in parasitism by natural
biological controlling agents was observed in the areas of high SO: emissions. Insectivorous birds
are sensitive to SO, emissions and show a reduced nesting in areas with increasing SO2 emissions
(Newman, 1985).
Sufficient studies are not available to draw the same conclusions on the sensitivity of animals to
SO. as to humans, but similar factors affecting sensitivity such as ventilation rate and respiratory
condition apply. Some animals are more sensitive than humans. The most sensitive animal
species is the guinea pig with a reported SO, LOEL for respiratory effects of 420 Lglem for
I hour (USEPA, 1982b). Mortality has been observed in rats at very high Sa concentrations,
e.g., daily SO, exposures of >262,000 ug/ml (USEPA, 1982b). Fog conditions and the presence
of SO, produce the formation of sulfuric acid mist (HSOj. Animals are more sensitive to H-SO
than SO.. Guinea pigs show effects as low as 100 ;.gI/m3 H-SO, at 1-hour exposures. Rabbits are
reported to be affected by H.SO, at levels ranging from 100 to 300 AgCi' for 1 hour. Donkeys
showed effects to H1SO, at concentrations of 100 to 1000 pg/m' (WHO, 1987).
A review of the literature of historic episodic conditions in the United States (e.g., Donora,
Pennsylvania) and in Europe (e.g., London and the Meuse Valley of Belgium) reveals that
domestic animals showed the first symptoms to peak SO, exposures. This response may be due to
higher exposure, i.e., living outdoors, and/or higher sensitivity.

No impac:s to wildlife habitar in the lowlani areas or the two protected mountain areas are
predicted since no effects to vegetation from SO_ are predicted. In lozalized areas on Taihang
Mountain, wildlife habitat if it exists will be adversely affected. In regard to direct effects to
wildlife, the same conclusion for predicted etfects to humans apply to wildlife. No effects or no
significant effects are predicted for the lower valley and protected mountain areas. Any wildlife
in the non-protected mountain area will be affected. It is likeiv that any wildlife living in this
area will move away or avoid the area.
The Baisongling Reserve was created for protection of the macaque monkeys (Rhesus macaques).
The predicted air quality concentrations are below the levels known to effect humans and other
animals. No effects to macaque monkeys are predicted.
Trace Metals
Trace metals such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury and others when found in high concentrations in
the atmosphere can be a threat to human health and the environment. Primary exposure comes
from ingestion of vegetation and/or water with high trace metals level. Contamination of
vegetation occurs through deposition on the leaf surfaces or uptake by plants from the soils.
Tables 3.2-11 and 3.2-12 present the predicted ambient concentrations (uglmr) and predicted
deposition values (g/mr) for important trace metals emitted from the facility. Because of the lack
of information on the bulk density of soils in the vicinity of the facility and in the protected and
unprotected areas, calculations of soil concentrations were not possible. The following is a brief
discussion of the various exposure levels that have been reported for trace metals emitted from
this facility.
Arsenic
Naturally occurring levels of As in plants range from 0.01 to 5.0 pg/g (EPA, 1989). A
concentration of 5 to 20 ug/g in plants is considered excessive (Gough et al., 1979). No
observable effects to vegetation are reported at soil concentrations less than 25 mg totl Askg soil
or less than 3.9 ugim' in air (Eisler, 1998).

Cadm ium
Cadmium is a relatively rare element that resides in narure at levels of 0.15 to 0.2 Fgl.
Generally, 3 to 5 Ag/Lg retards the growth of plants (Gough er al., 1979). Health protection has
been recommended for ambient air concentrations of 0.03 ug/nm' `average case' (Eisler, 1985).
Chromium
A soil concentration of 1,370 to 2,740 tg/l chromium was reported to cause chlorosis in citrus
(Gough et ia., 1979), but liquid cultures that contained 150 uglg were toxic to citrus seedlings.
Cohalt
Plant concentrations as high as 2,000 to 10.000 Mg-/ cobalt have been detected in leaves of
persimmon and ash, respectively (Gough et al., 1979). Cobalt was reported to cause chlorosis
and stunting in a variety of plants at levels from 6 to 142 ygfg in soils (Aller er al., 1990).
Mercury
Although mercury compounds are toxic to bacteria and fungi, higher plants are relatively resistant
to mercury poisoning. Tea plants growing above mercury-rich deposits contained as much as
3.5 jLglg without showing signs of toxicity. Apparently healthy-spanish moss plants collected had
a mercury content of 0.5 ;gIg (Gough er al., 1979). From the few studies available on the
effects of mercury on plants, it seems as if mercury is not concentrated to a great extent (Gough
ertal., 1979).
Nickel
The general range of excessive or toxic amounts of nickel in most plant species varies from 10 to
100 ppm (Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 1984). The annual amount of 3.39x105 iLg/g predicted for
the proposed unit to be absorbed by vegetation is 3.4xlIO7 to 3.4x I0  times the values at which
growth retardation was observed.
Vanaditm
Plants absorb and accumulate vanadium differentially. with concentrations in various plants
ranging from 20 to 700 jLg/g (Gough et al.. 1979). However, phytotoxic responses were
observed in some plants grown in soils at a concentration of 140 g/g (Aller et al., 1990).

3.2.4.4 Impactr to BiodivercitN :nd Endnn2tired Speciec
No significan; impacts to biodiversimv and listed endangered and threatened species are predicted.
As discussed above no effects to vegetation and wildlife are predicted except in the narrow zone
of the Taihang Mountains at least between 650 and 700 m. Unique plant and/or wildlife
resources in this area have not been surveyed. Because of the lack of information floral and
faunal surveys are recommended to confirm conditions (see Section 5.0, Recommended Mitigation
and Monitoring). Predicted SO. concentrations in the two preserves are below the threshold
effect level for plants and animals.
Only one rare plant, Taihangia rupestris (taihangua), is reported to occur in the region. This
species is reported to occur in small scattered stands in two localities in the southern portion of
the Taihang Mountain on the Henan side. It is reported to grow in sparse woods on cliffs at an
altitude of 1,000 to 1,300 m. If this plant occurs in the area of predicted maximum impacts it
should be found above the predicted elevation where Sa concentrations cause adverse vegetation
effects.

3.3 SOCIAL AN'D CU-LTURAL IMNPACTS
3.3.1 CHANGES TO LAND USE
No formal land use classification system is currently implemented within Henan Province;
therefore, the allocation of the site for power development does not violate local or provincial
land use or zoning procedures. The site is not used for agricultural production or regularly for
any other activity; therefore, impacts associated with utilizing the site for power development are
not considered to be adversely significant.
As noted previously, during public meetings at which villagers were briefed on development of
the power plant and associated impacts, villagers viewed the change in land use as positive and
anticipate the station to have a positive impact on their quality of life.
3.3.2 RESETILEMENT
Since the site designated for the power plant and associated facilities is not currently inhabited, no
resettlement will result from the project.
3.3.3 DEMOGRAPHIC/EMPLOYMENT/ECONOMIC IMIPACTS
During construction, population at the workers colony immediately surrounding the site will
increase to 5,000 workers. During construction, technically skilled workers will be brought in
from other EPH facilities, while laborers will be hired locally. During operation, workers at the
facility will come from Jiyuan City and the surrounding villages and will not inhabit the site on a
permanent basis. Local villages already possess an infrastructure to accommodate increased
demand of induced or secondary development. Moreover, PRC laws and regulations regarding
land ownership and inhibition make the likelihood of significant induced development and hence
significant spontaneous development unlikely.
The construction of the Henan Qinbei Power Project is expected to have a positive impact on
local populations through increased employment during construction, increased economic activity
associated with an increase in support services to the facility and its workers, and improved
electricity access for the surrounding villages.
3-65



1443J5CI33-
04 14195
3.3.4 TRANSPORTATION I.NIPACTS
Impacts from transportation of construction materials bv rail to the site will occur on a temporary
basis during project construction. During operation, coal will be transponed by rail to the site
daily at a rate of 3,000/tons per train and 12,000 TPD. This will increase rail transportation to
the site an additional eight trips each day. The rail line is considered sufficient to satisfy the
increased traffic, and with relatively light traffic (four stops at Qinbei station per day), increased
impacts associated with fuel transportation is estimated to be minimal.
As discussed in the project description, roads to the site will be constructed that will improve site
accessible by vehicular traffic as well as improve access to the surrounding villages. A dedicated
road will be constructed for transponing ash and bottom ash to the ash disposal facility. The road
will pass through open farmland no closer than 100 m from the nearest villages.
Twenty-ton trucks will be used for the coal ash transport in order to lower the ultimate number of
vehicle trips and reduce the ash disposal impact. Assuming a 12-hour day, Phase I would require
13 round trips per hour and Phase m would require 39 round trips per hour. Mitigation for the
actual trips will include limiting the trucks to daytime hours where feasible. The road will be
paved and maintained to provide for safe traffic operating conditions. The ash will be transported
in a moist condition or covered to limit dust. The 100 m distance from the nearest village is
considered adequate to assure pedestrian safety since the road is a limited access facility. The
road will be sited so that it does not conflict with the local agricultural land use patterns. Finally,
designated areas for crossing will be established to provide for greater safety to both pedestrian
and farm equipment traffic.
3.3.5 CULTURAL RESOURCES
As noted previously, a letter of confirmation from the Jiyuan City Cultural Bureau is included in
Appendix B indicating that the project site is not considered protected since no resources of
cultural or archaeological significance are known to exist in the project vicinity. Nevertheless,
prevention of impacts associated with accidental finds during construction is included in the
mitigation section of the EA.

14435C.'z3367
0.'14/95
3.3.6 INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
No adverse impacts to indigenous or tribal populations will occur as a result of the facilitv since
none currently exist in the project area. As noted previously, the villages surrounding the power
plant vicinity are inhabited exclusively by famnilies from the predominant ethnic group of Han who
have inhabited the area for generations.
3.3.7 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
3.3.7.1 Power Plant Safetv and Health Background
Efficiency and safety in electrical power plants can be greatly increased by careful planning of the
design, location and layout of the facility. Numerous injuries, illnesses, fires and possible
explosions can be prevented if appropriate measures are taken in the early stages of design.
Factors typically considered are nature of processes involved, design of the primary structures,
and the type of system equipment to be used.
The generation of electrical power involves the burning of coal, which produces steam. Tbe
steam is then used to drive turbines to produce electricity. Although process hazards involved in
the production of the electricity exist, numerous support functions subject workers to hazards
which result in the majority of industrial accidents.
Occupational Safety and Health Issues
The safety and health issues found in a coal-fired power plants are grouped into two categories.
These categories are process related and those incidental to the generation of electricity.
Process Hazards
The principle hazards of boiler furnaces and their associated fuel supplies, pipes, ducts, and fans
are fires and explosions.
Variations in the size distribution of raw coal may cause erratic or uncontrolled feeding of coal
into pulverizers. Coal may contain debris such as metal, wood, or rock which may cause coal
feeding interruptions or become a source of ignition. Since coal can form an explosive mixture
when airborne, an explosive mixture will likely develop if a momentary flameout occurs.
3-67



14435C?33-6g
04/ 14 '#95
Pulverizers themselves are potential sources for fires and explosions. Fires may oczur from
spontaneous combustion or the feeding of burning coal directly into the pulverizer. Airborne coal
dust will explode if the mixture exceeds 12.7 grams per cubic meter (g/m'). A special hazard is
the presence of methane gas that may be released from recently pulverized coal and may
accumulate in confined spaces.
Hydrogen will be used as a cooling agent for the Qinbei turbines. Hydrogen is extremely
explosive.
lnstallation and maintenance of safety devices to prevent overpressurization of boiler tubing is
critical for the protection of employees and equipment.
Electrical power generation and transmission poses a hazard to workers. High voltage may be
encountered at the turbine generators, transmission substations and associated wiring.
Incidental Safety and Health Hazards
Hazards incidental to the process but occurring as a result of process operations include;
1.  Exposure to boiler feedwater chemical,
2.  Heat stress,
3.  Exposure to hot steam lines and equipment, and
4.  Handling and disposal of ash.
Additional safety and health hazards to be considered as part of the operation of an electrical
power plant include the following;
1.  Working surfaces (such as floors, platforms, ladders, stairs, etc.),
2.  Emergency exit placement and maintenance,
3.  High noise exposure,
4.  Chemical exposure (including incidental use materials for maintenance, etc.),
5.  Handling of flammable and combustible materials,
6. Exposures to hazards of working in confined spaces (boilers, vessels, sewers, etc.),
7.  Control of hazardous energy (accidental startup of systems and equipment),
8.  Fire prevention and protection,
9.  Materials handling and storage,

14435C/33-69
04/14'95
10. Machine and equipment mechanical guarding,
11. Biohazards, and
12. Ergonomic design and operation of workstations.
33.7.2 Regulatorv Framework
In the case of Henan's power generation sector, occupational safety and health standards are
promulgated by the EPH to assure worker protection. Occupational health and safety is covered
by both provincial and national law in the PRC. The development of specific standards is a
sectoral obligation. These standards are described in the Safety Manual for the Operation of
Electric Power Plants in the Henan Province and are grouped in the following classifications.
1. Airborne dust and toxic particulates protection,
2. Protection against poisons,
3. Protection against occupational illnesses, and
4. Protection against radioisotopes.
The majority of the available standards are directed towards female workers in the workplace.
The standards published by PRC are focused primarily on the identification and control of hazards
which can cause occupational illness. Of particular note is the special emphasis on the female
workforce.
3.3.7.3 Adeguacv of Proiect Response
The EPH Safety Manual developed for the project is facility design intensive. Typical hazards
expected to be encountered, such as fire, dust and poison exposures, moving parts, and radiation
are referenced, although not in detail.
Although review of an English-language version by KBN was not possible, it appears that the
Safety Manual is deficient with reference to safe work pracTices and procedures which are
necessary to implement policies and assure safe operation and maintenance of the facility.
The NWEPD1 EA document presents a series of occupational hazard descriptions and commits the
Qinbei project to adherence to the sector work safety policy recommendations. Specific reference
is made to the following:
3-69



14435C.'33-70
04/14195
1.  Fire prevention, inciudin, the incorporation of fire access lanes, alarms, and reduction
of flammable gas into the project design.
2. Prevention of poisoning, dust inhalation, and chemical injurv, including the
incorporation of measures to ventilate adequately, and install chemical leak alarms.
3. Prevention of electric shock by following the Electric Technical Design Code for
Machinery during installation.
4. Prevention of mechanical injury by shielding moving parts, especially rotating
machinery and conveyor belts, by assuring adequate lighting, and implementing
hardhat rules for workers in hazardous areas.
5. Prevention of thermal stress by providing air-conditioning, space heating or adequate
ventilation in buildings.
6. Prevention of noise injuries by following noise limit standards for specific equipment,
providing insulating covers for noisy machinery such as steam turbines, cushers,
providing mufflers on high-volume air exhausts, and equipping the doors and walls of
work areas with sound-insulating material. Noise limits for new sources according to
the EPH guidelines range from 85 dBA for an 8-hour exposure, to 94 dBA for a
1-hour exposure.
7. Preventing microwave radiation by observing the EPH Worker Safety standards,
which call for microwave exposure not to exceed a daily aggregate dose of
400 microwaves per square centimeter (mw/cm2), or an average hourly exposure of

4.0 ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
4.1 MANAGENMENT ALTERNATIVES
As described in Section 1.3.1, the present installed capacity of the Henan Power Grid is 5,492
MW, comprised of one hydro- and eleven thermo-electric plants. Predicted power load in Henan
province is expected to reach 15,600 MW within 10 years, a figure nearly three times greater
than can be served by current installed capacity. Without an aggressive campaign of construction,
energy shortfalls and load-shedding will occur in Henan within the next several years. The "no-
project alternative" could worsen this expected shortage and result in significant social and
economic impacts.
Henan is connected to the Central China Power grid via a double-circuit 220 kV transmission
system. Additional thermal power production is planned within the Central China Power grid that
could be transferred to Henan province on a limited basis. However the consumption of power
throughout China has increased steadily at a rate of approximately 20 percent per annum since the
late 1950s, and will only accelerate over the next decade. Transfer from other provinces would
fall far short of meeting Henan's projected needs.
Energy conservation would produce benefits. EPH has an active energy conservation plan that
entails adaptation of new, higher efficiency transmission technologies, improved management of
distribution, and adaptation of more energy-efficient heavy equipment in the industrial sector. It
is estimated that the program will produce a net savings of 77.74x105 MW/h over the next
7 years, or equivalent to output of a 127 MW power plant operating at 100 percent capacity over
the same period. Though significant, the savings does not obviate the need for new power plant
construction.
EPH does not consider postponing the retirement of older units to be feasible since power plants
scheduled for decommissioning between 1996 and 1999 are over 30 years old, and their
rehabilitation is not deemed cost effective. There are only 21 small units with aggregate capacity
of 307 MW slated for retirement in Henan Province. Rehabilitation of these units would not
offset the requirement for construction of significant new capacity to meet growth in demand.

4.2 ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS
According to NWEPDI (1994), two sites were evaluated during the 1993 feasibility assessment.
One site is the current proposed location at Qinbei, and the second alternative is the Niezhang
plant site situated approximately 7 km to the northeast of Qinbei (see Figure 1.3-2)
KBN conducted air dispersion modeling using the Niezhang site alternative. Modeling results
indicated that the mountain slopes between 400 and 700 m altitude that lie 1.5 to 1.8 km to the
northeast of the Niezhang site, and which are entirely within the Baisongling Protected Area,
would be exposed to SO2 values at least four times higher than if the plant were located at the
Qinbei site. Predicted values for receptor locations within the Reserve range from 33 to
250 Ag/M2 So. concentrations for the 2x600 MW size (annual and 24-hour values, respectively).
Annual and 24-hour values within the protected area for the 6x600 MW size range from 94 to
754 gg/m2 SO2. As described in Section 3.2.4, concentration values in the ranges predicted for
both phases of the power plant's development not only exceed PRC Grade I air quality standards
(i.e., for protecting ecologically valuable areas), but chronic exposure may cause damage to
vegetation within the protected area. In contrast, no damage to either the Baisongling or
Taihangshan protected areas is predicted for the Qinbei site.
The NWEPDI (1994) document further states that the Qinbei site requires the construction of a
shorter rail spur than Niezhang, that a slightly longer transmission line route would be needed,
and that local sociological impacts would be higher since there are fewer options for housing
construction or plant workers near the latter town. Finally, NWEPDI asserts that all other
construction considerations are equivalent between the two sites.
4.3 WATER SUPPLY AND PRETREATMENT
Given the source water quality for the power plant, it may be possible to increase the design
cycles of concentration of the cooling system from 4 to 5. Cycling the concentrations up to
5 times would keep the recirculating water quality within limitations for sulfate, calcium, silica,
and magnesium without the need for significant adjustments to cooling water chemistry. The
increase in cycles would have three likely effects: a decrease by approximately 4 percent in
groundwater withdrawals, a decrease in the overall volume of wastewater discharge by a similar
rate (approximately 144 m31h), and an increase in total dissolved solids in the final wastewater of
about 150 mg/L.
4-2



14435C/4-3
03129195
Additionally, pretreatment of cooling tower circulation water for removal of calcium, silica.
sulfate, and magnesium could allow further cvcling of the cooling tower circulation water,
although the feasibility of this would also be dependent on other circulating water quality
parameters and may require significant water chemistry adjustments.
Alternative Water Sources
Potential water source alternatives which may be compared to the proposed source are
groundwater and the Qin River. The Wulongkou Aquifer is the most viable groundwater source
in proximity to the power plant. No other aquifer of similar capacity and quality exists in
reasonable proximity for consideration as an alternative water source.
The Qin River is the only surface water body in the region with sufficient flow or volume to
potentially supply the project with water. For 11 individual months in the previous 20 years,
flow in the Qin has been insufficient to supply project needs, not considering other existing uses
of the river's water such as irrigation. Thus, for dependable use of surface water, a storage
reservoir or dam would be necessary to ensure continuity of plant water supply. River water
quality is good as regards dissolved solids, although high suspended sediment concentration
during the river's flood periods would necessitate an additional filtration pretreatment step. Aside
from cost implications, the likely adverse environmental impacts resulting from the construction
of a reservoir large enough to ensure both plant water supply and avoidance of downstream user
impacts render this option infeasible.
4.4 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE
Discharge to Qin River
The only conventional discharge option open to the Qinbei facility at its proposed site is to route
wastewater directly to the Qin River. The advantages of such a system are that wastewaters will
be discharged downgradient of the proposed facility's welLfield, will greatly reduce adverse
impacts to groundwater, and will result in potentially better dilution. Potential adverse impacts
may result to irrigation use downstream in the river at low-flow conditions, as well as the cost
implications of constructing a pipeline from the power plant to the river, a distance varying from
about 2.3 to 4.5 km depending on the final outfall location.
4-3



14435C144
03129195
One possibility to minimize impacts may be to combine this alternative with the existing
wastewater disposal design. The primary disposal mode would be discharge to the Qin River.
During periods of low flow in the Qin (below 2 m3/s as reported at the Wulongkou gauging
station), wastewater would be diverted to the Baijian River. This configuration would avoid the
potential to significantly affect irrigation uses of the Qin River downstream, and would diminish
the overall volume of wastewater discharge to groundwater via the Baijian riverbed.
Based on probability distribution analyses of Qin River flow from 1970-1989, diversion to the
Baijian likely would occur for several days annually, with up to a month of diversion occurring
every 4 to 5 years. Although 35 years of flow data was available for the Qin River, only the last
20 years were used since it is evident from the data that an obstruction was placed on the river
around 1970. At present, the use of a minimum Qin River flow of 2 m3/s is somewhat arbitrary.
However, assuming a worst-case average wastewater discharge quality of about 2,000 mg/L TDS,
flow of 0.2 m3/s, and a river quality of 500 mg/L would result in a worst-case mixed water
quality in the river of about 700 mglL, still well below the irrigation water quality standard of
1,000 mg/L.
Adoption of this alternative must be assessed in terms of the final results of groundwater modeling
efforts discussed in the previous section.
Zero-Discharge of Wastewater
For inland power plants with limited access both to cooling water and large sinks for potential
wastewater discharge, the use of zero-liquid discharge technology may be considered. However,
the utilization of such systems is costly, and is necessary only if no other discharge options are
available. Zero-liquid discharge systems concentrate dissolved solids in wastewater such that a
solid waste product is obtained (brine salts and clarifier sludges). Both pretreatment and post-
treatment processes are used; since good quality water results from relatively expensive treatment
programs, maximum reuse of water is a necessary goal. All water in the system is either
evaporated in cooling systems or via steam losses, or is bound in solid wastes shipped to disposal
facilities. Zero-liquid discharge technology is not commonly used outside western industrialized
nations, primarily due to its relative newness and, more importantly, costs. Capital costs for such
systems are typically twice the cost of conventional systems; significant energy penalties also
apply during plant operation for final processing of briny waste to solid state.

4.5 ALTERNATIVE COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY
4.5.1 ALTERNATIVE SO, EMISSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES FOR UTILITY
BOILERS
Flue Gas Desulfurization
Sulfur compounds are produced in boilers firing fossil fuels by the combustion process in which
complete oxidation of the fuel-bound sulfur occurs, forming primarily SO2, with smaller quantities
of sulfur trioxide (SO3). The amount of SO, emissions is directly proportional to the sulfur and
sulfate content in the fuel. Reducing SO2 emissions by boiler modification is not feasible because
combustion processes do not affect SO2 emissions. Generally, complete oxidation of sulfur in fuel
is readily achieved before complete combustion of carbon, the most abundant element in fossil
fuel. For pulverized-coal-fired utility boilers, SO, emission reduction is typically accomplished
by treating the post-combustion flue gas with a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process.
Standard FGD processes for pulverized-coal-fired boilers are back-end equipment of either the
wet or dry type; these are often referred to as wet and dry scrubbing, respectively. Since the
early 1970s, FGD has been used extensively in the United States to control SO, emissions from
coal-fired power plants. Currently in the United States, there are 148 units, with a capacity of
68,957 MW, that have operating FGD systems. Accumulated experience with FGD systems is
about 1,800 years; experience with individual unit ranges from 3 to 24 years. These systems use
a wide range of coals with sulfur contents ranging from 0.3 percent to over 5 percent. Design
SO. removal efficiencies range from 25 to 99 percent, with an average of about 84 percent.
Associated design SO2 emission rates average 0.56 lb/MMBtu. The majority of FGD experience
is with wet systems. More recently, dry scrubber systems, which have both environmental and
economic advantages, have been installed. Currently, there about 20 units (about 7,300 MW)
with operating spray dry type FGD systems.
The following discussion of each potential FGD type includes a description of the technology and
the potential SO, emissions reduction level.
Wet Scrubbing Systems
Wet scrubbing is a gaseous and liquid phase reaction process in which the SQ gas is transferred
to the scrubbing liquid under saturated conditions. The wet scrubbing process usually involves a
4-5



14435C/4-6
03129195
liquid wastestream and slurry as by-products. Therefore, a wastewater treatment and disposal
system is generally associated with a wet scrubbing system.
Wet scrubbing systems include three different types which are classified by the reagents used in
the scrubbing process. The type of reagent influences the scrubber design, the quantity and type
of wastes produced, and the type of disposal system required. Either sodium-based, calcium-
based, or dual-alkali-based chemicals are used; these systems are referred to as sodium-based, wet
lime/limestone scrubbers, or dual-alkali. Packed towers are used for the sodium-based scrubbing
system, whereas spray towers are commonly used for the lime/limestone scrubbing system.
The sodium scrubbing systems use either a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or a sodium carbonate
(Na,C03) wet scrubbing solution to absorb SO. from the flue gas. Because of the high reactivity
of the sodium alkali sorbent compared to the lime or limestone sorbents, these systems are
characterized by a low liquid-to-gas ratio. The SO, gas reacts with the hydroxide or carbonate to
form sulfite (e.g., Na,S03) initially, then sulfate (Na,SOJ) with further oxidation. Both sodium
sulfite and sulfate are highly soluble; therefore, the final scrubber effluent is a mixture of sodium
alkaline salt liquor that requires special disposal. Although these sodium-based systems are
capable of achieving greater than 90 percent SO, reduction, they have not been used commercially
on large utility boilers and therefore are considered unproven.
The wet scrubbing system that is most widely used for a large-scale SO: removal such as the
proposed project is the calcium-based wet FGD system. It is estimated that approximately
82 percent of the coal-fired capacity in the United States is equipped with this FGD technology.
Depending on whether lime or limestone is used, the SO, reacts with the hydrates or carbonates to
form calcium sulfite (i.e., CaSO3-*h H,O) initially, then sulfate (i.e., CaSO,*2H,O) with further
oxidation. The calcium sulfite or sulfate slurry is insoluble, therefore requiring settling ponds,
separation equipment, and a wastewater treatment facility in order to properly handle the solid by-
product disposal.
The most frequently utilized wet FGD technology is the wet limestone system. The preferred
version of the technology is the spray tower. In this system, a slurry of atomized limestone is
sprayed into a tall, vertical absorber tower through a series of nozzles. The flue gas enters
4-6



1443SC/4-7
03?29f95
usually at the bottom of the tower, passes vertically up through the spray droplets, and exits the
vessel at the top.
The slurry is recirculated through the absorber system. This recirculation increases the scrubbing
utilization of the carbonate reagent. The scrubbing reaction produces calcium sulfite as the by-
product. Many systems oxidize the sulfite into calcium sulfate, which is easier to dewater. A
bleedstream is taken off from the recycled slurry stream to avoid buildup inside the spray tower.
By-products and unreacted reagents in the bleedstream are dewatered using a variety of equipment
including thickeners, centrifuges, and vacuum filters. Dewatering can reduce the water content in
the filtered by-product to as low as 10 to 15 percent by weight. Often, however, the typical
dewatered by-product is 40 to 50 percent by weight.
Several wet scrubbing systems utilize lime rather than limestone as the alkali reagent. Quick lime
(calcium oxide) is slaked with water to form hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide). The slurry of
calcium hydroxide and water is then sprayed into the spray tower. This alternative of using lime
instead of limestone is less attractive economically because the cost of either quick lime or
hydrated lime is much higher than the cost of limestone pebbles. While a limestone system
requires more initial capital costs for auxiliary equipment (i.e., limestone pulverizer, conveyor
and slaker system, etc.), the lower operating cost of the reagent provides a substantial annual
savings. Tis is especially beneficial for a facility using medium- and high-sulfur coals, where
considerably more reagent chemicals are needed.
In conventional wet limestone FGD systems, several additives have been used to enhance SO,
removal efficiencies. The majority of additives have been used to bring the performance of the
FGD system up to the original performance requirements. Both organic and inorganic additives.
The organic additives include various mixtures of organic acids that include glutaric acid and
succinic acid. Magnesium, added as magnesium-lime has been successfully used to enhance
performance. With the advancement of wet FGD designs, efficiencies of 95 percent can be
achieved by refinements in design including critical elements of absorbers, materials and control
systems. Additives can still play a role but their use is primarily focused on emergency condition
operation, corrosion inhibition, scaling and by-product handling.
4-7



1443SC14-S
03r29J95
Technically, wet scrubbing processes are capable of reducing SOn emissions with a removal
efficiency of 70 to 95 percent using the wet limellimestone scrubber system. Theoretically, a
higher efficiency may be achievable by adding adipic acid to the scrubbing liquid because the
reactions between the lime and limestone with SO, are more favorable at lower Ph levels. The
process control for the wet FGD technology has not advanced precisely enough to confidently
state that performance at one location can be duplicated at another. Margins of allowances must
be applied to the best performances achieved at other plants.
Dry Scrubbinif
In a dry FGD process, the flue gas entering the scrubber contacts an atomized slurry of either wet
lime or wet sodium carbonate (Na,CO3) sorbent. The exact mechanisms for the absorption of
gaseous SO2 and the formation of alkaline salts are complex. Overall, the SO, gas reacts with
lime or sodium sorbent to form initially either calcium sulfite (CaSO,- 'hH.O) or sodium sulfite
(Na,SO3). Upon further oxidation or SO. absorption enhanced by the drying process, the sulfite
salts transform into calcium sulfate (CaSO4.2H.O) or sodium sulfate solids. A typical dry
scrubber will use lime as the reagent because it is more readily available than sodium carbonate
and the sodium based reactions produce a soluble by-product that requires special handling.
Lime slurry is injected into the dry scrubber chamber through either rotary atomizers or
pressurized fluid nozzles. Rotary atomizers use centrifugal energy to atomize the slurry. The
slurry is fed to the center of a rapidly rotating disk or wheel where it flows outward to the edge
of the disk. The slurry is atomized as it leaves the surface of the rapidly rotating disk.
Fluid nozzles use kinetic energy to atomize the slurry. High-velocity air or steam is injected into
a slurry stream, breaking the slurry into droplets, which are ejected at near sonic velocities into
the spray drying chamber. Slurry droplets of comparable size can be obtained with both fluid
nozzles and rotary atomizers, minimizing differences in performance due to atomizer type. The
nozzle location relative to the flow, however, can be different depending on the particular design.
The moisture in the lime slurry evaporates and cools the flue gas, and the wet lime absorbs SO, in
the flue gas and reacts to form pseudo liquid-solid phase salts that are then dried into insoluble
crystals by the thermal effect of the flue gas. The dry scrubber chamber is designed to provide
sufficient contact and residence time to complete this reaction process. The prolonged residence
4-8



14435C14-9
03129195
time in the chamber is typically designed for 10 to 15 seconds. Sufficient contact between the
flue gas and the slurry solution is maintained in the absorber vessel, allowing the absorbing
reactions and the drying process to be completed.
The particulate exiting the dry scrubber contains fly ash, dried calcium salts and dried unreacted
lime. The moisture content of the dried calcium salt leaving the absorber is about 2 to 3 percent,
eventually decreasing to about I percent downstream. The simultaneous evaporation and reaction
in the spray drying process increases the moisture and particulate content of the flue gas and
reduces the flue gas temperature.
In the dry scrubber, the amount of water used is optimized to produce an exit stream with "dry"
particulates and gases with no liquid discharge from the scrubber. The flue gas temperature
exiting the dry scrubber is typically 18 to 30F above adiabatic saturation. The "dry" reaction
products and coal fly ash are both removed from the flue gas by a particulate collection device
located downstream of the scrubber. This differs from the wet scrubber system, wherein the
slurry leaving that system must be dewatered at great cost and the gas is cooled to adiabatic
saturation temperature. Moreover, in the wet process, the particulate control devise is located
upstream of the scrubber.
Key design and operating parameters that can significantly affect dry scrubber performance are
reagent-to-sulfur stoichiometric ratio, slurry droplet size, inlet water content, residence time, and
scrubber outlet temperature. An excess amount of lime above the theoretical requirement is
generally fed to the dry scrubber to compensate for mass transfer limitations and incomplete
mixing. Droplet size affects scrubber performance. Smaller droplet size increases the surface
area for reaction between lime and acid gases and increases the rate of water evaporation. A
longer residence time results in higher chemical reactivities, and the reagent-SO2 reaction occurs
more readily when the lime is wet. The scrubber outlet temperature is controlled by the amount
of water in the slurry. Typically, effective utilization of lime and effective sulfur dioxide removal
occur at temperatures close to adiabatic saturation, but the flue gas temperature must be kept high
enough to ensure that the slurry and reaction products are adequately dried prior to the particulate
collection process.

14435C/4-10
03/29!95
The dry scrubber is located upstream of the particulate control device, which is either an
electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or a fabric filter (baghouse) system. The baghouse is generally
preferred over the ESP because it provides additional SO2 and acid gas removal. When a
baghouse is used, a layer of porous filter cake is formed on the surface of the filter bags. This
filter cake contains unspent reagent which provides a site for additional flue gas desulfurization
since all flue gases also pass through the filter bags.
Based on BACT determinations previously issued, the dry scrubber FGD system can achieve 70
to 93 percent SO2 removal for coal-fired boilers, with the majority of pulverized-coal boilers
designed for 93 percent removal. Higher removal efficiencies of greater than 90 percent can be
achieved by maintaining an optimal ratio of reagent and SO, gas and using a fabric filter for
particulate removal. Discussions with dry scrubber FGD vendors indicate that a 93 percent
control efficiency is an optimal design for a dry lime scrubber FGD system in conjunction with a
baghouse for medium to high sulfur coal applications (i.e., up to 2.8 percent sulfur).
The current SO, emission rate for design coal for the Qinbei Power Plant configuration of 2x600
MW is 1.518 lb/MMBtu, or 85.2 TPD SO., which is well below the World Bank guideline of
500 TPD for unpolluted areas (i.e., s50 ,g/m3 SO. ambient concentration). At the 3,600 MW
(6x600) configuration, the SO, emissions from the plant (255.6 TPD) are still below the
applicable World Bank guideline for the area. Tlerefore, the need to control SO, using FGD
technology is not warranted.
4.5.2 ALTERNATIVE NOx CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES
Emissions of NO. are produced by the high temperature reactions of molecular nitrogen and
oxygen in the combustion air and by fuel bound nitrogen with oxygen. The former is referred to
as thermal NO, while the latter is referred to as fuel bound NO.. The relative amount of each
depends upon the combustion conditions and the amount of nitrogen in the fuel. Formation of
thermal NO, depends upon the combustion temperature and becomes rapid above 1,400C
(2550'F). The equations developed by Zeldovich are recognized as the reactions that form
thermal NO1:
N,+ O --> NO + N
N  +2---> NO+O
N +OH ---> NO + H
4-10



14435C/4- 1
03r29195
The important parameters in thermal NO, formation are combustion temperatures, gas residence
time, and stoichiometric ratio of fuel and air. Fuel bound NO., although usually small compared
to thermal NO,, is more rapidly formed by the nitrogen in the fuel which reacts with combustion
air. Another mechanism for NO, formation is the reaction of molecular nitrogen with free
hydrogen radicals. This mechanism is known as "prompt NO." and occurs within the combustion
zone with the following major reactions:
N, + CH-> HCN + N
N + 2-.-> NO + H
The contribution of prompt NO, to overall NO, levels is relatively small. The primary way to
reduce NO, emissions is through either control of the combustion process or by NO, removal
through catalytic or non-catalytic reactions.
4.5.2.1 Combustion Control Technologies
Description of Source (Pulverized-Coal-Fired Boiler)
Pulverized coal has been burned successfully for many years in large boilers using wall- and
corner-fired burning equipment. Pulverized-coal-fired boiler technology simply aimed at mixing
the coal and combustion air quickly to ensure ignition stability and rapid burnout, as well as
ensuring maximum thermal efficiency. This generally created high flame temperatures in the
boiler and the formation of thermal NO,. The boiler configuration, size, burners, and operating
practices affected NO, emissions. Conventional pulverized-coal boilers generally use more than
one pulverizer in their basic design. Each pulverizer grinds the coal pellets into small-sized
particles which are then mixed with incoming combustion air and fed to a single burner or a
system of multiple burners. The arrangement of these burners inside the boilers results in three
basic design configurations of commercially available pulverized-coal boilers: wall firing, corner
firing, and down firing. The use of a panicular design will vary depending upon the type and
quality of coal.
The wall firing design is used by several burner/boiler manufacturers including Foster Wheeler,
Babcock & Wilcox, and Riley Stoker. This design configuration uses an array of swirl-stabilized
burners arranged as either front-wall (on a single wall) firing or opposed-wall firing. The corner
(or tangential) firing design is used mainly by ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB)-Combustion
Engineering. Tangential firing burners are arranged in vertical distribution in the corners of the
4-11



14435C/- 12
03/29/95
furnace. At each vertical level, the burners are directed to form a rotating fireball inside the
furnace. The down firing design is used by both Foster Wheeler (arch-fired units) and Riley
Stoker (Turbo furnace). In this design configuration, burners are arranged on the venturi throat
and fired vertically down (arch-firing) or at an angle (Turbo furnace) into the furnace.
Circular burners typically are used in all early wall firing boilers. The circular burner was
designed to achieve maximum flame stability and carbon burnout in a minimum combustion
volume. Such a design concept was aimed at reducing the boiler cost which is directly
proportional to the size of the boiler; however, the NO, emission level is relatively high due to
elevated flame temperatures. The high flame temperatures are produced from the swirling flame
containing at least 20 percent excess air. Non-swirling burners are used in corner-fired and
down-fired designs. These designs produce lower NO, emission levels primarily due to the flame
stability enhanced by impingement of the adjacent hot flame, a substoichiometric J-shaped flame,
and a fuel-rich combustion zone, respectively.
Regardless of the design configurations, burner/boiler manufacturers have found that NO,,
emission levels are directly related to the total heat release per unit surface area in the furnace.
These boilers were designed with high heat release per surface area that produced high NO,
emissions.
Development of Combustion Controls
In the early 1970s, NO. emission reductions focused on combustion controls. Such boilers
accounted for a large portion of the total NO, emissions from all major stationary sources.
Burner/boiler manufacturers have developed techniques capable of achieving a factor of three to
four times reduction in NO,, emissions compared to pre-NSPS designs. Initially, the primary
design objective for the boiler manufacturers was to lower heat release rate per unit area
(HRRIUA) and thus lower NO. emissions. Both Foster Wheeler and Babcock & Wilcox have
successfully applied this concept into their boiler designs. For example, current boiler designs
limited HRR/UA to below 1.75 million British thermal units per hour per square foot
(MMBtufhr/ftr) compared to a 2.0 MIMBtu/hr/ft- for an early typical boiler design. By reducing
0.25 MMBtufhr/ft2, an NO, reduction of between 10 and 30 percent could be achieved. Lower
HRR/UA was also accomplished by operational modifications, such as low excess air, biased
firing, and burners-out-of-service.
4-12



1443SC14- 13
O0329f95
Further development of low NO, burners in combination with boiler designs further reduced the
NO, emission levels from pulverized-coal boilers. Some design concepts have been based on an
EPA-sponsored research program performed on a Riley Stoker's distributed mixing burner
(DMB). In this burner, combustion is staged to include two burner zones; a primary burner zone
with a stoichiometry of 70 percent of theoretical air, and a secondary burner zone with a
stoichiometry of 120 percent of theoretical air. In addition to the combustion air staging process,
the DMB design includes a pulverized coal fuel injector along the flame axis, and a secondary air
swirl controller to promote an internal recirculation zone inside the flame.
4.5.2.2 Post-Combustion Technologies
NO, emissions can be reduced by promoting the reactions of NO. in the flue gas with specific
reducing agents (i.e., ammonia or urea). These post-combustion treatments of flue gas have been
adopted by European and Japanese utilities in response to NO, control regulations stricter than
those in the United States. For the proposed pulverized-coal boiler, the selective reduction of
NO. methods include the non-catalytic and catalytic processes.
The SNCR process reduces NO, emissions through a reaction of ammonia or urea at high
temperatures (> 1,500 F). For the reaction to take place in utility boilers, ammonia or urea is
injected directly into the boiler, usually in the superheated section. No catalyst is.required for the
NO, reduction reaction to occur. Commercially available SNCR processes are either the
NOYOUT process or the Thermal DeNO,.
The SCR process reduces NO, emissions through a reaction between ammonia and NO1 that
occurs on the surface of a catalyst located in a 600 to 750F temperature range portion of the
boiler. This temperature range is achieved between the economizer and air preheater sections of
the boiler. Overseas experiences of SCR on coal-fired boilers include the high-dust, low-dust,
and post-SO, removal applications. There are several SCR vendors in the United States;
however, most applications have been focused primarily on gas turbines.
In view of coal-fired application, SCR has numerous applications in Japan and European
countries, whereas SNCR's experience on coal-fired boilers is limited to cyclone boilers in
Germany. Between the two technologies. SCR offers potentially higher NO, reduction at a higher

fired boilers using domestic coals. There is a general lack of operating experience when firing
domestic coals, which are distinct from either Japanese or European fuels.
Selective Catalytic Reduction-The NO, abatement technology for stationary combustion sources
that is currently receiving considerable attention is the SCR process using ammonia injection.
The selective reaction of ammonia with NO in the presence of a catalyst and excess oxygen was
discovered by Engelhard Corporation in 1957. However, the SCR NO, reduction technology was
developed in Japan and used there on a commercial basis for the first time. In an SCR process,
either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia is injected into the flue gas upstream of catalysts. The
catalysts are arranged in modules set up into single or multiple stages. For pulverized-coal-fired
boilers, the catalyst bed can be arranged into either a high-dust or low-dust system or a post-flue
gas desulfurization system. The selective reduction reactions occur at temperatures between 600
and 900F on the surface of the SCR catalysts to produce molecular nitrogen gas and water.
SCR catalysts consist of two types: base metal oxides and zeolite. In an SCR system using a
base metal oxides catalyst, either vanadium or titanium is embedded into a ceramic matrix
structure; the zeolite catalysts are ceramic molecular sieves extruded into modules of honeycomb
shape. All-ceramic zeolite catalysts are durable and less susceptible to catalyst masking or
poisoning than the base metal/ceramic catalyst systems. Catalysts exhibit advantages and
disadvantages in terms of exhaust gas temperatures, ammonia/NO, ratio, and exhaust gas oxygen
concentrations for optimum control. A common disadvantage for all catalyst systems is the
narrow window of temperature between 600 and 900'F within which the NO, reduction process
takes place. Operating outside this temperature range results in catastrophic harm to the catalyst
system. Chemical poisoning occurs at lower temperature conditions, while thermal degradation
occurs at higher temperatures plus NO, can be produced at higher temperatures. Reactivity can
only be restored through catalyst replacement.
SCR is theoretically capable of achieving 80 percent NO. reduction from a 0.5 lb/MMBtu level
and can achieve an emission level of 0.17 lb/MMBtu when NO, levels from the boiler are at
about 0.3 lb/MMBtu. SCR is potentially applicable to reduce NO. emissions from the proposed
pulverized-coal-fired boiler.

Based on the estimated NOx emission rate for pulverized-coal-fired boilers of 21.7 pounds per ton
(lb/ton) of coal burned, using USEPA Publication AP-42, the NO, emissions rate would exceed
the World Bank emission guideline of 300 ng/Joule by 83.3 percent. The predicted ground level
NO, concentrations support the use of NO. controls. The use of "low NO," burners in the boilers
would achieve World Bank emission guidelines as determined by USEPA [New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS) Part 60 Subpart Da].
4.6 ASH DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVES
Ash Handling Systems
Ash handling may be handled in either dry (pneumatic) or wet (hydraulic) management systems.
The proposed project will utilize dry handling for flyash and wet handling for bottom ash.
Alternatively, flyash may be handled with a wet system. Wet flyash management is advantageous
in that it is less expensive on a capital cost basis. However, the system creates additional waste
liquid streams which require disposal and renders reuse of the ash byproduct difficult. On this
basis, dry management of flyash has been adopted by the Qinbei power plant.
Ash Disposal Sites
NWEPDI considered two ash disposal locations sufficiently close to the proposed power plant
site. One location is the proposed site 4 km south of the power plant site on the left bank of the
Qin River. An alternative location in a valley to the northwest of the power plant was also
considered. Ash disposal at the site would require the construction of a darn for retention of ash.
Since it is located upgradient of both potable water wells and the proposed power plant water
source, some long-term impacts to downstream water quality of the Qin River and the Wulongkou
Aquifer from either ash water leachate or pond overflow are possible. The 100-year flood flow
for the alternative site is 607 m3/s. Even in the event that a liner is constructed for the pond
bottom and sides, flood and overflow control and diversion would be expected to be costly,
estimated to be 70 million RMB more than the proposed ash disposal site.
Ash Yard Impermeabilization
Greater impermeability than the I07 cm/sec provided by clay may be achieved by the use of
artificial barriers such as plastic liners, which achieve permeabilities as low as 10-12 cm/sec.
4-15



14435C14- 16
04107195
As described in 3.1.4.1, the NW-AEPDI has conducted dynamic absorption tests of ash material to
assess the potential for leachate penetration to near-ground depths in the ash pile, and consequent
risk to groundwater. This study concluded that high evaporation, low rainfall, and ash absorptive
capacity will interact to prevent saturation of the ash pile to a greater depth than 60 cm, even
when the greatest rainy episodes of the past 9-year period are considered. Since the ash design
depth is 11 m, the risk of groundwater exposure to rain-induced leachate is low, and does not
justify the use of more expensive, barriers with higher permeability.

5.0 RECOMMENDED MIITIGATION AN1D NION-ITORING
5.1 AIR IMPACTS
To summarize the impacts predicted in Section 3.0, modeling analysis indicates that at the 2x600
MW size, SO, concentrations would exceed the PRC First and Second Grade air quality standards
within a restricted area. This area is found within the unpopulated, mountainous elevations to the
north of the power plant site, generally between 600 and 800 m elevation (Appendix D,
Figures D-2 and D-3). At receptor locations in the populated farmlands to the south of the site,
predicted SO. concentrations generally do nor exceed PRC or World Bank standards at the
2x600 MW size.
At the 6x600 MW size, modeling analysis indicates that SO. concentrations exceed PRC Second
Grade standards over some lowland areas within 2.0 km southwest of the plant site including
Hexii village for the PRC once standard and Long Tong Mao, Dragon King Basin, and Baijan
Temple for the 24-hour standard (Figures D-4 and D-5). The areal extent of exceedance in the
mountainous area is proportionately greater than at the 2x600 MW size. The PRC First Grade air
quality standards are exceeded throughout the two nearby protected areas in the Taihang
Mountains.
Acute vegetation damage is predicted over a limited area at both 2x600 and 6x600 MW, from 650
to 750 m elevation approximately 2 km north of the site. Although little damage is expected to
vegetation or wildlife at the 2x600 or 6x600 MW sizes outside this area, there is an identified
potential for pollutant concentrations in excess of both World Bank and PRC standards,
particularly at the 6x600 MW size. For this reason. as well as the reliance on constructed
meteorological databases at this stage, certain mitigation measures are recommended. These
include collection of comprehensive meteorological data, monitoring of ambient SO., and
conducting floral surveys of the affected area.
5.1.1 COLLECTION OF SITE-SPECIFIC DATA ON MIETEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS
The Qinbei Power Plant will install, operate, and maintain a stand-alone, comprehensive
meteorological monitoring station onsite prior to the startup of construction of the 2x600 MW
facility, to generate site-specific, continuous meteorological data. This monitoring station will
include a 10-m tower to collect wind speed, wind direction, temperature at 2 and 10 m, and solar
5-1



14435C/5-2
G:/113/95
radiation. Also included with this equipment is a solid-state data acquisition svstem to record and
store the meteorological monitoring data generated by the sensors using mass storage modules.
The data can then be downloaded from the mass storage module by a number of methods,
including direct transfer of the data at the site, by telephone line if the system is configured for
telecommunications using a modem, or by radio frequency transmission back to a central
computer center.
This meteorological system configuration will provide onsite meteorological data as well as
atmospheric stability. Both the meteorological data and the atmospheric stability information are
required as inputs to computer-generated air pollutant dispersion models. The installation and
operation of a doppler acoustic sounder (SODAR) is encouraged in order to determine local
mixing heights in the vicinity of the power plant. Again, these data are also extremely important
when determining pollutant impacts using the computer generated air pollutant dispersion models.
This meteorological monitoring effort should begin immediately at the Qinbei Power Plant site.
Based on site-specific meteorological data, the air quality risk assessment for human health and
the environment needs to be reevaluated.
5.1.2 MONITORING OF SO2 WITHIN PREDICTED AREA OF HIGH SO2NOX
CONCENTRATIONS
In addition to the meteorological monitoring, it is imperative that ambient air monitoring for SO.,
TSP, and NO, be conducted at the area of highest predicted concentration impacts. The ambient
air quality data should be collected for a period sufficient to characterize the local air quality due
to the power plant. These data will be utilized as well in the air pollutant dispersion modeling
analysis. Both the meteorological and ambient air quality data will assist in validating the air
quality impacts of the 2x600 configuration and provide a better data set for estimating the air
quality impacts of the 6x600 MW buildout.
5.1.3 FLORAL SURVEY
Given the stated distribution of the endemic rare plant Taihangia rupesrris between 1,000 and
1,300 m elevations, it is unlikely that this species will be found within the zone of maximum
impacts, which is predicted to lie between 650 and 700 m. In lig-ht of the species' very rare
status, however, a plant survey should be conducted within the predicted areas of highest impact
prior to the initiation of operations at Qinhei. The survey should be conducted by a qualified
5-2



14435C/S-3
04/13/95
botanist familiar with the plant's appearance, sin.e the species is described as "difficult to
recognize by non-experts." If the species is found within the maximum impact area, mitigation
measures should be implemented that would include relocation of individual plants.
5.2 IMPACTS TO WATER RESOURCES
Withdrawals from the Wulongkou Aguirer
Preparers of this EA were not able to validate proposed groundwater withdrawal rates. While a
large amount of data evidently have been obtained characterizing the subsurface in the region, it is
not sufficiently clear from aquifer pump tests and modeling conducted to date that the aquifer can
sustain a long-term withdrawal of this magnitude required for operation of the 6x600 MW
facility. Modeling efforts to date were performed for the relatively short withdrawal periods of
30 and 150 days. The aquifer performance test was performed for a period of approximately
3 weeks.
The Qin River, while identified as the primary source of recharge to groundwater, may have
limited ability to recharge deeper water-bearing layers due to the presence of relatively
impermeable layers between phreatic water and deeper, confined layers from which water may, in
part, be withdrawn. Also, as noted in the following section. if water is expected to come
primarily from the phreatic portion of the aquiifer. which can he assumed to be readily recharged
from the Qin, possible adverse impacts related to upgradient groundwater disposal must also be
taken into account.
Additionally, modeling of the aquifer withdrawals performed to date do not completely agree with
pump test data obtained. For relatively similar periods, the groundwater modeling shows
drawdown at the withdrawal point and a point 4.000 m distant as being approximately 12 m and
3 m, respectively, while aquifer pump tests showed a water table drop of 7 m and 0.2 m over the
same interval for a greater withdrawal rate. While either drawdown level would not necessarily
engender adverse impacts, it raises questions about the long-term feasibility of the Wulongkou
Aquifer as a cooling water source for the power plant that are not answered with information
presently at hand.
To better characterize these risks before initializing full buildout to 6x600 MW, a modeling effort
using a three-dimensional groundwater tlow will be conducted utilizing a model such as the



14435CI5-4
0113195
MODFLOW program developed by the U.S. Geological Surv:e (USGS), or a suitable equivalent.
The modeling should be conducted prior to the installation of production wells and will
incorporate recharge from rainfall and the Qin River as well as address any effects the multi-
layered nature of the subsurface may have on the percolation and lateral movement of
groundwater in and around the proposed water source. The modeling effort will assess the 2x600
MW case in addition to the maximum case for 6x600 MW. On a long-term basis, average water
consumption levels for the proposed facility will be employed to incorporate withdrawals.
The results of the modeling will help to determine the long-term sustainable yield of the aquifer
while taking into account aquifer system inputts and outputs. Optimally, the model could account
for real-time inputs for certain parameters such as river flow, precipitation, and withdrawals.
Wastewater Discharge to Groundwater
Additional consideration will be given to the possible adverse impact of the proposed wastewater
discharge on the water quality of both phreatic and confined groundwater. Existing information
shows that the Qin River serves as an influent stream, i.e., it recharges the phreatic aquifer it
passes through and groundwater flow appears to flow away from the river. Long-term pumping
of the aquifer near the river has the potential to reverse this gradient of groundwater flow and
introduce pollutants to the wellfield which originate in the proposed wastewater discharge of the
facility. The use of a two- or three-dimensional groundwater transport model, such as
FLOWPATH, MOC, or MT' T3D, to assess the potential migration of contaminants discharged to
the subsurface will identify the significance of the impact.
The modeling will address potential impacts over an operational time-frame of at least 4 years.
The undertaking of such a modeling effort should help to clarify the extent of potential adverse
impacts to nearby groundwater users and the potential for "recirculation" of the discharge to
proposed water supply wells.
The envisaged mitigation for a significant adverse impact to groundwater would be to reroute the
industrial wastewater streams and cooling tower blowdown so that wastewater is directed
primarily to the Qin River. During periods of low flow in the Qin (for example, flows less than
2 m3/s), in which adverse impacts to downstream irrigation users might occur, discharge to the
Baijian River as originally proposed may occur.

04113195
Seepage from Ach Disposal Yard and Coa;l Storage Pile
Use of a liner at the ash disposal yard that achieves a permeability of l0' cm/s or greater will
prevent the infiltration of leachate from this area. Th,e final selection of clay or plastic liner types
will be made on the basis of cost considerations. A loess liner will retard the introduction of
leachate from the coal pile. The installation of groundwater monitoring wells around the
perimeter of both areas is required to monitor groundwater quality. Separate wells will be
installed to allow sampling of groundwater within the first two water-bearing zones beneath each
site. Groundwater will be sampled for heavy metals, pH, sulfate, chloride, and TDS.
Groundwater monitoring well locations on each side of the storage facilities will be constructed (a
minimum of four per storage yard).
Prior to plant operational startup, background monitoring will take place on a quarterly basis for
one year. Subsequent to operation, monitoring of all wells will take place on a monthly basis for
an initial period of one year. If water quality in all samples remains below drinking water
standards for this period, the sampling frequency may he reduced from monthly to quarterly.
Both facilities must be constructed to prevent all offisite runon. This technique will minimize the
amount of water which would have the possibility of reaching groundwater.
Additional Water Conservation Nlleasures
Water conservation measures have been identified at the proposed facility which will serve to
reduce overall consumption. However, in light of potential water-related limitations at the
proposed plant site (particularly at the 6x600 MlW capacity), firm commitments on implementation
of these reuse practices will be made by EPH. In addition, implementation of further
conservation measures outlined in the following paragraphs will be considered.
Cooling tower blowdown has been proposed for reuse as a bottom ash conveyance media. Other
reuse of cooling tower blowdown will be implemented as well. Such uses would include cooling
of pump glands as appropriate and plant washwater. Reuse of boiler blowdown and treated
sanitary effluent in the cooling tower would also contribute to water savings at the plant.
In addition, several other water conservation measures will be implemented at the facility. The
use of additional drift eliminators, for example, to minimize drift losses is appropriate for the
5-5



14435C1S-6
0.113195
facility. At relatively low cost, drift losses can be reduced to at least 0.01 percent. USEPA's
EIS-Power Plant Cooling Systems document (1973) indicates that then-state-of-the-art design can
be used to obtain drift losses of 0.005 percent of the circulating flow rate for mechanical draft
units and 0.002 percent fbr natural draft towers. In no case should the drift loss exceed
0.01 percent for modern, well-designed towers. Elgawhary and Wan (undated) note that drift and
windage losses of less than 0.008 percent of circulating flow are typical. Reduction of the drift
losses from 0.1 to 0.01 percent at the facility would reduce water consumption by approximately
3.3 percent (130 n31h) in the first stage and by a total of 390 m3fh for the final phase. This
change will also allow for slightly better cooling efficiency of the cooling tower units.
The implementation of a comprehensive and continuous auditing system of water consumption
practices at the facility will be considered to reduce water consumption and diminish potential
impacts related to water use. Trained personnel from the environmental management cell should
engage in monthly and annual inspections of water use and conservation practices with the aim of
reducing consumption and reusing water to the greatest extent feasible.
5.2.1 ASH DISPOSAL YARD
The use of a clay liner of 0.3 m thickness has been proposed for the base of the ash disposal
yard. In order to ensure that the initial permeability remains low, testing of the liner in place is
proposed as mitigation to ascertain prior to operation that the liner will have a permeability of
Ix10-' cm/s. This is the standard permeability value used as an indicator that leachate from an
impoundment or soiid waste disposal facility will be sufficiently retarded by an in-place liner.
Construction of the dikes of the proposed ash disposal yard will be using local materials, i.e.,
sand. Since the permeability of the sandy soil in the area can be up to 150 meters per day (mid)
(1.7x10 ' cmis), the placement of the clay liner, or a suitable alternative, should extend up the
interior slopes of the disposal yard dikes to prevent horizontal seepage from the yard through the
dikes.
Flood Indticement hv Ash Disposal V:ard
Placement of the disposal yard within the floodplain of the Qin River is likely to result in
upstream flooding. A study of the potentially inundated areas will be undertaken to identify if the
flooded areas are of significance. If significant indueec flooding would result from the placement
5-6



14435CI5-7
04/13195
of the ash disposal yard, a decision will be undertaken as to the viability of developing sufficient
compensatory storage upstream or to relocate the ash disposal yard from the floodplain.
Ash Reutilization and Management
The proposed reutilization plan will be developed in greater detail. The potential reuse of over 95
percent of identified ash reuse potential as a soil amendment does not appear to be feasible.
Tangible efforts to increase the use of flyash for brick manufacture and in concrete production
will also be undertaken. These measures will include the identification of specific targets for
reutilization, initially 20 percent, to be increased over the life of the project and as generation
capacity increases.
Natural Ha7ards
Earthquakes
The Institute of Seismology has indicated that earthquakes of 7.5M have occurred in the Taihang
Piedmont fault Zone. As discussed in Section 3.1.5.2, impacts associated with earthquakes at the
site range from MM Scale IV (resulting from more distant earthquakes) to 6.OM (MM Scale VII
and VIII) resulting from earthquakes occurring closer to the site. The HEPSDI has rated seismic
intensity on the Chinese scale, equivalent to MM, as VI for the Qinbei site.
Accordingly, structures associated with the project will be built in accordance with UBC Zone 3
criteria or the equivalent. Since high sand fractions in the soil and high water table conditions
increase the potential for liquefaction and damage potential resulting from earthquake activity,
testing of soils will be undertaken (if not already completed) to assess the potential for
liquefaction at the building site.
Flooding
A hydrologic study of the potential upstream flooding effects on the Qin River for design storms
will be undertaken. The purpose of the study will be to -clarify that flooding which may be
induced by the construction of the ash disposal yard in the tloodplain will not cause significant
economic damage. If significant impacts are identified with such flooding, compensatory storage
must be provided.

MONITORING
Power facilities are required by the Ministry of Environment to implement monitoring programs
as an integral part of environmental protection. For plant wastewater streams, monitoring is
proposed at the power plant wastewater outlet and main general outlet water quality and quantity
monitoring and analysis system. Monitoring results will be transmitted to the facility's central
computer system for data processing, review, and archiving. Table 5.3-1 provides details on the
proposed wastewater monitoring program. Monitorina at the proposed Baijian River outfall
location have been added to this program.
5.3 OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY ANT) HEALTH
As described in Section 3.3.7.2, EPH has a worker health and safety policy that appears to cover
many health-related issues associated with thermal power production. The NWEPDI document
addresses each of the areas of concern identified in the policy manual, as well as most general
concerns associated with worker safety in power plants, as described in Section 3.3.7.3..
Before initiation of operations at Qinbei. the EPH will further improve safety and health reliability
by
I.  Development and implementation of a worksite analysis system,
2.  Development and implementation of site-specific safe work practices, and
3.  Implementation of a site-specific safety and health training program.
5.4 SOCIAL ANID CULTURAL INTPACTS
No impacts to cultural or archaeological resources are anticipated as a result of the project. If
artifacts of cultural or historical significance are uncovered during construction, work will be
temporarily suspended and the Jiyuan City Cultural Bureau contacted.
EPH recognizes the importance of community involvement and support to the success of the
Henan Qinbei Power Project, and are committed to continue to work with local villagers and their
representatives to mitigate any legitimate concerns throughout the project. Moreover, local labor
will be used to the greatest extent possible during both construction and operation of the facility.

EXECUJTIVE SUMMARY
Electric Power of Henan (EPH) is proposing the construction of a 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission
line that will provide bulk transfer of electricity from the Qinbei Power Plant to the Henan
Provincial Power Grid. The transmission line is part of the Qinbei Power Plant project, which
contemplates the construction of six 600 megawatt (MW) coal-fired units located at Wulongkou
township, Jiyuan City, northwestern Henan province. The EPH has proposed World Bank
financing for Phase I of the Qinbei Power Plant project, which is comprised of two 600 MW units
and the 500 kV transmission line.
In accordance with the Thermal Power Plant Project Preparatory Stage Environmental Protection
Regulation (MOE, 1989), the EPH, with the assistance of the Northwest Electric Power Design
Institute (NWEPDI), prepared an environmental assessment of the 500 kV transmission line
project (NWEPDI, 1994b), submitting the document to both the MOEP and World Bank in 1994.
In accordance with Operational Directive (OD) 4:01 guidelines for screening projects according to
their risk of adverse impact, the World Bank has classified the Associated Transmission Line
Project as Category A, which necessitates the preparation of a environmental assessment. In
collaboration with the EPH and the NWEPDI, a team of scientists from KBN Engineering and
Applied Sciences, Inc. (KBN) visited portions of the proposed transmission line corridor during
February of 1995. All data, observations and information not collected by KBN during this field
trip and that relates to the line's construction and operation was provided to the team by EPH and
NWEPDI.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The EPH is part of the Central China Power Grid, which relies principally on a double-circuit
220 kV transmission system. The transmission of power at 500 kV is now in development, with
only two lines currently in service at this voltage. The Qinbei site is not proximate to any
existing 220 or 500 kV system, and requires the proposed transmission line for bulk transfer of
production from the plant to the Henan grid.
The proposed system will have two 500 kV lines in the Phase I portion of the Qinbei Power
Plant's development. The proposed route as described extends westward from the Qinbei plant,
ES-I



14435C/ll/ES-2
03114195
paralleling the Taihang Mountain range to the north for a distance of approximately 78 kilometers
(kin). The line will connect to the proposed Yubei substation, which will be constructed on the
southern side of Shiziying, Huojia County, Xinziong City. From the Yubei substation, the
proposed route continues south to the Yellow River, at which point the line will utilize existing
transmission line towers to cross the river, for an total approximate length of 46 km. The
proposed route then continues south for approximately 41 km before connecting to the existing
Xiaoliu substation, for a total length of 165 km. The Xioliu sub-station is located approximately
10 km southwest of the city of Zhengzhou.
The line will be supported by a total of 408 steel towers of the guyed V type, 38 meter (m) total
height and 28 m width (Figure 1). The existing towers at the Yellow River crossing are 114 m
total height.
Two substations will be utilized by the transmission line. The construction of the new 500 kV
Yubei station is planned to accommodate the proposed transmission line, and the Xioliu substation
near Zhengzhou at the terminus of the route that is already in service.
The proposed transmission line route traverses the Loess Plateau of the North China Plain,
paralleling the Taihang mountains to the North and Yellow River to the south. This area is
heavily utilized for agriculture, intersperse with numerous small farming villages. The only
major waterbody crossing identified during the field mission or from 1:100,000 scale maps is the
Yellow River.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
The adverse environmental impacts of electric transmission lines generally arise from the
construction of access roads, removal of vegetation, and the construction of tower footings and
substations. During operation, adverse impacts may arise -from suppression of vegetation in the
corridor, collision of birds with the lines, interference with transportation, maintenance of
substations, and electromagnetic field (EMF) effects on human health.
No plant communities, wetland areas or other natural biotic features will be affected by
transmission line construction or operation, since the route traverses areas that have long been
cleared for agriculture. Tbe line traverses no known migratory bird flyways.

The only major waterbody crossing is the Yellow River, where existing towers will be used to
support the new 500 kV line. Numerous other channels are identified that represent drainages
from the Taihang mountains to the north, but few if any are believed to contain year-round flow
due to the arid climate of the region.
The transmission line route includes the Yellow River tourist area, which is visited by 800,000 to
1 million tourists per year. Since existing towers will be used in this area, no additional impact
to aesthetic value of this area will occur as a result of the new 500 kV line. No other cultural
resources have been identified along the proposed route.
As best as can be determined, the proposed route passes within 100 m of 92 villages along its 165
kIn length, each with residential, commercial, agriculture, and institutional facilities, including a
primary school and health clinic.
Twenty identifiable road corridors and two railroads are crossed along the line's pathway, not
including small, unpaved roads within farm fields.
The primary impact of the Qinbei transmission line construction consists of the occupation of 80
in of agricultural land for each of the tower footings. Since local landholdings average 700 nr2
each, such loss would be significant to affected individuals.
Noise originates from transmission lines due to corona effect, and from substations due to cooling
pump operation. NWEPDI states that transmission line noise will not surpass 60 dBA at a
distance of 15 m out from a ground point directly beneath the conducting line. Likewise,
substation noise are predicted not to exceed 52 dBA at the perimeter fence under worst-case
conditions. Both noise levels are within World Bank criteria of 70 dBA.
The exposure of the village populations to EMF is a potential adverse impact of the transmission
line project, though research has not yet proven a conclusive link between EMF and health
effects.

RECOMMIENDED MITIGATIONS
The following mitigations are recommended to minimize adverse impacts of the construction and
operation of the 500 kV transmission line.
*   Tower placement will be made so as to minimize impacts to farm fields. Where
occupation of agricultural land is unavoidable, landholders will be indemnified
occupation of agricultural land by tower footings.
*   The 100 m corridor will be utilized to place the transmission line as far as possible
from population centers, with special regard for clinics and schools.
*   The transmission line will span all road corridors, and the point of maximum line
slack will be of sufficient height not to interfere with road traffic.
ALTERNATIVES
Options considered included no action, alternative routes, and alternative voltages.
The no-action alternative is not feasible, since no other means of bulk power transfer exists near
the proposed Qinbei power plant site. Relocation of the plant site to avoid the necessity of
transmission line construction would obligate the selection of a new site much nearer to large,
urban population centers, and further from the coalfield rail link. These negative impacts
outweigh any benefit derived from the elimination of the 500 kV line.
The alternate route passes through a 45 km stretch of the Taihang Mountains. Although such
routing would reduce the number of villages along the corridor by eight, construction would be
more expensive and would increase human accessibility to the relatively uninhabited, fragile areas
of the mountains that contain the few remaining fragments of natural plant communities in Henan
province. Since mitigation measures are identified for the villages along the proposed route, the
advantages offered by the alternate are outweighed by the increased cost and potential for
environmental impact.
Lowering voltages to 220 kV would reduce EMF along the transmission line corridor. However
this would also reduce the final design size of the Qinbei Power plant, which would in turn
exacerbate energy shortages in Henan province over the next decade. Since the transmission line
corridor allows flexibility with regards to proximity to residential areas, the advantage of lowered
voltage does not justify the negative effect of limiting the Qinbei Power Plant design size.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AIND BACKGROUND
This report addresses potential environmental impacts arising from the construction of the
500 kilovolt (kV) transmission line associated with the Qinbei Power Plant Project. As described
in the preceding Part 1, Electric Power of Henan (EPH) has received approval from the Ministry
of Electric Power (MOEP) for the construction of a 6x600 megawatt (MW), coal-fired power
plant in Wulongkou Township, Jiyuan City in northwestern Henan province. The EPH is
proposing World Bank financing for the first phase of project, which consists of 2x600 MW units
and the subject 500 kV transmission line. The World Bank is tentatively proposing an April 1995
appraisal date for the loan project, and a 1996 construction startup.
This document is the second of two parts, and contains the summary assessments of potential
environmental impacts arising from the construction of the 500 kV transmission line. The report
is divided into chapters that present the following:
1.  Key background information,
2.  Descriptions of the affected environment,
3.  Characterization of potential impacts arising from construction and operation,
4.  Recommended actions to mitigate environmental impacts, and
5.  A review of alternatives for the proposed project.
1.1 JUSTIFICATION
As described in Part 1, Henan province presently has an installed capacity of 5,492 MW,
comprised of 11 thermoelectric plants and one hydroelectric facility. Economic growth
anticipated by the Henan Provincial Economic Development Planning Bureau justifies the
prediction that electric load will surpass 15,600 MW within one decade, which could result in
serious energy shortages in the absence of an aggressive expansion plan.
The EPH is part of the Central China Power Grid, which relies principally on a double-circuit
220 kV transmission system. The transmission of power at 500 kV is now in development, with
only two lines currently in service at this voltage. The Qinbei site is not proximate to any
existing 220 or 500 kV system, and requires the proposed transmission line for bulk transfer of
production from the plant to the Henan grid.

1.2 PURPOSE OF THE ENVIRONNMENTAL ASSESSIEN!`T (EA) MIISSION
1.2.1 PRC LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRANIEW'ORK
As described in Part 1, China has developed comprehensive legal framework for environmental
protection that dates from the 1989 Environmental Protection Law of the PRC. Environmental
Protection Agencies (EPAs) exist at the national, provincial and, for cities of sufficient size,
municipal levels. The following PRC regulations comprise the basis for EPH environmental
assessment (EA) of the 500 kV transmission line:
1.  National EPA No. GG 003 (86), which provides guidelines for establishing the scope,
contents, submittal and approval of EA reports.
2.  National EPA No. GG 002, which provides technical guidelines for each phase of
project development, including siting, design, requirement for countermeasures and
cost-benefit analysis, and ongoing monitoring.
3.  National EPA No. G 117 (1988), which provides supplementary guidelines for the
management of environmental issues arising from construction projects.
4.  National EPA No. GJ 324 (1993), which provides guidelines specifically for projects
seeking international funding.
1.2.2 WORLD BANK TREATMENT OF ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES
The World Bank views electric transmission lines as projects with a wide range of environmental
risk, depending on location and project size. As described in the Sourcebook series (1990),
impacts are principally associated with the creation and maintenance of corridors, construction of
the towers, and risk from electromagnetic fields (EMF). Small-capacity lines of short length that
do not pass through sensitive areas may not require a comprehensive EA, though larger capacity,
longer lines will. For these reasons, transmission lines are ranked as a Category B project,
meaning that environmental assessment may not be required, and that the depth of analysis called
for in individual terms of reference can vary according to anticipated impacts.
Given the high voltage, relatively long length, and proximity to human populations, the World
Bank has requested that the 500 kV transmission line be treated according to the OD 4:01
guidelines for environmental assessment.

1.2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT BY KBN AND NWEPDI
The design of thermal power plants and associated facilities in Henan Province is the
responsibility of the Northwest Electric Power Design Institute (NWEPDI), a public organization
that provides technical assistance services to several additional provinces as well. On behalf of
EPH, NWEPDI prepared an EA of the 500 kV transmission line in 1994, which was submitted to
the World Bank in November of that year.
Ongoing World Bank concern regarding potential environmental issues related to the Qinbei
Power Plant led to the involvement of KBN Engineering and Applied Sciences, Inc. (KBN) in
January of 1995. Through KBN collaboration with EPH and NWEPDI, World Bank seeks
assurance that issues of special concern to the World Bank are addressed in the EA for the Qinbei
Plant. KBN has undertaken a similar collaborative role with regards to final EA preparation for
the 500 kV transmission line.
1.3 PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINE ROUTING AND CHARACTERISTICS
The proposed system will have two 500 kV lines in the first phase of the Qinbei Power Plant's
development, which consists of two 600 MW units. The preferred route as described by
NWEPDI (1994) extends westward from the Qinbei plant, paralleling the Taihang mountain range
to the north for a distance of approximately 78 kilometers (km). The line will connect to the
proposed Yubei substation, which will be located on the southern side of Shiziying, Huojia
County, Xinziong City (Photograph 8). From the Yubei substation, the proposed route continues
south to the Yellow River, at which point the line will utilize existing transmission line towers to
cross the river, for an total approximate length of 46 km. The proposed route then continues
south for approximately 41 km before connecting to the existing Xiaoliu substation (Figure 1-1).
The Xioliu sub-station is located approximately 10 km southwest of the city of Zhengzhou.
The line will be supported by a total of 408 steel towers of the guyed V type, 38 meter (m) total
height and 28 m width (Figure 1-2). According to NWEPDI (1994), the support base for each of
these towers will occupy approximately 80 square meters (m2), and the design distance between
the attachment points for the guy cables is 37.94 m. The three existing towers at the Yellow
River crossing are 114 m total height, which is above the stated flood height (NWEPDI, 1994b)
of 98.03 m for 100 year events (Figure 1-3 and Photograph 7).

According to NWEPDI (1994) the Yellow River crossing spans a distance of 3,300 m. The
concrete base for the three towers is poured to a depth of 75 m, of which the upper 25 m is
designated as the river's scouring depth.
Two substations will be utilized by the transmission line. The construction of the 500 kV Yubei
station is planned to accommodate the proposed transmission line, and the Xioliu substation at the
terminus of the route that is already in service.

2.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE AFFECTED ENVIRON-NENT
2.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
Topography of the proposed route is relatively flat, ranging from 150 to 180 m north of the
Yellow River. The route north of the Yellow River passes over land that is heavily developed for
agriculture, interspersed with drainage channels from the Taihang range. The uppermost
geological stratum along the route is alluvial sediments deposited during the Quaternary Period,
overlying a conglomerate layer of the Tertiary Period. Tertiary conglomerates are underlain by a
series of the Ordovician Period containing Majiagou limestone. The route south of the river
traverses a hilly area that is not utilized heavily for agriculture, and which ranges in elevation
from 120 to 250 m.
2.2 ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1 EXISTING COMMUNITIES
The first leg of the proposed transmission line traverses a region bound to the north by the
Taihang Mountains, and to the south by the Yellow River, an area that is considered part of the
Loess Plain of the North China Plain. The Loess Plain in general has been continuously and
densely inhabited for millennia, and holds few intact natural communities of significance. Present
estimates are that 93 percent of Henan's original forest cover has been removed, with most
remaining fragments located in the Taihang Mountains and other rugged areas (Mackinnon,
1992). Virtually all land south of the Taihang Mountains in Jiyuan county has been converted
from the original dry, temperate, lowland deciduous scrub to cropland. No stands of either natural
forest fragments or plantation timber were observed along the transmission line corridor during
the site visit, although the entire route was not surveyed.
2.2.2 WETLANDS
As described in Part I, the watercourses of Henan province observed by the KBN team are
channelized, diked and highly modified due to millennia of modification for agricultural and flood
2-1

control purposes. No stream corridor or identifiable wetland communities were observed during
the field visits, or identified by local scientists'.
2.2.3 ENDANGERED SPECIES AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
As detailed in Part 1, Henan Province is home to approximately 4,000 species, including three
Grade I and 16 Grade II endangered organisms. The only animal species of the Grade I category
whose range includes Henan is the Chinese Leopard (Panthera pardus), which is probably extinct
throughout the province. The only other species strictly identified with the project area is the rare
plant species Taihangia rupestris, which inhabits rocky mountain precipices at elevations from
1,000 to 1,300 m.
2.3 SOCIAL. CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONNMENT
2.3.1 PRESENT LAND USE ALONG THE CORRIDOR
Land use along the length of the 500 kV corridor is predominantly agricultural. Most farms
average 700 m2 per farm. In addition to the agricultural nature of the area, industrial land uses
are transversed by the corridor. The corridor passes through a number of villages with industries
such as a cement factory and brick factory. In addition, a water observatory, control station and
irrigation station are in proximity of the corridor. There are a number of villages within the
proximity of the corridor (see Section 2.3.3, Population Centers). These villages are comprised
of additional land uses such as residential, commercial, institutional, and service.
Recreational land use is also within the proposed corridor. The Yellow River tourist area located
on the banks of the river is transversed by the proposed line, however, the new line will utilize
existing tower structures that are currently at the tourist area and cross the Yellow River. Traffic
on the roads along the portion of the transmission line route was steady to light. The land
identified for the proposed Xiao Lui substation is currently used for agriculture production of
crops. It is located near the village of Xiao Lui. There are commercial establishments such as
shops, food vendors, and gas stations near the substation site.

2.3.2 CULTURAL RESOURCES
The major identified cultural resource in the vicinity of the transmission line corridor is associated
with the Yellow River tourist area. The tourist area runs approximately 2 km along the south
bank of the Yellow River. The tourist area has recreational activities such as horseback riding,
swimming, boating, amusement rides, and other associated recreational facilities. The tourist area
has approximately 800,000 to 1 million visitors per year. The tourist area has been in existence
since 1971.
Additional major cultural resources in the area have not been identified. The associated impacts
on cultural resources are discussed in Section 3.0 and the project will mitigate for any additional
cultural resources identified during the construction of the project.
2.3.3 POPULATION CENTERS
KBN considered population centers 'crossed" if the 1 millimeter (mm) wide line drawn on the
NWEPDI route map touched a labeled, urban center. This would translate to a corridor of 100 m
width.
The southern portion of the transmission corridor is located approximately 15 to 17 km south-
southwest from the urban center of the municipality of Zhengzhou. The Xioliu substation is
located approximately 10 km south of the Zhengzhou's urban center.
From the substation to the Yellow River crossing, 32 population centers are in the proximity of
the transmission line corridor, as follows:
Wang Jia Gou           Xiaotitong

3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL INPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION'
Transmission lines are primarily overland systems and can be constructed to span or cross
wetlands, streams, rivers, and nearshore areas of lakes or other sensitive areas with minimal
adverse environmental impact. Electric transmission lines do have the potential, however, to
affect natural and sociocultural resources in both their construction and operational phases.
The clearing of vegetation from transmission line corridors and the construction of access roads,
tower pads, and substations are the primary sources of construction-related impacts. Construction
of towers and access roads may also require additional clearing as well as grading. Placement of
towers in wetlands and other aquatic systems may require dredging and filling, with consequent
degradation of those ecosystems. Operation and maintenance of lines may involve either chemical
or mechanical control of corridor vegetation in heavily wooded areas. Depending on their
location, transmission lines can also impact humans by affecting social, economic and cultural
life.
3.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
3.1.1 WATER BODY TRANSMISSION LINE CROSSINGS
Depending on the location of the transmission line, activities such as tower pad and access road
construction in and near streams, rivers, and lakes can result in water quality impacts from
sedimentation and runoff. In addition, the flood storage function of these systems may be altered
by changes in surface water drainage patterns due to the construction of transmission line
facilities.
Based on KBN's examination of 1: 100.000 scale maps, as well as field visits, the Yellow River
appears to be the only significant water body crossed by the proposed 500 kV line. Therefore, no
dredging or filling will be required in the river or in any other water body or wetland.
The transmission line is sited in a region that has a semi-arid mid-latitude climate, and receives
from 600 mm of rain per year. Figures from 1990 indicate that China as a country irrigates
47,837 million hectares of land a year. Therefore, in this region, agricultural lands are sustained
3-1



14.35C\11'.3-2
031 14t95
by irrigation, and it is a given that channelized manmade water features will transverse the
proposed corridor.
There also appears to be both natural and manmade tributaries and drainage features flowing
south from the Taihang Mountain Range that cross over the corridor, although the precise location
and names of these channels, or any water features other than the Yellow River, cannot be readily
determined from the existing maps.
3.1.2 WASTE DISCHARGE FROM SUBSTATIONS
In normal operation, substations do not produce waste streams. The NWEPDI has identified no
waste generation other than water associated with accidental spills during changes of transformer
oil. The document further states that a runoff system will be designed for collection and
treatment of oily water from these spills, prior to discharge.
It should be noted that transformers that contain oils with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)
compounds will not be used.
3.2 ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
3.2.1 VEGETATION REMOVAL AND LOSS OF WILDLIFE HABITAT
Clearing of corridors and the construction of access roads may result in the loss of vegetation and
wildlife habitat along the corridor. Transmission lines may further result in habitat fragmentation
of natural areas such as wildiands and parks by dividing intact areas into smaller units. These
impacts can be significant for transmission lines cutting through otherwise undisturbed natural
areas. In natural areas, the creation of corridors can lead to invasion by exotic plants, which may
outcompete native vegetation.
However, powerline corridors that pass through natural areas, when properly managed, can be
beneficial to wildlife. Cleared areas can provide feeding and nesting sites for birds and mammals.
Because of the contact between these cleared line corridors and existing vegetation it can increase
habitat diversity. Powerlines and structures can serve as nesting sites and perches for many birds,
especially raptors.

In the case of the Qinbei 500 kV transmission line. it would appear that the proposed corridor
crosses rural agricultural lands and villages where minimal native undisturbed vegetative
communities exists. Where natural vegetative communities remain undisturbed, such as, areas
with steep slopes in the vicinity of the Qinbei Electric Power Plant and the southern bank of the
Yellow River, if mitigation is required, appropriate measures will be taken.
The second transmission line option, which transverses portions of the Taihang Mountain Range,
would risk causing impacts a greater amount of undisturbed natural vegetative communities, since
agricultural activities on steeper slopes is somewhat limited and most natural forest fragments that
remain in Henan are found in these areas. Therefore, the first proposed transmission corridor
route would appear to have less impacts to vegetation.
3.2.2 IMPACTS TO WETLANDS
As described in Section 2.2.2, no wetlands were observed during the KBN field visit, or
identified by Chinese scientists along the transmission line route. The only significant crossing of
a water body occurs at the Yellow River. However the new 500 kV line will utilize existing
towers for this crossing, such that no incremental impacts will result in the vicinity of the Yellow
River.
3.2.3 IMPACTS TO BIODIVERSITY, WILDLIFE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES
Collisions of birds, especially wading birds and waterfowl, can occur with transmission lines.
This is especially significant for transmission lines crossing wetland and water bodies used by
birds or along known migratory routes.
It is not known if the Yellow River constitutes a major flyway for any migratory wildfowl. ln
any event, the structure for the major water body crossing at the Yellow River already exists, and
additional impacts to birds will be incremental and of small magnitude.
Transmission line impacts to wildlife would be greater in areas where vegetative communities
have been undisturbed, for example, in the foothills of the mountains, and the steeper slopes
along the bank of the Yellow River. The areas that are predominantly agricultural and occupied
by villages, additional impacts to biodiversity, wildlife and endangered species would not be
anticipated.

3.3 HUMAN HEALTH. SOCIAL, ANrD CULTURAL INMPACTS
3.3.1 PROXIMITY TO SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, ANTD RESIDENTIAL AREAS
Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs)
Electric power transmission lines create EMFs. Typical EMFs at I m above the ground under a
500 kV transmission line are 7.0 kilovolts/meter (kV/m) electrical field and 86.7 milligause (mG)
mean magnetic field. The strengths of both electric and magnetic fields decrease significantly
with increasing distance (e.g., 2 m) from the transmission lines. Studies conducted in the U.S.
have shown that at 20 m, the electrical field of 500 kV transmission lines decreases to 3.0 kV/m
and the mean magnetic field drops to 29.4 mG. At 30 m, the electrical field is 1.0 kVlm and the
magnetic field is 12.6 mG. At 91 m, the electrical field is 0.1 kV/m and the magnetic field is
1.4 mG. In the United States, six states have set electrical field standards (Table 3-1). Two of
these states have set magnetic standards (New York and Florida). These magnetic field standards
are basically the maximum fields that existing lines in those states produced under maximum load-
carrying conditions and have been set to ensure that future powerlines do not exceed current EMF
levels.
The 500 kV transmission lines associated with the Qinbei power plant have been sited to avoid
villages as much as possible. According to the proposed transmission line design regulation, the
high-voltages lines or conductors will be 12 m above the ground and no residents will be within
20 m of either side of the line. The predicted EMF conditions under the line are 5 kV/m for
electrical fields. At 30 m, the predicted EMF conditions under the line are 3 kV/m for electrical
fields. Information was not available for magnetic fields.
Potential human health effects (e.g., cancer) have been attributed to high voltage transmission
lines (230 kV or greater), however, considerable debate exists concerning the significance of these
reported health effects. The following is a discussion of the important human health issues and
key studies as summarized by the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
(NIEHS) and US Department of Energy (DOE) (1995).
To date, 14 studies have analyzed a possible association between proximity to powerlines and
various types of childhood canceT. Of these, eight have reported positive associations between
proximity to powerlines and some form(s) of cancer. Four of the 14 studies showed a statistically
significant association with leukemia (NIEHS AND DOE, 1995).

The first study to report an association between powerlines and cancer was conducted in 1979 in
Denver by Wertheimer and Leeper. They found that children who had died from cancer were
two to three times more likely to have lived within 40 m (131 ft) of a high-current powerline than
were the other children studied. Exposure to magnetic fields was identified as a possible factor in
this finding. Magnetic fields were not measured in the homes. Instead, the researchers devised a
substitute method to estimate the magnetic fields produced by the powerlines. The estimate was
based on the size and number of powerline wires and the distance between the powerlines and the
home (NIEHS AND DOE, 1995).
A second Denver study in 1988, and a 1991 study in Los Angeles, also found significant
associations between living near high-current powerlines and childhood cancer incidence. The
L.A. study found an association with leukemia but did not look at all cancers. The 1988 Denver
study found an association with all cancer incidence. When leukemia was analyzed separately,
the risk was elevated but not statistically significant. In neither of these two studies were the
associations found to be statistically significant when magnetic fields were measured in the home
and used in the analysis. Studies in Sweden (1992) and Mexico (1993) have found increased
leukemia incidence for children living near transmission lines. A 1993 Danish study, like the
1988 Denver study, found an association for incidence of all childhood cancers but not
specifically leukemia. A Finnish study found an association with central nervous system tumors
in boys. Eight studies have examined risk of cancer for adults living near powerlines. Of these,
two found significant associations with cancer (NIEHS AND DOE. 1995).
Although often characterized this way, these diverse studies cannot simply be "added up" to
determine weight of evidence or to reach a conclusion about health effects because many types of
studies are included in these lists. Also, many studies that reported no statistically significant
elevations in risk did not report elevated risks (above 1.00). The risks in some cases may not be
reported as "significant" because of small sample sizes. For studies included as significant, some
found only one or a few significant risks out of several that had been calculated. When many
risks are calculated, some can be "significant" due to chance. It is worth noting that studies
which report positive associations tend to receive more publicity than to studies which find no
association (NIEHS AND DOE, 1995).

In late 1992, researchers in Sweden reported results of a study of cancer in people living near
high-voltage transmission lines. The Swedish study generated a great deal of interest among
scientists, the public, and the news media. Relative risk for leukemia increased in Swedish
children who lived within 50 m (164 ft) of a transmission line. The risk was found also to
increase progressively as the calculated average annual 50-Hz magnetic fieids increased in
strength. However, the risk calculations were based on very small numbers of cases (NIEHS
AND DOE, 1995).
The Swedish researchers concluded that their study provides additional evidence for a possible
link between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. However, scientists have expressed
differing opinions about this study. Some scientists believe the study is important because it is
based on magnetic field levels presumed to have existed around the time the cancers were
diagnosed. Others are skeptical because of the small numbers of cancer cases and because no
cancer association was seen with present-day magnetic field levels measured in the home (NIEHS
AND DOE, 1995).
There are about 70 new cases of childhood leukemia per year in Sweden. The National Electrical
Safety Board of Sweden estimates that if, as this study suggests, living near overhead transmission
lines increases a child's risk of developing leukemia, then approximately two children per year in
Sweden would develop leukemia as result of living near such powerlines (NIEHS AND DOE,
1995).
Information on adult cancer incidence was also collected and analyzed in the Swedish study.
Researchers reported in 1994 that adults with the highest cumulative exposure (over 15 years) to
powerline EMFs were twice as likely to develop acute or chronic myeloid leukemia as were less
exposed adults. Although the total number of cases was small, which made the results of
borderline statistical significance, the study provides some evidence for an association between
exposure to magnetic fields from powerlines and acute and chronic myeloid leukemia in adults
(NIEHS AND DOE, 1995).
Concerns have been raised about seemingly high numbers of cancers in some neighborhoods and
schools close to electric power facilities. In recent years, three U.S. state health departments
have studied apparent cancer clusters near electric power facilities. A Connecticut study involved
3-7



14435C\I1\3.8
04114195
five cases of brain and central nervous svstem cancers in people living near an electrical
substation. The local rates for these types of cancer were found to be no different from statewide
rates. Examination of cancer rates at various distances from the substation also failed to show
evidence of clustering. In North Carolina, several cases of brain cancer were identified in part of
a county that included an electric power generating plant. An investigation showed that brain
cancer rates in the county, however, were actually lower than statewide rates. Among staff at an
elementary school near transmission lines in California, 13 cancers of various types were
identified. Although this was twice the expected rate, the state investigators concluded that the
cancers could have occurred by chance alone (NIEHS AND DOE, 1995).
Finally, several studies have reported increased cancer risks for jobs involving work around
electrical equipment. To date, it is not clear whether these risks are caused by EMFs or by other
factors. A report published in 1982 by Dr. Samuel Milham was one of the first to suggest that
electrical workers have a higher risk of leukemia than do workers in other occupations. The
Milham study was based on death certificates from Washington state and included workers in 10
occupations assumed to have elevated exposure to EMFs. A subsequent study by Milham,
published in 1990, reported elevated levels of leukemia and lymphoma among workers in
aluminum smelters, which use very large amounts of electrical power (NIEHS AND DOE, 1995).
About 50 studies have now reported statistically significant increased risks for several types of
cancer in occupational groups presumed to have elevated exposure to EMFs. Relative risk levels
in these studies are mostly less than 2, and the possible influence of other factors such as
chemicals has not been ruled out. At least 30 other studies did not find any significant cancer
risks in electrical workers. Most of the earlier occupational studies did not include actual
measurements of EMF exposure on the job. Instead, they used "electrical" job titles as indicators
of assumed elevated exposure to EMFs. Recent studies, however, included extensive EMF
exposure assessments.
In summary, there is no strong evidence presented to date that EMF from electrical transmission
lines causes significant adverse human health effects. However, research is continuing and it
cannot be unequivocally concluded that no risk occurs. Because of the significance of the
problem, reasonable caution in siting transmissions lines should be taken to avoid construction
over homes, schools, and hospitals (see Section 5.0).

Noise
Noise can emanate from transmission lines and from associated substations. Depending on the
loudness and proximity to urban centers and/or residential areas, loudness of the noise can
effectively disrupt communications and people living in the immediate vicinity of the line and/or
substation. Natural conditions can at times enhance the noise caused from the lines. This is
discussed in the following paragraphs.
Audible noise of high voltage lines is mainly produced by corona effect and will appear under
seriously contaminated air and bad weather conditions such as high relative humidity, or heavy
wind and rain. In addition to natural weather conditions, large amounts of dust particles on the
line can create audible noise.
Substation noise sources are the result of equipment operation and circulating cooling water.
Equipment in the substation that creates audible noise is circulating water pump, cooling air fans,
main transformer cooling fans, and main transformer oil circulation.
Noise originates from transmission lines due to corona effect, and from substations due to cooling
pump operation. NWEPDI states that transmission line noise will not surpass 60 dBA at a
distance of 15 m out from a ground point directly beneath the conducting line: Likewise,
substation noise are predicted not to exceed 52 dBA at the perimeter fence under worst case
conditions. Both noise levels are within World Bank criteria of 70 dBA.
3.3.2 TRANSPORTATION CROSSINGS
Typically transmission lines do not interfere with roads and highways. However proper design
and placement of towers and lines must be considered so as not to interfere with highways and
road safety design. Line crossings will be designed so that at the point of maximum line slack
will not interfere with vehicle clearance levels nor with intersection sight triangle.
Based on the 1:100,000 scale map, it appears that the transmission line transverses approximately
20 major road corridors. In addition to crossing roadways, the transmission line crosses two
railroads. During construction and operation phases, proper transmission design will be used to
3-9



14435C\1Th3- 10
03114195
prevent impacts to roads and railroads. The timing of construction due to the possible obstruction
of major road corridors will be addressed.
3.3.3 PROXIMITY TO AIRPORTS
A major land use constraint for siting transmission lines is their proximity to airports. Towers
and transmission lines can disrupt aircraft flight paths in or near airports and intersect the flight
paths of low-flying airplanes used in agriculture.
There appears to be two airports in the vicinity of the transmission line. The first airport is
located in the northeast portion of Zhengzhou. At the closet point to the transmission line
corridor, the airport appears to be approximately 13 km from the line. Therefore, the
transmission line should not impact the aircraft flight patterns at this airport. The second airport
is the Jiyuan airport located about 14 km southwest of the Qinbei Electric Power Plant, again far
from any low-altitude glide slope used by aircraft on approach to this facility. No aviation-related
impacts are anticipated as a result of the Qinbei 500 kV transmission line.
3.3.4 EFFECTS ON AGRICULTURE
The siting of transmission lines does not have significant impacts to most agricultural uses. The
most direct impacts to agricultural areas are limited to placements of towers, pads and substations.
Agricultural activities, such as row crops and grazing can continue to occur within the
transmission corridors. However, small subsistence agricultural plots may be adversely affected
by the placement of a tower and pad. Small plots will be avoided and/or mitigated via
indemnification paid to land owners.
3.3.5 IMPACTS TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
In areas of the Yellow River Valley where human occupation has existed for thousands of years,
the potential for the existence of archaeological and culturaj resources is great. Construction of
the line and substation and the foundations of towers may impact these resources, and the
placement of towers, pads and substations on known archaeological, historical sites should be
avoided. Religious and culturally significant sites should be avoided and spanned where possible.
All cultural and religious sites will be identified and avoided prior to any construction activities.
In the event that archaeological finds are made during construction, work will be halted
immediately and the Jiyuan County (Cultural Resources Bureau) will be contacted.

03114195
3.3.6 AESTHETIC IMPACTS
Depending upon the location, transmission lines can obstruct and/or distract from aesthetic
viewsheds such as scenic vistas and cultural sites.
3.3.7 IMPACTS FROM IMPORTED LABOR
During construction especially, project workers and job seekers may move into the area,
temporarily or permanently. Construction camps may be developed in or near existing villages
placing burdens on village resources (i.e., food, water, utilities). Construction camps that are
erected in remote areas may have insufficient or poorly maintained sanitary facilities or sanitary
waste may be discharged untreated into the region's water bodies.

4.0 ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
4.1 NO ACTION
No bulk power transfer system exists near the Qinbei Power Plant site. Not constructing the
proposed 500 kV transmission line would force reconsideration of the power plant site to a
position nearer the existing Henan Power Grid transmission lines, which is generally nearer to
population centers and existing pollution sources, and further from the coal field transportation
routes. The "no-action" alternative would worsen the electrical shortage by causing delays in
power plant construction, and possibly worsen pollution impacts by aggregating the new pollution
with existing sources in areas of greater population density.
4.2 ALTERNATIVE TRANSMISSION LINE ROUTES
Changing the terminus of the proposed routing is not an option, since the line must arrive at the
Xioliu substation southwest of Zhengzhou in order to connect with the Henan Power Grid. The
route from the proposed Yubei substation also has limited siting alternatives, since the line must
arrive at the existing Yellow River crossing point. An alternative Touting has been proposed for
the initial leg of the transmission line, which connects the proposed Yubei substation with the
power plant (Figure 1-1).
The alternate route has 32 villages along the transmission route that begins at the Yu Bei
substation and transverses a portion of the Taihang Shan Mountain Range and terminates at the
Qinbei Electric Power Plant. The following list identifies the villages:
Kai you Huang          Yunyang

Shiziyin               Huang domg ti
As mentioned in Section 2.3.3, there are 92 population centers that are apparently within 100 m
of the proposed route, while the alternative route has only 84 villages within the same distance of
the route. The alternate route does not traverse agricultural areas, as does the proposed routing.
Though the impacts to agriculture and EMF-related health risks appear to be less with the
alternate route, this corridor traverses 45 km of mountainous terrain, where construction costs
would be an estimated 800,000 RMB per km higher than on the proposed route. Of greater
significance, the Taihang mountains hold the last fragments of representative Henan ecosystems,
including three Category C protected areas. The Baisongling Protected area is diagonally
traversed by the alternative route, which then continues through similar fragile terrain for an
additional 30 to 35 km. Construction impacts, and the long-term results of building roads that
allow greater public access, present a significant risk to.the continued survival of natural
ecosystems in the northeastern Taihang Mountain Range.
4.3 ALTERNATIVE VOLTAGES
Alternative, lower voltages would lessen exposure to EMF and the associated health risks.
However, a 220 kV line would not be able to transfer power from the Qinbei Power Plant in the
quantities that will be produced at the full, 6x600 MW size. This would obligate the construction
of another transmission line before Phase III of Qinbei is complete, which would carry a
proportionate risk for environmental impact. Alternatively,. Qinbei could be limited to its Phase I
size of 2x600 MW, which would contribute to serious power shortages in Henan province within
the next 10 years.

14435C\11\5- 1
03/14195
5.0 MIITIGATION PLAN
A mitigation plan will be developed in order to summarize the measures that will be taken to
either monitor or ameliorate known or potential impacts.
5.1 REOUTRED MITIGATIONS
5.1.1 TRANSMISSION LINE ROUTING THROUGH POPULATION CENTERS
When siting a line through population centers, mitigation measures need to be considered. The
proposed transmission line corridor appears to be routed in the vicinity of 92 villages or
population centers, when a 100 m corridor is considered represented on the 1:100,000 scale
routing map. The second transmission line option, which extends north through the Taihang
Mountain Range, is routed through 84 villages. The corridor should be sited to completely avoid
the villages where possible. If avoiding the entire village is not possible, the line should avoid
areas where the highest density residential developments, schools and clinics exist. Activities
directly under the transmission line corridor should be limited to agricultural and transportation,
such that residential and institutional uses are avoided. Alternative tower design and placement
should be implemented to reduce corridor width requirements and minimize impacts to the
population centers. Adjusting the length of the span or height could result in avoiding site-
specific tower pad impacts.
If villages are adversely affected by construction or proximity, compensation, housing adjustment,
and land adjustments will be undertaken. If resettlement is needed, a resettlement plan will be
developed and implemented in accordance with World Bank standards.
5.1.2 TRANSPORTATION CROSSINGS
As judged from the routing map, the transmission line transverses 20 major road corridors. In
addition to crossing roadways, the transmission line also crosses two railroads. Smaller roads
were not visible on the map.
During construction and operation phases, proper transmission design must be used to prevent
safety hazard impacts to roads and railroads. The timing of construction due to the possible
obstruction of major road corridors will be identified and construction scheduled during non-peak
hours.
5-1



14435CUI\S-2
03/14/95
5.1.3 OCCUPATIONAL AND AGRICULTURAL LAN'DS
The siting of a transmission lines does not cause significant impacts to most agricultural practices.
However, land adjustments and compensation should be given to the landowners where towers,
pads and substations disrupt the use of the agricultural lands. Agricultural activities, such as row
crops and grazing, can continue to occur within the corridor.
5.1.4 AESTHETIC IMPACTS
Aesthetic impacts will be considered when siting a transmission line. ROW should be selected in
order to avoid viewsheds. If that is not possible, mitigation measures like constructing visual
buffers and painting towers to camouflage can be implemented. Aesthetic impacts at the Yellow
River Tourist Area are not expected to occur because the transmission line will utilize existing
towers.
5.1.5 WATER CROSSINGS
As described in Section 3.1. 1, the need to cross significant water bodies cannot be determined
from the 1:100,000 routing map, although the existence of such crossings is unlikely. In the
event that rivers or streams will be intersected by the transmission line path, the line will most
likely span these features and avoid construction of tower footings within the drainage channel.
The Yellow River crossing is not anticipated to have negative impacts because the line is utilizing
existing transmission towers.
5.2 MONITORING
The monitoring requirements for transmission lines will be dependent on the type of
environmental resources involved and the degree to which they are affected. Monitoring
construction activities will be conducted to assure that negative land use and/or ecological impacts
are avoided and proper mitigation measures are employed. Monitoring of these impacts will be
short-term (e.g., weeks) and occur along the line as it is constructed. Monitoring will be
conducted at crossings of major water bodies or wetlands, near wildlands and cultural properties.
The actual monitoring will be based on visual inspections of the materials being used, the
construction practices, and mitigation measures. Monitoring of ROW maintenance activities will
also be undertaken to assure proper vegetation control methods, to prevent invasion of exotic
species, and to support decisions which take advantage of possible benefits to wildlife.

5.3 OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
Several occupational health and safety and industrial hazard considerations are associated with
transmission lines. Placement of low-slung lines or lines near human activity (e.g., highways,
buildings) increases the risk for electrocutions.

HENAN PROVINCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BUREAU COMMENTS OlN'
THE PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMIEN'T
Document Issued by Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau
No. Yo Huan Jian (1992) 08
A Reply to Environmental Protection Issues in the Qinbei Power Station Project, Phase I
Qinbei Power Plant Construction Preparatory Organization:
We have received your document No. Qin Dian Chou (1992) 01 and the proposal of the Qinbei
Power Plant Project, Phase I. After consideration, our comments are as follows:
1.  We agree in principle with the proposed plant site. The conclusion of preliminary
EPA states: the plant site is located at an open terrain on the southern foot of
Taihangshan Mountain and there is no large- or medium-scale industry plant or
enterprise around it. The site has a good condition for flue gas dust dispersion. The
ash disposal yard and the slag disposal yard can basically meet the requirements of the
plant. In view of the above-mentioned facts, our bureau approves the construction of
the Qinbei Power Plant, Phase 1.
2.  Close attention should be paid to the EIA work. An outline of the EIA shall be
prepared by a chartered institute with first-class certification of EIA and submitted to
the State Environmental Protection Bureau for approval.
3.  Ash comprehensive utilization should be planned and put into effect in synchronism
with the project, Phase 1.

After Phase I of the project is completed, the plant shall have an annual coal consumption of
3.2 million tons. The coal is arranged for the time being, from local mines in South Shanxi
Province and transported through Huoyue Railway. The connection of the plant siding with the
national railway and other transportation issues shall be settled in conjunction with the Ministry of
Railways in the next stage. Since the Huoyue Railway is the main line through which the coal
produced in the Shanxi Province is transported to South China, to avoid too much occupation of
its freight capacity, optimization should be considered for alternatives of coal sources and
transportation routes during the feasibility study.
The funds for the project Phase I shall be raised from six parties, i.e., State Energy Resource
Investment Corporation, Henan Province, Hubei Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province,
and the Central China Electricity Administration.
The investment ratio of each party shall be determined in the next stage. The total investment of
Phase I is 2.9 billion RMB, which is estimated on the price level in 1991, including 0.5 billion
RMB for its substation project. Issues about how to strive for foreign funds shall be discussed in
the next stage.
Please conduct a feasibility study in accordance with the gist of the document and submit the
report to us, along with a proposal for the 500 kV transmission and substation project for the
power plant.
