1. INTRODUCTION
A. OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
Supply and Demand
1.1   China has become the third largest producer of energy in the world.  The
country's primary commercial energy supply and consumption increased at around
4.4 percent per year from 1980 to 1994 to reach 1,169 and 1,175 million tons of standard
coal equivalent (tce), respectively.  Coal is the most important source of energy,
accounting for about 74.1 percent, and oil for 18 percent of the total production.
Hydroelectric power (6 percent), natural gas (1.9 percent), and small quantities of shale
oil and geothermal power make up the balance. The largest consumer of energy is the
industrial sector (75.4 percent), followed by households (9.7 percent), services
(8.6 percent), and agriculture (6.3 percent). Details of the primary energy outputs are
given in Annex 1.1, and total energy production and consumption in Annex 1.2.
Energy Resources
1.2   Coal. China has large coal deposits, with recoverable reserves of about 900
billion tons, of which 30 percent are proven. In 1994, the country produced 1.2 billion
tons of raw coal. By the year 2000, China aims to produce 1.4 billion tons of coal a year.
The best quality coals are found in North China, where Shanxi and Inner Mongolia each
have reserves of 200 billion tons. However, insufficient transport capacity makes it
extremely difficult to move sufficient coal to the large consuming centers in Central and
East China.
1.3   Hydroelectric Potential. China is rich in water resources and has a long tradition
of harnessing them for energy and other uses. The country's hydroelectric potential is
estimated at 1,900 TWh a year, but only about 9 percent of it has been developed. Most
of the potential is located in the Southwest (70 percent), about 1,500 km away from the
main demand centers. However, the long gestation period for hydroelectric projects and
the lack of capital have slowed the development and utilization of hydroelectric
resources.
1.4   Crude Oil. China's ultimately recoverable reserves of crude oil are estimated at
some 80 billion tons, of which approximately 20 percent are proven.  The 1994
production amounted to 147.65 million tons of crude oil and cumulative production
reached 2.3 billion tons. China's refining capacity is the sixth largest in the world.
However, with the sharply increasing consumption, the country will become net importer
in the near future.



-2-
1.5   Natural Gas. China's natural gas resources are estimated at 33 trillion m3, of
which 3 to 5 percent are proven. In 1994, China produced 16.97 billion m3 of natural gas.
About 58 percent of the current production is nonassociated gas, mostly from Sichuan
Province. The remaining gas production is associated with onshore crude oil production.
1.6   Biomass. Noncommercial biomass energy use currently amounts to about one
quarter of total energy consumption in China. Fuelwood and agricultural residues are the
chief biomass fuels, and they are consumed almost entirely by rural households. China is
promoting a variety of measures to achieve environmentally sustainable biomass supply
and consumption levels, including more efficient use of biomass, tree planting, and
substitution of other fuels for traditional biomass fuels.
1.7   Nuclear Energy. Known uranium reserves in China are sufficient to sustain
15,000 MW of nuclear power capacity for 30 years. China commissioned its first
commercial nuclear power plant (300 MW) in 1992, in Zhejiang Province. In 1993/94,
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant (2x900 MW) was also commissioned; 70 percent of its
output is intended for nearby Hong Kong. The construction of a few additional plants is
planned to start before the year 2000, primarily in regions which lack coal and
hydroelectric resources.
1.8   Other Energy Resources. Other energy resources play a small role in energy
supply and are used mostly in remote areas. Geothermal energy has been found in
locations throughout the country. Although wind and solar energy have promising
prospects, they are not expected to significantly affect the overall supply of energy in the
near future. Oil shale deposits are large, but little is exploited because of lack of viable
technology.
B. THE POWER SECTOR
Supply and Demand
1.9   China is the second largest producer of electricity in the world. By the end of
1994, China's total installed capacity reached about 200 GW, 74 percent of which is
thermal capacity and the rest hydropower (25 percent) and nuclear power (I percent)
(Annex 1.3). China has 5 regional and 8 separate provincial power networks, of which 7
have installed capacities of 10 GW or more. The five regional power grids (East China,
North China, Northeast China, Central China and Northwest China) coordinate the
systems of several provinces together. The total length of the high and medium voltage
transmission lines (i.e., from 500 kV down to 110 kV) lines amounted to 236,149 km and
the transformer capacity of substations down to the 110 kV level (owned and operated by
the power utilities) was about 179 GVA. Considering the power supply as a whole from
production to end-user supply, transmission and distribution losses amounted to about
16 percent of generation.
1.10  Total power generation in China increased by two and one-half times between
1980 and 1994, an average increase of 8.0 percent per year over 14 years. About



- 3 -
927.8 TWh were generated in 1994, with thermal power accounting for 80 percent. The
share of hydroelectric power has remained fairly stable over the last decade. Even though
the Government has maintained a strong commitment to hydropower development,
capital constraints and the distance of major resources from load centers inhibit more
rapid development.  Coal-fired power plants provide about 90percent of thermal
generation, with oil-fired generation accounting for most of the balance. The share of oil-
fired generation has declined sharply since the early 1980s, owing to a concerted
government policy to minimize petroleum use for power. The share of natural-gas based
generation is negligible and is expected to remain so barring unforeseen major natural gas
discoveries.
1.11  Industry continues to dominate electricity consumption in China, accounting for
75.4 percent of electricity use in 1994; agriculture accounted for 6.3 percent, residential
consumers for 9.7 percent, municipal and commercial consumers for 6.7 percent, and
transport and communications for 1.9 (Annex 1.4). Industrial demand has continued to
drive overall power demand; more than 70 percent of incremental electricity use between
1985 and 1994 was in the industrial sector. Although service is of uneven quality, rural
access to electricity is high; about 96 percent of the nation's villages and about 80 percent
of rural families now have access to electricity.
1.12  Despite the strong growth in electricity output, most areas of China continue to
suffer from severe power shortages. Since GDP grew by 9.3 percent per year during
1980-94, the elasticity of electricity consumption growth relative to GDP growth was
only 0.86-an exceptionally low elasticity for any country over a sustained period, and
particularly for an industrializing country such as China. Chinese officials estimate the
shortfall between peak power demand and supply at more than 10 percent. Daily load
curves are relatively flat, as industries have had to respond to power shortages during the
peak daytime periods through rescheduling of work shifts. The annual load factor in the
Henan power grid in 1994, for example, was 72 percent.
1.13  China's GDP is expected to grow by at least 8 to 9 percent per year during
1994-2000. This rapid economic growth will put tremendous pressure on China's electric
power industry to avoid yet worse shortages. The total investment in China in 1994 was
Y 208 billion, of which Y 85.9 billion (41 percent) was in the power sector. China's
electric power construction program for the 1990s will certainly be the world's largest.
Assuming that an aggressive conservation effort can enable an electricity demand/GDP
growth elasticity of 1.0 to be sustained, electricity demand could be expected to continue
to grow at average rates of 8 to 9 percent per year during 1994-2000. To keep pace with
this demand growth, China would need to add some 17-20 GW of capacity per year.
1.14  Although China's current power development program emphasizes addition of
200 to 600 MW units, over one half of China's thermal power capacity is still in units
below 200 MW. Only about 12 percent of the total installed capacity is in units of
300 MW or more, compared to 60 to 80 percent in industrialized countries. The average
gross conversion efficiency of thermal units over 6 MW has improved over the 1980s,



-4 -
reaching 32 percent in 1993. This efficiency level is not unreasonable given the low
average unit sizes in operation, but is substantially lower than the 36 to 37 percent typical
of systems with larger units.
Power Sector Institutions
1.15 In the period 1988-92, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) maintained primary
responsibility within the Central Government for policy, planning and regulation of the
power and related energy subsectors. In May 1993 MOE was restructured during a broad
government reorganization, and a Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) was established,
along with a Ministry of Coal and the existing China National Petroleum Corporation.
Chart I shows the entities that are within MOEP oversight.  The State Planning
Commission (SPC), on behalf of the State Council, has the responsibility for review and
approval of the strategic plans, investment programs and general pricing policy of the
energy sector.
1.16  Until early 1993, the State Energy Investment Corporation (SEIC) channeled
Government funds to finance coal and electricity projects. SEIC was responsible for
onlending funds for projects of national importance and representing the Government in
jointly financed projects. However, in April 1994, SEIC (and five other specialized
investment companies under SPC) were merged into a new policy bank, the State
Development Bank of China (SDBC). The People's Construction Bank of China will
perform policy lending as an agency of SDBC, and commercial banking activities on its
own account. For provincial power companies, it appears that equity and loans/debt shall
be channeled through the regional groups, and equity stakes will be held by the State
Development Investment Corporation (SDIC).
C. POWER SECTOR REFORMS-PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
1.17  Reforms in China's power sector during the 1980s involved a series of
incremental adjustments, largely to mobilize additional investment capital to finance
rapid growth. Taken as a whole, these adjustments have resulted in a sector structure that
is largely unrecognizable from that in the early 1980s. In 1980, the power sector was
fully controlled, managed and funded by Central Government departments. By the early
1990s, the sector had become much more decentralized, less vertically integrated and
open to nonutility producers.
1.18  In conformance with broad national reforms towards a market economy begun in
mid-1992, the Government initiated, in the early 1990s, a program of power sector
reforms. The reforrm agenda includes: (a) institutional restructuring-commercialization
and corporatization of power companies, and associated sector restructuring; (b) overhaul
of the regulatory and legal framework for the sector, including the promulgation of a
National Electricity Law; (c) further diversification in financing for power development,
including private sector participation; and, (d) the rationalization of power tariffs. The
Chinese approach to reform encourages experimentation with different reform options



- 5 -
and institutional forms. This gradual approach permits the Chinese to examine the
relevance and applicability of specific reforms, and also fine-tune implementation for
their broader dissemination or replication in other parts of the country. Box 1.1 provides
a snapshot of some of these pilot experiments.
Box 1.1: POWER SECTOR REFORM EXPERIMENTS IN CHINA
Industry Structure:
- System operation with separation of transmission and distribution from generation is being conducted in
Hainan Province. Actions undertaken include:  creation of a single transmission and distribution
shareholding company and several generation companies, including a wholly foreign-owned one.
- The creation of independent generation companies which will have their equity traded internationally
through either a share-listing on the New York or Hong Kong Stock Exchange is being considered in
Shandong Province.
Regulation:
- Complete functional and institutional separation of sector regulation and government oversight from the
provincial power company/bureau has been completed in Hainan Province. A separate agency was
established on June 1, 1995 to regulate the sector. A more ambitious experiment is under consideration
for Fujian Province. The success of these experiments should speed up the less radical reforms initiated
in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan.
Foreign Investment Financing:
- Huaneng International Power Development Company (HIPDC) and Shandong Power Development
Company, both raised equity capital through American Depository Receipt issues in New York in 1994.
- Meizhou Wan Power Project is a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) project of 2x350 MW in Fujian
Province. The project, which is 100 percent foreign owned, is being sponsored by a Consortium of
several international companies. IFC is exploring options for participating in the project. The project
was approved by SPC in September 1993.
- Rizhao Power Project is a joint-venture project of 2x350 MW in Shandong Province. The project is
sponsored by two international and five domestic investors. The foreign debt of $350 million is being
raised from two foreign financial institutions on a nonrecourse project-financing basis.
- Laibin B Power Project of 2x350 MW coal-fired plant in Guangxi Autonomous Region is the first Build-
Own-Transfer (BOT) project approved by the Government for international competitive bidding. The
owner has already solicited applications for prequalification.
1.19   Institutional and Corporate Restructuring.  MOEP is charged with overall
sector coordination and policy guidance, and is no longer involved in enterprise
management. Regional power entities are charged with responsibilities for regional grid
coordination and dispatching. Provincial power companies have become the utilities in
charge of management and operation of the bulk of the nation's power system.



- 6-
1.20 The operational scope of the provincial power companies varies substantially, but
none of them has a monopoly of power supply in their respective provinces. At the
distribution level, about one-third of the country's urban distribution companies and over
80 percent of the country's rural distribution utilities are separate economic entities. At
the generation level, semi-independent joint-investment plants and fully independent
power plants have been developed in many areas, selling power to the provincial power
companies.
1.21  Efforts are underway to restructure the provincial power entities to operate more
like commercial corporations. In parallel, the sector structure is being reformed to
facilitate transparent relationships between, and in some instances, complete separation of
distribution and generation operations from the transmission core.
1.22  Further restructuring of the the power sector is under consideration. The current
plans are for MOEP to be dissolved in early 1996 and its oversight and regulatory
functions divided between SPC, the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the
China Electricity Council, and the soon to be created National Power Company (NPC).
NPC would: (a) be designated by the State Council as the authorized representative of
the State as owner of government-owned power assets and is further authorized to make
investments in the power sector on behalf of the state; (b) operate the national (i.e.
interregional) transmission network; and (c) function as a holding company with the five
regional power group companies and the provincial power companies as subsidiaries.
After transformation of MOEP, the existing regional power administrations and
provincial power bureaus will undergo similar restructuring.
1.23  Legal and Regulatory Reform.  China is in the process of developing a
comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for operations in the power industry. The
existing legal framework consists of a multitude of inconsistent regulations and rulings,
developed over many years. The Government recognizes the need for overhauling the
regulatory framework and establishing more transparent and commercially driven
relationships between the various entities now involved in the sector, including regional
and provincial grids, semiautonomous joint-investment power plants and independent
power producers.
1.24 The Central Government is preparing a new Electricity Law, which will provide
the umbrella principles for the legal and regulatory system for the sector, for possible
promulgation in 1995. The Central Government is also preparing a series of more
specific regulations, consistent with the principles of the proposed Law. The emerging
regulatory system for the sector will clearly define government regulatory functions at
central and provincial levels, and will facilitate the separation of government oversight
functions from power company management. The World Bank is assisting MOEP in
assessing the existing laws and regulations and evaluating options to develop a new
regulatory framework through an IDF-funded technical assistance grant.



1.25  An important and innovative experiment in regulatory reform is being conducted
in Hainan Province to make the transition to an unbundled sector structure with separate
regulation. Actions undertaken include: creation of a single transmission and distribution
shareholding company; several generating companies, including a wholly foreign owned
one; and establishment on June 1, 1995 of a separate agency to regulate the sector.
Lessons learned from this experiment will be taken into account in furthering the power
sector reform efforts in other provinces.  A more ambitious experiment is under
consideration for Fujian Province.
1.26  Diversification of Financing Sources. Following changes in power project
financing from Government grants to loans in the early 1980s, the Govermnent
encouraged the development of additional financing sources from provincial and local
governments, large consumers, and, in some cases, private foreign partners. Since the
mid-1980s, the Government has allowed power produced from power plants financed
through these nontraditional sources to be sold at prices which provide for full debt
servicing and reasonable profit. This is referred to as the "new plant, new price policy."
The share of Central Government financing in power sector investment has fallen
sharply, from 91 percent in 1980 to less than 30 percent in 1994. Empowered with rights
to impose surcharges to accumulate funds for investment in power construction,
provincial and local governments have become a key source of financing, providing
about almost half of the investment funding for the sector in 1994.
1.27 Newly formed corporations have also become important players. The Huaneng
International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) was formed in 1985 with the aim
of attracting foreign capital and technology for power plants located mainly in coastal
areas. As an independent power producer, HIPDC operates its 15 plants (5,800 MW
total) under a build, own, and operate (BOO) framework. HIPDC had a mandate to raise
ftunds from the international financial market, and it has tapped bilateral and suppliers'
credits, and commercial bank loans. HIPDC was able to raise foreign equity capital
through an American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue in New York in 1994. The
Sunburst Energy Development Corporation (SEDC), with three large power projects
under implementation, and the recently established China Power Investment Corporation
(CPIC) are other windows for the Government's investment, and cofinancing with the
local governments and foreign sources in power projects. Build, own and transfer (BOT)
schemes have also been introduced in China, most notably the privately-financed Shajiao
B and Shajiao C thermal power plants in Guangdong Province; and the recently approved
projects Meizhou Wan in Fujian province, and Lai Bin, the first power project approved
for international competitive bidding, in Guangxi Autonomous Region.
1.28  Many other BOO and BOT schemes are in the negotiation stages, but progress is
slow because the Government has not yet developed a clear regulatory framework and
policies to encourage competition at entry. Rapid expansion of this form of foreign
investment may also require Government acceptance of higher rates of return to investors
and/or underwriting of certain risks, especially foreign exchange convertibility and other



- 8 -
policy related risks. Competitive bidding for power projects would be the best means of
establishing the market rate of return to international investors.
1.29 Power Pricing. Electricity price reform in China has involved a series of
incremental changes over the last 10 years. In the mid-1980s, multiple-track pricing was
introduced for both producers and consumers, in line with the shift away from full
vertical integration in the industry. This strategy was successful in increasing overall
tariff levels but, by the end of the decade, the power pricing system had become too
complex and difficult to manage.   Recent reformns have therefore focused on
simplification and rationalization of the system.
1.30  At the producer level, the state catalog prices charged for power produced by
Central Government-financed plants were modified in 1993. Prices for the electricity
produced from all new power plants are now set by contract to cover financing and
operating costs, on a plant-by-plant basis, and rolled into the average power tariff. Cost
recovery through the tariff system for new investments is thus ensured. Prices also are
similarly determined for existing plants financed through loans. The electricity tariff
applied for plants built with grant financing before 1985 has been rationalized to now
include an improved mechanism to automatically adjust prices annually to reflect fuel and
transportation cost variations. It is expected that producer prices for old power plants will
be revised to provide a reasonable rate of return on revalued assets.
1.31   At the consumer level, the prices are in general an average of the state catalog
prices and the guidance prices (that reflect full costs of supply from sources not financed
through the Central Government) plus national and local fees and surcharges. While the
situation varies between regions, the nature of the existing pricing system is such that
average consumer prices (including fees and surcharges) approximate long-run levels in
areas with rapid load growth, such as the coastal provinces. For example, average
consumer prices in Zhejiang Province are estimated to be about 50 fen/kWh compared to
a long-run average incremental cost of 45 fenikWh. Prices in underdeveloped areas, such
as Sichuan and Henan, are still below long-run marginal cost (LRMC) levels, but will
gradually be rationalized with increasing supply from new plants.
1.32  While tariff levels are approaching satisfactory levels, the structure of consumer
prices, however, remains too complex, lacks transparency, and is inequitable. In most
areas, including Henan Province, unfair "old" administered rates and "new" guidance
rates continue to be applied to different consumers. Some consumers are protected from
high cost electricity supply charges and certain local surcharges because they still hold
"in-plan" quota allocations, but other new or small consumers must pay high prices well
above actual supply costs.

D. ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Electricity Conservation
1.33  China has over 10 years of experience in the active promotion of electricity
conservation, with a solid record of achievement. The strength of its program lies in the
well developed institutional framework. Electricity conservation is handled by the
network of "Three Electricity Offices," with offices at central, provincial, prefectural and
county levels throughout the country. These offices are under the leadership of local
Economic Commissions, and coordinate their work with provincial power companies.
They monitor electricity intensity and use patterns in all major enterprises, promote
adoption of conservation technologies and electricity management improvements, and
assist in organizing funding for efficiency programs supported by the Government.
1.34  Further improvements in the efficiency of electricity use are imperative if China is
to realize its economic growth goals in an environmentally sustainable way. Henan
Province where the proposed project is located is a pioneer in many aspects of electricity
conservation.  Efforts in place include:  (a) an electricity conservation fund which
provides governnent cofinancing for conservation investments in industrial and
commercial sites; and (b) a program to popularize the use of high-efficiency lamps.
Environmental Protection
1.35   Thermal power production currently accounts for about one quarter of China's
coal consumption, and this share is expected to increase gradually. Improvements in the
efficiency of coal use in this sector not only alleviate pressure on the coal production and
transportation system, but also have a major impact on particulate, sulfur and carbon
dioxide emissions.
1.36  The achievement of economies of scale in thermal power production, through
expanded development of large generating units, is a priority because of the recent rapid
growth of small coal-fired power plants, in unit sizes of 50 MW or less. While national
policy emphasizes the addition of 300 MW and 600 MW units, new projects have lagged
behind demand and local governments are continuing to invest in large numbers of new
small plants, largely due to difficulties in mobilizing the necessary investment resources.
Compared with a state-of-the-art plant, these plants consume over 60 percent more coal
per unit of electricity produced. This results in at least 60 percent higher sulfur dioxide
emissions (depending upon the coal used), and roughly 60 percent greater emissions of
carbon dioxide. Particulate emissions from the small plants are proportionally even
higher, due to use of inefficient particulate control technology. If a sufficient number of
large-scale projects cannot be brought on stream in a timely fashion to substitute smaller
inefficient units, there is little doubt that this problem will worsen.
1.37  In terrns of emission control. in large and medium-scale plants, China has made
substantial progress in particulate control, through deployment of high efficiency
electrostatic precipitators. As the country has large reserves of low sulfur coal, China is



-10-
just beginning to employ sulfur dioxide control devices in areas where ambient air quality
standards require them. Top priority should be given to areas which must rely on local
high sulfur coal, such as in southwest China. In these regions, thermal power plants often
burn coal of over 4 percent sulfur content (e.g., 5 to 10 times the level typical through
most of north and east China), and development of sulfur dioxide control strategies and
corresponding investments are now urgent in these areas.  Several pilot flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) projects have been implemented in areas where the sulfur content
of coal is relatively high: Luohang in Sichuan Province, Japanese-assisted projects in
Shandong Province and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province.
1.38  Recently, the Chinese Government initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution
related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's contribution to
the problem. The Government announced in June 1994 that it will spend about $2 billion
over the next seven years on an environmental program aimed at keeping S02 emissions
at a level of 15 million metric tons a year, as part of a comprehensive program of acid
rain abatement.  The government also announced its intention to keep particulate
emissions at about 3.8 million tons (1992 level).
E. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK
World Bank Power Sector Assistance Strategy
1.39 In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in China
places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last two
years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's
Institutional Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector
work on power sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing domestic and foreign
private funds to meet the capital needs of sector development (through informal sector
work). The study (Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector
report (China Power Sector Reform: Towards Competition and Improved Performance,
Report 12929-CHA, 1994) provide vehicles for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese
institutions. Technical assistance is also now being provided to help the central
authorities develop an improved legal and regulatory framework for the sector. The
energy conservation support program includes technical assistance through the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), lending support in selected industrial, environment and
energy projects, and development of a series of new GEF investment operations. The
power sector lending program now focuses on assistance for the detailed aspects of
implementation of the power sector reforms, primarily in the less-advanced inland
provinces, as well as reducing the power shortages that continue to hamper development
and slow the market orientation of the sector.
1.40  The Bank also supports the Chinese Government's serious efforts to: (a) curb air
pollution related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's
contribution to the problem; and (b) accelerate the development of hydropower and



construction of large and efficient 300 and 600 MW coal-fired units to avoid the
mushrooming of the small and highly polluting plants that still constitute about 60
percent of the additional installed capacity.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.41   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for China presented to the Board on June 1, 1995. For the power sector, the CAS
identified six focal points for Bank assistance: (a) commercialization and corporatization
of operating companies and enterprises; (b) development of adequate regulatory and legal
frameworks; (c) introduction of competition and transparency; (d) assurance of adequate
tariff policies; (e) development of new sources and methods of financing; and (f) transfer
of new technology and modern operational and environmental management techniques.
This ambitious reform program reflects the detailed strategy set out in the recent power
sector strategy for China.
1.42  The project supports this strategy by including implementation of a reform
program to: (a) incorporate the provincial company, Electric Power of Henan (EPH), as a
limited liability company; (b) separate government and corporate functions within the
Company; (c) improve its structural organization and managerial processes to increase
cost conscientiousness and business orientation; (d) promote competition at the
generation level; and (e) rationalize the pricing system within the province (see
Chapter 3).  It also supports electricity conservation and adequate environmental
protection and monitoring (in close cooperation with the Asian Development Bank).
Past Bank Involvement and Lessons Learned
1.43   Since the first project for the power sector in 1982, the Bank has helped to finance
17 large power generation and load management projects, seven thermal, eight hydro, and
two transmission projects (Annex 1.5). Technical assistance in project management,
system operations, finance, management and institutional reform has been included in the
projects. Through these operations, the Bank has helped to introduce: (a) state-of-art
technologies and control systems in generation, transmission, distribution and pollution
control; (b) modem operational practices and procedures to improve power system
reliability and control; (c) improved methods for project planning, design, construction
management, and environmental impact assessment; (d) improved financial planning and
utility management tools and practices; (e) techniques for computing and establishing
appropriate tariff structures and levels; and, (f) assistance in sector and regulatory reform.
1.44  These operations have yielded useful lessons on project preparation, technical and
operating aspects of power systems, and sequencing of institutional reform.  The
experience gained from these projects and broader international experience in power
sector restructuring have also been taken into account in developing the Bank power
sector strategy in China, and in designing the proposed project.



- 12 -
1.45  Lessons learned from the previous seven thermal power projects were considered
during preparation of the proposed project in order to (a) avoid commissioning delays
experienced in the past due to contractual interface problems and weak project
management, (b) improve the quality of environmental studies and monitoring measures,
and (c) ensure commitment of the beneficiary to the institutional and corporate reforms to
be included in the project. Specific actions have been taken to increase involvement of
foreign consultants in assisting the Beneficiary in assessing the environmental impacts of
the project and preparing the environmental management plan, and in preparing a
comprehensive reform  plan prior to the preappraisal mission.  The procurement
packaging was revised to avoid problems experienced during the construction of the
Yanshi project (Loan 3433-CHA) in coordinating the different suppliers and vendors-
especially those involved in implementation of the instrumentation and control module.
Finally, a serious boiler accident at Beilungang has been taken into account in boiler
design and specifications, coal specifications and "check coal" specifications, and
intensified coal monitoring. Complementary studies were prepared by the Beneficiary
and its consultants on coal sampling and analysis and the methods used were found to
conform with international standards by the Bank's mining specialists.
1.46  In power sector restructuring and reform implementation, international experience
shows that even in advanced countries with strong legal systems and open economies, the
time needed to build consensus on the reform directions, establish a new regulatory
framework, and implement structural changes can be very long. In Central and Eastern
Europe, hopes for achieving quick progress in economic regulation in the energy sector
have not materialized because of the weaknesses of legal systems and the lack of interest
of governments in attracting large-scale private investments to meet current and
prospective demands.' A comparative study on the progress in power sector reforms in
these countries concluded that pursuit of transparency and accountability of energy and
other utilities is the best way to achieve progress in economic regulation.2  In Asian
economies, the reform effort has met with mixed success. Efforts to encourage private
investments have been successful in Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, but private-
sector initiatives are taking more time to implement than originally expected.
Restructuring of the power industry in both regions is cautious. The industry is still
mostly vertically integrated and gradually evolving toward the purchasing agency model.
Considering China's 40-year history of a command and control economy, the progress
achieved during the last decade and especially during the early 1990s, clearly indicates
the Government's commitment to reform. However, the difficult transition to market
oriented macroeconomic environment, without disruption, will take time and effort
because of the size of the system and the complexity of the issues involved.

2. THE HENAN POWER GRID
2.1    Henan province, where the proposed project is located, is the second-most populous
province in China (with 89.5 million in 1994) and is still one of the less developed. In
1994, its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to less than 70 percent of the
national average. The province is nevertheless experiencing remarkable growth-from
1980 to 1994 its GDP increased at an annual average of 10.4 percent, which is 1.2 percent
above the national average. In 1994, its industrial output increased by 8.8 percent, despite
acute power shortages. Power supply constraints in the area have been overcome by
improved power system performance, energy conservation and load management measures.
Adequate power supply and increased sector efficiency through further market orientation
are crucial for sustained growth in the province.
A. THE HENAN POWER SYSTEM
2.2   In 1994, the Henan Power Grid (HPG) had a total installed generating capacity of
8,473 MW, 7,928 MW coal-based and only 545 MW of hydropower (Annex 2.1). The
peak load was 7,900 MW and the total electricity supply (including energy exchanges)
was 5,405 GWh. Electricity consumption per capita was 560 kWh, about three quarters
of the national average. The provincial power sector is plagued by acute shortages: in
1994, load was shed about 84,000 times (more than 240 times a day) and demand during
peak time exceeded supply by about 700 MW, 9 percent of the peak demand, despite
severe measures to limit power use by industrial consumers.
2.3    Henan's generating facilities include 12 major thermal power plants, one
hydropower station, and a number of small captive and other plants. Major power
generating plants greater than 50 MW in installed capacity are listed in Annex 2.2. The
local and captive power plants total about 2,742 MW in installed capacity. Electricity
generated in the province in 1994 amounted to 48,486 GWh, about 71 percent of the total
of which was supplied by Electric Power of Hunan (EPH).
2.4   The transmission system in 1994 consisted of 323 km of 500 kV lines, 3,844 km
of 220 kV lines, and 7,868 km of 110 kV lines. EPH owns and operates almost all
500 kV, 220 kV, and part of the 110 kV lines. The system also includes transformer
substations, with a total capacity of 24,391 MVA (Annex2.3.
2.5   The growth of energy requirements in HPG between 1989 and 1994 is shown in
Annex 2.4 and summarized in Table 2.1. HPG's peak demand has increased more
rapidly than energy requirements, 10.6 percent on average compared to 8.8 percent.
indicating improved supply conditions. The system has a maximum daily load factor of
about 87 percent and an annual load factor of 72 percent. The peak load usually occurs in
August.

2.6  In 1994, electricity consumption of the HPG amounted to 50,016 GWh; of which
industry, 77.2 percent; agriculture, 8.3 percent; residential, commercial and other
municipal customers in the cities, 8.62 percent; and the transport/telecommunication
sector, 2.8 percent. Energy consumption by consumer categories for HPG in the period
1989-94 is shown in Annex 2A.
B. LOAD FORECAST
2.7   The load forecasting is based on the premise that the electricity conservation
efforts will be sustained to improve the 1.1 electricity-GNP elasticity factor that was
achieved during the last decade. Electricity conservation programs in Henan province
saved more than 11 TWh from 1980 to 1993, through technical renovation, adoption of
advanced technologies and promotion of efficient end-use equipment, especially Compact
Fluorescent Lamps.
2.8   Load forecasts for the years 1994 through 2004 have been developed as part of the
economic planning process carried out by EPH. The forecasts were obtained by applying
a combination of econometric methods to the total electricity demand; and analytical
methods to the major consumer categories' demand. In particular, industrial loads were
estimated on the basis of market surveys and projected industrial output growth and
electricity intensities for different categories of industry. Rural loads were estimated
based on past trends for drainage and irrigation, rural industries loads, and lighting.
Municipal loads were estimated based on market surveys of hotels, buildings, and
government projects. Specific demand management and energy conservation measures
have been fully incorporated in the load forecasts. Details of the energy forecasts for
HPG are given in Annex 2.5 and summarized in Table 2.2.

to 12,610 MW in 2000, and 16,880 MW in 2004, an average annual growth of 7.9 percent
from 1994 to 2004. Electricity supply would increase from 50 TWh in 1994 to 82 TWh
in 2000 and 110 TWh in 2004, averaging an annual growth of 8.3 percent over the whole
period.
C. ROLE OF THE PROJECT IN HENAN PROVINCE
2.10  The proposed project would ease the power shortage in the province, and, as
described in the following chapter, will support major institutional and financial reform in
the sector with the aim of putting Henan's power sector on a commercial footing. The
proposed physical investments include: (a) a generation component to provide reliable
and economical electricity supply in Henan and the Central China region, an area which
is experiencing strong and sustained economic growth. It will help the region cope with a
rapidly growving industrial demand resulting from its opening to the outside world, and
will further improve living standards in one of the poorest provinces in China; (b) a
transmission component to accommodate the new generation, improve the quality and
reliability of supply, and reduce the supply-side losses; and (c) an electricity conservation
component to accelerate the implementation of electricity conservation measures by
supporting economically and financially viable projects and substituting market
incentives for administrative measures to sustain progress in achieving Henan's
conservation potential.
2.11  The project overall is expected to have positive environmental benefits compared
to available alternatives. The proposed Qinbei power plant (phase I) to be constructed
under the project will introduce the first two 600 MW units to efficiently meet base load;
the units are designed to meet strict atmospheric emission standards and to minimize
other environmental impacts. The new capacity addition will result in reduced use, and in



- 16-
some case retirement, of older, less efficient and more polluting plants. The net effect
will be a large increase in energy generation and a substantial improvement in overall
efficiency of the power system, without a substantial increase in air pollution.
2.12  Finally, and as described in Chapter 3, the project will significantly contribute to
the provincial power sector reform and to the commercialization and corporatization of
EPH, which will remain one of the major operators in the sector.

3. THE BENEFICIARY
A. LEGAL STATUS AND ORGANIZATION OF EPH
3.1   The beneficiary of the proposed loan is the Electric Power of Henan (EPH), which
is one of three closely related provincial power sector entities. The others are the Henan
Province Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB) and Henan Province Construction Investment
Company (HPCIC). The functions of the three entities can be broadly defined as
commercial, regulatory and investment. All three entities have counterparts at prefecture/
municipal and county level-at the regional level, the equivalent bodies are the Central
China Electric Power Group Company (CCEPGC), Central China Electric Power
Administration (CCEPA), and Central China Electric Power Investment Company
(CCEPIC). A more detailed explanation of the power sector structure in Henan Province
is given in Annex 3. 1.
3.2   EPH is an independent legal entity possessing the status of a limited liability
company. Its charter has been formulated under the Law on Industrial Enterprises, and
the State Council's regulation on the "Structural Reformation of Central China Power
Network," prior to the promulgation of the new Company Law. EPH's legal status and
Charter require revision to conform with the new Company Law, promulgated in
December 1994. EPH is an affiliate of CCEPGC. CCEPGC is responsible for
coordination, development and operation of the Central China power system comprising
power companies in Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces.
3.3   The functions of EPH are outlined in its existing charter.  These include
construction of power projects and raising of funds from various sources. In practice,
EPH obtains investment funds from state, provincial and local governments and through
borrowing from local banks and financial institutions. EPH also has the corporate power
to issue bonds and shares with the approval of relevant authorities. It has the authority to
receive the proceeds of the proposed World Bank loan through the Central Government,
to carry out the proposed project, and to enter into a Project Agreement with the World
Bank.
B. OTHER PROVINCIAL ENTITIES
3.4   EPH was formed from HPEPB, which until 1988 was entrusted by central and
provincial governments with overall responsibility for provision of safe, reliable
electricity supply throughout the province.  Its responsibilities included planning,
construction, operation and marketing at the provincial level, as well as administration
and regulation of enterprises at the county and municipal level. In 1988, the State
Council approved the "Scheme of Power Industry Managerial System Reform," which
provided for setting up provincial power companies to take over commercial functions of



- 18-
the power bureaus. EPH thus became responsible for construction, operation and
marketing, while HPEPB retained the administrative and regulatory functions. In
practice this separation of functions has still not occurred and the sector is still
administered under the policy known as "one entity-two nameplates." Currently, the
general manager of EPH is also head of the HPEPB. This requires him and other staff of
EPH to exercise several regulatory functions in addition to core management and
operational functions. As part of the ongoing power sector reform program in China, the
Government is planning to separate the regulatory functions of the Bureau from the
Corporation.
3.5   HPCIC is a provincial government-owned enterprise entrusted with management
of provincial investments in power facilities. It raises funds from external sources for
financing components of EPH's power development program. The most important
source of funds administered by HPCIC is the 2 fen/kWh surcharge collected from
consumers. HPCIC expects to receive a return/dividend on its investments and interest
on its loans. For new power generation, funds are usually pooled with those from other
state, municipal or county-level investors to finance "joint investment" projects,
constructed, managed and operated by EPH.
C. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
3.6   EPH's Charter provides for a Board of Directors to manage the company, but to
date the Board has not been established. Accordingly, the overall management of EPH is
entrusted to a general manager/director (assisted by four deputy directors) appointed by
MOEP in consultation and agreement with the Provincial Government and CCEPA. The
general manager is the legal representative of the company and responsible for its
operations. The exercise of his powers (e.g., hiring and firing of staff and labor) is,
however, subject to "relevant state rules and regulations."
3.7   EPH has 49 functional divisions and offices, including 12 power plants, 13
prefecture/municipal power supply enterprises, two construction companies, separate
companies for material and fuel supply and seven training institutions. The organization
structure is detailed in Chart 2.
3.8   EPH has traditionally had a technically strong and effective management. Current
performance indicators for EPH reveal high plant capacity factors (with thermal capacity
factors reaching as high as 82 percent in periods of severely constrained supply), with
transmission and distribution losses generally less than 6 percent (Annex3.2). EPH
prepares accounting information in a timely fashion and operates an effective billing and
collection system. However, the company is now in a dynamic growth stage. Over the
period 1990-94, EPH revenues trebled from Y 2.6 billion to Y 7.5 billion, and over the
period to 2004, they are projected to increase more than sevenfold to Y 51.8 billion. This
dramatic growth requires EPH's transformation to a fully corporatized self-sufficient
entity and considerable upgrading of its institutional and, most important, financial
capabilities.



-19-
3.9   As part of the preparatory work for this project, EPH carried out a study to define
measures needed to reorganize its operations and further strengthen its management.
EPH appointed a task force to carry out this study assisted by international consultants,
financed by the Bank.  The reform  action plan and proposed improvement of
management information systems included in this project are based on the
recommendations of the study.
D. REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
3.10  A key objective of the proposed project is to assist and facilitate the corporate
restructuring of EPH and its affiliated enterprises, promote a more open sector structure,
and initiate competition at the generation level. In consultation with the Bank, EPH has
prepared and agreed to implement a package of sector and enterprise-related reforms
(Annex 3.3), consisting of appropriately sequenced and time-bound actions. The main
elements of the implementation plan are as follows:
(a)   Incorporation of EPH as a Limited Liability Company. EPH will
revise its charter to delineate its rights and obligations and develop an
adequate corporate governance framework in accordance with the new
Company Law. EPH will then be incorporated as a limited liability
company (under the new Company Law) within nine months of issuance
of necessary State Council regulations on restructuring state-owned
enterprises.
(b)   Separation of Government and Enterprise Functions. An important
objective of power sector reform at the provincial level is to separate
government ownership and regulatory functions from enterprise operation
and management functions. EPH, MOEP and CCEPA agreed to achieve
this objective in a two step approach: (i) consolidation of government and
regulatory functions (i.e., bureau functions) within one division within
EPH no later than June 1996; and (ii) separation of all bureau functions to
appropriate national and provincial level authorities in conformance with
the regulatory framework established at the national and provincial levels.
This separation will be achieved within 9 months of issuance of
implementing regulations.
(c)   Commercialization of Operations. EPH has agreed to streamline its
organizational structure and focus on its core businesses by converting
profit oriented units into autonomous companies or profit centers and
nonprofit oriented ones (social services) into cost centers to be shifted to
suitable institutions, pari pasu with the progress of social sector reforms.
It was agreed that technical assistance will be provided to EPH under this
project to develop and implement an organizational structure and
management system consistent with the above objectives and aiming at
improving the operational and managerial efficiency of the Company.



- 20 -
(d)   Tariff Reform. EPH is finalizing a tariff reform action plan to achieve
the following: (i) tariff increases beginning in 1996 to meet agreed upon
financial targets and economically adequate tariffs by 2000; (ii) unification
of tariffs by end-1998; and (iii) adjustment of demand charges for
industrial customers, and price differentials between different voltage
levels to gradually reflect the cost of supply.
(e)    Power Sector Restructuring. EPH will, in coordination and consultation
with higher authorities, implement structural reforms to introduce
competition at the generation level, improve contractual arrangements
arnongst the different operating entities in the sector, and increase
efficiency at the distribution level. To achieve these objectives, EPH
agreed to: (i) establish a competitive solicitation program for additional
supply and procure, on this basis, at least one generation plant by the end
of 1998; (ii) incorporate its generation units (seven state owned power
plants) and its development power company into limited liability
companies by mid-1996; (iii) establish its 13 supply bureaus as profit
centers with transfer prices based on EPH's bulk sale prices by mid-1997;
(iv) develop model commercial contracts by mid-1 996; and (v) introduce
formal commercial contractual arrangements with other sector entities,
such as independent distribution bureaus, IPPs, fuel supply companies, etc.
3.11  In general, the timing of the various steps is more ambitious in areas which EPH
generally considers to be within its control, and more cautious in areas where legislative
action, or issue of regulations is required, even though such actions are anticipated.
3.12  In the area of regulation, the Electricity Law, which was approved in December
1995, identifies the basic principles for regulation of the electricity supply industry.
However, international experience clearly shows that development and/or changes in
regulatory frameworks are complicated and slow processes, especially for a country like
China where major macroeconomic reforms and decentralization of decision making are
being carried out at the same time. Assistance is being provided to the Central
Government in carrying out this major effort in the most efficient and comprehensive
way (see para. 1.39).
3.13   The pricing policy requires profound changes both at the wholesale and final
consumer levels. At the wholesale level, electricity generated from all "new" plants is
being priced, on a plant-by-plant basis, at "debt repayment price" levels, allowing for
payment of full debt service costs based on a 10-year repayment period after
commissioning of new power plants, while electricity generated from "old" power plants
(built before 1986) is being sold at prices fixed by the central government. This principle
has been effective in promoting alternative financing sources to substitute decreasing
budget allocations during recent years but it is not considered to be sustainable in the long
term. With the expected coming on line of large numbers of new plants, the 10-year
repayment principle would impose an unreasonable burden on EPH's finances over the



-21 -
next few years but would lead to a much higher level of profits after the tenth year. It is
unreasonable to expect consumers to repay, over such a short period, loans which are
financing fixed assets which have a life of 2 to 3 times this period. At the consumer
level, prices depend on the source (old or new power plants) of the power they
purportedly are using. This means that customers in the same service area and with the
same consumption characteristics pay different prices. The multitier pricing might have
been useful for phasing in higher electricity prices to consumers, but it has become a
major impediment for progress towards economic pricing and results in distorted
consumption behavior. Unification of consumer tariffs is a priority.
3.14  In the corporatization area, the most urgent requirement is for the determination of
the respective ownership rights of the State and Provincial Governments in the fixed
assets of EPH and its affiliated enterprises. While China operated under a centrally
planned economy, all fixed assets belonged to the State and enterprises were entrusted
with the responsibility for their maintenance and use. There was no concept of ownership
in the legal sense. All fixed assets were financed up to 1985 from budget allocations but
since then, China has progressively moved towards loan financing, and since 1988 other
investors (provincial and local governments and HIPDC) have been investing in EPH
assets. In order to track the interests of the respective owners, and since ownership of
"state" assets had not been determined, separate records have had to be maintained for
various classes of assets and owners. Resolution of the ownership interests in EPH and
affiliated enterprises is dependent on the issuance of State Council implementing
guidelines for the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. Issuance of these guidelines
has been delayed because of conflicting interests of the numerous parties involved in
power sector development.
3.15  The project includes a comprehensive technical assistance component to assist
EPH with all aspects of its reform efforts: (a) an institutional strengthening component
directed at organizational restructuring and modernization of its financial management
and administrative practices (AnnexJ.4); (b) a comprehensive package of legal services
to assist in corporatization, and preparation of the necessary contractual documents for
sector restructuring (AnnxJ3.5); and (c) assistance in developing an appropriate tariff
structure and transition plan to achieve the agreed financial targets (Annex3.). Training
is included in all of the above technical assistance packages. Assurances were obtained
from EPH during negotiations that it would engage by June 1996 consultants to assist in
the review of its organization and management system, furnish the results and
recommendations of such reviews to the Bank by March 1, 1998, and thereafter
implement the recommended organizational improvements and accounting andfinancial
management systems, taking into account Bank comments.
3.16  EPH has established a working group comprising senior officials of the company
to manage the reform process, and its implementation is well underway. The program is
being supported by MOEP, CCEPAB and the Henan Provincial Government. Assurances



- 22 -
were obtained from EPH during negotiations that it would carry out the Reform
Implementation Plan according to the timetable agreed with the Bank (Annex3.).
E. STAFFING AND TRAINING
3.17 As of December 31, 1994, the company had a total staff of 53,384, of which about
21.8 percent were engineers and technicians, 6.7 percent administrative staff and
71.5 percent workers, including skilled and unskilled, apprentices and others. Except for
the core group of key technical and managerial personnel who are assigned by the State,
almost all of EPH's employees are recruited locally. Most of the employees are hired
under contracts based on their skills and training. Details of EPH's staffing are shown in
Annex 3.7.
3.18  EPH runs technical schools at Zhengzhou and Nanyang for skilled workers, a
management school for economists and two universities at Zhengzhou. There were 985
teaching and administrative staff in these training and educational centers, which had a
total enrollment of 4,848 students in 1994 (details in Anne.8A). This training capacity
is basically sufficient to meet EPH's long-term needs. However, the skills of teaching
staff and quality of teaching facilities are being improved and modernized. Training is
being designed to improve professional skills of staff engaged in planning, financial,
personnel, project construction and operational management areas. The proposed project
would support the EPH training program over a four-year period, financing foreign costs
of instructors, study tours and upgrading and equipping training facilities.
F. PLANNING, BUDGETING AND CONTROL
3.19 Power bureaus and companies are responsible for developing annual and five-year
production and investment plans which are integrated into the national plans and are
approved, through MOEP's auspices, by SPC. In the past, financial planning was
confined to attaching monetary values, predetermined by MOEP, to the power production
being planned. Although a power bureau's plan might be revised to reflect changes, it
would ordinarily not be revised to reflect differences between estimated prices and actual
prices. However, with the economic changes in the 1980s, prices have begun to move
toward market levels and the Government now finances investments through loans rather
than grants. Centralized control is being relaxed and replaced by greater financial
autonomy and responsibilities for the power entities. To address these changes, EPH will
need to adjust its planning system to include modem financial planning.
3.20 MOEP recognizes the importance of financial management in the power sector in
China and is promoting relevant training programs for all the power institutions under its
control. Many of the power bureaus/companies, including EPH, have been equipped with
personal computers and software for planning, budgeting, and accounting functions.
Information from the bureaus/companies can be transferred to MOEP and consolidated
into regional and national data.



- 23 -
3.21  These systems represent a good first generation of automated management
information; however, they still are not sufficient and integrated as a network to promptly
provide financial and related statistical information about a power entity's operations to
the various management levels, supplying each level with the necessary details at the
appropriate times. With EPH's rapid growth and commercialization, it is also necessary
for it to introduce an accounting and financial management system that will: (a) enable
managers to be held accountable for costs of activities and functions over which they
have control; (b) provide information for comparative analysis of actual costs with
budgets for decision making; and (c) provide transparency of information for investors,
government, lenders, and the public in general. The proposed project would include a
technical assistance component to support EPH in establishing a new organizational
structure and appropriate systems and procedures to upgrade its budgeting and financial
accounting systems, including provision of software and hardware, as well as
enhancement of its staff skills. The terms of reference for the proposed study under this
project is presented in Annex 3.4.
G. ACCOUNTING
3.22  EPH followed until recently a uniform enterprise accounting system and detailed
regulations established by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) which were developed in the
context of a highly centralized, planned economy. Recently, as part of China's efforts to
speed the transition to a market-oriented economy and improve the financial management
of enterprises, new regulations covering accounting rules and financial affairs were
introduced by MOF on July 1, 1993. These revised accounting principles are generally
consistent with those of international accounting standards.  Within this broad
framework, specific accounting standards will be developed with the assistance of the
Bank Group for all Chinese enterprises under the Financial Sector Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 2423-CHA).
3.23  While EPH has made good progress in implementing the new system, there are
still some areas where its accounting practices are not in accordance with international
practice. For example, EPH did not include the construction work in progress in the
accounts for 1994's financial statements due to the absence of specific accounting
standards and regulations which remain to be issued by MOF. Agreement to help make
further changes to regularize EPH's accounting and financial practices is therefore
included in the technical assistance component (para. 3.15).
H. Audit
External Audit
3.24  The State Audit Administration (SAA) was established in 1983 and given the
status of a ministry reporting directly to the State Council. In addition, provincial audit
bureaus have been established in each province and large municipality. The audit
regulations and standards prepared by MOF are based on international auditing practices
and were promulgated by the State Council on October 21, 1988. Audits of Bank-



- 24 -
financed projects have been conducted by SAA's Foreign Investment Audit Bureau or
one of the Provincial Audit Bureaus (PAB) under its guidance. SAA and PABs have
been receiving training through an IDA-financed Technical Assistance Credit.
3.25  Under the proposed project, EPH's accounts will continued to be audited by
Henan Provincial Audit Bureau (to be confirmed during negotiations) under the
supervision of SAA. This arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtainedfrom
EPH that it would: (a) maintain and provide to the Bank semiannual progress reports
with unaudited project accounts to reflect project expenditures for the period under
report compared with the original project cost estimate; (b) furnish the Bank with the
audited accounts for the project, statements of expenditures, and financial statements of
EPH within six months of the end of each fiscal year; (c) implement any changes to its
accounting practices as recommended by its financial management consultants to meet
international accounting standards; and (d) require its auditors to comply with
international auditing practices and provide audit plans prior to each audit. For the
FY95 audited financial statements, the auditors will provide: (a) their audit plan; (b) a
summary of the effects of accounting changes arising from the adoption of new MOF
regulations and corrections of any deviations from MOF regulations as interpreted with
reference to international accounting standards and practices; and (c) a management
letter summarizing any significant matters that may have arisen during the conduct of the
audit.
Internal Audit
3.26  EPH established an internal auditing section (staffed with qualified accountants)
in 1986, which periodically examines the accounts of each operating unit. The objective
of these examinations is primarily to test for accuracy and compliance with MOF
regulations. The section will serve as liaison between external auditors and the project
entity.
I. TARIFFS
3.27  Power pricing in Henan Province, as in other parts of China, underwent major
evolution during recent years. The current situation is detailed in Annex 3.9, and is
summarized here. As the economy moved to free markets, a multitier pricing system was
adopted. Power produced by plants financed by central government budget allocations
(prior to about 1985), and allocated through the old "in-plan quota" system, is sold at
catalog prices (first tier) which are established by MOEP and approved by SPC. These
are adjusted periodically to reflect increases in the costs of fuel and fuel transportation,
and, more recently, debt service costs. Electricity sold from power plants financed by
joint investments from State, Provincial and Local Governments is sold at "out of plan"
prices, referred to as the "guidance" price (second tier) based on full cost recovery
including debt repayment over 10 years and providing a reasonable return on investment.
In some provinces, power taken by consumers in excess of the quotas is priced about



- 25 -
50 percent higher than the state catalog price (third tier). The guidance prices are
established by the provincial utilities and approved by the provincial power bureaus.
3.28  The state catalog prices, which used to be artificially low at about 6.5 fen/kWh
until 1985, have been gradually increased to an average of 16.5 to 18 fen/kWh for
agriculture, 22 fen/kWh for residential consumers, 22 to 23 fen/kWh for commercial
users and small industries, and finally 16.5 to 18 fen/kWh for medium and large
industries.
3.29  The guidance price is established annually based on the supply cost of out of plan
power. Out of plan power is provided by power plants financed by provincial and local
governments, independent power producers, and state plants above and beyond their
planned production. In Henan, the collective fund price averaged, in 1994, 25.2 fenlkWh.
This is expected to increase to about 29.7 fen/kWh by the end of 1995.
3.30  A variety of additional fees are added to the prices charged to consumers. With
the exception of a new 0.45 fen/kWh levy on all consumers throughout the country to
help finance the Three Gorges Hydroelectric project, these charges are levied by
provincial and local governments. In Henan Province, power sales to commercial and
industrial users are subject to a 2 fen/kWh surcharge for a Provincial Power Construction
Fund. Some other fees are earmarked to cover a part of local distribution costs or street
lighting. However, average prices to final consumers remain lower than the long-run
marginal cost (LRMC).
3.31  The operation of the above multitier pricing system has proved to be useful for
phasing in higher prices to consumers and in creating a situation through which
investment decisions can be based on market prices. Now, since the difference between
the state catalog and the guidance prices has narrowed, EPH intends to begin the
unification of its pricing system in 1996, and complete it by offering uniform tariffs to all
customers of similar categories in 1998. This would be a major step in rationalizing the
pricing system in Henan. A task force to plan this process, comprising officials of EPH
and the Provincial Pricing Bureau, has discussed its tariff reform plan with the Beijing
Economic Research Institute (BERI), SPC and MOEP. At negotiations, the Bank agreed
with EPH and the Government on an action plan and timetable for unifying EPH's tariffs
and establishing a suitable formula for adjusting the level of rates which would enable it
to meet the financial performance targets to be agreed under the proposed loan (para.
5.12.). This would require an increase of about 4.0 percent in real terms over the period
1995 to 2004 (para. 5.16). Rate structure improvements were also made in 1994 by
introducing time-of-the-day tariffs for bulk and large retail consumers. Peak rates are
twice off-peak rates for bulk supply customers and three times off-peak rates for retail
consumers, which limits administrative interference and introduces economic incentives
for load management, at the demand side.

J. BILLING AND COLLECTIONS
3.32 As of December 31, 1994, electricity consumption in Henan Province, distributed
according to the consumer categories, is shown in Table 3.1. Details of the sales and
average price by category of consumers are given in Annex 3.9.
Table 3.1: ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IN HENAN PROVINCE (1994)
Customer category                     Consumption (GWh)         Percent
Agriculture                                  4,152                8.3

3.33  EPH conducts its billing and collection activities through 13 power supply units.
All major industrial consumers receiving supply over 320 kVA are charged in advance
three times per month at approximate 10-day intervals. The last two bills, rendered on
about the sixteenth and twenty-fifth days of the month, are based on estimated usage
derived from the consumer's contractual power consumption. The first bill, rendered on
about the sixth day of the month, is also based on estimated usage but includes an
adjustment to reflect the previous month's actual usage as computed from a meter
reading. All other customers are billed once a month based on actual usage.
3.34  Industrial commercial and bulk consumers pay their bills through direct debit
from their bank accounts. Urban residential and low voltage agricultural consumers
receiving power directly from EPH render payments to local branches of the National
Bank. Payment is due within five days of receipt of the bill. Regulations stipulate that
consumers who do not pay within this period are to be charged a fine of 0.03 percent per
day of delay on the unpaid bill, and that after several notices those who still refuse to pay
their bills are disconnected. These billing and collection arrangements have established a
reliable cash flow from sales.

4. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (a) reduce the acute power shortages
and foster integrated development of the power system of Henan Province in the most
cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; (b) support adequate implementation
of power sector and power enterprise reforms and accelerate the transition of the Electric
Power of Henan to a legally and financially autonomous and business-oriented company,
in line with the recently enacted Company Law; (c) assist in transferring new power
technologies and in applying modem power operation/maintenance methods; (d) support
improvements in the efficiency of electricity use; and (e) contribute to rationalization of
power tariffs. During project preparation, the Beneficiary demonstrated full commitment
to these objectives and assisted in identifying performance indicators and critical success
factors to ensure the effective monitoring of project implementation and achievement of
the agreed objectives, and for recognition of potential problems during supervision (cf.
Section I of the present chapter).
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
4.2   The project team worked in close coordination with the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), which is also financing a thermal power project in Henan, to avoid duplication
and ensure complementary objectives between the two projects. It has been agreed that
the proposed project focuses mainly on tariff and power sector reform and the ADB
project includes greater focus on environmental control at the provincial level through
improvements in environmental monitoring and enforcement, and closure of small
industrial boilers and small inefficient power plants (see Box 4.1). Therefore, the
proposed project includes investment, power sector reform, electricity conservation pilot
projects, and institutional development components as follows:
(a)   construction of two 600-MW coal-fired thermal power units and associated
equipment and facilities, including, for the first time in China, an online
performance monitoring system to increase plant performance, reduce coal
consumption and gradually introduce innovative maintenance techniques;
(b)   erection of two 165 km 500-kV transmission lines to connect the power
plant to the existing power transmission network;
(c)   services to assist the beneficiary in engineering, procurement and
construction supervision;



- 28 -
(d)    a technical assistance package to support the implementation of the power
sector reform action plan described in paras. 3.10-3.16;
Box 4. 1: PROPOSED ADB HENAN POWER PROJECT
Part A: First stage of the new Yuzhou Coal-Fired Power Station including ash disposal yards, access
roads, railway extension, water pipelines, and 250 circuit-km of 220 kV transmission
reinforcement with costing based on 350 MW units and international competitive bidding based
on 300-350 MW series;
Part B: Cogeneration Plan including (B1) conversion of small Yuzhou City 2x6 MW  plant, thereby
allowing the closure of 10 industrial boilers in Yuzhou City; and (B2) construction of new
2x142 MW cogeneration station in Luoyang, thereby allowing the closure of an additional 146
industrial and 113 residential boilers;
Part C: Closure of 21 inefficient, polluting and aging generating units from four power stations located in
Zhengzhou, Luoyang and Jiaozuo with total capacity 307 MW and their replacement by more
efficient capacity created under the Project;
Part D: Development of greening in public areas and forestry plantations and orchards in and around
Yuzhou City over a five-year period involving the planting of about 275 million trees such that
the reforestation rate for Yuzhou City will be improved from 16.5 to 20 percent. This program is
in addition to project-specific green belts associated with Part A above.
Improving Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement in Henan Province. The objectives
of the TA are to: (a) strengthen the capability of both the Yuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau
(YEPB) and EPH Yuzhou Power Station Environmental Protection Unit in monitoring and enforcing
environmental rules and regulations; (b) improve the capability of EPH and YEPB to monitor coal quality
and EPH to enforce a system of bonuses and penalties, thereby inducing the mines to deliver good-quality
coal; and (c) update the mines on current practices and technologies to upgrade their product quality.
Although EPH would be the Executing Agency, the main focus of the TA will be on improving
the monitoring and enforcement capabilities of YEPB and EPH Yuzhou Power Station Environmental
Protection Unit. The TA will be implemented over a calendar period of four months by a team of
individual international and local consultants specializing in environmental management and clean coal
technology, including coal sampling and analysis.
Source:  Excerpt from the ADB Project Report (published with the authorization of the Chinese
government).
(e)    an electricity conservation component to support EPH's efforts in improving
demand side efficiency through market incentives rather than administrative
means; and
(f)    technical assistance, consulting services and training programs to build the
beneficiary's capabilities in power system operation and management
practices.



- 29 -
4.3    The two generation units to be constructed under the proposed project consist of
subcritical, drum-type boilers with low NO, burners, single shaft condensing turbines and
600 MW generators. They share a single 240-m stack. The plant's design coal is a blend
in the ratio of 1 part bituminous, 2 parts lean, and 1 part washed middlings, having an
aggregate sulfur and ash content of 0.41 percent and 24.95 percent, respectively.
Emission controls consist of electrostatic precipitators with an efficiency of 99.6 percent
for removal of dust from the gas emissions. The plant will also include an online
monitoring system to maximize efficiency and reduce coal consumption and provide
useful data for preventive maintenance (see Annx 4.1).
4.4   Two 165 km 500-kV transmission lines and two 750 MVA transformers will
connect the plant to the existing power system. The lines will be supported by a total of
408 steel towers of the guyed V-type, 38 m total height and 28 m width. The existing
towers of the Yellow River crossing are 114 m total height (see Annex 4.1).
Electricity Conservation Component
4.5    As part of the preparation of the proposed project, EPH carried out, with the
assistance of BERI, an integrated resource planning exercise. The study, Electricity
Conservation in Henan Province, highlighted the economic benefits of electricity
conservation investments and showed that the implementation of an aggressive electricity
conservation program could alleviate electricity shortages and reduce the required
generation capacity by 1,200 MW over the next seven years. It also indicated that, over
the same period, coal consumption for power generation could be reduced by 10 million
tons.  The potential and identified technologies were reviewed and confirmed by
international consultants during appraisal.
4.6    According to the prevailing Chinese administrative regulations, only the
provincial "Three Electricity Office" is mandated to implement social electricity
conservation (outside the power sector) projects. However, given EPH's strong interest
in electricity conservation, it was discussed and agreed to include in the proposed project
a $ 10 million loan component to:
(a)    develop  pilot/demonstration  projects aimed  at reducing  electricity
consumption through introduction of state-of-the-art technologies such as
variable speed motor control systems; low loss transformers, high
efficiency welding machines, etc.;
(b)   implement a pilot/demonstration project of power loss reduction in the
urban distribution system;
(c)    demonstrate the viability of innovative commercially-based contractual
and financing mechanisms; and



- 30 -
(d)   develop adequate monitoring procedures and test new and market-oriented
approaches, especially performance contracting and leasing, to speed up
the implementation of electricity conservation projects.
4.7   EPH initiated the selection of the projects to be included in the electricity
conservation component according to the following principles: financial and economic
profitability, measurability, technical innovation and replicability.   Annex 4.2
summarizes:  (a) the ongoing electricity conservation program  in Henan, (b) the
principles and criteria that guided the selection and would guide the implementation of
the conservation project; and (c) a concise description and cost estimate of the projects to
be undertaken under this component, a costibenefit analysis of the selected projects, and a
time-bound two-year implementation plan.
Project Design and Consulting Services
4.8   The project feasibility study and design report were completed by the Northwest
Electric Power Design Institute (NWEPDI) in 1993, and revised in September 1994. The
project was approved by SPC in 1992. Following the Bank's Guidelines, international
engineering consultants are being selected to assist in finalizing designs, procurement of
goods and works, and construction management (Annex A43). Funding in the amount of
$2.45 million out of the China Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project-
CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA) has been approved for engineering and preparation of the
project. A first version of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) was
prepared in 1993 by NWEPDI.  The report was revised with the assistance of
international consultants to conform with the Chinese and Bank environmental
procedures and guidelines for thermal power projects and finalized in April 1995. The
EIAR has been approved by all Government authorities, and its summary was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 1, 1995. The overall project concept and design is
satisfactory.
Management Development and Training
4.9   To meet EPH's long-term staffing requirements and to further develop EPH's
management capability, a comprehensive training program is included under the
proposed project. It consists of the following: (a) training in utility management and
financial planning; (b) project-related training for technical staff; and (c) upgrading of
and equipment for EPH's training facilities. It is estimated that 394 staff in various
fields, totaling 863 staff-months, will be trained abroad and in China (see Annex4.4A).
Assurances were obtained from EPH that it would carry out the management
development and training program as agreed with the Bank.
C. COST ESTIMATE
4.10 The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,161.1 million equivalent, excluding
interest during construction (IDC), of which $497.4 million (43 percent) represents the
foreign exchange component.  Table 4.1 provides a summary of the project cost



- 31 -
breakdown. The cost estimates reflect mid-1995 prices and are based on the recent
tendering information available for similar projects, including prices for major generating
equipment and control systems. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent for
preparatory and other works, local cost of equipment and services, and 5 percent for the
costs of plant equipment and materials, and transmission facilities. Price-contingency
allowances for foreign costs estimated in US dollars are calculated according to
anticipated international price increases of 2.4 percent a year on average for the period
1996-2002 and 4.5 percent for 1995. The price escalation for costs expressed in local
currency is calculated according to projected domestic inflation rates of 14.0 percent for
1995, 10.5 percent for 1996, 8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998 and 6.5 percent
for 1999 and 6.2 percent for 2000-03. The exchange rate used in the cost estimate was
Y 8.43 for $1.

- 32 -
D. FINANCING PLAN
4.11  The total financing requirements (including IDC of $250.2 million equivalent),
are estimated at $1,411.3 million equivalent. Central China Electric Power Group
Company CCEPGC (50 percent), Henan Provincial Construction and Investment
Company (HPCIC) (30 percent), and EPH (20 percent) will cover the financing of the
local cost and IDC. The loans provided by CCEPG and HPCIC will have a variable
interest rate (currently 15.1 percent a year) and 11 years maturity, including 3 years'
grace. Fifteen percent of the total cost will be provided by CCEPG and HPCIC in the
form of convertible loans, which can be converted to equity contributions to the new
company if the financiers decide to establish a limited liability company for the project
later. The local financial arrangements are acceptable to the Bank.
4.12  The foreign cost for the project estimated at $497.4, excluding IDC of $85.2
million, will be covered by the proposed loan of $440 million, a credit of $2.45 million
under CRISPP from the Bank and a cofinancing program of about $55 million from
international commercial lenders. Details of the financing plan are summarized in Table
4.2. The Bank loan will be used to finance the following project items:
(a)   major power plant equipment, including boilers, turbine-generators, and
instrumentation and control islands;
(b)   500-kV substation equipment;
(c)   construction equipment and materials;
(d)   consulting services for engineering and construction management;
(e)   environmental management program;
(f)   organizational restructuring and development of accounting and financial
management systems; and
(g)   management development and training; and
(h)   part of the electricity conservation equipment.

4.13  The proposed Bank loan will be made to the People's Republic of China at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 20-year term, including 5 years' grace.
Proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the Government to EPH with Henan
Provincial Government's guarantee at the same terms as the Bank loan. Assurances were
obtained from the Government that it would onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan to EPH under a subsidiary loan agreement with a term of 20 years, including a 5-
year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. EPH will bear the
foreign exchange risk.  Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and EPH by the State Council will be a condition of effectiveness for the
loan.
4.14  The foreign costs gap will be covered by commercial cofinancing of $55 million
equivalent which consists of two tranches: a $30 million Eurodollar syndicated loan
(Dollar loan), and a Yen 2.5 billion ($25 million equivalent) private placement (Yen
loan). Under the cofinancing scheme, commercial lenders are providing funds with a
final maturity of 15 years to China, represented by the Ministry of Finance. The proceeds
will be onlent by the MOF on the same terms to the beneficiary, EPH. MOF conducted
price inquiry for the financing in October 1995 with financial institutions that indicated
interest during earlier market soundings and awarded conditional mandate to: (a) a group
of six commercial banks for the Dollar loan; and (b) a life insurance company for the Yen
loan. The mandated interest rates for the Dollar loan and the Yen loan are 0.43 and 0.30
percent per year, respectively, over the relevant 6-month LIBOR. These terms, achieved
with a comfort of cofinancing arrangement, are very favorable for the final maturity of 15
years, including 5-year grace period. They are below the average pricing of commercial
bank borrowing (about LIBOR+0.5-0.6 percent) by Chinese sovereign entities for a much
shorter maturity of five to seven years.
E. PROCUREMENT
4.15  Procurement arrangements and the related procurement schedules for various
packages are given in Annex 4.5. The Bank's Procurement Guidelines (January 1995



- 34 -
version) will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement. The Bank loan will be largely
disbursed against plant equipment and materials, and major equipment contracts for
transmission systems through international competitive bidding (ICB). Five contracts
amounting to about $10 million in total for consulting services covering environmental
studies, engineering and construction management, organizational restructuring and
financial management systems, legal framework, and tariff studies will be awarded in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. Some specialized equipment
estimated to cost less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $6 million
and which can only be purchased from a limited number of suppliers, regardless of the
cost thereof, will be procured through limited international bidding (LIB). Goods,
instruments and accessories needed for construction and operation of the power plant,
including equipment for environmental monitoring and training, which are readily
available off-the-shelf or are standard specification commodities, and which are estimated
to cost less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $2.5 million, will be
procured through contracts awarded on the basis of international shopping procedures for
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2 million or national shopping procedures for
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $0.5 million. Goods of a proprietary nature may
be procured through direct contracting with the Bank's prior agreement up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed $0.5 million.  For the Electricity Conservation
Component, equipment for distribution loss reduction and high-efficiency transformers
will be procured through ICB. International and national shopping will be applied to
miscellaneous equipment, and technical services.
4.16 Because of foreign exchange limitations, civil works (fully locally financed) and
non-Bank-financed equipment will be procured locally through competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank, particularly for 220 kV transmission and substation
components, where local contractors and suppliers are fully capable and very competitive.
The procurement procedures for non-Bank-financed components will not adversely affect
the execution of the project in terms of cost, quality or completion time.
4.17 In ICB procurement, model bidding documents developed in consultation with the
Bank would be used, and goods and components of goods manufactured in China would
be eligible for a 15 percent (or import duties, whichever is less) preference in bid
evaluation. The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3.
4.18  Prior review would apply to all Bank-financed contracts for goods, with an
estimated cost of $5 million equivalent or above (about 94 percent of the loan). Prior
review would also apply to the first three contracts under $5 million. Other contracts
would be subject to selective post-award review. Prior review would also be required for
all consultancy contracts with an estimated cost exceeding $50,000 for individuals, or
$100,000 for firms. Exceptions to prior review would not apply to the terms of reference
for all consultancy contracts and single-source selection of consulting firms.

F. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.19 EPH will be responsible for project implementation and operation. A specialized
construction  unit has  been  established  to  manage  site  construction  activities.    Its
organizational structure is shown in Chart 3. Preparatory works including access roads
and construction power supply started in January 1995 and have been progressing
satisfactorily. The bidding documents for the procurement of the main boiler and turbine-
generator packages are scheduled to be issued in January 1996 to be opened in April
1996. The commercial operation of the first generating unit is expected in end-March
2001 and the second unit by the end of December 2001. Thus, the project completion
date would be December 30, 2002 and the closing date of the Bank loan would be
June 30, 2003. Chart 4 presents the implementation schedule for the various components
of the project. Furthermore, key dates of project implementation are given in Annex 4.6,
and estimated annual contractual and other payments are summarized Table 4.4.

G. DISBURSEMENT
4.20      The  Bank  loan  will  be  disbursed  against:    (a) 100 percent  of  the  foreign
expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a c.i.f. basis;



- 37 -
(b) 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items, and
75 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and (c) 100 percent of
the expenditure for consulting services and training. For expenditures pertaining to goods
contracts valued at less than $5,000,000 (except for the first three such contracts),
consultancy contracts valued at less than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals
and all training, reimbursement will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.
Supporting documents need not be submitted to the Bank but will be retained in the EPH
office for review by Bank supervision missions. To facilitate disbursements under this
project, a Special Account will be established with an authorized allocation of $15
million, representing approximately four months of average project disbursements.
Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the amounts
withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes sooner. Annex 4.7
presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan as well as a standard
profile of disbursements for all sectors in China. The disbursements are expected to be
completed in six years, very close to the standard disbursement profile for China. The
last year is for payment of retention money.
H. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RESETTLEMENT
4.21  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been
assigned to Category A. The Environmental Assessment (EA), prepared with the
assistance of international consultants specializing in environmental issues related to
thermal power plants, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Bureau of
Henan Province and the National Environmental Protection Agency. The EA has been
reviewed by the World Bank; it is considered that all environmental aspects of the project
are satisfactorily addressed and in compliance with all Chinese and World Bank
environmental regulations, policies and procedures. The project has been designed and
will be carried out in accordance with modem concepts of environmental management.
Consequently, the project should cause minimum disturbance to the environment. A
monitoring program will be incorporated to ascertain and verify these conclusions on a
sustained basis.
4.22  The project is a greenfield operation located in a semirural agricultural area of
Jiyuan municipality in the northwestern part of Henan Province, about 17 km to the
northwest of Jiyuan city. Alternative locations for the power plant had been considered.
The selected site for the power plant, at the foot of Taihang and Wangwushan mountains,
received the highest environmental ranking. It uses land that is currently uninhabited, too
poor for cultivation and offers the best possibilities for dispersion of flue gases, thus
avoiding relocation of population and providing the smallest impact on the natural and
human environment. It will require acquisition of a total of 290 ha of land, of which only
14 ha, required by the transmission line, are cultivated.  The construction of the
transmission lines and substations will require very limited relocation of population
unless routing changes will be required due to unidentified technical and/or soil
problems.  A  land acquisition and relocation document (LARP-I) defining the
resettlement policies, planning principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria



- 38 -
for the estimated maximum resettlement that could be caused by the project, was
prepared by EPH (Annax4.8A). It was agreed that EPH will: (a) carry out the
environmental management program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (b) prepare a
final Land Acquisition and Relocation Plan (LARP-II) when the final survey and detailed
engineering of the 500 kV lines and substations are completed; and (c) carry out the
LARP-II as agreed with the Bank The Borrower will submit the LARP-II for Bank
approval prior to the procurement of equipment for the construction of the lines and
substations and this will be a condition for disbursement for that equipment..
4.23 Modern pollution control technologies will be incorporated into the design of the
power plant, such as high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators and low NO, burners.
Additionally, the plant layout provides adequate space to install additional pollution
control systems if required as a result of future changes in Chinese standards and/or
technological developments. Annex 4.9 provides a summary of key environmental issues
associated with the project and their anticipated impacts, the mitigating plan to assure
these impacts are minimized, and the monitoring program with which environmental
impacts will be measured and compared with EA predictions. Further strengthening of
EPH institutional capabilities is included in the project design. It will cover both training
and acquisition of appropriate environmental monitoring equipment (see Annex 4.9, Part
C). Moreover, mitigation measures identified in the EA and included into the project
design for the transmission lines include: adequate tower placement to minimize impact
on farm fields, a 100-meter corridor to place the transmission lines as far as possible from
population centers, and sufficient height of the line span, at the point of maximum line
slack, to avoid interference with road traffic.
4.24  Environmental issues associated with the project (power station and transmission
line) and addressed in the EA included all concerns expressed by affected parties in a
series of public meetings. The local public and local authorities support the project and
the recommended mitigating measures offered in the EA. The mitigation and monitoring
plans presented in the EA (see Annex 4.9, Parts B and C) will be fully implemented.
4.25  Key issues addressed in the EA include: air pollution (dust, sulfur dioxide), water
pollution (primarily groundwater at the ash disposal site), coal storage and handling, ash
disposal, worker health and safety, electric field, noise and bird flight patterns
(transmission line), and the influence of the construction and operation labor force on the
local infrastructure. Furthermore, the proposed project (2 units of 600 MW) is the first
phase of an overall program to develop 3,600 MW at the Qinbei site. To avoid future
adverse environmental consequences, the EA examined both the immediate impacts of
the subject project (1,200 MW) as well as the cumulative impacts of the overall
3,600 MW program.
4.26 All mitigating measures for air, water, and solids management (coal, ash) are
designed to meet appropriate Chinese requirements and/or World Bank guidelines,
whichever is stricter. In the absence of either, international standards of codes of practice
will be used.

I. REPORTING AND MONITORING
4.27  Satisfactory performance indicators and procedures for monitoring, evaluating,
and reporting on the project have been discussed with and agreed by EPH. The Bank
would be furnished with semiannual and annual project progress reports, The annual
project progress reports would include, inter alia, EPH's proposals regarding project costs
and financing plan for the following year. The scope and content of the project progress
reports have also been agreed.
4.28  With regard to the construction of the Qinbei power plant and transmission lines,
monitoring of costs, quality and schedule is the main function of the project unit within
EPH, and their consultants. The Bank will monitor procurement progress in accordance
with the procurement schedule in Annex 4.5, and construction progress in accordance
with the schedule of Chart 4 and the key dates in the main contracts, of which major
milestones are set out in Annex 4.6. Overall costs will be monitored in accordance with
Table 4.1. The guiding principles for the resettlement are described in Annex 4.9 and
detailed indicators will be defined in the RAP. The responsibility for environmental
monitoring is comprehensively presented in Annex 4.9. Key data for the implementation
of the reform plan is provided in the matrix at the end of Annex 3.3.
4.29  The Bank supervision plan attached in Annex 4.10 will focus on the core
activities of the project implementation and achievement of the agreed objectives. These
include physical construction, environmental management, the resettlement plan
(including compensation), corporatization of EPH, power sector reform in Henan
Province, and the financial covenants set out in Table 5.2. The key monitoring indicators
of each of the objectives sought through the proposed project are provided in Annex 4.1 1.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. INTRODUCTION
5.1   EPH follows MOF financial regulations applicable to state-owned enterprises.
These regulations have gradually evolved over the last decade from a system in which all
investment funds were provided by the Government and all surpluses remitted to it, to
one which provides some autonomy and incentives for efficiency.
5.2   The new accounting principles and financial rules effective July 1, 1993 will have
far-reaching impacts on the sector. First, they require power entities to clarify and
separate debt from equity. This is an important step for power entities moving toward
limited liability companies and eventually shareholding companies. Diversification of
ownership is critical to mobilizing more resources to the sector. Secondly, under the new
profit allocation system specified in the new financial rules issued by MOF, the
adjustment tax and special fund allocations have been abolished. The management of
power entities are given greater autonomy in making decisions on profit distribution.
Thirdly, enterprises are permitted to design their own internal accounting and financial
management system based on their business needs. Overall, the new financial rules
together with the rationalization of state assets management, and other fiscal and financial
sector reforms, will lead the state to gradually play an ownership role rather than being
involved in the management of power entities. With new autonomy and increased
accountability power entities will also have an incentive to improve their budgetary and
cost controls as well as cash management in order to stay competitive in a market-
oriented environment.
5.3   The Government promulgated a series of important new tax laws at the end of
1993. From 1994, the negotiated contract responsibility system was replaced by a
uniform and simplified tax system. A corporate income tax rate of 33 percent is being
applied to all domestic enterprises. The old sales taxes (about 25 percent of sales) levied
for power generation and distribution were also replaced by a new value-added tax (VAT)
at 17 percent. The new tax policy does not necessarily reduce the tax burden for power
entities. However, it eliminates the lengthy and complicated negotiations between
enterprises and the Government. More importantly, it is conducive to strengthening the
planning and financial management functions of the power companies.
5.4   The power sector was selected as one of the sectors under experiment for assets
revaluation in 1993. The exercise has been undertaken in five steps: (a) inventory check
of the existing assets; (b) classification of ownership (source of investment for all assets);
(c) revaluation of fixed assets; (d) validating cash position; and (e) property right
registration. All power companies, regional, provincial, and municipal, have completed



-41 -
the work up to the fourth step and now are awaiting the central government to issue state
assets management implementation regulations in order to carry out the final step.
5.5    The  methodology  used  in  revaluing  assets  is generally  consistent with
international practice. Four methods in the following order have been tested in the
revaluation exercise: (a) price indexed approach; (b) price quotations specified in the
revaluation booklet; (c) replacement cost approach; and (d) foreign cost adjustment for all
imported equipment. Both gross and net fixed assets have been revalued according to the
booklet issued by the Government. The Central Enterprise Division in MOF's Finance
Bureau in the power company's jurisdiction is responsible for reviewing whether the
exercise is done properly. The results of revaluation have been double checked by the
regional power company which is administratively in charge of the provincial or
municipal company. Finally, the Central Enterprise Division of the Finance Bureau in
the regional power company's jurisdiction is responsible for validation of the revaluation
results.
B. EPH's PAST AND PRESENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.6    EPH's financial performance in the past was generally satisfactory. It has been
able to meet the financial covenants in connection with the previous Bank-financed
Yanshi project (Loan 3433-CHA). EPH's income statements, balance sheets, and funds
flow  statements for the period 1990-94 are set out in Annex 5.1.  Key ratios and
indicators highlighting its past and present finances are summarized in Table 5.1.

- 42 -
5.7   The decline in net profit observed in 1994 after three years of steady increase, is
mainly due to different accounting treatments of depreciation and interest expenses, and
new tax laws enacted in 1994. Operating costs increased dramatically in 1994 mostly
because of the accelerated depreciation methods implemented by mid-1993 and higher
taxation rate following the implementation of the new VAT.
5.8   Under the previous Bank loan for the Yanshi Thermal Power Project, EPH agreed
to maintain its net operating income equivalent to not less than (a) 20 percent of its
average annual investment program for the years 1992-94, and (b) 25 percent thereafter,
and not to incur any debt unless its debt service coverage ratio is greater than 1.3 times.
EPH's net operating incomes were 24.2 percent, 26.2 percent and 22.2 percent of three
years' average capital expenditures in 1992, 1993, and 1994 respectively. The debt
service coverage ratios in 1992, 1993, and 1994 were 2.1, 1.7 and 1.8 times, respectively.
Therefore, EPH has met the financial performance targets set out under the previous loan.
5.9   The pre-1993 financial statements have limited value as predictors of future
performance, because of several factors:
(a)   Fixed assets and accumulated depreciation provisions were revalued in
1993 but not in previous years;
(b)   Depreciation rates were increased in 1993; power plant equipment is now
amortized over 12 years, well below its economic/technical life;
(c)   Value of construction work-in-progress and related sources of funds were
not recorded in EPH's accounts; and
(d)   New financial regulations, mostly based on International Accounting
Standards (IAS), effective July 1, 1993, have required financial statements
to follow the definitions and classifications of accounts promulgated by
MOF, which are different from those under the old accounting system.
C. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TARGETS
5.10  A self-financing ratio was chosen to promote prudent financial management and
adequate tariff levels for two reasons: (a) the ownership of EPH's assets cannot be
clarified and decided before issuance of the State Council regulations related to the
implementation of the new Company Law, and, (b) mobilization of funds to meet the
important investment needs of the power sector will remain one of the most important
challenges in Henan Province. The self-financing ratio will also be easy to monitor.
5.11  The rationale for raising the final target of the self-financing ratio from 25 percent
under the previous Bank loan (para. 5.8) to 35 percent by the year 2000 are threefold:
(a) EPH's internal tariff projection, with an increasing share of new-generation units
entering into the rate base by the end of the century, suggests a higher tariff level than a
self-financing ratio of 25 percent can achieve; (b) EPH's current tariff level is well below



- 43 -
the long-run marginal cost and a higher self-financing ratio is aimed to bring up the tariff
level close to the economic price by the year 2000; and (c) EPH has increased the
depreciation rate from 4.73 percent to 7.18 percent of the gross fixed assets under
operation since 1994 and is no longer obligated to contribute to the "two funds" under the
new financial rules.
5.12   With a view  to promoting this reform  and prudent financial management,
assurances were obtainedfrom EPH that it will:
(a)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments,
to ensure its internal cash surpluses, qfter meeting (i) cash operating
expenses; (ii) interest charged to operations; (iii) all taxes; (iv) gross
increases in working capital; and (iv) loan repayments, are sufficient to
maintain self-financing ratios of no less than 25 percent in 1996, 30 percent
during 199 7-1999, and 35 percent thereafter;
(b)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments,
to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt service coverage
ratio of no less than 1.5 times at all times, and
(c)   by April 30 of each year, fiurnish to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial
plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and uses
offunds, and balance sheets.
5.13   By taking this approach, the magnitude of required tariff increases is significant.
With the large investment program anticipated and the current low tariff, major
adjustments need to be initiated. In order to meet these financial targets, projections
show that EPH's average price must be increased by a minimum of above 15 percent
(over 6 percent in real terms) per annum from the 1994 level as shown in Table 5.2
during the remainder of the 1 990s for EPH to make a reasonable contribution to its future
investment program.
D. FUTURE FINANCES
5.14  The projections of EPH's finances for 1995-2004 are presented in Annex 5.2, and
the salient features of these finances are highlighted below in Table 5.2. The projections
are based on the assumptions contained in Annex 5.3. The average prices shown depict
the minimum tariff adjustments needed to allow EPH to achieve the above financial
performance targets.
5.15   Table 5.2 shows the projected level of increases in purchased power prices, prices
for EPH's own generation, and the weighted average of those two that will be required to
meet the financial covenants. The prices for purchased power will be determined on a
plant-by-plant basis, at "debt service price" levels, allowing for full debt service based on
7- to 8-year repayment period after commissioning of new power plants.

5.16    EPH's financial position, however, depends on revenues that it collects from  its
own generation plants. In order to meet the expansion plan and projected cost increases
in the future and comply with the financial performance targets set forth above, EPH's
average tariff will need to increase by an estimated 11.7 percent in current terms or
4.0 percent in real terms a year from 1995 to 2004. Given the current low catalog prices,
18.9 fen/kWh in 1994 and 20.4 fen/kWh in 1995, EPH's own average revenue needs to
have a substantial increase of about 130 percent from 1994 (21.63 fen/kWh) to 2000
(50.24 fen/kWh) to achieve the final target self-financing ratio of 35 percent.
5.17    Although  the rate of increases in the catalog  prices required  to  achieve the
covenanted self-financing ratio for EPH are large, much of the increase should stem from
the entry of new generating plant into the rate base. Because of the rapid load growth, the
bulk of the tariff increase required will be met through implementation of the new pricing
principles. By 1996, more than half of EPH's own generation is expected to come from
plants built after 1993. By 2004, the share rises to 75 percent.



-45 -
5.18  During the period 1995-2004, EPH is expected to maintain relatively high rates of
growth necessitated by the prospective strong economic growth in Henan Province.
Based on latest demand forecast and expansion plan assumptions, energy sales are
expected to rise by 138 percent over 1994 levels, representing a compound annual growth
rate of about 9.1 percent. EPH's annual investment program and net fixed assets in
operation are expected to expand by 219 and 562 percent over the period, an annual
increase of about 14 and 23 percent, respectively.
5.19 During 1995-2004, EPH's performance is anticipated to improve gradually and
steadily as the tariff level of EPH's own generation be raised to meet the financial targets,
from 21.68 fen/kWh in 1994 to 65.81 fen/kWh in 2004, tariff structure is further
rationalized, and self-financing as well as debt service requirements emerge as dominant
factors in pricing formulation. Based on the projected minimum tariff level, about
11.4 percent increase per year for its own generation and 14 percent for purchased power
from 1994 to 2004, both revenues and net incomes are expected to grow considerably
over the period. The rate of return on historically valued assets and on revalued assets
will improve significantly during 1995-2001 as the tariff level moving towards economic
prices and decline to a more sustainable level, 12 to 15 percent, afterwards.

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. LEAST COST STUDY
6.1   Henan Province has limited hydroelectric potential and large coal resources, and
is next to Shanxi Province, which has abundant resources of high quality coal. Therefore
state-of-the-art 300 and 600 MW coal-fired units are attractive candidates for the
provincial and regional development programs.  They complement hydropower
developments in Henan (Xiaolangdi, Loan 3727-CHA) and in neighboring provinces,
such as Hunan and Hebei, to ensure optimal and environmentally sustainable
development of the Central China power system.
6.2   During the preparation of the project, a least-cost expansion study was carried out
by BERI, covering 1996-2010 with a focus on 1996-2005. The study was carried out
using an optimization model that determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to
meet the demand with the minimum cost (net present value of investment and operating
costs), given a predetermined reliability criteria. It considered all potential candidates
including: power exchanges with neighboring provinces, distillate fueled combined cycle
plant, 300 and 600 MW coal-fired units, hydropower and pumped storage plants, and gas
turbines. It showed that the expansion program should be based, up to the year 2002, on
300 MW and 600 MW coal-fired units and that the proposed project is the first
investment of the optimal (least-cost) power development program.
6.3   Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the proposed project, which remains
the first investment of the provincial expansion program(s) under a wide range of
assumptions:
(a)   the project will still be required by year 2001, even if the demand growth
would slow from projected 9 percent per year to only 6 percent between
1994 and 2001.
(b)   The project remains more economical than an equivalent combined cycle
power plant even if the cost of distillate were 46 percent lower than in the
base case ($113 per ton compared to $209 per ton) or if the investment
cost of combined cycle were 58 percent lower than in the base case ($250
per kW installed compared to $600 per kW installed).
(c)   The project remains the first investment of the least-cost program and is
still needed in 2001 even if the discount rate is increased from 12 to
16 percent.



- 47 -
6.4   A summary of the power development program (1994-2004) for the HPG system
is given in Annex 6. 1. The balances between power demand and supply are presented in
Annex 6.2. They demonstrate that the power system will be short of energy supply and
capacity up to the year 2001.
B. ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
Power Plant and Transmission Components
6.5   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the proposed project was
calculated based on the estimated power price of 39 fen/kWh (in 1994 prices) that will be
paid for electricity at the 110/35 kV level in 2001, the first year of operation, based on
existing policies for pricing of power output from new power plants. This price, based on
revenues generated by the new power plant rather than the economic value of a shortfall
in electric power supply, underestimates the economic benefits of the project. It yielded
an IERR of about 15.2 percent
6.6   The IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent, in the case of
one of the following occurrences:
(a)   the price paid at the 110/30 kV for electricity from new power plants were
20 percent lower than the base case price: i.e., 33 fen/kWh in 1994 prices;
(b)   the project were to experience a cost overrun of 26 percent;
(c)   the power plant operation were reduced to 5,160 hours per year;
(d)   the economic fuel cost were 70 percent higher than the base case;
(e)   the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of 29 months.
6.7   However, these occurrences are very unlikely because EPH has a very good
record in project implementation, the economic assumptions considered in the base case
are stringent ,and the financial covenants of the project would ensure that prices are high
enough to meet the economic viability requirements.. As examples, (a) the price paid by
new power plants in the province is already higher than the assumed price and prices
accepted for some of newly commissioned or under construction power plants are in the
range of 45-50 fen/kWh; and (b) EPH managed to build the Jiaozuo power plant
(6x200 MW) and the Bank supported Yanshi project (2x300 MW) within schedule and
without cost overruns, and (c) the cost per kW installed considered in the base case is
more than 20 percent higher than the cost of the latest Bank supported projects in China.
Environmental Benefits
6.8   The project has also significant environmental benefits. It improves the efficiency
of the generation system and reduces the average coal consumption by about 14 g/kWh.
Reduction in coal consumption amounts to more than 1.4 million tons in 2003, the year



- 48 -
after full commissioning of the plant. With the development of Xiaolangdi (multipurpose
hydro project-No. 3727-CHA), most of Henan's hydropower potential would have been
exploited and the only alternatives to Qinbei would be smaller and less efficient coal-
fired units. The electricity conservation component will also contribute in speeding up
the implementation of electricity conservation projects and significantly reduce the coal
consumption over the medium term (see para. 4.6).
C. PROJECT RISKS
6.9   All proposed technologies are currently in successful use in China. Cost estimate
risks have been addressed by advanced procurement action; bids for major components
have already been prepared before loan negotiations and issued prior to Board
presentation. The risk of delay in project construction due to project management
shortcomings is minimal because of the experience gained during the implementation of
the Jiaozuo and Yanshi projects, the timely staffing and training of personnel of the
Qinbei implementation unit , and the assistance provided by experienced engineering
consultants. The risk of nonperformance in the environmental and resettlement area has
been addressed by the establishment of appropriate monitoring organizations and
procedures (see para. 4.24). More importantly, sensitivity analyses show that even in
case of implementation of more stringent enviromnental standards requiring future
installation of FGD, the project would remain economically viable.
6.10 Delay in implementing power sector reforms in an efficient and timely manner
represents a risk that can jeopardize the progress toward more openness and efficiency of
the sector and more fiscal and managerial autonomy of EPH. This risk is minimized by
the strong commitment of Chinese to reform both at the central and provincial level. This
risk is also addressed through provision of required technical assistance and adequate
monitoring of implementation of the agreed upon reform plan during the project cycle (cf.
para. 3. 10).
6.11 The economic and financial risks would be minimal. In view of advanced
preparatory works, risks associated with project construction, cost overruns, and
implementation delays are within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed
supervision and involvement of competent consultants. Particular attention will be given
to the safety aspects of the project, and to capability and performance of major
contractors.

ANNEX 3.1: POWER SECTOR STRUCTURE
IN HENAN PROVINCE
Institutional Framework
1.    There are four groups of enterprises associated with construction, management and
operation of the electric power sector in Henan Province:
(a)   provincial power enterprises;
(b)   prefectural/municipal power enterprises;
(c)   county power enterprises; and
(d)   power plant enterprises.
Provincial Power Enterprises
2.    The Electric Power of Henan (EPH) and Henan General Construction Investment
Company (HGCIC) are independent legal entities. EPH has the status of a limited-liability
company under its charters formulated pursuant to the law on State-Owned Enterprises.
3.    EPH is a state-owned enterprise administrated by Central China Electric Power
Administration (CCEPA) on behalf of MOEP. It is owned jointly by the central
government and the Henan Provincial Government. EPH is responsible for construction,
management and operation of generation, transmission and distribution in the province. It
has 31 dependent enterprises; 13 prefectural/municipal power enterprises, 7 power plant
enterprises, 4 power plants under construction (offices for management of projects under
construction), 2 technical school, 2 training school, a staff training center, a power test and
research center, and a power dispatch center. These subsidiaries have no separate legal
status and have commitments with EPH to achieve specific production and cost
performance. EPH collects all revenue from their electricity sales and pays their salaries
and operating costs.
4.    EPH also has 13 independent enterprises that are separate legal entities, which are
self-accounting and operate like subsidiaries. They include five service companies; for
material supply, consulting, fuel supply, industry and commerce and general construction;
four construction and installation companies; two factories for repair of equipment; one
investment company and one design institute. EPH controls them by appointing their



- 66 -                     ANNEX 3.1
management, limiting the size of their staff and salary levels. The service and construction
companies are required to pay dividends each year to EPH based on their profits.
5.    HGCIC is an enterprise owned by the Provincial Government, entrusted by it to
manage its investment in capital construction projects, mainly in transportation, power,
coal, raw material and industry sector, whether in the form of joint investment or joint
ventures. Administratively, it is affiliated with the Henan Provincial Planning and
Economic Commission. HGCIC's articles of association state that it is an investment
company administrated by the provincial government. HGCIC's income is derived mainly
from capital construction surcharges, including the 2 fen/kwh power construction fund, for
financing new construction and from dividends on its investments. It has the right to raise
funds and borrow to finance its investment on behalf of the Provincial Government.
6.    HGCIC has by the end of 1994 invested about Y 2.1 billion in twelve power
projects in Henan Province. These are contractual joint ventures (except Zhengzhou
Cogeneration Power Plant is ajoint-investment company with legal status). The contractual
joint ventures are with the central government, the provincial power company and
prefectural/municipal governments. HGCIC is responsible for making investment and it is
not involved in the construction, operation and management process. For contractual joint
venture power projects, EPH is entrusted to construct, manage and operate them on behalf
of all the investors.
Prefectural/Municipal Power Enterprises
7.    The prefectural/municipal power companies are responsible for power distribution
in the main cities of the province. Ten of these companies are part of EPH and have no
separate legal status. Four of these companies are separate legal entities independent from
EPH and they are owned by the respective prefectural/municipal governments. The
independent power companies purchase power from EPH on a wholesale basis and resell
the power to the county power companies or directly to the consumers.
County Power Enterprises
8.    There are 118 county-level power companies, most of whom have small coal-fired
plants and operate local distribution. All these companies are independent entities owned
by county governments. They purchase bulk power from EPH and sell any surplus to it
from their small thermal plants.
Power Plant Enterprises
9.    Henan Province has 13 large power plants. Firstly, there are seven state-owned
power plants operated by EPH. Four other plants are owned independently as joint
investments. However, EPH operates and manages them under contract and purchases their
output. Then, there is the Zhengzhou Cogeneration Power Plant (ZCPP), which is an
independent legal entity jointly owned by Xinli Company, HGCIC and EPH. ZCPP's daily



- 67 -                     ANNEX 3.1
operation and maintenance is entrusted to EPH through an O&M contract and its energy is
sold to EPH through a Power Purchase Agreement. Lastly, the Sanmenxia Hydropower
Plant is owned and operated by the Ministry of Water Resources, and its energy is
dispatched by and sold to EPH.
Regulatory Framework
10.   The main institutions involved with the regulation of the sector are:
(a)   State Planning Commission (SPC);
(b)   Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP);
(c)   Central China Electric Power Administration (CCEPA);
(d)   Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB);
(e)   Henan Provincial Planning and Economic Commission (HPPEC);
(f)    Henan Provincial Price Bureau (HPPB);
(g)   Prefectural/Municipal Power Bureau; and
(h)   County Power Bureau
11.   There are several levels of regulation controlling the activities of the electric power
enterprises in Henan province. At the top are the central government agencies like the State
Planning Commission (SPC), which approves all large investments and tariff level for
energy produced by government grant financed plants, the Ministry of Electric Power
(MOEP), which formulates the major policies and legislation governing the power sector,
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Corporation (MOFTEC). At the regional level is the Central China Electric Power
Administration (CCEPA), which is delegated responsibility for administration of the
provincial power enterprises in the central China grid by MOEP.
12.   At the provincial level, the Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau acts on behalf
of MOEP through CCEPA. Administratively, CCEPA is integrated with EPH and has the
same staff and management. Its main functions are to implement the laws and regulations
issued by the central government for the power sector. HPEPB administers the sector
enterprises, provides technical support to them and prepares the provincial power
development plan.
13.   The other main regulatory agency is the Henan Provincial Planning and Economic
Commission (HPPEC). HPPEC approves project investments up to Y 200 million. Above
this level, it submits proposed project to SPC for approval. It also approves fund raising by



- 68 -                      ANNEX 3.1
HGCIC such as surcharges and bond issues and power consumption quotas and allocations
based on monthly plans prepared by EPH. Prefecture-level power prices and prices for
above-quota power supply are also approved by HPPEC. HPPEC also, jointly with
HPEPA, approves the "network tariffs" of the new power plants built under joint-
investment projects.
14.   Finally, there are the Prefectural/Municipal and County-level bureau, which operate
like HPEPA and on its behalf at this level. In addition, power development enterprises
similar to HGCIC in the prefectures or in the counties, an electricity office (referred to as
the "three electricity office") approves investments, power allocations and retail prices.
These bodies also collect local surcharges from consumers and arrange investment of these
funds on behalf of county governments, mostly in distribution. The three specific functions
of the electricity offices are to take responsibility for electricity consumptions, conservation
and safety.

ANNEX 3.3: REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
ELECTRIC POWER OF HENAN
(MAY 1995)
1.    The Chinese Government has initiated various measures designed to meet the
requirements of the power sector within a socialist market economy and to establish a
modem enterprise system. This new system is based on: the clear definition of property
rights; commercial orientation and autonomous management; financial independence; and,
the separation of government ownership and regulation from enterprise management.
Electric Power of Henan (EPH) and Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB)
have made some progress to achieve the above goals by: (a) completing the identification,
revaluation and registration of fixed assets; (b) initiating financial and accounting reforms
consistent with new rules and regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance; (c) developing
a new tariff structure to achieve economic pricing in five years; and (d) continuing
management system reforms according to the Regulations for Transformation of Operation
Mechanism of Enterprises Owned by the Whole People.
2.    These measures provide favorable conditions to develop China's power industry
and for a gradual transition to a socialist market economy. To further the progress achieved
it is now necessary to deepen reform. Accordingly, EPH and HPEPB have defined a
Reform Implementation Plan with the assistance of international consultants.
3.    This plan takes account of the Decision on Several Problems in Establishing the
Socialist Market Economy, the Company Law of the People's Republic of China, the
Regulations for Transformation of the Operating Mechanism of Enterprises Owned by the
Whole People, as well as the Power Sector Reform Strategy for China prepared jointly by
the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) and the World Bank.
4.    EPH, MOEP and Central China Electric Power Group Administration (CCEPGA)
confirm that the reforms planned will be fully implemented in accordance with the
applicable laws and implementing regulations-some of which are yet to be promulgated.
The reform actions, timing and linkage to the Qinbei Thermal Power Project loan are
summarized in the attached table.



-71-                            ANNEX3.3
Reform Objectives
5.     EPH has established the following reform objectives:
(a)    separation of government ownership, government regulation and enterprise
management; and, to establish a mechanism for effective and coordinated
regulation;
(b)    clear specification of EPH's commercial objectives and introduction of
management methods which are scientific and suited to the market system,
in order to increase management autonomy and accountability;
(c)    gradual rationalization of electricity tariffs to reach economic levels and
achieve financial adequacy;
(d)    the introduction of competition and market forces into the power sector.
6.     To attain these objectives, the Reform Implementation Plan defines a series of step-
by-step reforms involving: (a) incorporation of EPH as a limited liability company in
accordance with the Company Law; (b) separating the regulatory functions of the power
bureau from EPH; (c) commercialization of EPH's operations; (d) reforming tariffs to reach
economic and financially adequate levels; and, (e) restructuring the sector to introduce
competition at the generation level, and improve commercial contractual arrangements
between the different operating entities in the sector. This strategy is consistent with the
reforms outlined in the Power Sector Strategy Study developed jointly by the MOEP and
the World Bank. As an integrated package, subject to certain statutory approvals by the
State Council and the promulgation of supporting laws and regulations, these reforms will
be fully implemented by the end of 2000.
A. Corporatization of EPH
7.     EPH will be incorporated as a limited liability company under the new Company
Law.' The precise schedule for incorporation cannot be defined, because the State Council
has yet to issue implementing guidelines for restructuring state-owned enterprises as
Companies-Article 21, Chapter 2, of the Company Law. Towards achieving this goal
EPH has completed an asset valuation and verification of accounts.
8.     As a transitional step towards incorporation as a limited liability company (LLC),
EPH and MOEP explored the possibility of incorporating EPH as a Wholly State-Owned
1   The Company Law of the People's Republic of China specifies two broad corporate forms: Limited Liability
Companies and Joint Stock Limited Companies (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 respectively, in the Company Law).
Under the category of Liability Liability Companies there are two organizational forms: (i). a limited liability
company (LLC) which has not less than two and not more than fifty shareholders; and, a wholly State-owned
limited liability company (WSOLLC) for state-owned enterprises that have a "single investing entity".



- 72 -                    ANNEX 3.3
limited liability Company (WSOLLC). It was established that even to be incorporated as a
WSOLLC it would require State Council implementing guidelines for restructuring state-
owned enterprises as Companies.
9.    To prepare for incorporation as a limited liability company, EPH will prepare
Articles of Association and internal regulations that will be consistent with the Company
Law. The Articles of Association (except for capital restructuring provisions which will
require State Council implementing regulations) will be prepared by June, 1995. According
to the Reform Implementation Plan, EPH will be incorporated as a limited liability
corporation within nine months of the issuance of the State Council implementing
regulations.
10.   EPH will also establish its state-owned generation plants as wholly-owned limited
liability companies (this is discussed in more detail in Section E, Sector Restructuring).
B. Separation of Government Functions from Enterprise
11.   An important reform objective is to separate government functions (i.e. regulatory
functions) from EPH. This reform is not entirely within the control of EPH, MOEP and
CCEPGA and will require additional government regulations on implementing power
sector reform. Consequently, EPH will adopt a two phase strategy. In the first phase,
which is within the control of EPH, all government functions will be consolidated within a
Power Bureau Department within EPH working independently from EPH operations. In
the second phase, the Power Bureau Department and the government functions it performns
will be completely separated from EPH. This second phase will need to be pursued in
accordance with an overall government program to establish effective power sector
regulation in China, as well as the province of Henan.
12.   EPH will begin the first phase immediately. All government functions being
performed by the Power Bureau will be identified and consolidated within a Power Bureau
Department. The new department will have its own Director, its own staff and be the only
departmnent that performs government functions. Internal company regulations and
procedures will be developed that will ensure that the Power Bureau Department will
operate separate from EPH, and will include procedures about: (a) the Power Bureau
Department's authority over EPH's operations; (b) communication between EPH's internal
divisions and external units and the Power Bureau Department; and (c) the Power Bureau
Departnent's communication with other government organizations.  The plan for
establishing the Power Department will be completed by June 1995, and implemented no
later than June 1996.
13.  Initiation of the second phase will need to await governmental reforms and
implementation directives. EPH, CCEPGA and MOEP have in principle agreed to achieve
formal separation of all government functions within nine (9) months of issuance of the
necessary regulations. Policy dialogue on this aspect of regulatory separation will continue,



-73 -                        ANNEX 3.3
more specifically through the IDF-financed technical assistance on power sector regulation
being managed by MOEP.
C. Commercialization of EPH Operations
14.   EPH will implement four types of reform to deepen commercialization.  The
reforms will include: (a) rationalizing noncore businesses from the core power business of
EPH, with gradual divestiture of noncore businesses; (b) establishing power supply bureaus
as independent accounting profit centers to operate based on a transparent bulk transfer
price; (c) restructuring of internal organization and improvement of management control
systems; and (d) implementing a suitable financial management and accounting system
appropriate to restructured internal organization.
Separation and Potential Transfer of Noncore Activities
15.   EPH has a number of activities that are either not related or ancillary to its power
activities. These activities have different degrees of financial autonomy, separation of costs
and commercial orientation. Several of the activities provide social services important to
EPH workers and staff. EPH will first review its external units to differentiate between
those subsidiary activities that are: (a) existing profit-centers with independent accounting
and separate legal status (Category A) such as the four Construction and Installation
Companies and the Industrial and Commercial Group; (b) cost-centers that can be
transformed into profit centers (Category B), such as the two Technical Schools and one
Training School for Skilled Workers; and (c) cost centers that mainly provide social and
welfare services (Category C).
16.   The review to differentiate EPH's noncore activities and classification into the three
categories (i.e. A, B and C) will be completed by June 1995. Category A entities, which are
already independent accounting profit-centers with separate legal status, will establish clear
commercial relationship based on contractual agreements with EPH by December 1996.
These commercial entities will be incorporated as Companies in accordance with the
Company Law when State Council guidelines on restructuring state-owned enterprises are
promulgated.
17.   Category B and C activities will first be set up as profit-centers and cost-centers
respectively. This will require appropriate transfer prices that reflect the costs of the
services being provided. This will be completed by December 1996. Category C cost-
centers will be separated once the government establishes suitable institutions and
mechanisms to facilitate separation.
Establishing Power Supply Bureaus as Independent Accounting Profit-Centers
18.   EPH will establish the thirteen (13) EPH-affiliated power supply bureaus as
independent accounting profit-centers to operate on the basis of: (a) a clear and transparent
bulk transfer price for electricity (also called the internal settlement price); and (b) a



- 74 -                      ANNEX3.3
commercial contractual arrangement that specifies performance targets providing a
framework for efficient operation and management of these power supply bureaus. The
tariff technical assistance will assist in developing the bulk transfer price for electricity (see
paragraph 22.of Section D), and the legal technical assistance will develop the required
contractual agreements.
Restructuring of Internal Organization and Management Control Systems and
Implementation of a Modern Accounting and Financial Management
Information System
19.   To successfully implement a commercially oriented organizational structure and
management systems consistent with the objective of improving operational efficiency, the
following actions will be undertaken:
(a)   a diagnostic study of the internal organization, operating and administrative
procedures. The assessment will determine how existing business units
functionally relate to each other and their respective scope of responsibility.
Overlapping lines of responsibility, excessive centralization of decision-
making and departments with excessively wide functional scope will be
identified.   An organizational structure that will improve internal
management will be identified. The functional boundaries of the different
departments, work units and subsidiaries. This could include the merging,
separation or elimination of certain functions. Correspondingly, this could
involve the strengthening or expansion of certain functions, for e.g. financial
operations at the headquarters and work unit level, establishing a division for
the competitive procurement of supply, etc.
(b)   assess accounting procedures, documentation, reporting formats and the
nature of financial transactions between the various departments, power
generation and supply entities, and service subsidiaries. The accounting
units and activities, reporting requirements, formats for information flow
and frequency of such information exchange will be redefined. A basic
design for the new financial and accounting information system will be
developed. The new financial and accounting management information
system be totally consistent with the proposed reorganization of business
processes and procedures.
(c)   The international consultants to perform and assist in the above diagnostic
and implementation activities will be financed from technical assistance
component in the project. The terms of reference for the task will be
prepared by June 1995, with the draft diagnostic report and implementation
plan to be completed by June 1996. All organizational reforms and the
implementation of the accounting and financial management information
systems, will be completed within two years of the submission of the
diagnostic report. The implementation of organizational reforms and the



-75 -                       ANNEX3.3
accounting and financial management systems will be covenanted in the
project agreement.
D. Tariff Reform
20.   EPH's tariff reform plan is supported by the Chinese government agencies at the
Central and Provincial levels. The reform is founded on the following principles:
(a)   the tariff structure will be gradually adjusted to reflect the economic cost of
supply for different consumer classes in order to promote the efficient use of
electricity; and
(b)   the tariff levels will be gradually increased to reach economic levels by year
2000, to ensure that EPH can meet its financial obligations and provide
reasonable contribution for the future investment requirements of Henan's
power sector.
21.   It is recognized that tariff reform in Henan province will need to be consistent with
tariff reform guidelines of the relevant provincial and central government authorities, and
will be subject to their approval. However, any deviation from economic cost of supply
which require government subsidies should be fully transparent-implying that the total
amount of subsidies and the consumer groups benefiting from the subsidies are clearly
indicated
22.   Tariff System Implementation Study: EPH will prepare with the assistance of
foreign consultants an tariff implementation plan that ensures smooth transition from the
existing dual-track pricing system to a tariff system based on long-run marginal cost pricing
principles. This study will be initiated in August 1995 and the preliminary tariff system
presented to the World Bank for comments by March 15, 1996. The revised tariff system
which takes into account the comments and suggestions of the World Bank will be
proposed for Central and Provincial authorities for approval and finalized before June 30,
1996.
23.   The implementation plan for tariff reform should achieve-the average tariff level
increases agreed with EPH during project appraisal, approved by the relevant provincial
authorities before project negotiations and covenanted in the project agreement.
24.   The tariff system to be developed though the tariff study (paragraph 21), will
achieve the following tariff reform objectives:
(a)    Rationalization of Capacity Charge: Gradual increase of the capacity
charge, particularly for industrial and large commercial consumers, to more
accurately reflect the cost of electricity supply.  Future average price



- 76 -                      ANNEX 3.3
increases for these customers should be achieved through the increase of
capacity charge rather than the energy price.
(b)   Introduction and Extension of time-of-day (TOD) tariffs: Appropriate
TOD tariffs should be developed and offered to (not imposed) all consumers
who have the potential to benefit from load management. The objective is
to extend TOD tariffs to the whole province by year-200 according to the
following schedule:
-  1996  introduction for 400 large industrial consumers in 9
prefectures.
-  1997  extension to large industrial consumers in 4 additional
prefectures.
-  1998  1,000 more consumers, including commercial consumers.
- 2000  TOD tariff choice available to all consumers in the province.
(c)    Unification of Dual-track Tariffs: Through a suitable transitional strategy
the dual-track pricing system will be eliminated by more rapid increases of
"in-plan" electricity prices. The unification of tariffs should be completed as
early as possible, although no later than year- 1998.
(d)   Commercial Bulk Tariffs for Power Supply Bureaus: By-end 1997 all
power supply bureaus who are affiliated to EPH and those that are
independent should operate on the basis of a transparent bulk electricity
tariff (also called the internal settlement price for EPH power supply
bureaus). The intention is facilitate true profit-center and commercial
operation at the distribution level.
E. Sector Restructuring
25.   The objective of sector restructuring in Henan is to establish clear commercial
relationship between the core power sector operations of EPH and increase the efficiency of
generation and distribution operations. Sector restructuring will also introduce competition
in the procurement of new generation. The reformns to be implemented include:
(a)    Design and implementation of a competitive solicitation program  to
obtain power supply: The design of the competitive solicitation program
with all documentation will be completed by December 1995. Subject to
State Council approval this program will be implemented to procure at least
one generation project by the end-of 1998.
(b)   EPH will restructure the generation company (with seven state-owned
power plants), and the power development company as profit-centers by
March 1997.  These entities will be incorporated as limited liability
companies in accordance with the Company Law following establishment as



- 77 -                      ANNEX 3.3
profit centers in March 1997, or availability of State Council guidelines
whichever is later.
(c)   Development of Model Commercial Contracts: EPH will develop model
contracts to define its commercial relationships with power sector
companies. The contracts include:
*     Power sales agreements between EPH transmission and generation
operations and EPH supply bureaus and independent supply bureaus.
*     Power  purchase  agreements  between  separate/independent
generators and EPH.
*     Operational and commercial agreement between Central China
Power Group Corporation/Administration and EPH.
These contracts will be developed by December 1996. These contracts will be made
effective by June 1997.

ANNEX 3.4: ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
I. Background and Objectives
1.    Electric Power of Henan (EPH) is undertaking major changes to meet the
operational challenges of power sector reforms initiated by the Chinese Government.
One of the major objectives of these reforms is to establish a modem enterprise system
characterized by clear definition of property rights, autonomous management,
commercial orientation, financial independence, and separation of government ownership
and regulatory functions from enterprise management. The reforms are mainly based on:
(i) new accounting regulations, promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in July 1994, that
are generally consistent with International Accounting Standards, and, (ii) the improved
enterprise policy and governance framework defined by the Company Law enacted in
July 1994.
2.    To achieve these objectives, the Chinese Government and the World Bank jointly
developed an implementation program of sector reforms that stresses full corporatization
and greater autonomy and accountability of power enterprises.' The reform strategy is
intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market orientation of the
power sector.
3.    Like most state-owned enterprises, EPH is faced with the following problems:
(i) government interference in management, administrative and operational decisions
reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy; (ii) lack of full
accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly centralized decision
making and non availability of timely and accurate financial information at different
operational activity levels; (iii) lack of transparency of the financial situation: financial
statements that are now prepared based on the new accounting regulations, still do not
provide full disclosure of EPH's financial position and, (iv) lack of focus on the core
business operations and involvement in many side activities that include profitable
activities such as construction companies, design/engineering institutes, as well as
welfare responsibilities such as housing, schools, hospitals etc.
China Power Sector Reform: Toward Competition and Improved Performance, Report No. 12929-CHA,
Document of the World Bank, September 15, 1994.



-84 -                       ANNEX 3.4
4.    This technical assistance activity is financed through the Henan (Qinbei) thermal
power project and is designed to address the above mentioned organizational and
financial issues and problems. It stresses the strengthening of internal organizational and
management practices, and the introduction of appropriate accounting, budgeting and
financial management systems. To achieve the full benefits of organizational reform and
improved financial reporting and monitoring systems, it is proposed to carry out the
project in three distinct but fully integrated phases:
(a)   a comprehensive diagnostic review of the current organizational structure,
management practices, and financial/accounting practices and reporting
systems, with particular attention to division of responsibilities, flow of
information and quality of reporting, and budgeting and accounting
systems and procedures.
(b)   development of an improved organizational structure, design of the
required accounting and financial and budgeting systems to meet the need
of efficient management and decentralized decision making, and
preparation of a detailed plan for implementation.
(c)   implementation of the organizational structure and systems approved by
EPH including computer, software and training needs.
5.    This work to be undertaken is closely related to the implementation of various
institutional reforms in EPH/Henan's power system. It will be extremely important to
coordinate the tasks under this activity with the overall reform effort in EPH.
Coordination with legal advisors hired by EPH for reform implementation will be crucial.
The Reform Implementation Plan and the Termns of Reference for Legal Consulting
Services are attached (Attachment 1 and 2, respectively).
II. Scope of Work
6.    The project will include, but not necessarily limited to, the following tasks:
Phase 1: Diagnostic Review and Analysis
7.    During the first phase, the consultants are required to carry out a detailed
assessment of the current organizational structure and financial management practices in
EPH. The preliminary work done by EPH consultants in November 1994, may be used
as a background document. The scope of this review will include:
(a)   A review and assessment of EPH's internal organization and operating and
administrative procedures with particular attention to the responsibilities
of the existing business units or subunits (such as, generation plants,
prefecture supply bureaus, county/city supply bureaus, construction



-85 -                      ANNEX 3.4
companies, etc.) and their functional relations, overlap in lines of
responsibility, excessive centralization of decision-making, and
organizational deficiencies.
(b)   Review and analysis of accounting procedures, documentation, reporting
formats and the nature of financial transactions between the various
departments, power generation and supply entities, and service
subsidiaries.
(c)   Critical assessment of Cost Accounting, Financial Planning, Budgeting,
and Internal Audit systems and procedures. Special attention will be given
to the existing organization of accounting units and reporting
requirements.
(d)   Evaluation  of performance  monitoring  systems: establishment of
performance targets and indicators, methods for communicating,
controlling and monitoring them.
Phase 2: Master plan for Internal Reorganization and Financial Management Systems
8.    During the second phase, the consultants will, jointly with EPH, develop an
organizational structure and related management, accounting, financial, control and
reporting systems that address the deficiencies and weaknesses identified during the first
phase, satisfy EPH's long-term corporate objectives and increase its cost consciousness
and business orientation. The work of this phase is organized in three subactivities:
Organizational and Management Structure
9.    Redefinition of the functional boundaries and responsibilities of the different
departments, work units and subsidiaries. Special attention should be given EPH's main
functions (e.g. generation, transmission, distribution and customer management) and
financial operations at the headquarters and operational unit levels. The recommended
organization should also prepare EPH to its role of major player in a more competitive
power sector by assessing the need for an autonomous unit responsible for planning and
competitive procurement of supply.
10.   Definition of interorganizational relationships, communication and reporting
channels between the different units.
11.   Assistance in the preparation of an Operational Manual that describes the
organizational structure, functional boundaries, job descriptions, communication and
reporting channels, limits of authority, etc.  Special attention should be given to
accounting and financial units.



- 86-                      ANNEX 3.4
12.   Recommendation of optimal staffing and preparation of job description and
qualification requirements for all posts of reasonable importance in the recommended
organizational structure.
Accounting Systems and Practices
13.   Redefinition of accounting units and activities clearly identifying cost and profit
centers, reporting requirements, formats for information flow and frequency of
information exchange. This task will develop a basic design for the new financial and
accounting information system. It is of crucial importance that this basic design of the
financial and accounting management information system be totally consistent with the
proposed reorganization of business processes and procedures.
14.   Development of a Standard Financial Accounting System and general accounts
classification detailing balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. This
should include policies and system procedures, recommended principles for accounting
classification, and follow-up methods. The system should develop and provide for the
timely collection of accounts receivable and settlement of accounts payable. It should
also contain standards for depreciation for fixed asset accounting.
15.   Assistance in the preparation of an Accounting Manual setting forth a coded chart
of accounts, detailing and describing balance sheet accounts, income accounts, functional
and department accounts, cost/profit centers, objective accounts, policies, standard
procedure instructions, report formats (including an inventory of reports describing their
purpose and method of preparation, assigning responsibilities for preparation, timetable,
frequency and distribution lists), use of capital and expense budget programs (including
guidelines distinguishing capital items and items charges directly to expense).
16.   Improvement of the Internal Control and Audit System through approval and audit
procedures, internal review systems-especially for purchasing, inventory and stores,
handling of cash, and payroll.
Budgeting and Performance-Based Management Information Systems
17.   Redefinition of the process of setting performance targets, and the systems for
controlling and monitoring them in practice. This would include policies and procedures,
related analytical techniques, and mechanical tools to ensure project planning,
formulation, justification, management and control of budgets, including analysis of
budget variances.
18.   Procedures to integrate MIS with the cost accounting system so that it can
generate information for assigning responsibility, measure labor and input productivity
against standards, analyze and control cost variances (i.e. input and labor price and
quantity, efficiency, overheads, and capacity variances) from standards. This should



-87 -                     ANNEX3.4
facilitate the determination of the level of profitability of EPH so that pricing decisions
can be taken with the full knowledge of costs.
19.   Development of a Financial Planning system, including the introduction of
operational objectives and planned allocation of resources in the form of Operating
Expense Budgets and Capital Expenditure Budgets, and the frequency for issuance. The
budgeting system should be coordinated with the financial accounts in order to reconcile
budget variances with financial figures;
20.   Improvement of the planning and control of operational support functions or
central service functions, such as, maintenance and work planning/preparation, materials
management, procurement, quality control, transportation, personnel management, etc..
21.   The consultant will prepare a detailed scope of tasks and a clearly defined
implementation strategy for a smooth transition from the current organizational structure
to the recommended one and progressive replacement of existing systems by the newly
designed ones. The implementation strategy will be divided into actions and targets with
a timetable and should identify the priorities of and sequence in organizational change
and systems development.
Phase 3: Implementation
22.   During this phase, the consultant will assist EPH  in implementing the
recommended changes in organizational structure, business practices, financial
management and reporting systems. The work will include:
(a)   assistance in implementing the new  organizational structure and
organizing work sessions/seminars to help managers and financial/
accounting staff fully understand the proposed changes;
(b)   assistance in selecting and installing suitable hardware and software,
especially  a  new   general  ledger  package  and  appropriate
centralized/distributed computer systems to be linked to desk-top
terminals.
(c)   identification of staffing and skills required to implement the new
financial/accounting systems and appropriate in-house, external training
programs, and assistance in preparation of training manuals.
III. Approach, Reporting, Outputs and Time Schedule
23.   The international consultants will submit a proposal to cover all three phases of
the work. However, the proposal should delineate clearly the costs for each phase of the
work. The proposal will detail: (i) the proposed work plan, approach and organization of
the consultant's project team; (ii) the tasks to be undertaken by each member of the team,



- 88 -                        ANNEX 3.4
and (iii) time allocated to each member in the field and head office to carry out his/her
assignment. Apart from providing a full complement of skills to undertake this task, the
consultants will be required to demonstrate work experience on similar assignments and
good knowledge of the power utility industry.
24.   The task will be supervised and coordinated by a Steering Committee of senior
management and department directors to ensure that decisions are made promptly,
especially at the end of the first and second phases. The Committee will designate a high
level project manager and a multidisciplinary working group to work with the consultants
and to ensure timely availability of data and full cooperation of staff at various levels of
the company. The international consultant will report problems and difficulties in
carrying his assignment to the project manager and Steering Committee, and make
recommendations to address them and ensure smooth and timely progress of the
assignment. The foreign consultants and the working group will work as a joint team to
carry out the project, however, the foreign consultant will remain responsible for the
quality of the work and for the recommendations presented to the Steering Committee at
the end of each phase of the process.
Reporting
25.   The Consultant will prepare interim  reports for each phase of work to be
submitted to the Steering Committee for review and decision. The report should in
addition to the Consultant's conclusions and recommendations, clearly identify:
(i) outstanding issues and/or problems encountered; and, (ii) decisions that need to made
by the Steering Committee and/or EPH management. All reporting will be in English.
The Consultant will provide ten (10) copies of all interim and final reports.

ANNEX 3.5: LEGAL CONSULTING SERVICES
TERMS OF REFERENCE
I. Background and Objectives
I.    The Electric Power of Henan (EPH), a government-owned power company, is
seeking a loan from the World Bank to finance the Qinbei Thermal Power Plant. It is
proposed to include in the proposed loan, funds for financing the cost of legal technical
training and consulting services to support enterprise and regulatory Teform.
2.    EPH  has adopted a "Reform  Implementation Plan" which includes: the
corporatization of EPH and its subsidiary power related activities; the separation of
government bureau functions (i.e. regulatory functions) from enterprise ownership and
management; and, the restructuring of the provincial power sector with clear cost
separation of core generation and distribution to increase efficiency and pave the way for
eventual separation through divestment. EPH has already used an international legal
advisor in the preparation of the Reform Implementation Plan.
3.    To implement these reforms EPH will require legal technical assistance to: create
corporate legal instruments; establish internal rules and regulations; and, develop and
execute a variety of commercial contracts. In addition, the expected creation of a new
legal and regulatory framework for the power sector in China and increased commercial
orientation of EPH will require EPH to development internal legal expertise sufficient to
support its commercial and financial activities within this new framework.
4.    This Terms of Reference for legal consulting services is designed to provide EPH
with the required legal assistance on a timely basis. The timing for certain aspects in the
scope of work are contingent upon specific government actions, consequently, the legal
consulting services will be provided when required by EPH to meet the schedules
established in the Reform Implementation Plan.
5.    A parallel technical assistance activity will focus on organizational restructuring
and financial management procedures. Outputs of this work, particularly the definition of
internal functional boundaries and business units, will be an important input to some of
the legal technical assistance. The Legal Consultant will be kept informed on the
progress of this work. It will be important for the Legal Consultant to ensure that the
legal advise is consistent with the organizational restructuring being undertaken by EPH.



-90 -                       ANNEX 3.5
II. Scope of Work
6.    The legal Consultant will undertake to deliver the specific legal tasks identified
below, as well as legal training and briefings as required in order to keep the client (i.e.
EPH) fully informed of the implications of the recommended actions. This legal training
can be conducted through informal lectures and seminars and will assist in the
development of in-house EPH legal capability.
7.    Incorporation of EPH as a Limited Liability Company.  Preparation of
Articles of Association and all statutory documentation required to incorporate EPH as a
Limited Liability Company as per Company Law in China. A draft Articles of
Association prepared by EPH will form the initial basis of this work. The process of
incorporation will be formally initiated when the State Council issues the regulations on
the restructuring of state-owned enterprises as Companies. The Legal Consultant will
assist EPH in all procedural matters required by the Company Registry and other
statutory agencies in China. A key task for the Legal Consultant will be to ensure that the
capital restructuring issues in the Articles of Association which relate to the clarification
of ownership are consistent with the implementing regulations to be issued by the State
Council. In addition, advise will be provided in responding to questions raised and
clarifications requested by statutory agencies involved in the process of incorporation.
8.    The assistance provided for incorporation as a limited liability company will in
also focus on the development of suitable procedures and guidelines to facilitate
operation under the new structure. This will include: corporate charters; by-laws and
internal administrative procedures/regulations consistent with the new corporate form.
The internal procedures should focus on the development of clear profit and cost centers
that will ease subsequent stages of restructuring envisaged i.e. separation of generation
company and creation of distribution profit-centers.
9.    Consolidation of Government Functions within EPH  and subsequent
Separation. As a first step towards the separation of government (i.e. power bureau)
functions from EPH, it is proposed that a single department be responsible for all these
activities. This plan will be developed by EPH with assistance provided through
organizational restructuring study. The Legal Consultant will assist EPH in developing
the necessary internal guidelines to facilitate this organizational change. Coordination
with the Consultant responsible for the organizational restructuring study will be
required.
10.   Once the Government clearly defines the procedures for implementing new power
sector regulation arrangements, the Legal Consultant will assist EPH in transferring the
bureau functions to the entities specified in the government implementation regulations.
11.   Commercialization of Noncore Activities of EPH. EPH has undertaken to
delineate their noncore activities into three categories:



-91-                       ANNEX 3.5
Category A: Activities that are currently accounted for separately and
which have the potential to be separated as independent companies.
Category B: Commercial activities that are can be operated as profit-
centers
Category C: Welfare activities that can be established as cost-centers.
EPH will separate Category A activities into wholly-owned limited liability companies as
a first step. The Legal Consultant will advise on all relevant legal and procedural aspects
of this task. In addition, advise will be provided on the internal procedures and
guidelines to facilitate the operation of Category B activities as profit-centers and
Category C activities as cost-centers.
12.   Design of Competitive Bidding Program for Acquiring New Generation. The
legal consultant will assist EPH in designing comprehensive documentation and
procedures to acquire new generation resources. This task will include: Request for
Proposals (RFP) documentation; model power purchase contracts; implementation
agreements; etc. These documents will be designed based on the power system
parameters of EPH. This task will be completed by June 1996.
13.   Development of Model Commercial Contracts. Three types of commercial
contractual arrangements will need to be developed to assist EPH in dealing with
independent companies engaged in generation and distribution, as well as formalizing its
relationship with the Central China Power Group Corporation. These commercial
contracts are:
(a)   power sales and operating agreements between EPH and its affiliated and
nonaffiliated power supply bureaus (i.e. distribution entities);
(b)   power purchase and operating agreements between EPH and separate
generation entities; and
(c)   commercial and operating agreement between EPH and the Central China
Power Group Corporation.
14.   The commercial arrangements (a) and (b) should be based on the principle of
treating entities affiliated to EPH and those which are independent on an equal,
nondiscriminatory basis. The intention is that these commercial arrangements form the
basis of any restructuring undertaken in the power sector in Henan.
15.   As such commercial contractual arrangements are relatively new in China, the
Legal Consultant must provide all the required training to EPH staff on how to negotiate
and execute these contracts. This task will be completed by December 1996. The Legal



- 92 -                    ANNEX 3.5
Consultant will assist in implementing and making these contracts effective by June
1997.
16.  Incorporation of Generation Company and Power Development Company.
The seven state-owned plants within EPH will be consolidated and incorporated as a
limited liability company wholly-owned by EPH. The Legal Consultant will assist in the
incorporation process, as well as provide advise on the actual implementation of the
commercial contract between generation entities and EPH (see task 5 above). A similar
incorporation process will be adopted for the Power Development Company.
17.   Development of Electricity Conservation Performance Contracts. EPH plans
to establish and independent profit-center to pursue electricity conservation activities and
programs. Some of these activities will be conducted on the basis of "performance
contracts" between the conservation profit-center and the client. In addition, some
activities would require commercial contracts to specify financing terms and associated
services. The Legal Consultant will provide the advise required by EPH on the
development of these contracts. This tentative schedule for this task is June 1996.
III. Organization of Work and Consultant Qualifications
18.   The Legal Consultant will be a reputed international law firm. The Consultant
will be selected by EPH (i.e. the Client) with the assistance of the World Bank. The
following criteria will guide the selection of the Legal Consultant:
(a)   Demonstrated experience in providing corporate, commercial, financial
and regulatory legal services to electric utilities, including representation
of utilities in their acquisition of power from independent power
producers;
(b)   Direct experience in advising Chinese and foreign clients on the
application of the Chinese Company Law. Experience in assisting entities
to incorporate as limited liability companies in China would be a distinct
advantage; and
(c)   A law firm which has a strong Asian presence, and a legal staff with
Chinese language ability will be favorably considered.  Previous
experience in advising power sector entities in China would be an
advantage.
The Legal Consultant will need to clearly specify the legal staff who will be made
available for each of the above tasks. The Client reserves the right to reject any legal
staff who substitute the individuals specified at the time of selection. The Legal
Consultant will be selected by end-July 1995.

ANNEX 3.6: TARIFF STRUCTURE
CONSULTING SERVICES
TERMS OF REFERENCE
I. Background and Objectives
1.    The principal objective of this study is to assist Electric Power of Henan (EPH) in
developing a tariff structure and feasible transition plan that will reflect the following
principles:
(a)   full adoption of a unified electricity tariff in Henan based on financially
sufficient long-run marginal cost principles;
(b)   a rational capacity charge for industrial and large consumers;
(c)   a time-of-day tariff system that is feasible; and
(d)   a nondiscriminatory bulk sale power tariff for power sold to power supply
bureaus.
2.    Electric Power of Henan (EPH) has with the assistance of Beijing Economic
Research Institute (BERI) prepared a tariff study which will forn the basis for this
technical assistance. This tariff study (Attachment I) represents an excellent analytic
exercise towards achieving the above objectives. The Consultant will work with EPH
and related agencies in assessing the assumptions, computations and recommendations in
the tariff study. Additionally, the Consultant will provide the necessary training to ensure
that EPH develops adequate in-house capacity to undertake future tariff reviews and
revisions.
II. Scope of Work
3 .    The Consultant will perform the specific tasks identified below:
(a)   Review the computations performed to arrive at the Long-Run Marginal
Cost (LRMC) tariff in the tariff study conducted by EPH. The Consultant
will:



- 94 -                      ANNEX 3.6
(i)   examine the appropriateness of the economic assumptions made;
(ii)   review the load forecasts and surveys conducted;
(iii)   review system expansion plan and operating policies; and
(iv)    review the basis for selecting time-of-day tariff intervals selected.
(b)   Examine the rate structure developed in the tariff study and suggest
suitable modifications if necessary.  The Consultant will compare the
proposed tariff structure with different alternatives, and clearly explain the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.  In making these
comparisons it will be important to stress the practical aspects of tariff
administration in addition to the economic efficiency of a given tariff
structure.
(c)    Assist EPH  in designing and selecting a suitable rate structure and
defining a workable tariff reform implementation plan. The purpose of the
tariff reform implementation plan is to achieve a suitable transition to
LRMC pricing. As EPH intends to make a gradual transition to a
corporate entity operating on commercial principles, the Consultant will:
(i)   analyze the financial cost and revenues associated with the rate
structure to ensure that the commercial financial targets can be
achieved by EPH; and
(ii)   ensure consistency with the new direct and in-direct taxation policy
in China, as well as the financial accounting standards established.
(d)   Develop a suitable nondiscriminatory bulk electricity transfer price (also
called the internal settlement price for EPH-affiliated power supply
bureaus).  It is important that the method of establishing the bulk
electricity transfer price ensures equal treatment of a the 13 EPH-affiliated
and 4 independent power supply bureaus.
III. Organization of Work
4.    This technical assistance activity will be managed by EPH with the assistance of
the World Bank. The Consultant selected must demonstrate prior expertise in developing
electricity utility rate structures. Experience in advising electric utilities and regulatory
agencies in developing countries will considered favorably.
5.    It is envisaged that two experienced professional will form the core Consultant
Team. About 10 weeks of work will be required by each professional, of which 7 will be
in the field. Two trips each to China are planned.

ANNEX 3.9: POWER PRICING IN HENAN PROVINCE
1.    Power Pricing in Henan Province, as other part in China, underwent major evolution
during the past years. As the economy moved to freer markets, a multitier pricing system
has been introduced in 1985 based on:
(a)    "in-plan quotas", electricity provided by power plants owned by the state,
priced at a state base price fixed by SPC and MOEP;
(b)    out of plan quotas", electricity provided by most plants built after 1985 and
financed mostly by provincial and local governments, parapublic
independent producers (Huaneng and Sunburst Power Company,
essentially) and eventually joint-ventures, priced at a collected fund price
approved on a yearly basis by the provincial government;'
In Henan, in 1994, about 57 percent of the total electricity sales were priced at the "State-
base price", 43 percent of the sales were priced at the "collected fund price".
State Base Price
2.     The state base prices, also referred as the catalog prices, used to be artificially low at
about 6.54 fen/kWh until 1985, were gradually increased to reflect coal and transport price
increases. In 1993, they were fully revised throughout China and substantially increased.
Demand charges have been increased by about 50 percent and energy prices by about 40
percent. The new system will thereafter be adjusted annually by SPC and MOEP to reflect
charges in supply costs, specially fuel prices.
3.     State prices in Henan increased from an average of 10.6 fen/kWh in 1992 to an
average of about 14.4 fen/kWh in 1993 and about 18.92 fen/kWh, in 1994. State base
prices for Henan in 1994 are provided in Table 1.
The Collected Fund Price
4.     The "collected fund price", also referred to as guided prices, is based on the "new
plant-new price" policy introduced by the Government in 1986. Under this policy, power
Unlike in other provinces such as Zhejiang: Henan doesn't have "above quota" or "processed" electricity, purchased
from other provinces or captive plants and/or by all power plants after meeting their planed generation targets. The
"above quota" electricity price in Henan province, are about 40 percent higher than the "catalog price".



- 99-                         ANNEX 3.9
from "new plants" is sold to provincial company at "debt-repayment prices". Calculated
and paid on a plant-by-plant basis, the debt-repayment prices are designed to provide
sufficient revenue for the "repayment of loan capital with interest", generally within ten
years. The collected fund price in Henan was 25.2 fen/kWh in 1994.

Fees and Surcharges
5.     Additional fees and surcharges are added to the prices paid by the consumers. With
the exception of the 0.4 fen/kWh levy on all consumers throughout the country to help
finance the Three Gorges Hydroelectric Project, these charges are levied by provincial and
local governments. In Henan, industrial and commercial electricity sales are subject to both
a 2.0 fen/kWh surcharge for a Provincial Power Construction Fund (as in other provinces)
and a surcharge rate of 8 to 10 percent over total consumption for Local Construction Funds
operated by prefectural governments. Some additional fees are earmarked in some areas to
partially cover part of local distribution and transmission costs or street lighting. The bulk
of the revenue collected through these additional fees are managed by the "three electricity
bureau" (supply, security, conservation), controlled by local governments at different levels.
Consumer Tariffs
6.     Consumer tariffs in Zhengzhou city and Zhumadian Prefecture are shown in Table 2
and 3. The consolidated add-ons include: 0.02 development fund; 0.004 Three Gorges
Fund; local development fund 8 percent- 10 percent of total energy cost.

7.    In Zhengzhou city, residential customers are charged at a low tariff, slightly higher
than the catalog price, of about 30 fen/kWh 300 plus industrial customers still enjoy in-plan
quotas of about 3000 GWh, about 60 percent of the total electricity consumption in 1993
estimated at 5,400 GWh; they are charged at tariffs of 18.8 to 19.8 fen/kWh for in-plan
compared with 30.5 fen/kWh paid by similar consumers without quotas, except agriculture
and fertilizer customers who enjoy a tariff at a subsidized level: 14 fen/kWh and 18.4
fen/kWh respectively. The fertilizer factories consumed about 6 GWh in 1993, 1.1 percent
of the total consumption.
8.    Final consumers prices based on bills issued in June 1994 for typical consumers in
Zhengzhou city are as below:

All these prices are much lower than the long-run average incremental cost of supply of the
provincial system estimated at about 39 fen/kWh at the 35 kV level and LRMC of 43 at
10 kV level.(Beijing Economic Research Institute of Water Resources and Electric Power:
The Economic Analysis Report for Qinbei, November, 1994 and Henan Power Grid Tariff
Study, October, 1994).
Consumer Price Reform
9.    Henan provincial government has attached great importance to tariff reform. The
government has promised to raise the average tariff to a level equivalent to US$0.6 by the
year 2000. EPH has gradually raised the final consumer prices to reflect the real cost of the
resources. The consolidated tariff has been increased from 6.54 fen/kWh in 1985 to 21.6
fen/kWh in 1994. EPH has also introduced incentives to improve efficiency specially by
introducing time-of-the-day tariffs and reducing economically unjustified discrimination
among customers. In Luoyang and Zhengzhou prefectures a time-of-the-day tariff was
introduced on an experimental basis. The difference between peak tariff and off-peak tariff
is 5:1. Starting from 1996, EPH will prepare a time-of-the-day tariff to large consumers
with a four year schedule expanding from 400 large industrial consumers in 9 prefectures to
the full availability of TOD tariff choice to all consumers in the province. EPH will also
introduce a new tariff for commercial consumers.
10.   EPH is committed to increase the pace of the tariff reforn in the province based on
its past successes and leading experiences in other areas in China. EPH will gradually
increase capacity charge to large consumers starting from 1996. It is specially committed to
the abolition of the two track system and unification of bulk sale tariffs and final consumer
tariffs and avoid discrimination among customers based on "in-plan" and "out-of-plan"
quotas. EPH will adopt a unified sales tariff by the end of 1998. EPH will prepare with the
assistance of foreign consultants an tariff implementation plan that ensures smooth
transition from the existing dual-track pricing system to a tariff system based on long-run
marginal cost pricing principles. This study will be initiated in August 1995 and the
preliminary tariff system presented to the World Bank for comments by March 15, 1996.
The revised tariff system which takes into account the comments and suggestions of the
World Bank will be proposed for Central and Provincial authorities for approval and
finalized before June 30, 1996.



-102-                       ANNEX3.9
11.   By the year 2000, EPH will have finally rationalized the tariff structure, giving
consumers a choice of a flat tariff or time-of-the-day tariff, and raised the tariff level not
much lower than the LRMC level of 42.5 fen.

ANNEX 4.1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General
1.    The proposed Henan (Qinbei) thermal power plant is located at Wulongkou town,
17 km northeast of Jiyuan City and about 140 km northwest of Zhengzhou City, Henan
Province. The north of the plant site faces Taihangshan Mountains and the south is close
to the Qinbei Railway Station where Jiaozuo-Zhicheng railway passes through. The
topography of the plant site is flat and open. Most of the land is too poor to be farmed
without resettlement, the relief is higher with a slope of 3-4 percent and the plant will be
leveled above the 100-year flood line. The seismic intensity scale is 6 degree. In its first
phase, the plant will have an installed capacity of 1,200 MW (2 x 600 MW units) of
ultimate capacity of 3,600 MW (6 x 600 MW). The scheduled dates of commercial
operation of the two units are as follows:
Unit 1    -    March 2001
Unit 2    -    December 2001
Coal
2.    Basic design parameters for the boilers and turbine generators will follow the
standard specifications of 600 MW coal-fired subcritical units of proven technology. The
power plant will consume up to 3.5 million tons of mixed coal a year. Coal produced at
Linfen, Houzhou and Changzhi coal mines in the southern region of Shanxi Province will
be transported to the coal yard of the power plant directly by train. The coal transporting
distance is 150-270 km from these coal mines to the power plant. The units will be
designed to bum design coal (mixture of lean coal/bituminous coal/washed middlings of
2:1:1 ratio; 21297 kJ/kg LHV; Ash 24.95 percent; Sulfur 0.41 percent; volatile matter 15.40
percent) and check coal (mixture of lean coal/bituminous coal/washed middlings of 2:0:1
ratio; 22083 kJ/kg; Ash 25.27 percent; sulfur 0.56 percent; volatile matter 12.95 percent).
The supply and transportation of the fuel coal have been approved by the related authorities.
Cooling Water System
3.    The north of the plant site is facing Taihangshan Mountains and sufficient quantity
of ground water is available to meet the water demand of the plant for the makeup and
cooling requirements for the plant. For the circulating water system, the closed circulating
system will be adopted. The makeup water required by the plant will be supplied from the
underground water of the Qin River alluvial plain. Each unit will be equipped with one
cooling tower and three circulating water pumps.



-104 -                     ANNEX 4.1
Transmission Lines and Associated Substations
4.    Two 500 kV transmission lines, 165 km each, will be constructed to connect the
Qinbei power plant and Xiao-Liu substation, which is one of the existing substations in the
Henan Power Grid. In Xiao-Liu substation, one 750 MVA step-down transformer will be
installed. The existing 500 kV transmission line between Xiaoliu-Yaomeng-Shuanghe
connect the Xiao-Liu substation and Nanyang substation. In the Nanyang substation, one
750 MVA step-down transformer will be installed.
Turbine and Generator
5.    Turbines will have the nominal rated output of 600 MW with steam pressure of 16.7
MPa at high-pressure turbine inlet and superheat and reheat temperature of 538 degree C.
each unit will be equipped with one high-pressure turbine bypass system and one low-
pressure turbine bypass system.
6.    Turbine generator units will have a nominal capacity of 600 MW each. The voltage
of the generators is 22 KV and the cooling mode is of water-hydrogen-hydrogen type.
Steam Generator
7.    The stream generators will be of the subcritical, single reheat, dry bottom ash,
balanced draft, semioutdoor, drum type, each rated to MCR of 2020 T/h, steam pressure of
18.18 MPa and steam temperature of 541 degree C at superheater and reheater outlets. For
pulverized coal system, the double inlet and double outlet ball mill, directly firing system or
directly firing medium speed mill system will be adopted. Each unit will be equipped with
two forced draft fans, two primary air fans and two induced draft fans. The four-field
electrostatic precipitator with 99.6 percent efficiency will be adopted. Two boilers will
share one common chimney with a height of 240 m. For air pollution mitigation, the units
will be designed to provide low NO, burners and other low NO, technology and provide
space for future provision of the flue gas desulfurization plant.
Ash Handling System
8.    The power plant (2x600 MW) will produce 19.97 T/H slag and 113.167 T/H ash,
and about 0.87 million tons of ash and slag each year. The slag from the bottom of boilers
will be conveyed hydraulically to the dewatering bin. The dewatered slag will be delivered
to the ash yard by trucks. The fine ash from the electrostatic precipitators and the bottom of
economizers of the two units will be conveyed pneumatically to dry ash silo where the dry
ash will be added with water to the moisture of about 25 percent so as to avoid the ash
flying and easy to be rolled and piled in the ash yard. The ash yard is situated on the flood
land of Qin River, 4.5 km away from the plant site. The ash yard will be provided to meet
the ash and slag disposal from 6x600 MW units, for 17 years operation.

Instrumentation and Control System
9.    A microprocessor-based distributed control system  including data acquisition
system (DAS), supervisory control system (SCS), control coordination system (CCS),
furnace fire fighting system (FSSS), etc. will be provided. Display of plant-specific
equipment status and operating parameters on CRTs installed in the central control room
will provide real-time interface between operators and plant systems. On-line performance
monitoring system will be provided to increase plant performance, reduce coal consumption
and gradually introduce innovative advanced maintenance techniques.

ANNEX 4.2: ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION
PROJECT COMPONENT
A. Electricity Conservation Programs in Henan Province
I.    Electricity conservation programs in Henan are part of an integrated planning
process conducted at the provincial, prefectural and county levels based on new
national/provincial electricity conservation policies and administrative programs. They
are implemented through the "three electricity office" of Henan province.  Three
electricity offices are government entities charged with the implementation and
monitoring of conservation programs. This includes participation in and supervision of
conservation programs, providing advice to enterprises, disseminating good practice and
monitoring targets. Three electricity offices are found at all levels of government within
a province, with the provincial power entity being the effective umbrella organization.
They are called three electricity offices because their responsibilities include planning and
safety, in addition to energy conservation.
2.    Cumulative electrical energy savings in Henan province for the period from 1980
to 1989 were approximately 6,800 GWh/year, of which 5,000 GWh resulted from
structural changes in industry and 1,800 GWh/year were technical savings. These
savings have been achieved through the implementation of energy efficiency codes and
standards with other agencies. The standards are implemented through a variety of
programs, the most notable of which are:
(a)   Renovation of Enterprise Technologies: This program has been carried
out since 1981. It consists of renovation or replacement of electricity-
inefficient technologies and equipment with measures such as high-
frequency electric furnaces, variable-speed motors, etc.. More than 40,000
equipment units have been renovated and more than 115,000 new units
installed. Total savings of the measures are 1,260 GWh/year.
(b)   Renovation of Enterprise Transformers: This programs is part of a
comprehensive provincial and EPH plan to decrease losses in enterprise
owned and maintained transformers.
(c)   Efficient Lighting Program: Henan province and EPH aggressively
promote this program for the replacement of standard lighting
technologies and compact fluorescent bulbs, fluorescent tubes, high
intensity discharge lamps, and high pressure sodium lamps in enterprises.
(Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, is perhaps the only Chinese city where a



-107-                       ANNEX4.2
large number of shopping centers, hotels and commercial establishments
use CFLs and other modem lighting technologies extensively).
3.    The main electricity conservation activities conducted by EPH include: to sustain
these efforts the Henan Provincial Government established a fund for cofinancing
investments in energy efficiency technologies made by enterprises. This Conservation
Investment Program, began as a pilot program in early 1994. The pilot began with a fund
corpus of Yuan 50 million-28 million came from the provincial government and 22
million from EPH. Savings of approximately 240 GWh/year have been obtained for a
total investment of 76 million Yuan (i.e. EPH 15 plus Customer 61) in 117 projects with
76 enterprises. The basic features of the fund are as follows:
(a)   EPH cofinancing takes the forrn of loans to industrial customers, with the
criterion that the customer make up the bulk of the capital required. The average
contribution from EPH has been about 20 percent.
(b)   Repayments are made by the customer directly into an EPH account. (The
potentially easier method of direct bill collection is not used as it could be
interpreted as a tariff for which EPH has no authority to set.)
(c)    EPH expects to recover its investment within six months to two years for
typical projects.
(d)   The interest rate on the loan is below market rates and therefore represents
a subsidy.
B. Electricity Conservation Component
Project Selection and Implementation Principles
4.    The principal objective of the $10 million electricity conservation component
under the proposed loan is to complement ongoing efforts by promoting market-based
sustainable programs. The sustainability of the projects will be ensured by: (a) the
economic and financial viability of the selected projects; (b) the full payment of the
project costs by the users; and (c) the verified and proper measurement of energy savings.
These projects will disseminate energy efficient technologies, demonstrate effective
measurement and monitoring practices, and demonstrate the viability of innovative
commercially-based contractual and financing mechanisms. The agreed principles for
project selection and implementation are:
(i)    Projects should be economicallly and financially viable with an
internal rate of return higher than for supply-side (i.e. generation)
projects.
(ii)    Pilot  projects  should  demonstrate  new   high-efficiency
technologies.  To successfully demonstrate and ensure wider



-108 -                           ANNEX4.2
application of these technologies, EPH will ensure that: a) the
actual energy savings are measured and verified against planning
estimates; and b) the results are disseminated in Henan through
case-studies or information brochures.
(iii)    All projects undertaken jointly by EPH and electricity consumers
will be based on commercial terms with appropriate contractual
relationships.
(iv)    Pilot projects should demonstrate new  financing techniques for
energy conservation projects. These techniques include equipment
leasing and shared savings contracts.
Description of Conservation Projects
5.     The projects included under the electricity conservation project component, the
estimated energy savings, and the financial intemal rate for EPH are outlined in the
following table. The proposed energy conservation loan component of $10.00 million
equivalent comprises $6 million for conservation projects within EPH, $3.80 million for
projects with EPH clients, and about $200,000 for up-front implementation technical
assistance. This division of the energy conservation loan component between EPH
subsidiaries (approx. 60 percent) and EPH electricity consumers (approx. 40 percent)
reflects a balance desired by EPH to increase their confidence in guaranteeing the loan
repayment.

energy services and adminstrative expenses.



- 109 -                       ANNEX 4.2
6.    The economic rate of return was very attractive for all projects, exceeding 30
percent. The financial rate of return exceed the return on supply-side projects in
accordance with established principles. To underscore the importance of complementary
tariff reforms, it was found that the return increases dramatically when economic tariffs
are instituted.
7.    Zhengzhou City Distribution Loss Reduction Program:  The scope of this
project includes the modernization and improvement of system operations in one
distribution circle in Zhengzhou city. The objective of the project from an electricity
conservation stand-point is to demonstrate the large reductions in distribution system
losses that can be achieved by optimizing the operation of the distribution network. The
project includes an investment component of about $2.9 million and a technical
assistance component of about $0.4 million.  The technical assistance component
provided for international consulting services for project basic engineering, development
of measurement and monitoring techniques, introduction of modern distribution system
planning techniques including computer hardware/software, and training in load research
and managment.
8.    High-Efficiency Transformer Program: This project is intended to: (a) reduce
distribution system losses in the supply bureaus of EPH; and (b) demonstrate the
suitability  of high-efficiency transformers.   The project scope will include the
procurement and installation of about 800 distribution transformers, and the performance
monitoring of a valid sample number of these transformers. A feasibility study will be
prepared by EPH to define the number and type of distribution transformers to be
procured. This study will evaluate the use of BS9 and higher efficiency transformers as
replacement for the existing SJ-type transformers. At least 5 percent of the total funds
will be used to procure amorphous core tranformers. This will be done to evaluate the
suitability and cost-effectiveness of such transformers for wider use in the EPH
distribution network.
9.    High-Efficiency Welding Machine Program:  This project is intended to:
(a) introduce high-efficiency welding machines in EPH subsidiaries; and (b) demonstrate
the energy savings and operational benefits of such equipment. The project scope will
include the procurement and installation of about 300 high-efficiency welding machines,
and the performance monitoring of an appropriate sample of these welding machines.
The financing of this project is conditional on an increase in the World Bank electricity
conservation loan component.
10.   Upgradation of Facilities at Luoyang Steel Plant: This project is intended to:
(a) assist a major industrial electricity consumer in Henan to install energy efficiency
equipment, and (b) demonstrate the application of commercial contractual relationships
between EPH and consumers for the financing and implementation of mutually beneficial
I  The BS-type transformers are hermetically sealed tranformers that are both more efficient, as well as require much lower
maintenance than the SJ-type of transformers.



-110 -                     ANNEX4.2
energy conservation projects. The project scope will include the procurement and
installation of state-of-art oxygen production equipment at one plant of the Louyang Steel
Company. EPH will finance the equipment and enter into a performance based contract
with Louyang Steel Company that links the repayment to energy savings and improved
productivity at the Luoyang Steel plant. A minimum payment will be established to
ensure recovery of the investment costs and also a reasonable profit. In addition, a shared
savings contract provision will enable Luoyang Steel Company to accelerate repayment
by utilizing the energy savings and productivity benefits that exceed the minimum debt
repayment. The contractual relationship will be based on commercial financing terms
applicable in China, plus a margin for services rendered and adminstrative expenses.
Technical assistance will be provided to develop the contractual arrangements and
repayment based on shared savings performance contracting terms.
11.   Variable Speed Drives (VSDs)-Leasing Program: This project is intended to:
(a) encourage the use of VSDs in applications that deliver financially viable energy
savings benefits; and (b) demonstrate the applicability of leasing as a means to provide
consumer credit for the financing of energy efficient equipment in Henan. The project
scope will include the procurement and leasing of variable speed drives (VSDs). EPH
will procure the VSDs and lease them to consumers. The leasing terms will be
commercially based. The advantages of leasing as a means of financing energy efficient
equipment are: (a) increased credit security for EPH, as it will own the equipment until it
is transferred to the consumer (lessor) at the end of the leasing period. This mode of
leasing is referred to as a full-payout lease; and (b) provides consumers with 100 percent
upfront financing, thereby encouraging the adoption of the energy efficient equipment.
Technical assistance to prepare model contracts and procedures for lease financing of
energy efficient equipment has been included in the project.
Implementation Arrangements
12.   The main implementation arrangements agreed upon are:
(a)   EPH will be responsible for the implementation of all energy conservation
projects included under the proposed loan.
(b)   All projects will include adequate provisions for the measurement and
verification of energy savings. The measurement of energy savings will
ensure that the performance of these pilot demonstration projects are
appropriately monitored to facilitate future dissemination of results and
project replicability. The measurement and monitoring protocols, as well
as the reporting requirements will be defined as part of the up-front
technical assistance for project implementation (item 6. in project list) and
agreed upon with the World Bank.
(c)   The  energy  conservation  projects  implemented  by  EPH  with
clients/consumers will be based on commercial terms. The direct cost of
funds for both on-lending in the case of Luoyang Steel (item 4. in project



-111I I -                  ANNEX4.2
list) and the VSD leasing program (item 5. in project list) will at a
minimum be the published state commercial bank rate for comparable loan
maturities, plus an administrative margin of 3 percent per year on
outstanding interest and principal.
(d)   All procurement will be done in accordance with World Bank procurement
guidelines. Technical specifications for all equipment procurement will be
reviewed by the World Bank. Disbursement of funds will be based on the
agreed schedule.
Technical Assistance and Training
13.   To asure successful implementation, the proposed loan component includes
technical assistance in two elements: (a) a $400,000 component to support EPH's
distribution loss reduction demonstration project. These funds will be used for preparing
the basic engineering work required, as well as support the introduction of improved
distribution load management and planning techniques; and (b) a $200,000 component
for general support of project preparation and implementation. These funds will be used
mainly for the technical and contractual work required for the Luoyang Steel shared
savings program and VSD leasing program. These funds will also be used to develop
adequate monitoring and measurement protocols for all projects.
14.   A broader package of training and technical assistance initiatives are planned.
These initiatives cover both the business management aspects and technical aspects of a
commercially oriented electricity conservation program. Funding for these activities will
be proposed for financing from multilateral and bilateral technical assistance grant funds.
The following technical assistance initiatives are planned:
(a)   Commercial Business Planning and Management Module:  Topics
relating to financial analysis, project management, business planning will
be covered.
(b)   Energy Service Contracting:  Performance contracting for energy
services at a customer site will be crucial to mitigating performance risk to
levels where energy efficiency projects become viable. The introduction
of performance contracting as an integral part of in energy service
provision would address issues of project structure, marketing, and
building project linkages between customer, service providers and
financiers.
(c)   Energy monitoring and targeting (M&T): M&T is seen as a crucial
element of energy service provision. Without effective practices in M&T
it is difficult to focus scarce resources on the highest yield efficiency
investments and it is also not possible to maintain performance at design
levels over the long-term.

ANNEX 4.8: LAND ACQUISITION AND RELOCATION
Scope of Relocation
1.    Qinbei Thennal Power Project includes construction of a new power plant and a
new 500-kV network consisting of about 165 kilometers (kin) of transmission lines, with
2 substations (1,500 MVA). The power plant is a greenfield operation located in a
semirural agricultural area of Jiyuan municipality in the northwestern part of Henan
province, about 17km to the northwest of Jiyuan City. The actual location of the plant is
an uninhabited wasteland area at the foot of Taihangshan and Wangwushan Mountains.
The topography of the plant site is flat and open. Most of the land is too poor to be
farmed. There is no resident on it, and no relocation necessary. There will be no adverse
social and economic impact through the loss of houses, agricultural land, grazing land or
other economic activity. According to the preliminary design there is no relocation
involved in the transmission component. However after considering the fact that the
construction of transmission will be implemented in 1997, EPH has budgeted for a
certain amount of land acquisition and possible relocation of households in case of
possible changes in the route of the transmission lines. Therefore, according to the
relocation plan, the project will acquire a total of 84.24 hectares (ha) of land, relocating at
most 30 to 40 households or 150 to 160 persons. In addition, as many as 358.4 ha of land
will be required temporarily during the project construction.

Purpose and Strategy of Resettlement
2.    The priority was given to minimize the scope of resettlement throughout the
project design and planning. In order to achieve such an objective EPH spared no efforts
to minimize utilization of agriculture land and relocation of households and avoid mines,
historic, tourist and urban areas.
3.    There is no relocation of human beings in the preliminary planning. However, the
final routing of the lines have not been finalized yet, and the soil conditions or technical
constraints could have some changes. EPH estimated that relocation of a maximum of 30
to 40 households might be required if technical studies underway would require changes
in the routing of the lines. For those households who might be affected by the
construction of transmission lines, they will be compensated and supported to rebuild
their houses with better housing and living conditions within the same villages not far
from the existing site, averaging 100 to 200m to guarantee a smooth completion of the
construction.
4.    If a resettlement action plan would be required, it would be developed according
to Chinese policy and regulations and the Bank procedures, and in consultation with local
government regarding compensation standards and baseline surveys.
Legal Framework
5.    The Bank Requirements. The resettlement action plan (RAP) will be developed
in line with the requirements contained in the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30:
Involuntary Resettlement.
6.    National and Local Policies.  The legal basis for land acquisition and
resettlement of Qinbei Power Project is provided by laws and regulations enacted by the
Central Government, and implementation regulations of provincial and local
municipalities. The main state law and regulations, the "Land Administration Law" was
enacted in 1986. The local implementation regulations include: "The Compensation
Standards for the land acquisition by the State," and "Henan Province Land
Administration Laws and Regulations" issued by Henan Provincial Government.(1989),
"Further Strengthening of Land Management in the Infrastructure Construction." jointed
issued by Henan Provincial Economic Planning Commission and Henan Provincial Land
Administration." (No. 111, 1991), and "The Decisions on the Compensation for the land
acquisition by the State" issued by Zhengzhou City and Prefecture Government (No. 144,
1993), and various related regulations or decrees adopted by local municipal or county
governments.
7.    Under this project, since most land acquisition and relocation will take place in
rural areas. Most of the resettlement activities will be governed by both the "Land
Administration Law" and its local implementation measures. According to the "Land
Administration Law," S ection 1, Article 2: "for the public interest, the state could



-134 -                      ANNEX 4.8
expropriate collectively owned farmland." The essence of the policy is that when the
state acquires farmland, the land-using units will pay not only a basic compensation for
land, crop and attached properties, but also job resettlement subsidies. Based on the
documents issued by the provincial govermment, local governments have specified a
detailed compensation plan.
8.    The compensation rates are as follows:
(a)   State land (uncultivated) at power plant site: Y 1 1,000/mu/1 5 years.
(b)   Crop land on the transmission route: Y 16,800/mu/l5 years.
(c)   Vegetable land: Y 17,600/mu/15 years.
(d)   Crop land leased for construction: Y 1,690/mu.
(e)   Vegetable land leased for construction: Y 1,780/mu.
(f)    Closing of small quarry used by single family: Y 50,000 per place.
(g)   Regular tree: Y 30/piece.
(h)   Fruit tree: Y 200/piece.
(i)    Land for transformers: Y 38,000/mu.
(j)    Relocation of households: Y 200/m2.
(k)   Relocation subsidy: Y 30/person.
Resettlement Institutional Responsibility
9.    EPH has set up a Land Acquisition and Compensation Group composed of three
to four professionals and local representatives to be responsible for the resettlement. The
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Group will provide overall leadership and
coordination during the process of resettlement planning and implementation, which
includes thirty party supervisor. More specifically, it will:
(a)   participate in the process of preliminary design and alignment selection,
including surveys of land acquisition and any affected households,
consultation with local communities; and estimation of compensation
costs;
(b)   participate in the finalization of alignment design in the field, including
verification of land acquisition, determination of the number of affected



-135 -                       ANNEX 4.8
households, and other lost properties; and formulation of "Project Land
Acquisition and Building Demolition Table," which will be the basis for
the resettlement action plan;
(c)   discuss with relevant local government agencies on various compensation
policies and resettlement programs, which will then be formulated into
local decrees issued by the local governments;
(d)   negotiate  compensation  and  rehabilitation  contracts with  affected
communities, particularly for all substations; and processing land
acquisition applications with provincial and affected county land bureaus;
and
(e)   supervise and coordinate individual contractors during the implementation
the resettlement action plan.
Budget and Timetable
10.   Based on the preliminary budget projection, resettlement costs will total
approximately Y 70.33 million. This includes a 6 percent contingency and 3 percent
administration expense. According to Chinese regulations, the Y 49.62 million on the
state land acquisition will be paid to the Jiyuan City Government.

Monitoring and Evaluation
11.   The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure that the resettlement
program is implemented smoothly and to see whether resettled people restore their living
condition and income level after relocation.  The agreed outline of the first-year
monitoring report includes reviewing resettlement progress among all components;
examining the us of resettlement funds; and assessing situation regarding production
restoration among relocated population, if any; living condition improvements (housing
and related services and facilities); and administration capacity of resettlement
organizations. The group will produce a resettlement progress report for the project
office and the Bank every six months.  After the completion of resettlement
implementation, a resettlement evaluation report will be completed.
Conflict Resolution and Grievance Procedure
12.  If an affected person is not satisfied with the compensation package or if, for any
reason, the compensation does not materialized according to the agreed schedule, he or
she could go through a grievance procedure specified in the resettlement action plan.



-137 -                       ANNEX 4.8
13.   The complainer can voice his or her concern to the responsible resettlement
offices, or could bring the case to the "Public Complaint Office," which exists in both
county and municipality level governments, directly under the governors' offices, or
request an administrative review of the case by the same or higher level of government
and appeal directly in court, if he or she is not satisfied with the governor's decision.



-138 -                     ANNEX 4.9
ANNEX 4.9: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
A. Summary of Key Project Environmental Issues
Air Pollution
1.    Table 1 presents air pollution characteristics for the proposed project (1,200 MW)
and the total power program planned for the site (3,600 MW). As can be seen, emission
standards for dust, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are all in compliance with Chinese
standards and World Bank guidelines for both design coal and check coal cases. Air
quality data are also presented, and for sulfur dioxide, the project (1,200 MW) and overall
program (3,600 MW) will not result in a violation of World Bank guidelines. PRC
(Grade Il) standards are likewise not exceeded for annual and 24-hour averages, though
one exceedance of the 1-hour standard was predicted from the dispersion modeling in a
nonprotected portion of the mountain region (details may be found in the EAR). Existing
background dust levels exceed both Chinese standards and World Bank guidelines. This
is not unusual for China in general, and in particular for this area which is exceptionally
dry. With project implementation, and ultimately with the overall program, these dust
levels will be slightly elevated (a maximum of 0.5 percent for the project and 1.5 percent
for the program, with respect to "one maximum" values). This is not believed to be
problematic for several reasons; maximums are at the plant site which is uninhabited and,
at the nearest major population center (Jiyuan City), anticipated increases in dust levels
are about one third the values of those at the plant site. These differences are well below
the monitoring errors and the modeling uncertainties (0.2 percent for the project and 0.6
percent for the program); and the local government (including the regional environmental
protection board) supports the project.
2.    Although ambient measurements of nitrogen oxides were not made, it is unlikely
to be a problem because of limited sources (traffic, fuel combustion) in the region.
Furthermore, low NOx burners are to be included in order to meet emission levels to
comply with Chinese and World Bank emission standards for NOx. Thus appropriate
mitigating measures are being taken as would be taken had an issue of NOx been
identified.
3.    Carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to be 0.0065 and 0.0195 billion tons/year
for the 1,200 MW and 3,600 MW situations respectively. This represents 0.03 and 0.09
percent of the annual industrial global burden. Therefore both the project and the overall
program should present an insignificant impact on global warming.

Water Pollution
4.     Wastewaters will be discharged after appropriate treatment to meet Chinese
standards and World Bank guidelines. Treatment will be physical, chemical and/or
biological. Cooling towers will be used and some cooling tower blowdown will be used
for bottom ash sluicing and dust suppression at the ash disposal yard. All effluent
discharges, after treatment, will be to the Baijan river, which is primarily a dry river bed
from September to June and only experiences flow conditions during July and August.
There is a potential issue of these effluent discharges contaminating downstream
groundwater used for irrigation. If the effluent and irrigation water monitoring program
(see Table C.2) indicate a problem, EPH agreed to drill alternate wells and construct
necessary irrigation systems to provide farmers an acceptable water supply. Drinking
water wells are all upstream of the discharge and should not be affected. During these
dry periods these surface discharges percolate to the aquifer and thereby recharge (in part)
the water supply source for this project.

Coal Transport and Handling
6.    Fuel will be supplied from the two main sources: the Houzhou Coal Mine Bureau
(Linfen prefecture) and the Changzi Coal Transport and Supply Branch Company. Fuel
from the Houzhou mines will be shipped by rail along the southern Tong-Pu railway line
and the Houma-Yueshan railway line to the Qinbei north railway station. Fuel from the
Changzi mines will be shipped by the Tai Jiao railway line and then along the Jiao Zhi



- 142 -                     ANNEX 4.9
railway line to Qinbei. The power station is about 150 km from the Changzi mines and
270 km from the Houzhou mines. For the project (1,200 MW) about 3.5 million
tons/year of fuel will be supplied from both mines. Fuel will be a mixture of lean coal,
bituminous, and washed middlings in the following proportions:
Lean Coal       Bituminous      Washed Middlings
Design coal         2        :     I        :         I
Checkcoal           2              0                  1
7.    Washed middlings are derived from a coal washing plant in Houzhou whose main
customer is a nearby steel mill.
8.    Both rail lines are to be utilized for a variety of freight, and project
implementation would not overburden current or future freight movement. Project
requirements and overall freight line capacities are indicated below:

9.    At the coal storage yard, water sprinkling facilities will be installed to prevent
coal dust dispersion. Spraying will be done on a regular basis and during coal dumping.
The coal coniveyor operation, crusher room, rotary dumper rooms and transfer points will
be enclosed and dust collection equipment installed. All excess water runoff at the coal
yard will be collected and treated (suspended solids and pH) prior to discharge.
Ash Management
10.   Fly ash and slag will be removed separately. Slag will be slurried and pumped to
a dewatering bin and then either trucked or conveyed to the dry ash disposal area or sold.
Trucking and conveying alternatives are currently under study in terms of
environmental/economic factors.  If trucking is determined to be the appropriate
alternative, a dedicated highway will be constructed to avoid truck traffic interference
with local residents. Excess water will be sent for treatment as part of the chemical
wastewater stream. Fly ash will be sent to an ash silo pneumatically where it will be
mixed with a small amount of water (25 percent) and either trucked or conveyed to the
dry ash disposal yard or sold to consumers.



-143-                       ANNEX4.9
11.   Two dry ash disposal yards sites are available: the Liuchun and Dongluzai sites.
The Liuchun side located in the flood plain on the left bank of the Qin river about 4.5 km
south of the plant site is preferred. All boundaries of this ashyard will be confined by
dikes whose height will be established to protect against the 50-year flood. An additional
dike will be constructed to contain any flooding which might result from the alternate
runoff pattern introduced by the presence of the ashyard. The Dongluzai dry ashyard is
located 4 km east of the plant site. Both sites can together accommodate about 15 years
of ash deposition (either design or check coal) at the full operation of 3,600 MW.
12.   Permeability at the site of Liuchun is relatively high (10-5 cm/sec) so an
impermeable liner of either compacted clay or plastic will be laid down at the ashyard
first. Groundwater in the area is used by farmers for drinking and irrigation; however,
groundwater beneath the ashyard is expected to flow away from any drinking water wells.
Additionally, in this region, annual evaporation rates exceed precipitation rates by almost
1,000 mm and laboratory tests indicated that water migration from the ashyard should not
reach the groundwater level which is three to four meters below the base of the ashyard.
13.   Nonetheless, the Liuchun ashyard does present a slightly greater than normal risk
of groundwater contamination. Therefore, groundwater monitoring will play a critical
role in the environmental management plan. In addition, if a problem arises, the Borrower
will reevaluate the liner design and construction and make necessary corrections before
disposal is continued. The sector of the ash disposal site in use at the time problems are
identified would be capped with clay and topsoil, and disposal resumed at a section of the
ashyard that would have been repaired. If the problem still persists, the Borrower agrees
to switch ash disposal to the Dongluzai site.
14.   Dust suppression will be maintained by spraying 10 mm of water per month
during periods of low or no rainfall. Additionally, the ash surface will be compressed by
rolling, and trees planted at the periphery to decrease wind speed.
15.   When the site is complete, it will be covered with clay and topsoil and then
planted with vegetation.
Transmission Line
16.   The 165-km 500 kV transmission line will be designed in such fashion that the
maximum electric field strength at 1.5 meters above the ground surface will be 5 kV/m
(500 KV Substation Design Provisional Technical Regulation: SDGJ69-85). The design
will further limit induction currents to 0.5 ma. There are no World Bank standards for
electric field strengths, but the maximum value is considered safe (within limits
experienced by using an electric heating blanket) and should not cause damage to any
vegetation. The transmission line route has been selected to avoid villages and towns, so
there are no issues of resettlement or compensation for dismantling of existing structures.
Approximately 80 m2 of land is occupied by each cable support tower. Affected



-144-                      ANNEX 4.9
landowners will be reimbursed for this use with a one-time payment based upon loss-of-
land use for fifteen years. Noise levels on the average comply with Chinese standards
and World Bank guidelines. Both electric field monitoring along the transmission route
and noise monitoring are part of the overall monitoring plan (see Section C).
17.   The issue of migratory bird routes over the transmission corridors were examined
in the updated EAR (April, 1995) and it was concluded that any impacts would be small
or negligible. Additionally, the Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Agency has
verified that the proposed project does not cross or influence any natural protection zones.
Aquatic/Terrestrial Ecology
18.   The plant will be located at a site that is uninhabited and consists of poor quality,
uncultivated soil. There are no nature preservation areas, wildlife, fisheries, or forest
cover of any significance. Any existing ecological communities could establish
themselves quickly and easily in any number of nearby areas with similar environmental
conditions.
Occupational Health and Safety
19.   Project design will be such that international standards of worker safety will be
included in all bidding documents of project equipment. Boilers and other dangerous
equipment will be designed to meet ASME standards of safety and will be so specified in
the bidding documents. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are illegal in China, their use
is prohibited in the project. Prohibition of asbestos use will be specified in the bid
documents.
Human Environment
20.   No socio-cultural resources were identified with the Qinbei Power Plant
construction or operational area of impact. A primary concern is increased truck traffic
on local roads if ash disposal is to be conducted this way. However, if this alternative for
ash disposal is selected, impacts would be mitigated by construction of a dedicated road
and using trucks with increased capacity (to minimize frequency of deliveries). EPH is
studying the alternative of a dry ash conveyor system. Based upon study results, the most
economic and environmentally acceptable choice will be made.
Noise
21.   Noise estimates indicate that the project (power station and transmission line) will
conform to Chinese standards and World Bank guidelines as indicated in Table 3.

Ash and Slag Disposal       After wetting, dry ash and slag from boiler are conveyed (truck or belt) to dry ash
disposal yard. Ash and slag deposited at the yard will be leveled, rolled and
sprayed with water in time. Ashyard is partitioned in blocks. When one block pile
of ash reaches the designated height, it is covered by clay, then topsoil, then
planted with grass. Development of a program/market for utilization of ash and
slag. For prevent groundwater contamination, either a clay or plastic membrane
liner will be placed at the ash site with a permeability of 10 7 cm/sec.
If the groundwater monitoring program indicates development of adverse water
quality conditions, the block will be capped with clay, the remaining liner
construction examined to check permeability. If detective, the remaining liner will
be repaired, and disposal continued in the repaired section of the ashyard.
If this measure is unsuccessful, the Dongluzai site will be prepared and used for ash
disposal.
Dust (at Ashyard)          Trees planted at the edge of the yard to suppress dust formation. Cooling tower
blowdown water sprinkled on active ash block. After block is complete, it will be
