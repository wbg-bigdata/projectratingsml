MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A HENAN (QINBEI) THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to China for the equivalent of $440 million. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The
proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the Electric Power of Henan (EPH) on the same terms
and conditions as the Bank loan, with EPH bearing the foreign exchange risk.
2.    Country Power Sector Policies. Large-scale energy development and improvements in
the efficiency of energy supply and use are critical to meet the fast growing demand, alleviate
shortages and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment in China. The Government is
encouraging efficient energy use through reliance upon energy price increases and a well-
developed institutional network for energy conservation. Consumer prices for the major forms
of energy now largely reflect economic costs. Electricity conservation is promoted through the
"Three Electricity Offices", with a comprehensive network at the central, provincial and local
levels. These offices supervise and coordinate electricity conservation investments through a
variety of programs involving provincial power companies and industrial consumers. These
measures have helped achieve exceptionally low energy use-GDP growth elasticities since the
early 1980s, and especially during the last few years. Even with further improvements in
conservation, however, generation capacity must increase by at least 15 to 16 GW a year from
1994 to 1997, and 17 to 20 GW a year from 1997 to 2000 to avoid exacerbation of the serious
power shortages that already exist. The Government has adopted the strategy of constructing
large-scale and cost-effective power plants to meet demand and accelerate the replacement of
obsolete and heavily polluting plants with more energy-efficient units.
3.    To continue the efficiency improvements and increase capital mobilization for further
development of the power industry, China is now actively pursuing an ambitious program of
power sector reforms. Particular progress has been made in sector decentralization, cost
recovery through major tariff reforms, and diversification of financing sources, including
development of a variety of independent power generation schemes. The pace and depth of
sector reforms have picked up during 1993-95. Recently, China has achieved three important
steps in its gradual reform approach: (a) the Standing Committee of the 17th Session of the
National People's Congress passed the first "Electricity Law of the People's Republic of China";
(b) the State Council decided to abolish the Ministry of Electric Power and divide its functions
between existing government agencies; and (c) the State Council decided on the creation of a
National Power Grid Company that would, inter alia, be designated as the representative of the
state as owner of government-owned power assets. The Government's future agenda for action
now includes: (a) commercialization and corporatization of power companies, together with
achievement of greater enterprise autonomy; (b) further measures to rationalize power tariffs;
(c) further reforms to the regulatory and legal framework; and (d) diversification of the financing



- 2 -
for power development, including private sector participation. Although consensus exists at the
national level on the basic directions of the program, the difficult task of implementing the
reform program at provincial and local levels throughout the country is just beginning. While
actions have been initiated on all of the above fronts, measures to commercialize the power
entities are now a focal point in the overall effort. These measures include separating the
producing entities from the Government, granting them autonomy in business decision-making,
and subjecting them to market forces in an arms-length regulatory framework.
4.    The Chinese Government has also initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution related to
the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's contribution to the problem. In
terms of emission control in large and medium-scale plants, China has made substantial progress
in particulate control, through deployment of high efficiency electrostatic precipitators. The
Government announced in June 1994 that it would spend about $2 billion over the next seven
years on an environmental program aimed at keeping SO2 emissions at a level of 15 million
metric tons a year, as part of a comprehensive program of acid rain abatement. The Government
intends also to accelerate the development of hydropower and construction of large and efficient
300 and 600 MW coal-fired units to avoid the mushrooming of the small and highly polluting
plants that still constitute about 60 percent of the additional installed capacity.
5.    Bank Strategy. In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program
in China places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last two
years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on helping the
Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's Institutional
Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector work on power sector
reform), and exploring options for mobilizing further resources to meet the capital needs of
sector development (through informal sector work). The study (Strategic Options in Power
Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector report (China Power Sector Reform: Towards
Competition and Improved Performance, 1994) provide vehicles for dialogue between the Bank
and Chinese institutions. Technical assistance is also currently provided to central authorities to
develop an improved legal and regulatory framework for the power industry. The energy
conservation support program includes technical assistance through the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), lending support in selected industrial, environment and energy projects, and
development of a series of new GEF investment operations. The power sector lending program
now focuses on assistance for detailed aspects of implementation of the power sector reforms, as
well as reducing the power shortages that continue to hamper development and slow the market
orientation of the sector.
6.    Provincial Background. Henan Province, where the proposed project is located, is the
second most populous (89.5 million in 1994) and one of the less developed provinces in China.
The installed power capacity by the end of 1994 was 8,473 MW, of which 545 MW hydro and
7,928 MW coal fired power plants. The peak load was 7,900 MW and the total electricity
supply (including energy exchanges) 50 TWh. Electricity consumption per capita was 560
kWh, about three quarters of the national average. The provincial power sector is plagued by
acute shortages: in 1994, load was shed about 84,000 times (more than 240 times per day) and
demand during peak time exceeded supply by about 700 MW, 9 percent of the peak demand, in



- 3 -
spite of severe measures to limit power use by industrial consumers. Adequate power supply
and increased sector efficiency through further market orientation are crucial for sustained
growth in the province.
7.    While provincial authorities recognize the need for reforms to improve the performance
of the sector and attract private investment, implementation lags behind that in some of the
coastal provinces. The transition of the provincial power entity to an autonomous and business-
oriented company has proceeded slowly. Although EPH has been established as an independent
legal entity for several years, it still carries government and administrative functions and lacks
the management and technical skills to efficiently carry out its core businesses. While Henan
has made substantial progress in power price reform, prices are still lower than the economic
costs of supply, and further progress is required to gradually phase out the multitier pricing
system.
8.    Following two successful reform-oriented power projects in the coastal provinces of
Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Bank support has shifted inland, first to Sichuan Province with the
recently approved Ertan II Hydroelectric Project (Ln. 3933-CHA), and now to Henan Province
with the proposed operation. This reflects the Bank's strategy of assisting Chinese authorities in
mitigating the growing regional disparities and infrastructure bottlenecks in underdeveloped
provinces, where capital resources, access to financial markets, and private involvement remain
very limited. This shift will extend reform to inland provinces, where progress towards a more
open, efficient and financially sustainable power industry is slower than in the booming coastal
provinces. While prior involvement of the Bank in Henan under the 1992 Yanshi Thermal
Power Project (Ln. 3433-CHA) helped in building EPH's capability in managing construction of
large projects and improving its financial situation through increased electricity prices, the
proposed project focuses on reform implementation and institutional changes to ensure sustained
performance and attract private investments. EPH has expressed strong commitment to reform
and prepared, with the assistance of international consultants, a reform implementation plan
which has been approved by provincial and central authorities.
9.    Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project are to: (a) reduce the acute
power shortages and foster integrated development of the power system of Henan Province in
the most cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; (b) support adequate
implementation of power sector and power enterprise reforms and accelerate the transition of
EPH to a legally and financially autonomous and business-oriented company, in line with the
recently enacted Company La>A; (c) assist in transferring new power technologies and in
applying modem power operation/maintenance methods; (d) support improvements in the
efficiency of electricity use; and (e) contribute to rationalization of power tariffs.
10.   Project Description. The proposed project includes investment, power sector reform
and institutional development components as follows: (a) construction of two 600-MW coal-
fired thermal power units and associated equipment and facilities, including an on-line
performance monitoring system to increase plant performance, reduce coal consumption and
gradually introduce innovative maintenance techniques; (b) erection of two 165 km 500-kV
transmission lines to connect the power plant to the existing power transmission network;



- 4 -
(c) construction management and engineering services; (d) a technical assistance package to
support the implementation of the power sector reform action plan; (e) an electricity
conservation component to assist EPH and Henan Province in developing a demand side
efficiency program based on market incentives rather than administrative means; and (f) a
technical assistance, a training program and suitable computerized systems to build the
beneficiary's operation and management capabilities.
11.   A $10 million equivalent loan component is included in the project to: (a) develop
pilot/demonstration projects aimed at reducing end-use electricity consumption through
introduction of state-of-the-art technologies such as variable speed motors, low loss
transformers, high efficiency welding machines, etc.; (b) implement a pilot/demonstration
project of power loss reduction in the urban distribution system; and (c) develop adequate
monitoring procedures and test new financing approaches, especially performance contracting
and leasing, to speed up implementation of electricity conservation projects.
12.   The Reform Implementation component is intended to enhance the business and profit
orientation of the EPH and its corporate governance, strengthen its financial autonomy and
initiate a restructuring of the sector that would lead to introduction of competition at the
generation level, and improved contractual arrangements between the different operators
through the following actions:
(a)   Incorporation of EPH as a Limited Liability Company. EPH revised its
charter to delineate its rights and obligations and develop an adequate
corporate governance framework in accordance with the new Company Law in
June 1995. Its incorporation as a limited liability company (under the new
Company Law) will be completed within nine months of issuance of necessary
State Council regulations on restructuring state-owned enterprises.
(b)   Separation of Government and Enterprise Functions. EPH, the Ministry of
Electric Power and the Central China Electric Power Administration have
agreed to achieve this objective in a two-step approach: (i) consolidation of
government and regulatory functions (i.e., bureau functions) in one division
within EPH by no later than June 1996; and (ii) separation of all bureau
functions to appropriate national and provincial level authorities in
conformance with the regulatory framework established at the national and
provincial levels.
(c)   Commercialization of Operations. EPH will streamline its organizational
structure and focus on its core businesses by converting profit-oriented units
into autonomous companies or profit centers by December 1996, and
nonprofit-oriented ones (social services) into cost centers to be shifted to
suitable institutions, pari pasu with the progress of social sector reforms.
(d)   Tariff Reform. EPH's tariff reform action plan focuses on: (i) tariff increases
beginning in 1996 to meet agreed financial targets and economically adequate
tariffs by the year 2000; (ii) unification of tariffs by end-1998; and



(iii) adjustment of demand charges for industrial customers, and price
differentials between different voltage levels to gradually reflect the cost of
supply.
(e)   Power Sector Restructuring. EPH will, in coordination and consultation with
higher authorities, implement structural reforms to introduce competition at the
generation level (end of 1998), improve contractual arrangements among the
different operating entities in the sector, and increase efficiency at the
distribution level (June 1997).
EPH's Reform Implementation Plan is set out in the table attached to Annex 3.3 of the Staff
Appraisal Report.
13.   The project team also coordinated efforts with the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
which is financing another thermal power project in Henan. While the proposed Bank project
mainly focuses on power sector and tariff reforms, the ADB project will focus more on
environmental control at the provincial level through improvements in environment and coal
quality monitoring and enforcement, closure of small boilers and small and inefficient power
plants, and reforestation.
14.   Project Costs and Financing. The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at
$1,161.1 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $497.4 million equivalent.
The total financing requirements, including interest during construction, are estimated at
$1,411.3 million equivalent. The foreign costs would be cofinanced by the proposed Bank
loan of $440.0 million equivalent, a commercial cofinancing of $55 million equivalent which
consists of two tranches: a $30 million Eurodollar syndicated loan, and a private placement
(Yen loan) of Yen 2.5 billion ($25 million equivalent). Retroactive financing up to $2 million
would be required for expenditures to be incurred prior to the loan signing but after June 15,
1995, to avoid delay in implementation of technical assistance supported under this loan,
especially consultancy services related to an organizational structure and financial
management study.
15.   Under the cofmancing, commercial lenders are providing funds with a final maturity
of 15 years to China, represented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The proceeds will be
onlent by MOF on the same terms to the beneficiary, EPH. MOF conducted price inquiry for
the financing in October 1995 with financial institutions that indicated interest during earlier
market soundings and awarded a conditional mandate to: (a) a group consisting of six
commercial banks for the Dollar loan; and (b) a life insurance company for the Yen loan. The
mandated interest rates for the Dollar loan and Yen loan are 0.43 and 0.30 percent per year,
respectively, over the relevant 6-month LIBOR. These terms, achieved with a comfort of
cofinancing arrangement with the Bank, are very favorable for the final maturity of 15 years,
including a 5-year grace period. They are below the average pricing of commercial bank
borrowing (about LIBOR+0.5-0.6 percent) by Chinese sovereign entities for a much shorter
maturity of five to seven years.



- 6 -
16.   Local cost financing would be provided by the Central China Electric Power Group
Company (CCEPGC), the Henan Provincial Construction and Investment Company (HPCIC),
and EPH. The loans to be provided by CCEPGC and HPCIC will have a variable interest rate
and 11 years maturity, including three years' grace. Fifteen percent of the total cost will be
provided by CCEPGC and HPCIC in the form of convertible loans. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
17.   Project Implementation. EPH is responsible for implementation of the project and has
created a specialized construction unit to manage project implementation. The construction unit
will benefit from the experience of the recently completed Jiaozuo (6x200 MW) and Yanshi
(2x300 MW) power plants. Assistance in environmental assessment, engineering, procurement
and construction management has been provided during project preparation by international
engineering consultants and will be provided for construction supervision and management
during project implementation.
18.   Schedule B shows procurement arrangements and the disbursement schedule.  A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 15002-CHA dated January 29, 1996, is being distributed separately.
19.   Project Sustainability. An indispensable sustainability factor which has already been
demonstrated is the commitment of the Beneficiary to the agreed objectives of the project.
Moreover, the considerable effort that has been devoted to adequate preparation of all the project
components, the planned training programs, and the agreed technical assistance will assure: (i) a
timely completion of the power plant and associated transmission lines; (ii) adequate and
efficient operation of the power plant thereafter, and (iii) increased market and profit orientation
of the Beneficiary. The institutional and financial sustainability will be assured through
monitoring of adequate implementation of the agreed sectoral and enterprise reforms and
compliance with the agreed financial covenants.
20.   Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. Previous power sector lending operations
have yielded useful lessons on project preparation, technical and operating aspects of power
systems, and the sequencing of institutional and sector reforms. These experiences and
broader international experience in power sector restructuring have also been taken into
account in developing the Bank's power sector strategy in China, and in designing the
proposed project.
21.   Lessons learned from the previous seven thermal power projects in China, particularly
the previous project in Henan at Yanshi (Ln. 3433-CHA), were incorporated in the
preparation of the proposed project in order to: (a) avoid commissioning delays experienced
in the past due to contractual interface problems and weak project management; (b) improve
the quality of environmental studies and monitoring measures; and (c) ensure commitment of
the beneficiary to the institutional and corporate reforms to be included in the project.
Specific actions were taken to increase the involvement of international consultants in
assisting the Beneficiary in assessing the environmental impacts of the project and preparing



- 7 -
the environmental management plan, and in preparing a comprehensive reform plan prior to
preappraisal of the proposed project. The procurement packaging has been designed so as to
avoid the interface problems experienced among different suppliers and vendors during
construction of the Yanshi power plant-especially those involved in implementation of the
instrumentation and control module. Finally, lessons learned from a serious boiler accident
under the Beilungang Thermal Power Project (Ln. 2706-CHA) have been taken into account
to improve boiler design and specifications and coal quality. Complementary studies were
prepared by the Beneficiary and its consultants on coal sampling and analysis to confirm coal
and "check coal" specifications. The methods used were found to conform with international
standards by the Bank's mining specialists.
22.   International experience shows that: (a) even in advanced countries with strong legal
systems and open economies, the time needed to build consensus on power sector reform,
establish a new regulatory framework, and implement structural changes can be very long;
and (b) commercialization and corporatization of energy and other utilities and the pursuit of
transparency and accountability of energy and other utilities are the best ways to achieve
progress in economic regulation. Considering China's 40-year history of a command and
control economy, the progress achieved in reforming the power sector during the last decade,
and especially during the early 1990s, clearly indicates the Government's commitment to
reform. However, the country's difficult transition to a market-oriented macroeconomic
environment and the size of the Chinese economy constrain the pace of power sector reforms,
which will take a gradualist approach, adapted to the diverse provincial conditions, to avoid
disruption.
23.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China presented to the Board on June 1, 1995. For the power
sector, the CAS identified six focal points for Bank assistance: (a) commercialization and
corporatization of operating companies and enterprises; (b) development of adequate regulatory
and legal frameworks; (c) introduction of competition and transparency; (d) assurance of
adequate tariff policies; (e) development of new sources and methods of financing; and
(f) transfer of new technology and modern operational and environmental techniques. This
ambitious reform program reflects the detailed strategy set out in the recent power sector report
for China, which recommends support to plovincial power companies in their transition to
autonomous and business-oriented enterprises.
24.   The proposed project supports the Bank's strategy in the power sector in the above-
mentioned areas. It will support the implementation of an ambitious reform program
including:  (a) incorporation of EPH as a limited liability company; (b) separation of
government and corporate functions within EPH; (c) improvement of its structural
organization and managerial processes to increase cost consciousness and business
orientation; (d) promotion of competition at the generation level; and (e) rationalization of the
pricing system within Henan Province. It also supports new approaches to disseminate
electricity conservation market-based and sustainable projects, and adequate environmental
protection and monitoring, in close cooperation with the Asian Development Bank.

25.   Agreed Actions. Assurances have been obtained from the Borrower that it will:
(a) furnish audited project accounts to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year;
(b) onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to EPH on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank; and (c) ensure that resettlement under the project is carried out in accordance with
an agreed resettlement program.
26.   To ensure a sound institutional environment and adequate and quantifiable monitoring of
the project's progress, assurances have been obtained from EPH that it will: (a) carry out the
Reform Implementation Plan according to the timetable agreed with the Bank, (b) implement
organizational improvements, and the development of improved accounting and financial
management systems according to the recommendations of and schedule determined by the
study financed under the proposed project; (c) furnish the Bank with progress reports and
audited project accounts, statements of expenditures, and financial statements within six months
of the end of each fiscal year; (d) provide an action plan and timetable acceptable to the Bank for
unifying EPH's tariffs and establishing a suitable formula for adjusting the rates; (e) carry out a
management development and training program; (f) carry out resettlement of affected persons in
accordance with a resettlement plan acceptable to the Bank; (g) carry out the agreed
environmental management program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (h) take all necessary
measures to ensure that it meets the financial performance targets (self-financing ratio of 25
percent in 1996, 30 percent during 1997-99, and 35 percent thereafter; and debt service coverage
ratio of 1.5 times at all times); and (i) furnish to the Bank, by April 30 of each year, a rolling 8-
year financial plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and uses of
funds, and balance sheets.
27.   Environmental Aspects. The project is classified as Category A. Environmental
Assessments (EAs) have been prepared for all components and cleared by the responsible
Chinese authorities. The EAs underwent considerable refinements and complementary analyses
with the assistance of international consultants in response to Bank comments, and now meet
international standards. The Bank is satisfied that all environmental concerns have been
satisfactorily addressed. An Environmental Assessment Summary was distributed to the Board
on May 2, 1995.
28.   The project is a greenfield operation located in a semirural agricultural area, about
17 km northwest of Jiyuan city. The site selected for the power plant uses land that is
currently uninhabited, too poor for cultivation and offers the best possibilities for dispersion
of flue gases, thus minimizing impact on the natural and human environment. Also,
appropriate technologies will be applied in design of the power plant, such as high-efficiency
electrostatic precipitators and low NO, burners. Additionally, the plant layout provides
adequate space to install additional pollution control systems if required as a result of future
changes in Chinese standards and/or technological developments.
29.   Resettlement. The project will require acquisition of a total of 290 ha of land. Only
14 cultivated ha will be required for the transmission line. The project will require very
limited relocation of population unless changes in the current routing of the transmission lines
are required due to unidentified technical or soil problems. EPH prepared a preliminary land



- 9 -
acquisition and relocation document (LARP-I) defining the resettlement policies, planning
principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria for resettlement caused by the
project. It was agreed that, upon finalization of the design of the transmission lines and
substations, EPH will prepare a final land acquisition and relocation action plan (LARP-II) to
be submitted to the Bank for its approval prior to the procurement of equipment for
construction of the lines and substations, and this will be a condition of disbursement for the
transmission equipment.
30.   Project Benefits. The large generation additions and associated transmission lines will
remove the severe constraints to economic growth and ease the hardships imposed by power
shortages, especially in poor rural areas in Henan. The electricity conservation component will
demonstrate new techniques in achieving Henan's conservation potential. Finally, institutional
reforms will constitute a significant step towards long-term financial sustainability and
economic efficiency of the power sector.
31.   The least cost analysis prepared by EPH, with the assistance of local consultants, clearly
shows that the proposed project is the first investment of the optimal (least cost) power
development program, and remains so under a wide range of sensitivity analyses related to the
risks that the project may face: a lower demand growth (6 percent per year on average compared
to the expected 9 percent), cost overruns due to low cost estimate and/or construction delays,
lower off-take, and higher fuel costs (see further discussion of project risks below).
32.   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is estimated at 15.2 percent, based on a
power price of 39 fen/kWh (in 1994 prices) that would be paid for electricity at the 110/30 kV
level in 2001, the first year of operation of the power plant, and taking into account the
economic costs for equipment, construction work and fuel.
33.   The IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent, in the event of one of
the following occurrences:
(a)   the price paid at the 110/30 kV for electricity from new power plants were
20 percent lower than the base case price: i.e., 33 fen/kWh in 1994 prices;
(b)   the project were to experience a cost overrun of 26 percent;
(c)   the power plant operation were reduced to 5,160 hours (59 percent capacity
factor) per year;
(d)   fuel costs were 70 percent higher than the base case; and
(e)   the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of 29 months.
34.   However, as described below, these occurrences are unlikely because EPH has a very
good record in project implementation, the economic assumptions considered in the base case
are very conservative, and the financial covenants of the project would ensure that prices are
high enough to meet the financial and economic viability requirements.



- 10-
35.   The project has also significant environmental benefits. It improves the efficiency of
the generation system and reduces the average coal consumption by about 14 g/kWh.
Reduction in coal consumption amounts to more than 1.4 million tons in 2003, the year after
full commissioning of the plant. With development of Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project
(Ln. 3727-CHA), most of Henan's hydropower potential would have been exploited and the
only alternative to Qinbei would be smaller and less efficient coal-fired units. The electricity
conservation component will help EPH in identifying and testing the most promising
technology to tap the important potential of electricity conservation in the province. Studies
carried out by EPH showed that the implementation of an aggressive conservation program
would alleviate power shortages and reduce the required generation capacity by 1,200 MW
over the next seven years.
36.   Risks. All proposed technologies are currently in successful use in China. Cost
overrun risks have been minimized by a very conservative cost estimate and advanced
procurement action; bids for major components have been prepared before loan negotiations
and issued prior to Board presentation. The risk of delay in project construction due to project
management shortcomings is minimal because of experience gained during the
implementation of the Jiaozuo and Yanshi projects, the timely staffing and training of
personnel of the Qinbei implementation unit, and the assistance provided by experienced
international engineering consultants. The risk of nonperformance in the environmental and
resettlement areas has been addressed by the establishment of appropriate monitoring
organizations and procedures and close cooperation with ADB, which will provide special
technical assistance to improve EPH's capability to monitor coal quality and strengthen the
capability of the provincial/municipal environment bureaus in monitoring and enforcing
environmental rules and regulations. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses show that even in case
of implementation of more stringent environmental standards requiring future installation of
Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) equipment, the project would remain economically viable.
37.   Delay in implementing power sector reforms in an efficient and timely manner
represents a risk that can jeopardize the progress toward more openness and efficiency of the
sector and more fiscal and managerial autonomy of EPH. This risk is minimized by the
strong commitment of the Chinese to reform both at the central and provincial levels. This
risk is also addressed through the proposed provision of technical assistance and adequate
monitoring of implementation of the agreed reform plan during project implementation.
38.   The economic and financial risks would be minimal. In view of advanced preparatory
works, risks associated with project construction, cost overruns, and implementation delays
are within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed supervision and involvement of
competent consultants. Particular attention will be given to the safety aspects of the project,
and to capability and performance of major contractors.



39.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b)  Credit fully disbursed.
