CHINA
HENAN (QINBEI) THERMAL POWER PROJECT (LOAN 3980-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Henan (Qinbei) Thermal
Power Project in China, for which Loan 3980-CHA in the amount of US$ 440 million equivalent
was signed on January 23, 1997 and made effective on April 17, 1997. The project was not
implemented as the entire loan was canceled on December 12, 1997 at the request of the
Borrower, owing to differences of opinion in the procurement of major equipment for the
proposed power plant. No disbursement was made from the loan.
The project was designed to ease the power shortage in the Henan province and, at the
same time, support major institutional and financial reform in the sector with the aim of putting
Henan's power sector on a commercial footing. The proposed physical investments included: (a)
a generation component comprising the installation by the Electric Power of Henan (EPH) of two
coal-fired generating units, each of 600 MW capacity, to provide reliable and economical supply
of electricity in the region; (b) a transmission component to accommodate the new generation
with 165 km of 500 kV transmission lines to improve the quality and reliability of supply, and
reduce the supply-side losses; and (c) an electricity conservation component to accelerate the
implementation of electricity conservation measures by supporting economically and financially
viable projects. Significant progress was achieved in the implementation of the power sector
reform plan and excellent preparation was made for the energy efficiency project component;
however, none could be pursued to the end because of the loan cancellation.
This ICR was prepared by Mihir Mitra (Consultant, Power Engineer), with the assistance
of Noureddine Berrah, Task Manager, and reviewed by Yoshihiko Sumi, Sector Manager,
Energy and Mining Sector Unit, and Yukon Huang, Director, China.
The ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report (No.15002-CHA), the Loan and Project
Agreements, correspondences between the Bank and the Borrower, Back-to-Office Report of the
two supervision missions, and internal Bank memoranda. A draft copy of this report was sent to
the Borrower with request for comments and Borrower's contribution to the ICR; however, none
was received.

HENAN (QINBEI) THERMAL POWER PROJECT (LOAN 3980-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A. Introduction
1.    Henan Province, the selected location of the proposed Qinbei thermal power plant, is the
most populous (following the creation of Chongqing Municipality in March 1997), yet one of the
less developed provinces in China. At project appraisal, the provincial power sector was beset
with acute shortages and serious problems resulting from frequent load shedding (84,000 times or
240/day in 1994) and severe limitations imposed on industrial consumers.
2.    In line with Bank-wide policy, the Bank's energy assistance program in China placed
special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. The lending program for the Henan
(Qinbei) Thermal Power Project, therefore, focused on the one hand on assistance for detailed
aspects of implementation of power sector reforms, and -on the other on reducing the power
shortages that continued to hamper development of the sector.
3.     Because of large coal deposits, coal-fired thermal generation commands a major share of
total power generation in China. The loan for the two, 600 MW coal-fired units, amounting to
US$ 440 million equivalent, was signed on January 23, 1997, and made effective on April 17,
1997. While the institutional reform agenda and preparations for implementing the energy
efficiency component proceeded extremely well, differences arose between the Bank and the
Borrower during the procurement phase of the two major components of the proposed plant,
namely, the boilers and turbine-generators. The differences relative to the turbine-generators
were reconciled satisfactorily in the end; however, those in the evaluation of boilers could not be
compromised. (See implementation experience for details.) As the Bank expressed its inability
to concur with the contract award recommendation for the boilers, the Borrower requested on
December 12, 1997 for the entire loan amount to be canceled. The Bank canceled the loan with
effect from the same date.
B. Project Objectives
4.     The main objectives of the project were to: (a) reduce the acute power shortages and
foster integrated development of the power system of Henan Province in the most cost-effective
and environmentally sound manner; (b) support adequate implementation of power sector and
power enterprise reforms and accelerate the transition of EPH to a legally and financially
autonomous and business-oriented company, in line with the Company Law (recently enacted
during project preparation); (c) assist in transferring new power technologies and in applying
modem power operation/ maintenance methods; (d) support improvements in the efficiency of
electricity use; and (e) contribute to rationalization of power tariffs. During project preparation,
the Beneficiary (EPH) demonstrated full commitment to the objectives of the project and assisted
in identifying performance indicators and critical success factors to ensure the achievement of
these agreed objectives.

C. Implementation Experience and Results
5.     Reform Agenda. In line with the key objective of using the project as a vehicle to assist
and facilitate the corporate restructuring of EPH and its affiliate enterprises, promote a more open
sector structure, and initiate competition at the generation level, EPH prepared and agreed to
implement a package of sector and enterprise-related reforms, consisting of appropriately
sequenced, time-bound actions. The main elements of the implementation plan were: (a)
incorporation of EPH as a limited liability company; (b) separation of government and enterprise
functions; (c) commercialization of operations; (d) tariff reform; and (e) power sector
restructuring. The Qinbei Electric Power Company (QEPC) was established as a limited liability
company, as a first step, under the new Company Law, during project preparation itself. QEPC
was established with the mandate to construct and operate the proposed Henan (Qinbei) Thermal
Power Project. Equity shares of the company were held by four different investors, with EPH
being designated as the organization responsible for overall project coordination and liaison with
the World Bank.
6.     The project also included a comprehensive technical assistance component to assist EPH
with all aspects of its reform efforts, which included: (a) an institutional strengthening component
directed at organizational restructuring and modernization of its financial management and
administrative practices; (b) a comprehensive package of legal services to assist in
corporatization, and preparation of the necessary contractual documents for sector restructuring;
and (c) assistance in developing an appropriate tariff structure and transition plan to achieve the
agreed financial targets.
7.     Significant progress was achieved in the implementation of the reform agenda. EPH had
established a working group comprising senior officials of the company to manage the reform
process. It hired international consultants to assist in designing a comprehensive reform
implementation plan and carrying out a tariff study. A model power purchase agreement was
developed, EPH's administrative responsibilities were clearly defined and were ready to be
transferred to the concerned provincial authority(ies) in accordance with the power sector reform
schedule at the central level, more management autonomy was granted to subsidiary companies,
several joint venture power projects were finalized, including one based on limited international
bidding procedure (as required by the Bank) which resulted in increasing private sector
involvement in power generation, and prices were unified in several prefectures and cross
subsidies notably reduced paving the way to a full unification and more supply cost based tariffs
in 1998. EPH deserves full credit for achieving such commendable progress on the reform
agenda.
8.     Site Preparation. EPH  took timely steps to acquire the land for the proposed power
plant. The site was virgin land, uninhabited and uncultivated, with no adverse social or economic
impact. As a result, there was no resettlement issue. Site leveling, construction power and water
supply, communication systems, access and in-site roads and culverts, 80 percent of the
foundation work for the railway spur, including bridges, the main office building as well as
associated facilities were completed by June 1997, as reported by the first supervision mission.
EPH also moved to the new office building to be physically close to the project site. A sum of
about 125 million RMB, or an equivalent of US$15 million, had been spent for all these front
end preparations.

9.     Procurement. As long-lead items, the procurement of boiler island and turbine island
contracts, under international competitive bidding procedures, was envisaged to proceed in
parallel with project loan processing. A firm of international consultants was appointed to assist
EPH in prebid meetings, bid clarification process, bid evaluation, bid evaluation report
preparation, contract negotiations, coordination of design interfaces, review of drawings, design
liaison and construction management. EPH performed an exemplary task of finalizing the
preliminary engineering and design of the power plant as well as complete specifications for the
boilers and turbine generators. A cost estimate for the various components of the plant and an
agreed implementation schedule were developed. Bidding documents for the boilers and the
turbine generators were prepared, and reviewed and approved by the Bank. A prebid meeting
was held with interested bidders and bidding documents for both packages were issued on
December 21, 1995. Bids were opened April 26, 1996 and evaluated. The Bid Evaluation
Report was submitted to the Bank on March 21, 1997. In accordance with this evaluation, Harbin
Power Engineering (HPE) of China was the lowest evaluated bidder for both bid packages.
10.   The qualification requirements for both packages were that the equipment manufacturers,
or their agents authorized to sell the products, "shall have designed and furnished at least two (2)
600 MW units or larger equipment which have been in successful operation for at least three (3)
years. The successful operation shall mean the operation under design load with high degrees of
reliability and availability." Even though not specifically defined in the bidding documents, the
high degree of reliability and availability is internationally recognized as operation at a minimum
of 80 percent capacity factor and 70% availability. However, based on information furnished by
all interested bidders and assessment by EPH, Harbin Power Engineering, prima facie, was
deemed qualified to bid.
11.    A total of 9 bids were received for the turbine island and 8 bids for the boiler island.
HPE's bids, as read out at bid opening, were the lowest. While bid evaluation was in progress,
the Executive Director's office raised questions on HPE's qualification on the ground that HPE
was a government-owned company and, therefore, should be disqualified in accordance with
Clause 1.8(c) of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. These guidelines state that: "Government-
owned enterprises in the Borrower's country may participate only if they can establish that they
(i) are legally and financially autonomous and (ii) operate under commercial law. No dependent
agency of the Borrower or sub-Borrower under a Bank-financed project shall be permitted to bid
or submit a proposal for the procurement of goods or works under the project." The Bank
sought clarifications from EPH on this issue, and reviewed Harbin's Charter, annual reports and
audited financial accounts. The documents helped establish the fact that HPE was indeed a
legally and financially autonomous corporation, being operated under commercial law. Based on
this finding, HPE's bids were determined as acceptable for evaluation. However, questions were
raised on whether Harbin satisfied the post qualification requirements, as enumerated in para. 10
above. It appeared that the equipment offered in the bids were significantly different in design
from the units cited as reference units in support of Harbin's experience. To obtain a fair
assessment, therefore, the Bank requested that EPH's international consultants provide an
independent opinion on the winning bid, specifically relative to the bidder's qualifications and
experience to perform the contract.
12.   Turbine Island. Of 9 bids received, the Bid Evaluation Committee found 2 bids
incomplete and rejected them. The committee found the HPE bid as complete. The three lowest
qualified bids, based on read-out prices (corrected for arithmetical errors, if any) were taken up
for detailed evaluation. Harbin's bid was evaluated as the lowest.



-4 -
13.    HPE, at bid opening, had manufactured only three, 600 MW units; two at the Pingwei
station and one at Harbin (unit no. 3). However, only the Pingwei units were cited as reference
units in the bid for the purpose of postqualification. Detailed examination of the features of the
turbines offered by HPE revealed that the specific turbines offered in the bid were significantly
different from those cited as reference units. The proposed turbines indicated extensive design
modifications, which included a new profile for the steam path, different integral shroud blades,
and modified technology for the control reaction stage in the high pressure turbine. The
intermediate pressure and low pressure turbines also indicated similar changes. Additionally, the
last two stages of the low pressure turbine blades had been redesigned.
14.   It transpired that the design changes were necessitated by the unsatisfactory performance
of the Pingwei units during commissioning and the initial period of their operation. Their
performance was nowhere near the international standard for reliability and availability
mentioned earlier (para. 10). With all the changes made to the Pingwei turbines, there was not
enough operating experience to satisfy the requirements of Para. 10. It was concluded, therefore,
that the turbines offered in the bid did not have the required performance history to provide
confidence in their design integrity or performance reliability. Based on their independent
review, the international consultants also came to the same conclusion. As HPE did not satisfy
the qualification requirements, the Bank recommended that the contract award be made to the
next lowest evaluated bidder, the difference in the evaluated price amounting to about US$ 18
million. After protracted exchange of correspondences, EPH finally agreed with the Bank's
recommendation and wrote the Bank officially to approve the award of contract to the second
lowest evaluated bidder. The Bank sent its no objection letter to EPH on October 1, 1997.
15.   Boiler Island. Of a total of 8 bids received, the Bid Evaluation Committee found 3 bids
incomplete and rejected them. The committee also accepted the HPE bid, lowest in price as read
out at bid opening, as complete. The next two bids, in ascending order of prices, were also taken
up for detailed evaluation.
16.    HPE, in their bid, offered a boiler that had design characteristics significantly different
from those of the reference units. The coal pulverizers offered were of different design and the
coal pipe configuration extremely unusual and cumbersome, without any industry precedence.
According to the bid proposal, HPE offered three (3) coal pulverizers of a certain type. Even
though this satisfied the requirements of the technical specifications which called for"no more
than six pulverizers per unit", the arrangement proposed was not consistent with industry practice
for a 600 MW unit. When questioned by the committee for supporting evidence, Harbin could
not provide any reference of 600 MW units with only three mills. The bid evaluation committee
as well as the international consultants did not think the number of mills and the arrangement
proposed guaranteed adequate reliability and flexibility in plant operation. During bid evaluation,
EPH raised these concerns and suggested major changes in the design, which included raising the
number of pulverizers to six (6) per unit. EPH also recommended pulverizers of a preferred,
foreign design. Harbin promptly agreed to substitute the pulverizers with those of the preferred
design and the desired number of mills per unit, for a price increase of US$ 9.9 million equivalent
for the two units. Additionally, in their original bid, HPE had forgotten to include the price of
Boiler Water Circulating Pumps in their bid, even though the pumps were listed in the Equipment
List. When asked to clarify, HPE admitted that this was an oversight on their part and required
the price of the bid to be adjusted upwards by another US$ 3.4 million equivalent for the required
number of pumps.

17.    Bank's procurement guidelines stipulate that, during the bid clarification process, if a bid
is not substantially responsive, it should be rejected and that it may not subsequently be made
responsive by the Bidder by correction of the non-conformity (ITB 32.6). Also, the Guidelines
for Procurement mandate that during the clarification process, no change in the price or substance
of the bid shall be offered, sought or permitted (Clause 2.45). These guidelines were clearly
violated during the evaluation process.
18.   Violations of the evaluation procedure notwithstanding, since the design offered in the
original bid was not supported by the required operating experience, Bank concluded that
Harbin's bid did not satisfy the postqualification requirements enumerated in para. 10 in this case
also. Bank therefore, recommended that the contract award for the boilers be made to the next
lowest evaluated bidder. As evaluated, Harbin's bid price was about US$ 50 million equivalent
cheaper than that of the second lowest. There were, therefore, questions as to whether HPE had
grossly underquoted their price and whether they would be able to perform the contract. EPH
continued to contest the Bank's recommendation. However, since no new information was
provided to warrant a fresh review of the case, it was not possible for the Bank to revise its
decision. To facilitate conclusion, Bank informed EPH on October 8, 1997 that Bank's decision
was final and could not be changed. On December 12, 1997, the Ministry of Finance requested
the Bank to cancel the loan. The Bank expressed disappointment at this decision and regretfully
canceled the loan with effect from the same date. The chronology of events concerning the two
procurements is tabulated in Table 8.
19.   Energy Conservation Component TA. As part of the preparation of the proposed
project, EPH carried out, with the assistance of Beijing Economic Research Institute (BERI), an
integrated resource planning exercise. The study highlighted the economic benefits of electricity
conservation investments and showed that the implementation of an aggressive electricity
conservation program could alleviate electricity shortages and reduce the required generation
capacity by 1,200 MW over the next seven years. It also indicated that, over the same period,
coal consumption for power generation could be reduced by 10 million tons. The potential and
identified technologies were reviewed and confirmed by international consultants during project
appraisal.
20.    Given EPH's strong interest in electricity conservation, the project included a $10 million
loan component to: (a) develop pilot/demonstration projects aimed at reducing electricity
consumption through introduction of state-of-the-art technologies, such as variable speed drive
motor control systems, low loss transformers, high efficiency welding machines, etc.; b)
implement a pilot/demonstration project of power loss reduction in the urban distribution
system'; (c) demonstrate the viability of innovative commercially-based contractual and
financing mechanisms; and (d) develop adequate monitoring procedures and test new market-
oriented approaches, especially performance contracting and leasing, to speed up the
implementation of electricity conservation projects.
21.    The Bank arranged for two US$ 90,000 equivalent (total of US$180,000) TA program
financed by the Canadian Trust Fund to: (a) help prepare for the creation of the Henan First
EPH also prepared terms of reference to optimize supply and reduce losses in Zhengzhou,
capital of Henan Province. It was agreed that an international consultant would be engaged
to finalize the TOR



Energy Efficiency Service Company (HFEESC), with a clearly defined business plan; (b) assist
HFEESC in developing a business plan; (c) assess the economic and financial viability of the first
projects to be included in the energy efficiency component; and (d) training on energy efficiency
nuances of HFEESC staff during the assignment. EPH staff also received training under the
program to conduct energy efficiency business. Subsequently, HFEESC initiated the selection of
the projects to be included in the electricity conservation component based on the following
principles: financial and economic profitability, measurability, technical innovation, and
replicability. Significant steps were taken by the company in implementing these pioneering
initiatives to develop energy conservation schemes on a for-profit commercial basis.
22.    With EPH's active support, HFEESC completed a significant amount of preparatory
work to launch the energy conservation initiative. Based on three reports, two by consultants and
one by the Engineer, several project components, including the procurement of Variable Speed
Drives for industrial applications, the upgradation of facilities at the Luoyang Steel Plant, more
efficient welding machines, high efficiency distribution transformers, as well as the Zhengzhou
City Loss Reduction Component optimizing the operation of the distribution network and
demand management, were selected for implementation. The steel plant program was later
dropped because the procurement packages were not prepared according to Bank procurement
guidelines. The Bank is exploring options to continue assisting EPH in the implementation of
this program under another ongoing Bank project.
D. Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Lessons Learned
23.    Summary of Findings. Procurement under Bank-financed projects has become one of
the most difficult problems in China, particularly in thermal generation projects.  Loose
interpretation of the Bank's guidelines, combined with the pressure exerted by domestic
manufacturers on the beneficiaries, results in unusually long bid evaluation periods and
consequent delays in the effectiveness of projects. This is also becoming a major problem with
the Bank's Board. It is obvious that a massive effort on procurement training should be
undertaken, as soon as possible, to train new officers and to refresh and update the knowledge
base of the existing cadre in China so that Bank's procurement guidelines are followed
assiduously. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that there is a massive turnover of
officers in the Government departments, as well as in the tendering companies.
24.    Procurement procedures, as agreed during loan negotiations, are included in the legal
documents. For the specific project, therefore, these agreed procedures become binding on all
parties. Specifically, evaluation of bids are required to be performed strictly in accordance with
the provisions of the bidding documents. In this case, divergence in the bid evaluation results
arose because of the difference in the interpretation of the bid specifications concerning the
qualification criteria.
25.    A perception seems to prevail that there is more room for interpretation of procurement
guidelines than there actually is. As a matter of policy, the Bank's interest as a cooperative
institution, is in giving all eligible bidders from developed and developing countries an
opportunity to compete in providing goods and works financed by the Bank. This needs to be
ensured with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency without regard to
political or other non-economic influences or considerations (Article 1.2). The broadest possible
competition while assuring the critical performance or other requirements for the goods and/or
works under procurement will bring maximum  benefit to the beneficiary.  Loss of this



- 7 -
fundamental perspective, rendering the evaluation process to a negotiation of the application of
procurement guidelines, led to the unfortunate impasse and eventual loan cancellation. The
Bank's rejection of EPH's recommendation for boiler award after EPH followed the Bank's
suggestion for turbine award seems to have been perceived as a rigid position rather than a
justified decision strictly based on adequate application of procurement procedures and post
qualification criteria, clearly spelled out in the bidding documents.
26.    The episode suggests whether or not two-stage bidding procedure should be mandated
for the procurement of major pieces of equipment. Since this procedure entails prequalification
of all prospective bidders, it takes more time. In the case of Qinbei, there was a danger that this
would further delay project implementation. Even single-stage procurement in China, with post
qualification of bidders, is taking almost two years to finalize, with the bid evaluation process
itself taking more than one year. Procurement being as important as it is, due attention should be
given to considerations of economy and efficiency without regard for political or other non-
economic influences or considerations.
27.    Future Operations. A high level meeting was held in China on January 23, 1998,
between the Chinese government officials and the Bank to discuss the unsatisfactory project
outcome. This was followed by a high level interaction between the Bank's Procurement
Advisors and officials of the Chinese Government to discuss, inter alia, the procurement
problems encountered on this project. Much was made out of our past successful collaboration
and it was hoped that this was an isolated problem. It was also pointed out that some of the
provisions of recently issued MOF Procurement Guidelines seemed to contradict the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. It was apparent that these guidelines should be carefully reviewed by
the Bank as soon as possible and the contradictions fleshed out. Nevertheless, past successful
collaboration between China and the Bank clearly demonstrates the need to intensify our dialogue
to remove uncertainties among all parties concerned and adequately address procurement issues
to ensure continued cooperation between the Bank and the Chinese Government in the successful
implementation of the Bank's energy policy in China as enumerated in the CAS.
28.    Lessons Learned.
(a)    Procurement being the single most important operation in loan administration, it is
extremely important for the Bank to ensure that the knowledge base on the Bank's procurement
guidelines in the Borrower's country is maintained at the highest level at all times. In the shorter
term, procurement workshops are organized to acquaint project beneficiaries with Bank
Procurement Guidelines and Procedures at the early stages of project preparation. In the longer
term, there is a proposal to establish procurement training courses in Chinese universities. The
universities, in turn, will offer this training on a continuing basis.  This initiative will be
supported by the Bank in the earlier years of its implementation.
(b)    To ensure best practice in procurement processing, the Bank needs not only to perform a
careful review of all documents, but also wide consultation involving external
technical/procurement staff, as necessary. This approach has been very helpful in developing a
consensus during the review of the evaluation of the project by the Bank. The external
consultant's independent opinion also played a central role in reaching a decision.
(c)    Procurement efficiency can only be ensured if project implementation is done with due
diligence and without extraneous considerations.
