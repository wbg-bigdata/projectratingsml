URBAN REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
Introduction
2
1.01      Mauritius is a small island of 2,000 km , and in 1979 had a popula-
tionI of about one million, with a GNP per capita of US$1,040. Almost 60%
of all land is under sugar cultivation, the dominant sector of the economy
in terms of output, exports, employment and as a source of savings. The
importance of sugar to the economy means that little of this land will become
available for urbanization. Excluding it (and other undevelopable land such
as mountains) yields very high gross densities of about 25 persons per acre.
Further pressure on urban land and services is evidenced by continued, albeit
slow, population growth and rapid industrial growth in export processing
during the 1970s. Continued and increased pressure will occur because of an
inescapable requirement to provide industrial jobs. Labor force growth rates
of 3.3% will continue until about 1985 when they should begin to decline,
reflecting successful family planning efforts which began to take hold in
the mid-1960s and have brought population growth to less than 2% per year.
1.02      The task of providing for increased demand for urban serviced land
is set amid generally unfavorable economic conditions, likely to prevail over
the medium term. During the last decade the country has made notable achieve-
ments in terms of economic growth and the provision of social services. As
a result of high world sugar prices and a rapid industrial expansion through
promotion of export processing, the Government of Mauritius (GOM) established
an impressive program of social services including free and universal primary
education, free secondary education, food and water subsidies, and relatively
high levels of health delivery. But these programs continue to demand high
expenditure, which in the face of a relative decline in sugar and export
earnings is now creating large government deficits and severe balance of
payments difficulties. Strong trade unions and rapid inflation also have
reduced much of the country's competitiveness in export processing although
recently, and especially since devaluation in October 1979, real wages have
fallen. Over the medium term the main priorities are to reduce the GOM
deficit and provide industrial employment in export processing or import
substituting production. Both these issues touch on urbanization importantly.
1.03      Unemployment stood at about 23,000 in October 1979 (7.6% of the
tota:L labor force) with new entrants coming in at about 12,000 per annum.
Employment opportunities for these new entrants must be spearheaded by
manufacturing enterprises rather than in agriculture or government.  This
will involve promotional and structural adjustment on a national scale.
Programs already exist, through the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) 1/
and through the State Commercial Bank for promotion of small-scale industries.

Sector Background
1.04      Based on current administrative definitions of urban and rural, the
country is already well urbanized. Fifty percent of the population live in
five municipalities which together constitute the conurbation of Port Louis -
Plaines Wilhems. Besides sugar, practically all employment is accounted for
by non-farm activity: manufacturing, government and services account for 70%
of the employed labor force.
1.05      A relatively high standard of living and a widespread availability
of urban and social services narrows the difference between the urban and
rural sectors. The smallness of the island and a dense road network mean
that no one is more than a few miles from an urban center.
1.06      In fact, the major difference between urban and rural is adminis-
trative and financial rather than functional, geographical or economic.
Urban defined areas are administered by the six municipalities of Port Louis,
Vacoas-Phoenix, Beau Bassin, Rose Hill Quatre Bornes and Curepipe who alone
have independent revenue authority or expenditure responsibility. In the
rest of the island three district councils administer, but they are totally
dependent on annual appropriations for revenues as no property or betterment
taxes can be levied (para. 1.21).
1.07      The 120,000 or so new entrants to the labor market over the next
decade must almost all be employed in industrial enterprises and will demand
provision of urban serviced land, housing and related services. There is,
however, no institutional capacity, either in the public or private sector,
to implement land development on the required scale.
Income Distribution and Poverty 1/
1.08      Average family monthly income in Mauritius is Rs 2,772 (US$366) with
a median of Rs 960 (US$127). Family income distribution is highly skewed as
shown in Table 1: the top 9% receive almost 40% of income. Absolute poverty
family monthly income is about Rs 500 (US$66), covering 12% of families, and
relative poverty is around Rs 770 (US$102) covering a third of all households--
low levels by East African standards. GOM programs have done much to mitigate
the worst effects of poor income distribution: measures such as rent control,
consumption subsidies on rice and water, although not income specific, have
certainly meant that on the whole shelter and services are widespread and
relatively accessible to the poor. Nutrition and health standards are high
and universal primary free education has allowed more than 90% literacy and
a skilled labor force.
1/   Monetary figures are at 1979 predevaluation rate.  To get 1980 figures,
multiply by a factor of 1.3 to allow for inflation and devaluation.

Housing
1.09      Mauritius invests heavily in housing (about 12% of GNP) both by
the private (80%) and public (20%) sectors. Official production peaked at
6,000 units per year (including cyclone affected), compared to an estimated
demand of around 9,000 units. The bulk of housing is financed out of private
savings or commercial bank loans which are inaccessible to the poor. Poor
families who acquire land often find the rate at which they can build limited
to their current saving capacity rather than by their debt servicing capacity.
No formal credit is available for home improvement or extension. These
problems are exacerbated by rent control legislation which allows no rent to
rise beyond its initial level for any given tenant and has resulted in little
or no maintenance, improvement or extension to the low income rental stock.
About 40% of the urban stock is affected and subjected to accelerated depre-
ciation. Furthermore rent control has introduced serious distortions to
the housing market pushing all new development to high income housing to
the obvious detriment of the poor. GOM is aware of the need to amend the
legislation, has discussed it with the Bank and has appointed a ministerial
committee to look into this. GOM will continue to consult with the Bank on
this matter (para. 7.02(e)).



-4-
1-10      Lying in the midst of a cyclonic area, Mauritius is subject to
periodic devastation. Severe cyclones hit in 1960, 1975, and 1979-1980 and
damaged or wiped out a lot of housing and infrastructure. In the past there
have been cyclone relief programs, primarily providing for finished and
serviced housing, which was passed on at heavily subsidized rentals to cyclone
victims. Not only have these programs been extremely expensive for Government
but production by the Central Housing Authority (CHA), the responsible agency,
has been nowhere near target. For example, of an original 1975 cyclone relief
program of 8,000 houses, only 2,000 had been completed by the end of 1979 and
completion of a further 4,000 is now expected by 1982 (Annex 2).
1.11      Public sector expenditures comprise capital budget contributions to
the CHA and additional contributions to cover the operating losses it accrues.
GOM also provides long-term loans to the Mauritius Housing Corporation (MHC)
(Annex 1). The CHA program is subsidized because CHA is inefficient as a
building contractor and because its houses have been passed on at very low
rentals. GOM recently moved to reduce housing subsidies (but not to eliminate
them) through a policy of sale of CHA units rather than rental, and a policy
of providing unsubsidized loans through MHC. Also, given the present con-
strained economic situation, the proportion of current investment devoted to
housing needs to be reduced and redirected. GOM is aware of all these issues
and has adopted a housing policy within the general framework of the "Two Year
Plan for Economic and Social Development" and in "Toward a Structural Readjust-
ment of the Mauritius Economy" of October 1980. This policy is considered
realistic under the present circumstances. In summary, GOM intends to reduce
public housing investment by about 30% to no more than Rs 100 (US$13.2)
million. The policy includes a phased reduction of CHA operations over time
and consolidation and expansion of MHC as a housing financial intermediary.
CHA will mainly be used to provide extremely basic low cost housing at an
appropriate level of subsidy to those who cannot afford shelter from other
sources (about the lowest 20% of the households). CHA's budget would be
reduced from Rs 80 (US$10.6) million to Rs 25 (US$3.3) million from FY81
to FY84 and MHC loans and equity would be increased from Rs 20 (US$2.6)
million to Rs 75 (US9.9) million during the same period, all in constant 1980
prices (para. 5.05).
1.12 1/   With regard to the private sector GOM would try to reduce private
housing investment by about 25% to no more than Rs 400 (US$53) million in
the period 1981/84 by discouraging building through a series of monetary and
fiscal measures of which details are being worked out. However it appears
that private sector housing investment is falling sharply due to reduced
liquidity of the private sector in the recent months.
1.13      Established in 1963, MHC is a parastatal organization reporting
to the Ministry of Finance and is the only specialized mortgage institution
in the country. The corporation is governed by a 9-member board of directors,
of which 7 members are drawn from the business community at large, while the
remaining two are from GOM. It is an efficient organization and has an
excellent record of collections. Its policies, administration and financial
structure are described in Chapter V.

Urban Services
1.14      Water: 99% of the population has access to piped clean water. In
19722, 25% were serviced by individual connections and 56% were within 100
meters of a public hydrant. Current estimates indicate that about 50-60% are
now served by house connections, accounting for about 85% of domestic consump-
tion, the balance being from hydrants.  Water, its provision, maintenance and
management, is the responsibility of the Central Water Authority (CWA) and
unti:L 1979 was heavily subsidized. GOM now has raised potable water tariffs
drastically in a first step toward pricing water services on sound financial
and economic bases. Recurrent expenses are no longer subsidized and with
additional tariff adjustments over the next few years, CW7A's net operating
reverLues should gradually reach levels adequate to meet amortization and
interest costs and contribute to new investments. There has been considerable
public dissatisfaction with the new tariffs, but although the best means of
charging is still being sought, the principle of charging economic tariffs
is now accepted.
1.15         Sewerage and Sanitation.  Mauritius has two public sewerage
systems, serving about 20% of the total population, which are the responsi-
bility of the Ministry of Works (MW) Sewerage Division. 1/ The Port Louis
system serves an estimated 50% of that municipality's population and the
Plaines Wilhems system serves about 40% of the population of the other prin-
cipal urban areas. There are several smaller sewer systems serving housing
estates, resorts and institutions and which utilize waste stabilization pond
treatment methods.
1.16      Sanitation for the balance of 75% to 80% of the country's population
is provided by various types of individual facility: septic tanks with
absorption pits or leaching fields; cesspits, pit latrines; and conservancy
(bucket latrine) systems. The conservancy systems, once widespread, are being
phasecl out mainly because of the dwindling supply of labor for this type of
work. The major part of the population is served by pit latrines of various
types, the standards of which are generally satisfactory. The Ministry of
Health's Transport Section has some equipment which it uses for emptying
cesspits, septic tanks and pit latrines.
1.17      Revenues for sewerage and sanitation services are very low and the
sector is heavily subsidized; these tariffs are under review by GOM. In 1975,
the last year for which we have fairly complete data, total revenues were
about Rs 0.7 (US$0.09) million while costs of operation and maintenance of the
Port Louis and Plaine Wilhems sewerage systems alone was nearly Rs 3 (US$0.4)
million. At the same time capital investments in sewerage, totally financed
by the GOM, are considerable. The 1975-80 plan provided for a total of
Rs 105 (US$13.9) million, not including costs of the individual systems.
1/   Legislation establishing CWA in 1971 included a provision for it to take
over sewerage as well as water supply. However, the transfer is being put
of-f until such time as CWA is developed to the point where it could cope
with this additional responsibility.



-6-
Nearly 90% of sector revenue is from sewerage rates, which are a small per-
centage of the rental value of the properties served. The balance of the
revenue is from pit-emptying and bucket latrine services. GOM has agreed
to carry out a study, by October 31, 1982, of the costs of investments in,
and operations of its sewerage system and on the basis thereof, exchange
views with the Bank on a proposed tariff structure designed progressively
to reduce subsidies on such service (para. 7.02(j)).
1.18      Solid Waste Management.  Collection and disposal of solid waste
is the responsibility of local authorities. However, this is essentially
an urban related service and the most serious problems are being faced in
Port Louis with a large resident and daytime population and concentration of
commercial, and industrial activities including the port. Only 50% of the
estimated garbage generated in the Port Louis area is now collected and
disposed of. The remainder is dispersed on streets, verges, drains and on
other open spaces contributing to environmental and public health problems
and to malfunctioning of other services such as drainage, roads and sewerage.
Municipalities are unable to undertake the necessary investment required to
provide adequate solid waste management because of their restricted access to
capital and revenues, the majority of which now comes from central government
in the form of annual subventions. GOM expects to carry out a study in 1981,
with French technical assistance, which would focus on the long-term management
of solid waste throughout the island and would recommend collection, disposal,
recycling and related charges.
1.19      Road Network and Public Transport.  N1auritius is served by a well
developed network of roads having about 1,100 miles of road which radiate
from Port Louis to all parts of the island providing access to population
centers and to industrial and agricultural areas. Traffic on this network is
concentrated in the Port Louis-Curepipe corridor, where up to 20,000 vehicles
per day use the roads in Port Louis. Congestion is mainly limited to urban
areas in this corridor, being worst in the city of Port Louis, where travel is
slow throughout the day because of narrow discontinuous or converging streets,
frequent intersections, pedestrian interferences and parking and loading
conflicts. COM with the assistance of ADB intends to build a through road
to the port which should reduce traffic congestion in the Port Louis area.
Outside the corridor the volume of traffic drops quickly and roads are not
unduly congested.
1.20      Public transport in the island is provided by nine privately owned
transport companies, a number of small operators (1-3 buses), and the National
Transport Corporation. They carry about 140 million passengers annually
(about 160 rides per capita) and operate about 35 million vehicle miles.
There is a licensed fleet of about 1,200 vehicles of which only about 750
operate each day because of breakdowns, inadequate maintenance or driver
absenteeism. Age of bus fleet averages about 9.5 years and some 21% are
more than 15 years old.  Lines of credit have been made available to GOM by
the Governments of Japan and India for the procurement of buses. NTC has
recently ordered about 100 buses from Japan and private operators are using
the credits for replacement and expansion of the fleet. Principal problems
associated with the transport system include poor regulations, ill coordination



of routes, lack of policies for fare and tariff structures and level of cross-
subsidization between routes. There are long waits and queues during peak
periods, overcrowding at existing terminals, old and poorly maintained
equipment, inadequate service, inconvenient transfer arrangements and poor
labor/management relations. Frequent disputes occur between GOM and major bus
companies, who complain that government controlled bus fares u.o not keep pace
with the rising cost of fuel, materials and labor.
Urban Administration and Finance
1.21      Urban and local government is administered through five municipal
councils and three district councils. The functions of these authorities
are rather limited; only the municipal councils have power to levy tax, but
a reluctance to raise rates and rapid wage inflation has all but eradicated
its importance. In 1979/80 only 20% of total expenditure was covered by
loca.l tax income, the remainder being received from Central Government.
District councils depend entirely on Central Government. In 1978, GOM had
enacted legislation for rural tax but could not implement it, mainly because
the property in the district council areas had not been valued. Grants to
local authorities are not made on any tax or revenue specific basis and no
formulae govern revenue sharing, which has allowed little independence to the
authorities and no strategic investment planning. Total expenditure by local
authorities amounted to about Rs 102 (US$13.5) million in 1979/80, less than
about 2% of GNP, low by international standards, and therefore inadequate to
provide and maintain adequate levels of services. Besides the fact that all
non-municipal land and property escapes tax, no specific betterment charges
or user fees are levied and strict rent control legislation (para. 1.09) holds
down property values and hence tax revenue. Of the Rs 102 (US13.5) million
spent in 1979/80 only Rs 17 (US$2.2) million went through the district
councils' budgets.
1.22      As a result of these arrangements, standards of performance are
low. Local authorities cannot afford to employ the range of staff expertise
required to maintain and operate services or perform their functions. This is
an obvious area where tax reform is needed to allow higher locally generated
expenditures and reduce Central Government spending.
Planning
1.23      Continued population growth, declining household size and employment
needs will place heavy demands on the urban sector for the next 10-20 years.
Current forecasts indicate demand for urbanized land to be about 1,200 acres
per year--an expansion, in area, by 50% of existing urbanized land over the
next 10 years. Almost all expansion must occur outside the currently desig-
nated urban areas. The National Physical Development Plan (NPDP), 1/ recently
adopted in principle by GOMI, calls for concentration of this new urbanization
into three major and six minor distribution centers 2/ around the island.

-8-
NPDP provides long-term locational guidance, a set of sound land use criteria,
and a preferred terminal land use configuration. It is a good example of this
type of plan and provides invaluable physical planning (as well as economic
planning) data and set of recommendations. However, it lacks an implementatior
framework, detailed articulation of priorities, phasing, costing or implementa-
tion and maintenance responsibilities. Detailed implementation procedures for
the plan have not yet been devised and are urgently needed. Mechanisms for
the assembly and development of land, its finance and maintenance, are not
included in the Plan, (either economic or physical) and current institutions
are neither designed to nor currently capable of coordinating investment or
implementing developments on the scale required.
1.24      Land itself is a crucial constraint.  The need to maintain sugar
production seriously restricts its use, at least for the foreseeable future.
Speculation and demand pressure have produced rapidly rising land values,
faster by far than any other item in the economy. Furthermore, under present
regulations the transfer of land is time-consuming, bureaucratic and expensive.
Procedures and powers need to be streamlined to ensure steady and controlled
release of land for developmental purposes at realistic prices.
Major Issues in the Urban Sector
1.25      The scale of future urbanization which is bound to occur (controlled
or uncontrolled) and GOM's inescapable need to reduce its overall deficit
have important effects on the urban sector and will require new and specific
policies toward urban administration and finance. These include the need to
develop improved land management and release mechanisms to build a public
developer capacity, to reduce overall investment in housing, to change the
legislation controlling rents for commercial and residential property, to
find alternative financing mechanisms for urban services and to distribute
them more evenly around the island, to make improvements to the public trans-
port system, and to improve administration of the different services provided
to the urban sector.
1.26      Obvious concerns in need of early attention include housing and the
extension of credit to allow improved administration of shelter consumption,
public utility provision, maintenance and pricing, land supply and price
control mechanisms, and public transport. GOM is already embarked on reforms
in all these areas:
- in housing: by redirecting the public housing program toward
channeling credit to the poor rather than construction of
subsidized housing, and by a review of the rent legislation.
- public utility pricing: by a commitment to their provision
on a self-financing basis through user-fees, exemplified
by current efforts to reform water tariffs.
- on land: through the proposal to be contained in the
Plan, to establish a Land Bank Agency with strong powers
for acquisition and assembly.



- 9 -
- on public transport:  by the creation of a National Transport
Authority (NTA) charged with regulation, planning and
control of public transport, and expanding the publicly-owned
National Transport Corporation to provide more efficient bus
service:s in the heavily traveled Port Louis-Vacoas area.
II. THE PROJECT
Genesis of the Project
2.01      In 1977, GOM approached the Bank for assistance in housing and
urban transport. In August 1979, the Bank carried out an analysis of
the urban sector and identified possible areas of assistance followed by
feasibility studies in housing, infrastructure and transport. Between
December 1979 and March 1980, Mauritius was hit by three cyclones, causing
heavy damage to crops, housing and infrastructure. Over 1,000 families were
made homeless and were given temporary shelter in public schools which had
to be closed for months. Services in low cost housing estates were badly
damaged and created health hazards and outbreaks of typhoid. GOM requested
urgent assistance from the Bank for rehabilitation works. The Bank responded
by accelerating the project and by including in it the most urgent rehabilita-
tion needs.
Project Objectives
2.02      The project would strengthen institutions for urban planning,
development and maintenance. It would help to establish and implement sound
and replicable practices for the provision of utilities, urbanized land
and housing in existing as well as new urban areas, reducing where possible
central government budgetary support for these purposes. Other objectives
would be to:
(a) redirect housing investment by increasing the amount and
availability of credit accessible to the poor without in-
creasing the total amount of housing investment in Mauritius;
(b) reduce direct government involvement in housing construc-
tion, reduce the Central Housing Authority (CHA) housing
construction program and to eliminate over time central
government subsidies to housing;
(c) provide immediate relief, through house construction and
repair loans, to cyclone victims and to establish procedures
for future cyclone relief programs; and to upgrade and
rehabilitate existing urban services especially those
damaged by recent cyclones;



- 10 -
(d) improve the efficiency and service standards of public
transport throughout the island and strengthen transport
planning and implementation capacity of the NTA and Traffic
Management Unit (TMU) in the MW;
(e) provide a basis for implementation of the NPDP.
2.03      The project consists of:

Land Development at La Tour Koenig
2.04      Approximately 25 acres of land at La Tour Koenig, just south of
Port Louis and adjacent to the industrial estates of Coromandel 1/ and Plaine
Lauzun, would be serviced for integrated housing development. For details of
the site see para 4.01. The land on this site belongs to DBM which has agreed
1/ Financed by IDA Credit 411-MAS, 1973.



- 11 -
to sell the land for the housing component to NHC and for off-site roads and
facilities to GOM. About 740 serviced plots would be marketed, 60% of which
would be reserved for low-income families earning up to Rs 1,200 per month.
These plots would be randomly allocated to qualified applicants if demand
exceeds supply. Detailed criteria was agreed at negotiations (para. 2.05).
Provision would be made for a 17-classroom primary school for 600 pupils, a
kindergarten for 100 children and a creche for 120 babies, essential if female
residents are to fully benefit from their proximity to the industrial estates.
A market recreational area and public toilets would also be built. Layout of
the site is given in Map IBRD 15144. Services are to minimum standard and
detailed in Table IV-1. Agreement was reached during negotiations that La
Tour Koenig would be brought under the jurisdiction of an appropriate
authority for the purposes of charging rates and maintaining services (para.
7.02(f)). The component would provide valuable experience for future land
development schemes in the island.
Home Improvement and Construction Loans
2.05     Under the project a line of credit would be made available to NHC
to allow extension of its low-income lending operations and make available
formalized credit for home repair and reconstruction for cyclone victims as
well as extensions and construction of new housing. The credit is to provide
about 3,700 loans over a four-year period. Based on current estimates of
demand, about 10% of the credit and about 900 loans would be on-lent for
repairs and upgrading of houses at an average loan size of Rs 10,000 and
the remainder would go to new construction including La Tour or cyclone
recorLstruction in about 2,800 loans, distributed as shown in Table II-2.

2.06      During negotiations agreement was reached (para. 7.02(a)) on the
beneficiary selection criteria and procedures for the housing credit which
are as follows:
(a) MRC will continue to follow its own procedures with respect
to: applications for credits, processing such applications
and inspections of building activities (including work in
progress and completed construction) for housing mortgages
financed by MHC.
(b) When processing applications for housing credits, MHC will
give priority to registered cyclone victims applying for
credits prior to December 31, 1980.
(c) Not less than 50% 1/ of the amount of all housing credits
made in fiscal 1981 by MHC, 55% 1/ in fiscal 1982 and 60% 1/
in fiscal 1983, shall be made to families earning up to
Rs 1,200 2/ per month in June 1980 prices, or such other
limits and income ceilings as shall be agreed with the
Bank. Out of the balance in each year, priority will be
given to the lower income groups above Rs 1,200.
(d) The maximum amount for any housing credit made to MHC to
any beneficiary utilizing proceeds of the loan shall be
Rs 50,000 in June 1980 prices.
(e) The lending rate charged by MHC to its borrowers will vary,
but the average rate will not be less than MHC's average
cost of capital plus a margin of at least 2-1/2 percentage
points, and the lowest rate, not less than the discount
rate of the Bank of Mauritius plus a margin of 1-1/2 per-
centage points. For such purpose the following will apply:
1/   Including CHA (which provides housing for low income families) more than
60% of the public sector budget would be made available to low income
families in the years 1981/84.
2/   Existing income criteria of MHC has been used, which defines low income
group as those earning Rs 1,200/month: about 53% of the income distribu-
tion. Bank estimates urban poverty threshold at Rs 1,000/month
(Table I-1). This is based on a sample survey which is under revision.
Given the crudity of such estimation it was decided to use MHC's estab-
lished lending policies.  Therefore the project target group would be
families earning Rs 1,200 (US$158) or less per month or the lower 53% of
households. In addition the middle income group has at present little or
no access to housing credit and it was decided to include credit for them.



- 13 -
(i)  average cost of capital will be computed by dividing
the total of all interest, commissions, and other
charges payable on debt in any given year by the
average of the balances outstanding of all debt
payable, including deposits and other forms of
investors' savings, at the beginning and end of
such year; and
(ii) average rate of interest on lending operations will
be computed by dividing the total of all interest,
commmissions, and other charges receivable on out-
standing debt during any given year by the average
of the principal amounts outstanding at the beginning
and end of such year. Based on Bank of Mauritius'
discount rate of 10% at appraisal low income families
would be able to borrow at 12% per annum over a period
not exceeding 25 years and middle-high income families
at 14% per annum over a period not exceeding 20 years.
(f)  Should NMC propose to modify these procedures prior to completion
of the housing credit component of the project, it will discuss
such changes with the Bank prior to doing so.
Upgrading of QHA Estates
2.07      Services are to be rehabilitated and upgraded in four CHA estates
(Borstal, Vallijee, Roche Bois and La Cure) built in 1960 to house victims
of Cyclone "Carol." These estates have been giving a lot of trouble and
have been heavy on maintenance expenditures. During the last cyclone there
were many sewage overflows, probably the cause of a breakout of typhoid.
Under this component it is proposed to rehabilitate damaged and substandard
sewer lines and some water mains, improve and provide adequate stormwater
drainage. Solid waste collection would be improved under the solid waste
management component (para. 2.11). Lack of collection results in garbage
being dumped in the roadside drains . Households affected by the rehabilita-
tiorn total 3,170 (including adjoining areas). For detailed description see
Annex 2.
Public Transport Improvement and Traffic Management
2.08      The principal objectives of this component would be (i) to improve
the efficiency and service standard of public transport throughout the island;
arnd (ii) to design and implement a series of traffic management measures to
avoid unnecessary congestion, especially in Port Louis. An island-wide study
of public transport also would be carried out resulting in recommendations on
improved public transport, management, routing, public investment, pricing
policies and the relationship between public and private transport. No
subsidy on gasoline is provided by GOM.



- 14 -
2.09      The traffic management component in the Port Louis-Curepipe Corridor
would be over a length of 25 km (see Map IBRD 15143). It is a low cost compo-
nent and intended to improve road network capacity/increase travel speeds and
reduce vehicle operating costs. It would include, inter alia:
(a) development of one-way streets to reduce traffic conflicts
and congestion;
(b) elimination of curb parking and restriction of truck loading
and unloading in the most congested part of Port Louis;
(c) provision of reversible lanes on the main road (Plaine
Wilhems) into the capital;
(d) provision of additional off-street parking in Port Louis.
At present about 1,900 vehicles are parked in 1,500 permitted
on-street spaces during peak traffic periods;
(e) improvement of twenty-four junctions and provision of traffic
signals in the corridor; and
(f) carrying out a feasibility study and detailed engineering to
replace an existing substandard bridge of Grand River Northwest
(GRNW), which is narrow, limited to ten-ton traffic and is a
bottleneck to traffic entering Port Louis (13,500 vehicles cross
this bridge daily).
2.10      GOM is reviewing a parking policy for the central area of Port
Louis and along the main approach roads. The policy would include provisions
for parking charges (to be used to cover operating expenses and improve off-
street car parks). Existing parking regulations are inadequate and cannot
be effectively enforced. These will be reviewed, consolidated and, if
necessary, legislation would be improved or amended to enforce them. During
negotiations assurances were received that GOM would carry out a study
on parking and take all necessary action within its power to amend traffic
regulations to allow for parking charges, specify tariffs and set up a force
of traffic wardens empowered to enforce traffic regulations (para. 7.02(i)).
Solid Waste Management
2.11      The project would assist the Port Louis municipality to implement
a new and more efficient system of solid waste collection which was designed
during project preparation. It would provide a modest number of simple
vehicles, equipment and maintenance facilities, which are required to meet
immediate and urgent needs. This component was designed taking into account
the longer-term studies to be carried out in 1981 (para. 1.18). Only 50% of
solid waste generated in Port Louis daily is cleared by the Municipality.
In the industrial estates and the central business district, some private
trucks occasionally augment the service. However, most of the uncollected
garbage finds its way into empty sites, stormwater drains, and roads, thus



- 15 -
creates serious health problems and affects the functioning of other
services. The present collection system results in low productivity due to
the low ratio of equipment and multiple handling by scavengers. The present
dump is inconveniently located with respect to the southern part of the city
where the main industrial and trading areas are. This results in long
journeys and lost time through traffic delays while going through the center
of Port Louis for 32% of the garbage. A site has been identified at Les
Salines which can serve for about 5 years until a long-term solution is found
for solid waste disposal and recycling. The solid waste study (para. 1.18)
is expected to be completed in 1982. Agreement was reached with GOM during
negotiations that the recommendations of the study would be reviewed with the
Bank (para. 7.02(k)). Acquisition of an additional suitable dump would be a
condition of disbursement for this component (para. 7.01(b)).
Technical Assistance
2.12      Technical assistance would be provided to the Ministry of Economic
Planning and Development (MEPD) for National Physical Development Plan (NPDP)
implementation study (para. 2.13), to MW for the island-wide transportation
study (para. 2.08), to Ministry of Housing, Lands and Town and Country Planning
(MH) for island-wide property valuation (para.2.14), and to MHC for training
extension workers to assist in self-help/self-managed housing construction
(para. 3.07).
2.13      A NPDP has recently been adopted by GOM which now wishes to estab-
lish rachinery for its implementation (para. 1.23).  Studies on appropriate
instniments, agencies and policies are needed and their conclusions acted
upon before a coordinated strategy for urban growth, employment location
and acdministration can be realistically set in motion. For this purpose
a National Physical Development Unit would be established in the MEPD and
charged with coordination and monitoring of implementation of the NPDP.
The studies would make recommendations on priorities for development, finance,
planning and attainable annual levels of implementation and employment and
would lead to development proposals for at least one of the distribution
centers. Staffing and detailed terms of reference were agreed at negotiations
(see Annex 4).
2.14      Since district councils are not empowered to levy property, land or
betterment taxes, no property outside the municipal council areas is valued.
It is proposed to begin immediately the task of valuing this property as most
new development will take place in these areas which already experience high
value land uses. A revaluation of property in the municipalities has just
been completed with the assistance of three expatriate valuers and it is
proposed to continue the exercise to cover the whole island with technical
assistance to be included in the project. Discussions during a proposed Bank
structural adjustment loan to Mauritius would emphasize the urgency of reduc-
ing GOM's deficits. One of the conditions of this loan is likely to be that
non-municipal property be appropriately taxed.

Cost Estimates
2.15      Total project costs are estimated at Rs 185.1 (US$24.5) million
with a foreign exchange component of 63%.  Summary cost estimates are given
in Table II-3. Base cost estimates are at October 1980 prices and are based
on: (a) deLailed engineering for La Tour Koenig, (b) preliminary engineering
for the CHA rehabilitation and the traffic management component, (c) suppliers'
quotations for equipment and current costs of consulting services on other
projects in Mauritius.  Physical contingencies have been calculated at 10% on
all infrastructure and building works. No physical contingencies have been
included on housing loans, equipment, training, engineering and technical
ass4stance. Price contingencies are estimated at 15% p.a. for 1981/82 and 10%
p.a. thereafter. Foreign elements of price contingencies are based on GOM and
consultants estimates of inflation in the neighboring countries from where
goods and services are normally procured. Estimates for local inflation are
based on Bank's estimates of inflation (para. 5.01) for 1981/82 but have been
revised upwards for 1983/84 as these were considered low by GOM and consultants
for the project components. The mission reviewed these figures and considered
them realistic. Engineering, architectural services and technical assistance
are estimated to cost about US$1.9 million at an average professional staff-
month cost of about US$5,000 (US$4,500 for local consultants and US$6,500 for
expatriate consultants) for a total of 383 staff-months. Consultants and
professional staff with the necessary qualifications and experience are
available in Mauritius at this cost.
Financing
2.16      The proposed Bank loan would finance about 61% of the total project
cost.  No duties and taxes are payable on goods and services procured for the
project.  Co-financing covers about 19% of the total project cost.  Total
external financing (Bank plus co-financing) would cover 80% of total cost
including 100% of the estimated foreign exchange cost and about 45% of local
cost. Financing of a substantive portion of local costs from external sources
is proposed in view of the severe adverse movements in terms of trade and
cyclone damage which have led to constraints in GOM revenue. The Bank would
use this project as a means of assisting GOM to recover immediately from the
damages brought about by recent cyclones. Co-financing is expected to finance
home improvement and construction loans. Effectiveness of an agreement with
co-financier would be a condition of disbursement for housing credit
(para 7.01(a)).

2.17      GOM would make the proceeds of the loans (Bank and co-financing)
and its own contributions available to various government ministries and
parastatals to cover the cost of components to be implemented by them.
Budgetary allocations would be made to ministries. Funds would be onlent to
parastatals, as follows:
Amount
Institution      Component            (Rs'000)      US$
MHC              Housing loans          113,820   15,036

2.18      GOM would enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the above
institutions, satisfactory to the Bank, and this would be a condition of
disbursement for the parts of the project to be financed under each subsidiary
agreement. The terms of onlending would be at an interest rate of 10% or the
Bank of Mauritius discount rate, whichever is higher at the time of signature
of the subsidiary loan agreements and for a period of 17 years, including 4
years' grace. (para. 7.01(c)).

III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Executing Agencies
3.01      Implementation agencies were appraised and with technical assistance
being provided under the project should be able to execute project components
satisfactorily. Implementation would be carried out as follows:
3.02      The project would be coordinated by MEPD which has appointed a
project coordinator for this purpose. The coordinator would monitor the
progress of the project, provide regular progress reports to GOM and the
Bank and ensure that project execution is carried out satisfactorily. MEPD
would also coordinate preparation of NPDP studies and to assist in carrying
out this work, specialized technical assistance would be provided in the
field of urban finance and management.
3.03      MH would implement La Tour Koenig and carry out island-wide valuation
of property. For the La Tour Koenig component, MH would invite bids for the
infrastructure, community facilities and core units, if there is a demand.
It would supervise work and pay the contractors. MH has recruited a suitably
qualified and experienced civil engineer and a quantity surveyor to implement
this component. The Chief Valuer of MH would carry out valuation of all
property including setting up administration and registration procedures.
3.04      MHC would administer housing loans (including land at La Tour
Koenig), would process all applications, enter into mortgage agreements with
beneficiaries and collect repayments.
3.05      MW would implement the traffic management and public transport
component and the rehabilitation of infrastructure in the CHA estates (except
water, to be supervised through CWA). The traffic improvement component is
being designed in-house by TMU, who would carry out this work by force account.
The feasibility study of GRNW bridge would be carried out through consultants.
Design of the rehabilitation works is being carried out through consultants,
who would supervise the construction on behalf of MW/CWA. The island-wide
transport study would be carried out by NTA.
3.06      The Port Louis municipality would execute the solid waste management
component, invite bids for the equipment and award contracts. It would carry
out improvement of workshops through force account.
Training
3.07      Mauritius has considerable local manpower which should be able
to execute most of the project with specialist assistance in the fields of
engineering municipal finance and transport. The project provides for this
assistance and would ensure that local manpower would beneEit from this
technical assistance by actually participating in the implementation of the



- 20 -
project. Training courses would also be provided for extension workers of
MHC, traffic e-agineers of MW, personnel of NTA, and solid waste management
personnel of the municipalities. In-house training courses and seminars would
be given to extension workers of MHC in building techniques, to enable them to
assist beneficiaries in construction of houses and to the staff of TMU through
the planning3 design and implementation of traffic management, parking, pedes-
trian and pLblic transport priority schemes. Overseas training would be pro-
vided for two traffic engineers to strengthen and provide for effective
expansion of its activities in operation, control, and maintenance and to
three senior staff from the vehicle inspection division of the NTA to improve
its performance in controlling vehicle safety. Refresher courses and work-
shops would be provided to the staff of the municipalities to introduce an
improved system of solid waste collection and promoting greater cooperation
from the public.
Implementation
3.08      The project would take about four years to complete, as envisaged
in the Implementation Schedule WB 21923 on the next page, and would be completed by
June, 1984.
Procurement 1/
3.09      All procurement would be in accordance with Bank guidelines.  Civil
and building works for La Tour Koenig estimated at Rs 13.1 (US$1.7) million,
rehabilitation work for the CHA estates estimated at Rs 20.1 (US$2.7) million
and procurement of traffic signaling equipment estimated at Rs 8.7 (US$1.1)
million would be on the basis of international competitive bidding. The solid
waste component is small, Rs 4.1 (US$0.5) million, and unlikely to attract
suppliers from outside Mauritius and therefore this item would be procured
using local bidding procedures.
3.10      Small infrastructure works costing less than Rs 2.0 (US$0.26)
million totaling about Rs 6.0 (US$0.8) million and miscellaneous equipment,
(other than solid waste) after grouping, amounting to less than Rs 0.75
(US$0.1) million would be procured using local bidding procedures. Local
bidding procedures are satisfactory and would allow international contractors
and suppliers to bid.
3.11      Civil works and installation for the traffic management component
estimated at Rs 1.8 (US$0.24) million and building works for solid waste
management estimated at Rs 0.9 (US$0.12) million would be carried out by
force account by MW and the Port Louis Municipality respectively.
3.12      Consultant and specialist services for detailed engineering and
studies would be procured on conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
1/ Estimated costs include contingencies.

Disbursement
3.13      Bank would disburse 80% of the local cost of housing credit and of
civil and building works, 100% of the foreign cost or 80% of the local cost of
equipment and 100% of the foreign cost or 80% of the total cost of technical
assistance including consulting services. Disbursements would be fully
documented, except for housing credit expenditure and for works carried out by
force account which would be made against certificates of expenditure certified
by the Project Coordinator and subject to a satisfactory audit; documentation
for these items would not be submitted to the Bank for review but would be
retained by the Borrower and made available for inspection by the Bank during
the course of project supervision. An estimated Schedule of Disbursement is
shown in Table III-1.
3.14      To maintain the momentum of project preparation and assist victims
of cyclones, retroactive financing to cover project related expenditures
incurred after May 31, 1980 has been approved. Refinancing of the expenditures
approved under the Project Preparation Facility would also be included in the
loan. Total expenditure would be about US$2.0 million of which US$1.5 million
is recommended for retroactive financing.
Accotnts and Audits
3.15      Separate accounts would be maintained by implementing agencies who
have qualified personnel to carry out this work. Auditing is carried out
satisfactorily by the office of the Auditor General. With respect to MHC,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that unaudited accounts would be
submitted to the Bank within 6 months and audited accounts within 12 months
after the close of each financial year for the whole of their activities as
well as for the project (para 7.02(d)).
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.16      Monitoring and evaluation would be a modest exercise geared to
gathering of essential management information and analysis of the practical
problems and project impact on beneficiaries. A special effort would be
focused on key features to form an information base for future projects.
The monitoring system would highlight potential implementation problems
to enable speedy remedial action.
3.17      Each implementing agency would be responsible for routine monitoring
of its own activity and prepare a report for the Project Coordinator, who
would prepare a quarterly report for the Bank,(para 7.02(h)). MH would report
on La Tour Koenig and island-wide valuation, MHC on the housing credit, MW on
the upgrading of CHA estates and the traffic and transportation component and
MEPD on the NPDP implementation study. Agreement would be reached during
negotiations that on completion of the project, the Project Coordinator would
prepare a project completion report due no later than six months after com-
pletion of the project on the basis of an outline to be agreed with the Bank
(para. 7.02(h)).

IV. DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
La Tour Koenig
4.01      Laot. The site is a 220 acre estate located on the edge of the
Port Louis municipal boundary in close proximity to the main urban centers
of Port Louis and Beau Bassin. The site is well located with respect to
major public transport routes and centers of employment such as Coromandel
(Bank financed) and Plaine Lauzun industrial estates (Map IBRD 15143).
4.02      The preliminary layout plan for the area, prepared by a firm of con-
sultants under Australian technical assistance, proposed a target population
of 11,400 with provision for community facilities and some commercial areas.
The first phase of the development which would be funded under the project
would urbanize about 25.6 acres (12% of the site) providing 740 residential
lots and ancillary community facilities. This phase is predominantly residen-
tial, accommodating approximately 33% of the population to a relatively high
density of about 30 units per acre. These densities are higher than normal
for Mauritius and conserve scarce land resources. This has been achieved
through the use of small efficient plots with  4.6 2- 4.9 m frontages (except
for end lots which aie wider) averaging about 84 m  1/2in area.  Plot sizes
vary from about 74 m for low income families to 139 m for middle- and upper
income families. There is just over 2,740 m of paved road, approximately 3.4
m of road per plot, a relatively efficient ratio. The majority of plots have
access to vehicular roads; however, 110 (15%) plots are accessible from paved
footpaths and are no more than 46 m from vehicular roads. Land allocation is
reasonable, with 64% of land used for housing. Community facilities occupy
21% of the area. For layout see drawing IBRD 15144.
Infrastructure Standards
4.03      In designing the project, existing conditions and service capacity
were assessed and engineering works necessary to meet additional require-
ments worked out. The problem was to provide shelter and services to house-
holds, within an income group of Rs 1,200 (US$159) per month at affordable
costs and this has been achieved (Table V-4). Design standards for each
service are shown in Table IV-1.
Housing Designs
4.04      Design options for sanitary core, shelter and finished houses are
basic, with affordability the principal criterion. The Ministry has produced
a number of housing designs, some of which are shown in Chart WB 22121 and
would cater for all inc me groups expected to live in the area.  The ba ic
options include a 6.5 m sanitary corg; the core and one room of 13.9 m total;
and the core plus two rooms of 21.4 m total, with expansion options
2
1/   CHA estate plot sizes average about 140 m



- 25 -
15.7 m and 19.6 m respectively. House construction would be of load besr-
ing concrete block walls with a concrete floor and flat concrete slab roof.
This construction is well suited to cyclone prone areas, allows phased
construction and conforms with local lifestyles.  Beneficiaries would be
to choose from these plans or build to their own design.
4.05      Project would encourage construction through self-help or self
management using local tradesmen, which should reduce overall construc-
tion costs and provide jobs for lower income groups. Technical assistance
would be given for self-help construction (para 3.07).

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
5.01      Inflation and Interest Rate Policy.  Bank estimates of recent and
projected inflation rates have been averaged as follows: 1977-' 9: 11.5%,
1980-82: 15%, reducing to 8% in 1983 and 7% thereafter the higher rate of
inflation during 1980-82 reflects largely the impact of devaluation of the
rupee by about 30% in October, 1979. Bank of Mauritius discount rate at the
time of appraisal was 10%. It is recommended that interest rates chargeable
to beneficiaries and parastatals should be based on and should not be less
than the Bank of Mauritius discount rate (paras. 2.17 and 5.09).
Mauritius Housing Corporation
5.02      Organization and Management.  MHC has long been an efficient and
prudent mortgage lending institution with established policies, loan process-
ing procedures and a well trained staff. In recent years its expansion
has been slowed because of economic conditions and government's inability
to maintain real amounts of long-term lending or equity. It employs a total
staff of about 77, of which 9 hold professional designations, 5 are semi-
professional and 63 are non-professional administrative and support personnel.
The professional staff includes 2 engineers, 2 architects, and 5 financial
administrators who are all well qualified. Activities are grouped into four
major operating divisions: loan processing, personnel management, finance,
and engineering. The organization chart is shown in Annex 1, Table 2.
Presently MHC has adequate staff to meet the requirements of its current
lending program and the proposed project. However it intends to employ
additional extension workers and building inspectors if its lending expands
as envisaged and would have no difficulty in recruiting them. MHC's account-
ing procedures are satisfactory and the corporation is audited twice yearly
by the Auditor General of Mauritius who reports directly to Parliament;
this audit is considered satisfactory.
5.03      As shown in Table V-1 and Annex 1, Table 7, the total assets
have grown an average of 15% per year between 1977 and 1980. Of the total
resources at June 30, 1980, approximately 75% were in the form of long-term
debt; 12% in the form of customer savings and short-term liabilities; while
the remaining 13% was in the form of equity. Growth during the 1977-80 period
was financed almost entirely by long-term debt which currently has an average
maturity of 21.6 years and a cost of 7.5% per annum. More recent borrowings
have averaged 20 years at a cost of 10% per annum.

5.04      The heavy dependency on long-term borrowings to finance expansion
has resulted in an erosion of the MHC's overall financial viability. This
is shown by the relatively high debt/equity ratio of 5:1 at the end of 1979.
More recently, MHC has financed some of its expansion through short-term loans
(of less than one year). As a result, the current ratio (current assets/
current liabilities), which has always been quite weak, deteriorated even
further to 0.2 by the end of FY80. Liquidity is virtually non-existent.
5.05      To continue a realistic growth of MHC and to protect its future
financial viability, a structural readjustment of its financial position
should be undertaken.  Allowances can be made for the relatively long-term
structure of MHC-s debt, which comes quite close to matching the average
mortgage terms (para 5.08) and which reduces the risk of a significantly
negative net cash flow on borrowing and relending operations (the average
maturity on borrowings is 21.6 years as opposed to 23 years on mortgage
lending operations). Under these circumstances a debt/equity ratio of 4:1
would be acceptable. During negotiations GOM presented a summary of its
housing policy for the period 1980/84 which represents a policy shift towards
provision of credit rather than completed houses. This will be reflected by a
budgetary shift from contributions to CHA to loans and equity to the MHC.
Tentative planned public expenditure in MHC (loans and equity) in constant
1980 prices is as follows: 1980/81 - Rs 20 million, 1981/82 - Rs 60 million,
1982/83 - Rs 70 million, 1983/84 Rs 75 million (para. 1.11).
5.06      During negotiations GOM agreed:  (a) to strengthen MHC by providing
Rs 13 million in loans and converting Rs 7.0 million debt into equity in
1980/81; (b) to provide additional funds to MHC in equity over the period
1981/84 (estimated at about Rs 17 million in 1980 prices); and (c) that MHC
will take steps to reach a debt-equity ratio of 4:1 in fiscal 1984. This is
possible as demonstrated in Annex 1, Table 7. In this regard, the following
method would be used for computation:



- 28 -
(i) Debt is the sum of all liabilities outstanding at
June 30 of each year, excluding customer savings; and
(ii)  Euity is the sum of all customer savings, reserves,
capital and retained earnings outstanding at June 30
of each year.
5.07      Particularly noteworthy of MHC is its recent policy of aggressive
solicitation of savings as a source of capital. Amounting to only Rs 600,000
in 1975, these funds have grown to Rs 7 million by June 30, 1979, and now
account for 4% of its total resources. This is indicative of a capacity to
save. Moreover, the risk of these savings being withdrawn is minimal since
they pay, on average, 10% per annum and are competitive with other invest-
ment opportunities within the country. So that low income housing will be
assured of greater continuity, and that the GOM's role will be in support of,
and not in lieu of, private funding, the foregoing policy of domestic resource
mobilization should be encouraged and continued. MHC has established a target
of raising additional capital through customer savings by an average of
approximately 15% per annum for the next five years and is already actively
engaged in an advertising campaign with this in mind, especially outside the
municipalities.
5.08      Mortgage Lending and Interest Policies. 1/  MHC has been lending
approximately Ps 25 (US$3.3) million per year (Annex 1, Table 7) and as of
July 1980 had outstanding loan applications for approximately this amount
which have not been processed due to lack of funds. MHC can finance mortgages
for the full value of residential properties; and requires a 10% down payment.
In all cases, capacity to pay determines the maximum loan ceiling. Due to its
good management, the portfolio shows only 1% in arrears of 90 days or more.
5.09      During negotiations it was agreed that the rates of interest MHC
would charge would fluctuate with the structure of interest in Mauritius.
They would be calculated so as to maintain an average spread of 2-1/2% above
MHC's average cost of capital. MHC would not charge less than 1-1/2% above
the Bank of Mauritius' discount rate. Any changes in MHC's interest rate
policies would be reviewed with Bank to ensure that its future viability as
financial intermediary is protected. For the purpose of calculating the
average spread, the following would apply:
(a) Average cost of capital will be computed by dividing the total
of all interest, commissions, and other charges payable on debt
in any given year by the average of the balances outstanding
of all debt payable, including deposits and other forms of
investors' savings, at the beginning and end of such year; and
(b) Average rate of interest on lending operations will be computed
by dividing the total of all interest, commissions, and other
charges receivable on outstanding debt during any given year
by the average of the principal amounts outstanding at the
beginning and end of such year.
1/   Under the proposed project mortgages would be limited to a maximum of
Rs 50,000 (US$6,600) (para. 2.06).



- 29 -
5.10      Future Finances.  Looking forward, the financing requirements of
MHC during the 1980-84 period are estimated at Rs 304 million. This amount
includes an outlay of Rs 110 million for the proposed project, other lending
operations of Rs 83 million, construction of housing estates of Rs 90 million,
liquidity requirements of Rs 17 million, and other investments of Rs 3 million.
About 15% of requirements would be financed from repayments of mortgage prin-
cipal (net of repayments and borrowings), 2% from depositors savings and 75%
from borrowings, and 8% from Government equity contributions.
5.11      Table V-2 summarizes the cost of investments, additional funds
required during the period of execution, and sources of funds.

Cost Recovery
5.12      The following principles of cost recovery would be applied to
various elements of the project:
(a) those costs which are normally partially recovered kbecause
of subsidies) by public authorities in the form of user charges
or tariffs would be similarly recovered, (e.g., off-site
infrastructure for water, sewerage, and electricity);
(b) all site development costs for on-site infrastructure
development of La Tour Koenig, home construction and
improvement loans, engineering and supervision would be
borne directly by beneficiaries in respect of private plots.
Costs relating to public areas such as schools would be
borne from central government revenue;
(c) parking would be recovered through user charges.
(d) cost of studies would be borne from central government
revenues.
5.13      At La Tour Koenig, serviced land would be sold to beneficiaries
at prices which would permit full recovery of all costs. Middle- and high
income plots forming about 40% of the total plots developed and those in prime
locations, would pay a premium which would go toward subsidizing standard
plots for the lower income group. 1/ MHC would provide housing loans at La
Tour Koenig as well as throughout the island. Cost recovery for serviced land
and housing loans would not exceed 25 years at an interest rate which would
not be less than the Central Bank discount rate plus an adequate margin to
cover MHC's operational cost and risk (para 7.02(c)).  Cost recovery calcula-
tion for the housing component are based on an interest rate of 12% for the
lower income group and 14% for the middle- and high-income group over periods
of 25 years (para. 5.09) and 20 years respectively (para. 2.06(e)).
5.14      In the case of solid waste management assurances were obtained
at negotiations that GOM would recover the cost of additional investment
under the project. Detailed methodology for recovering costs would be agreed
with GOM on completion of the solid waste management study (paras. 2.11 and
7.02(k)).
5.15      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that partial cost recovery
on sewerage and water would be made by ensuring that direct beneficiaries
and occupiers of all CHA estates who currently do not pay sewerage and water
rates 2/ would pay existing tariffs (para 7.02(g)). These tariffs are also
being reviewed. No direct cost recovery applies on the traffic management
component.
1/   Table showing calculation of cross-subsidy in project file (Annex 5).
2/   Estimated households number about 12,000.  Householders affected by
project rehabilitation number 3,170.



- 31 -
5.16      Table V-3 shows how costs would be recovered.  A total of 73% of
the project costs would be recovered directly from plot charges, housing
loan repayments, rates and tariffs. The balance of 27%, which would be
unallocable to project beneficiaries, would be financed by general revenues.
Affordability
5.17      During appraisal components were scrutinized to ensure that all
infrastructure components are affordable to the target group. Data on
affordability of basic services are presented below.
5.18      La Tour Koenig Serviced Land.  The financing plans for this com-
ponent makes the cost of serviced land with one room core house affordable
by families with incomes of Rs 870 and above per month (73% of the total
households), core houses on owned land (cyclone victims) would however be
affordable by 88% of the population (see Table V-4).
5.19      Sewerage, Water and Solid Waste.  The total of these charges would
be well below 5% of the relative poverty income level and hence would be
affordable, to the target group.
5.20      Housing Credit.  MHC would ensure that cost of carrying charges
(amortization for land and construction) would not exceed 25%-30% 1/ of
family income on all credit provided for reconstruction of houses or for
new housing at La Tour Koenig or throughout Mauritius.
Project Replicability
5.21      The project demonstrates the feasibility of developing serviced
land and housing affordable to low-income households and recovers costs
without overstraining GOM's already stretched budget. However, replicability
of the project is very much dependent on its being executed efficiently and a
successful collection of charges from beneficiaries. Implementation agencies
have efficient manpower and with the technical assistance being provided under
the project should be able to execute the project satisfactorily. MHC's
excellent past record of collections (less than 1% default rate) needs to
be maintained for a satisfactory performance. The project includes studies
which would recommend similar projects in the new distribution centers and
experience from this project would be valuable in designing these.
Poverty Impact
5.22      About 33% of the population of Mauritius is below the urban relative
poverty threshold. 2/ The project design is such that all components are
1/   25% for borrowers with incomes up to Rs 1,200 per month and 30% for
borrowers with incomes greater than Rs 1,200 per month.   This is in
line with MHC's present policies, and is affordable because of subsidies
on basic food and services. These percentages would be reviewed by MHC
as necessary.
2/   The relative urban poverty threshold is estimated at Rs 1,000 (US$132)
per month in 1980 prices (para. 1.08).

biased to benefit this group to the extent possible. The housing and rehabili-
tation component would benefit about 39,000 people of whom about 50% would be
below the relative poverty threshold. Investment in public transport would
benefit the poor disproportionately since it is they who dominate as users of
public transport. An estimated 46% of the total project cost would directly
benefit the urban poverty group. Thus of the total project .ost oE US$24.5
million, US$11.4 million is attributable to the poor. For details see Annex 3.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General Justification and Project Benefits
6.01      The project components are all justified.  At least 60% of the
direct beneficiaries of these programs would be in the target low-income
population group with incomes up to Rs 1,200 per month (US$158). The quanti-
fiable rates of return range from 17% to 18%. All project components were
scrutinized technically to ensure that they would meet their objectives at
lowest cost. Alternative approaches were considered; technical designs were
reviewed and modified where unsatisfactory. This resulted in significant
reduction in component costs and increased impact on the poor in the case
of sewerage and solid waste management. In the latter case, changes in the
method of solid waste collection would result in a substantial increase in
collection of waste in the Port Louis area with considerable impact on the
urban poor.
Rate of Return Calculations and Justification
6.02      The following basis was used to measure economic viability of the
various components:
6.03      La Tour Koenig Serviced Land.  All economic costs are included:
land detailed design and engineering, on-site infrastructure, construction,
physical contingencies and maintenance costs. Economic benefits are conserva-
tively evaluated at present market prices for similarly developed land. The
costs and benefits of community facilities which represent 21% of the total
cost of this component, have been excluded from the analysis because of
difficulty in quantifying their benefits. The facilities would be provided
on a least cost basis, in accordance with minimal national standards.
6.04      Home Improvement Loans.  Total amount of loans for reconstruction
of existing housing and construction of new housing (Rs 90 (US$11.9) million)
and maintenance costs estimated at 3% of capital costs are included. Taxes,
interest, and price contingencies are excluded from the costs. Economic
benefits are conservatively evaluated at present market rental value for
similar housing. Rental value ranges from Rs 350 per month for a one-bedroom
house with kitchen and bath to Rs 650 per month for a two-bedroom house and
Rs 900 per month for a three-bedroom house.

6.05      Table VI-1 presents the internal economic rates of return calculated
according to the procedures set forth above. All components for which an
economic rate of return was calculated have a positive net present value
at a discount rate of 12%.
Table VI-1: ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN
Economic          Sensitivity Analysis
Rate of Return        Costs         Benefits
+10%  +20%    -10%  -20%
La Tour Koenig        18% - 15 years       15%   12%      14%   10%
Housing Credit        17% - 15 years       13%   11%      15%   13%
6.06      Technical Assistance.  No economic or financial evaluation was
performed due to unquantifiable benefits.  However, the component was scru-
tinized to ensure that costs were minimized.
6.07      Upgrading of CHA Estates.  The water, sewerage and drainage component
is justified for the following reasons:
(a) the project would bring minimum levels of these services,
essential for reasonable health standards, to some 3,170 poor
families who live in or adjacent to CHA estates and do not
receive adequate service;
(b) improvement of existing inadequate surface water drainage
systems would reduce damage caused by flooding and help to
control infectious diseases in these areas. Although health
statistics are deficient, health officials state that
incidence of typhoid and malaria increase significantly in
these areas because of flooding and the related malfunction-
ing of the sewerage systems, particularly after the cyclone
season;
(c) high subsidy on sewerage and particularly water supply in
Mauritius has been the subject of protracted discussions
between Government and the Bank and has led to the first
major step in reforming water tariffs (para. 1.14). Although
water supply and sewerage are small components, the principle
of charging economic tariffs has been accepted and a levy
would be introduced for all residents of CHA estates equiva-
lent at least to the service charges to households in other
areas.



- 36 -
6.08      Solid Waste Management.  The modest expenditure envisaged in this
component is justified on health and amenity grounds. The program would also
be cost effective and reduce maintenance costs on stormwater drainage through-
out Port Louis. Environmental improvements would include cleaner streets,
less noxious odors, reduced risks of epidemic diseases, etc., but these
benefits cannot be quantified.
6.09      Public Transport Improvement and Traffic Management.  No financial
or economic evaluation was performed as this would require an extensive
network analysis which was not justified given the modest expenditure of this
component. However, the investment is justified because more efficient public
transport throughout the island will eventually reduce journey times for many
people, since buses are heavily used for commuting, and will improve supply
of labor to industries at present experiencing a labor shortage because of
transport problems.
Risk
6.10      The main risk relates to the implementation ability of the insti-
tutions involved. Although the project does not call for the creation of
new institutions (except for the National Physical Development Unit to be
created in MEPD), it is dependent on strengthening of several organizations
which are presently weak. We however believe that with the support of tech-
nical assistance, project objectives can be achieved. The present staff and
procedures of IHC are capable of implementing an expanded loan program. A
major uncertainty concerns demand for MHC loans in the proportions (by income
group) and the scale envisaged. A long tradition exists in Mauritius of
informal finance for housing often based on an individual's current spending
capacity rather than his debt servicing capacity. For public housing and
urban services (water, sewerage and solid waste disposal) there has been a
tradition of heavily subsidized provision and this project would be a first
step in trying to change this tradition. Similar customs elsewhere die hard.
Nevertheless there is little doubt that for housing at least the demand exists.
MHC has a sizable waiting list of persons, many of whom are eligible for
loans under this project; given the relatively small base from which MHC
starts and the limited size of its overall intended program, the risks are well
within a tolerable range.  Furthermore, MHC's healthy past record of less than
1% arrears or default rate, as well as the fact that as it expands lending to
lower income groups it will increase its spread from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2% should
minimize these risks. To the extent of the risks are realized, this would
imply a somewhat slower rate of disbursement rather than project failure or
misconception.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following would be conditions of disbursement:
(a) For the Housing Credit Component: effectiveness of a loan
agreement with co-financiers (para. 2.16).
(b) For the solid waste component: acquisition of suitable land
for the solid waste disposal (para. 2.11).
(c) GOM would enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the
following institutions, satisfactory to the Bank; this
would be a condition of disbursement for the parts of
the project to be financed under each subsidiary agreement
(para. 2.18):
(i) MHC for the housing credit
(ii) CEB for electrical works at La Tour Koenig
(iii) CWA for water at La Tour Koenig and CHA estates; and
(iv) the Port Louis Municipality for the solid waste
management.
7.02      The following key assurances were obtained and agreements reached
during negotiations:
(a) GOM agreed to strengthen MNC by providing loans and equity;
MHC would move toward reducing its debt/equity ratio to 4:1
by the end of the Project (para. 5.05).
(b) MHC would give priority to cyclone victims. Beneficiary
selection criteria and procedures and policies for onlending
will be as detailed in paras. 2.05 and 5.09 respectively.
(c) Terms for MHC onlending to beneficiaries would not be less
than the Central Bank discount rate plus an adequate margin
to cover its administrative and other costs, over a period
not exceeding 25 years (para. 5.13); any changes in MHC's
investment or lending policies would be reviewed with the
Bank to ensure that its future viability as a financial
intermediary is protected (para. 5.09).
(d) MHC would provide unaudited accounts within 6 months and
audited accounts within 12 months after close of the
financial year for the whole of their activities and the
project (paras 3.15 and 3.17);



- 38 -
(e) GOM would take necessary steps to provide incentives to ensure
improvement and maintenance of the rental housing and will
exchange views with the Bank on any proposal to modify or
supplement legislation for this purpose (para. 1.09).
(f) La Tour Koenig would be brought under the jurisdiction of
an appropriate authority before completion of this component,
so that services could be maintained and rates charged
(para 2.04);
(g) GOM would require all direct beneficiary and occupiers of
CHA estates to pay water and sewerage charges in accordance
with existing tariffs (para 5.15);
(h) Project Coordinator would prepare quarterly progress reports
and that, on completion of the project, a Project Completion
Report would be prepared on the basis of an outline to
be agreed with the Bank (para 3.17).
(i) GOM would carry out a study on traffic regulations and
parking and, if required, take all action (June 1981)
in its power to enact amendments in legislation to:
(i) allow Government/Municipalities to charge on-street and
off-street parking specifying tariffs (para 2.10);
(ii) set up a force of traffic wardens and empower them to
enforce traffic regulations (para 2.10).
(j) GOM would carry out a study, by October 31, 1982, of the
cost of investment in, and operations and maintenance of
its sewerage system, and on the basis thereof exchange
views with the Bank on a proposed tariff structure
designed progressively to reduce subsidies on such
services (para. 1.17).
(k) GOM would carry out a solid waste management study and
review findings with the Bank (December 1982) and implement
it (para 2.11); and recover additional costs of improving
solid waste collection and disposal from beneficiaries
(including trade and related) (para 5.14).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$15.0 million.

ANNEX 1
Page 1 of 3
MAURITIUS HOUSING CORPORATION (MHC)
Overview
1.        Mauritius Housing Corporation (MHC) is a parastatal organization
under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance. The Assistant Secretary of
the Ministry of Finance is on the Board of MHC. It was established in 1963
to assume the housing loan functions of the Mauritius Agricultural Bank.
The Government provides MHC local currency resources in the form of long-term
loans, totaling Rs 83.3 million at May 31, 1980. (See Table 1).
Operating Policy
2.        The operating policy of MHC is established by the Mauritius Housing
Corporation Act dated May 24, 1974 which states that the Corporation may grant
loans for:
"(a) purchase, construction, reconstruction, repair or improvement
of any building;
(b) purchase of any land on which there exists a building, or
on which a building is to be erected;
(c) erection of any building;
(d) any purpose incidental, accessory, subsidiary or ancillary
to any of the above purposes or to the making of the loan; or
(e) repayment in part or in full of any debt incurred for any
of the above purposes."
Board of Directors
3.        MHC's Board consists of nine directors; two representatives of the
government, six of the private sector (all appointed by the GOM) as well as
the general manager. The chairman is a former Minister of Social Security and
owner of a ship chandler's company. The directors are all prominent members
of business and official communities of Mauritius. The Board, which must
approve all loans, meets at least once a month.
Management and Staffing
4.        The general manager of MUC, has been with the Corporation since its
inception and has had extensive banking experience and is well qualified for
the position.
5.        The organization chart of MHC is shown as Table 2.  The staff
consists of 9 professionals, 5 semi-professionals, and 63 non-professionals.
Professionals are well qualified; no staff increases will be needed to handle
this program.

Appraisal of Mortgage Applications and Follow Up
6.        Appraisals of applications for mortgages are thorough, and include
a detailed evaluation of the financial capability of each borrower. Construc-
tion specifications acceptable to the Corporation are specified in the loan
documents. Regular inspection of the building site is made by the Corporation's
inspectors throughout construction. The mission found the procedures used by
MHC acceptable.
Accounting and Auditors
7.        The Director of Audit of the government is responsible for audit
of the Corporation. Auditing is performed twice yearly. The Accounts
Department of MHC handles all accounting, under direction of the financial
controller/assistant manager.
Legal Matters and Disbursements
8.        MHC has four legal advisers, one of whom is the attorney general or
his assistant. They are consulted on a retainer basis. Once loans are
approved, disbursements are made according to a disbursement schedule estab-
lished for each building stage, usually following inspection by one of
the Corporation's representatives (inspector, engineer or architect).
Domestic Resources
9.        Equity.  There is no share capital in the Corporation.  Reserves
and appropriation amounted to Rs 20.9 million at June 30, 1979. The bulk
of the Corporation's working funds is acquired in the form of long-term
loans, mainly from the Central Government.
Local Currency Borrowing
10.       As of Nay 31, 1980, MHC's long-term liabilities amounted to Rs 143.7
million of which Rs 83.3 million are in the form of government loans and
Rs 60.4 million are in the form of long-term loans from commercial sources.
(See Table 3).
11.       MHC accepts savings deposits from the public and has the following
interest schemes:
(a) 4-year saving scheme: pays interest of 10%, including a
bonus if a depositor becomes a mortgagor of the Corporation
after 2 years;
(b) regular savings scheme: pays the going market interest rate
of commercial banks.
Deposits increased from Rs 2.36 million in FY77 to Rs 3.97 million in FY78,
and to Rs 5.4 million in FY79, representing an average annual growth of
just over 50%.

Operations
12.       A breakdown of MHC's total approvals, commitments, and disbursements
for new housing for FY76 through FY79 appears as Table 4. A distribution of
mortgage loans for the years 1960 through 1979 according to repairs, recon-
struction and new housing appears in Table 5. The significant increase in
loans made beginning in 1976/77 is due to Gervaise cyclone reconstruction and
new housing credit.
Mortgage Portfolio Evaluation
13.       An analysis of MHC's mortgage loan portfolio for FY78 and FY79 shows
an excellent repayment record on loans with a low percentage of arrears on
debt repayment amounting to less than 1% (see Table 6). This repayment pattern
is consistent with trends in banking institutions throughout Mauritius.
Profitability and Financial Condition
14.       Summarized financial statements for MHC for FY77 through FY80 appear
as Table 7. MIC's financial condition would be substantially improved if
GOM were to convert its total loans to the Corporation (amounting to Rs 83.3
million) into equity. At negotiations, GOM agreed that MHC would take steps
to reach a debt/equity ratio of 4:1 in fiscal 1984. Actual and forecast
financial ratios have been calculated for FY77 through FY85 (Table 7).
Prospects
15.       Forecast financial statements for the years 1980 through 1985
are also provided in Table 7. In these years the bulk of resources for MHC
would continue to be from long term borrowings; the significant increases in
1981 would reflect particularly the line of credit to MHC from the proposed
urban project.

MAURITIUS
URBAN REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rehabilitation and Improvement of Stormwater Drainage, Sewerage and Water Supply
in Four CHA Housing Estates - La Cure, Roche Bois, Vallijee, and Borstal
General
1.        The key problem within each of the estates--but to varying degrees--
is inadequate surface water drainage due to bad design and maintenance of
drains and to poor grading. This in turn contributes to difficulties with the
sewerage systems. Another serious problem is the lack of solid waste collec-
tion and disposal systems which contributes to the drainage deficiencies as
well as to sewerage malfunctions; trash and garbage are dumped in open drains
and streets and sometimes in sewerage structures.
2.        Water supply problems are caused by distribution systems within
the estates which are deficient or defunct, and by inadequate supplies to the
estates.
3.        The rehabilitation and improvement programs proposed for the estates
are intended to alleviate the worst flooding, sewerage and water supply
problems. The improvements to solid waste collection and disposal are
described in Chapter II.
Water Supply
4.        The housing and water supply systems in each of the four estates
are simil r. The typical house is ionstructed of concrete block covering
about 40m  on a plot of about 140 m . At the back of the plot, in a separate
structure, is a kitchen and toilet. Originally each house was provided with
a cistern (roof tank) on the kitchen/toilet structure and a shower fitting,
connected to the estate water supply distribution system. In the 20 years
since the estates were built, there have been many alterations to the struc-
tures; those that have been purchased by the householder often have been
improved while many of the rented units have deteriorated.
5.        The plots are in rows of four to ten and face small roads.  A very
narrow (one meter or less) service alley runs behind each row of plots,
separating it from another row. The sewer is in the alley and the water main
serving the plots runs along one side. At one time there were water taps in
the alleys--one to serve each four plots--but most of these have disappeared
as householders altered the plumbing to provide taps within their plots. Many
of the plot holders have put fences or hedges next to the alleys and some have
encroached on the alleys. Other alleys are filled with rubbish. Therefore,
for the most part the alleys are not accessible for maintenance of water or
sewer services.

ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 5
6.        The grid-type distribution systems within each estate consists mostly
of galvanized steel pipes 25 mm to 50 mm (1 inch to 2 inch) diameter with some
feeder mains of 75 mm to 100 mm diameter. The supply mains connecting the
estate systems to the Central Water Authority (CWA) system range in diameter
from 50 mm (Borstal) to 100 mm (Roch Bois and La Cure). There is no metering
either for the individual service connections (about 20 mm diameter) or for
the bulk supplies to the estates.
7.        The capacity of existing water systems to meet demand varies from
estate to estate. In all cases capacity is limited by the age of the pipes
and the bare minimum standards of design. At Borstal, the smallest estate,
water service is reasonably good although pressure is low, principally
because of the small size of the bulk supply connection, also at Vallijee
service is not bad. Service at Roche Bois is poor and at La Cure, the largest
of the four estates, it is terrible.
8.        CWA has been under pressure to take over the internal water supply
systems at each of the estates and charge the customers directly for metered
water use. CWA refuses to do so unless the internal systems are developed to
reasonable standards. The CWA engineers' preliminary plans for this kind of
development include: replacement of all internal mains with 100 mm or larger
diameter pipe laid under the roads instead of the alleys; new metered service
connections to the front of each property (instead of the rear as at present);
new ring mains around each estate; and new bulk supply mains to each estate.
The total cost of all this would be about MRs 10 million (US$1.3 million
equivalent) at January 1980 prices. This would not include the cost of service
connections and revisions required to the on-plot plumbing to accommodate the
new service connections.
9.        The above costs would be clearly out of line with the resources
available and the value of the properties and much of the work would be
unnecessary for providing acceptable standards of service for low cost housing.
Consequently, substantial reductions were worked out in consultation with the
CWA engineers and the revised plan described in the paragraph below should
alleviate the worst problems.
10.       At La Cure, the on-plot water services never worked and, for the
most part have been dismantled by the occupants. For 20 years the inhabitants
of La Cure have collected their water in home-made wheeled drums from a few
makeshift and totally inadequate and unsanitary street hydrants. The cost of
restoring the individual supply system would be prohibitive. Instead, it is
proposed to install a properly designed and constructed street hydrant system
for La Cure with about 33 metered hydrants--one for every 25 plots as opposed
to about one per 200 plots at present. New internal mains, equivalent in
length to about 30% of the existing mains would be constructed, some in
streets and some in alleys and would be designed so that the on-plot water
connections could be restored if desired in future. There would be a loop
main around the estate and a short metered bulk supply connection to a
new CWA main scheduled to be constructed adjacent to the estate as part of
CWA's on-going development program.

ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 5
11.       For Roche Bois, a major new bulk supply main to the estate is
required. This would consist of about 550 m of 200 mm diameter pipe-and 800 m
of 150 mm d:-aneter pipe and would include about 75% excess capacity to improve
service in adjacent areas. The connection to the estate would be metered.
Half of a 150 mm diameter ring main around the estate would be constructed
(about 950 m) and the internal distribution system would be strengthened by the
addition (including some replacement) of a small amount (0.1 km) of 100 mm pipe.
12.       At Vallijee, there would be provision for replacement of about 50%
(1.7 km) of the internal distribution network with 100 mm diameter pipe and
perhaps 200 new service connections.  The plots in this estate are 85% owned
by the occupants; the system could be taken over by CWA in the not-too-distant
future and the wateT- use billed directly. A ring main (1.4 km of 150 mm
pipe) would be constructed and a short metered bulk supply connection to the
estate would be made from a nearby CWA transmission line.
13.       The requirements for water supply improvements at Borstal are
minimal. Only two short 150 mm diameter metered bulk supply connections to
the CWA system are necessary. This is another system that reasonably could be
taken over by CWA within the next few years.
Stormwater Drainage
14.       Surface water drainage components of the rehabilitation at the four
estates include regrading and reshaping, and occasionally lining, of main
internal estate drains and disposal drains (outfalls from the estates),
improved culverts under roadways and improvements to critical roadside and
collector drains. As in the case of water supply, La Cure is in the worst
condition for drainage and Borstal is best. The most difficult and expensive
single drainage item is for Roche Bois where a large open disposal drain is
required to direct water to the Terre Rouge estuary from the estate as well
as part of the adjacent land fill now in place for the Mer Rouge infrastruc-
ture development. This drain would include a short length of dredged channel
to the center of the estuary.
15.       The Ministry of Works engineers and their consultants originally
proposed considerable additional works to improve drainage at the four estates.
This consisted of on-plot improvements including regrading, additional paved
and covered areas and improved yard drains and paths. However, although
desirable, the cost of these items was estimated at about MRs 12 million
(US$1.6 million) and is considered to be not justified as part of this project.
It is felt that occupants could make these modifications if they felt they
were important enough and that as plots become self owned, the owners almost
certainly would do so.
Sewerage
16.       Typically in the four estates, the sewer connections from four
plots are brought to a junction chamber (like a small manhole) on the sewer
in the alley. The sewers run for relatively long distances through



- 53 -
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 5
the alleys until they reach one of the infrequent trunk sewers. Sewer diame-
ters range from 100 m 1/ to 200 mm with a few at 300 mm. They are laid with
litt:Le cover and many are at unfortunately flat grades which reduces their
flow capacity. The material of the smaller sewer pipes is bituminous fiber
which is not reccmmended for sewers because it gets softer with time and is
easily damaged.
17.       The final sewage disposal methods vary in nature.  At La Cure,
sewage is treated at a badly maintained oxidation pond located nearby.
However, the La Cure trunk sewer which will terminate near the estate is under
construction and should be completed in 1981. It is intended to connect the
La Cure sewerage system to this and the sewage then will be taken to the Port
Louis Northern Works for ultimate disposal through a sea outfall.
18.       Sewage from Roche Bois is discharged to sea by gravity through a 300
mm diameter outfall without treatment. The outfall operates under surcharged
conditions except at low tide and is partly silted up.  In the near future,
part of the estate sewerage will be connected to the new La Cure trunk sewer.
A pumping station and force main were intended to take the sewage from the
balance of the estate to the Port Louis Northern Works as part of the Mer Rouge
Industrial Estate infrastructure, but has not been implemented, and there is
no definite plan for the near future. These facilities now would be construc-
ted as part of this project except that capacity and alignment of the mains
would be at minimum cost as required for Roche Bois only. Elimination of the
existing outfall and passing the Roche Bois sewage through the Northern Works
would remove a source of local pollution.
19.       The Valijee sewerage system is connected to the Port Louis southern
system. A few additional connections to an existing trunk sewer in this
system would be made as part of this project. At Borstal, there would be
minor improvements to the existing septic tank and outfall to Grand River North.
20.       In all estates, surface water enters the sewers through poorly con-
structed or broken--often intentionally to drain plots--sewers, manholes
and junction chambers. This not only surcharges sewers during storms but also
allows solid matter and large objects to enter and cause blockages. Both
result in sewage backups and overflows which in turn lead to secondary sediment
deposits. Attempts to clear blocked sewers sometimes result in further breaks
and collapses, due to poor original pipe materials (paragraph 16). Downstream
blockages and surcharges, because of the way systems are laid out (paragraph
4.01), cause sewage overflows at all upstream locations. Consequently sewerage
improvements within all the estates would comprise: repair and improvement of
many manholes and junction chambers, new trunk sewers to intercept existing
estate sewers in troublesome areas; some new street sewers to replace existing
estate sewers; and new service connections to new sewers.
Costs
21.       The estimated costs of water supply, sewerage and drainage for the
four estates are summarized in Table 1 of this annex. The costs shown are at
October 1980 prices and do not include engineering and physical contingencies.
Appropriate allowances for physical contingencies and engineering are 10% and
12% respectively. Price contingency allowances to be used are given in the
footnote /b to Table II-3 in the body of this report.
It   Not good design practice because of the ease with which they can be
blocked.

NATIONAL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT UNIT
1.        Annual requirements for newly serviced and urbanized land in
Mauritius will be on the order of 1,200 acres annually for the next 10-20
years. Procedures for planning, land release, assembly, financing and
development, maintenance and financing of existing urban services which
have also deteriorated, depend largely on central government general funds
and are also in need of reform and strengthening. Implementation of any
physical development strategy capable of coping with existing and future
demand for land and services calls for careful articulation of revised
financing policies, new institutions, and the allocation or coordination of
responsibilities.
National Physical Development Plan 1/
2.        The National Physical Development Plan (NPDP) has recently been
adopted in principle by Government who must now establish machinery for
its implementation. The plan as it stands does not include measures or
recommendations on powers, sources of funds or execution responsibility
and capacity and remains therefore of limited use: sound as land use
planning framework but devoid of implementation priorities or instruments.
The plan calls for a dispersed pattern of urbanization, concentrated into
three major and six minor growth poles all of which are in areas admin-
istered by District Councils with no sources of revenue, access to long-
term funds for capital development or capacity to maintain and manage the
facilites to be provided. Studies on appropriate instruments, agencies
and policies are needed and their conclusions acted upon before a
coordinated strategy for urban administration and growth management can be
realistically set in motion. Any managed pattern of future urban develop-
ment demands the urgent attention of Government in these matters.
National Physical Development Unit
3.        A unit is to be established in the Ministry of Economic Planning
and Development charged with coordination and monitoring of implementation
by concerned ministries and organizations of the National Physical Develop-
ment Plan. It will have a permanent staff of about four or five, and funds
will be available under the project for recruitment of specific consultants,
as necessary. The unit will also supervise related work carried out in other

Memorandum.

ministries. Agencies and specific staff will be seconded to it as specific
expertise is required in the execution of the unit's work program. The unit
will be headed by a principal economist, who would report directly to the
Director of Planning. The unit will otherwise comprise about five profes-
sionals and necessary support staff and services. Following is a description
of the broad responsibilities, work program, schedule of activities and
expected technical assistance requirement.
Responsibilities and Work Program
4.        The unit will be staffed with experienced people and have
overall responsibility for coordination of investment (public and
private) in land development and exploitation, supervision of planning,
financial and institutional design studies. It will be responsible for
making recommendations on and sponsor implementation of any necessary
policy reform and institutional development. Land use control and
zoning would remain, as at present, the responsibility of local
authorities and be referred to the Planning Board when conflicts arise
between issuance of a permit and strategic land use planning. The
unit may also be responsible for overall coordination and monitoring
of this project.
5.        The unit's immediate work will concentrate on six major and
related areas of concern:
(a) design of suitable financial and administrative
institutions;
(b) design of a public developer capability;
(c) detailed design and implementation of the proposed
land bank agency;
(d) valuation of property on an island-wide basis;
(e) a plan implementation study;
(f) supervision-related studies proposed or under way,
directly related urban management and services or
Physical Plan implementation, for example, studies
financed through bi-lateral agreement with French
Government.
This program is based on an expected two-year work commitment, allocation
of time and resources by other agencies and departments and technical
assistance funds as detailed below. Government decisions or introduction
of necessary legislation would proceed pari passu and according to the
schedule outlined.

Urban Management and Finance Study
6.        Present structures and practices for maintaining and extending
urban land and services are inadequate. Major anomalies exist in the
organization and power of local authorities and the provision and
financing utilities, especially water, sewerage and solid waste removal.
Large discrepancies between revenue authority and expenditure responsi-
bilities have become endemic. As a result, both local government services
and public utilities have become chronically dependent on subvention by
central authorities and ad hoc institutional responses to systematic
urban demands have become pervasive. There exists insufficient developer
capacity (either private or public) to provide urbanized land on an
adequate scale and the procedures for land release, transfer and develop-
ment remain arcane while speculative and genuine demand pressures are
driving land prices to preemptive levels.
7.        An Urban Management and Finance Study will be carried out,
covering broadly items (a) to (c) above. It will have a wide scope and
lead to broad and complex recommendations. Its detailed terms of
reference include a proposed structure of local administration in the
light of future urban development and finance and responsibilities for
provision and pricing of utilities: in particular water, sewerage, solid
waste, local roads, traffic management and parking. Recommendations
should be designed to restore financial and administrative capacity to
the relevant agencies to permit sound, financially independent authority
and responsibilities to the agencies charged with administering new
urbanization in other areas; and to allow utilities to operate on a
self-training basis for both operating and capital programs. Reduced
Government subvention to urbanization, urban management and public
utility expenditure would be the major objective of the study. These
tasks will include detailed examination of and recommendations on:
(a) appropriate administrative structures for urbanizing
areas and their definition in the district councils
where most of future urbanization is bound to occur;
(b)  sources of revenue;
(c) potential increased revenues in local authorities;
(d) revenue sharing formulae or introduction of earmarked
central revenues;
(e) an examination of expenditure responsibilities in the
light of present and reformed revenue authority and
collection capacity;



- 59 -
ANNEX 4
Page 4 of 7
(f) possibilities for specific taxes on industrialized and
commercial land and graduated capital gains taxes on all
land transaction;
(g) implications of specific and preferred cost-recovery
methods for urban and regional development on overall
public sector finance. For example, with alternative
mechanisms for financing urbanization, adjustments would
be called for in the methods of overall fiscal management
and the rates and use of existing general revenue
measures such as corporation tax, sugar export tax, etc.;
(h) specific studies of the scope for and feasibility of
abolishing the distinction between urban and district
councils and the introduction of land-based property and
betterment taxes throughout the island.
8.        There is a need to design and develop institutional capacity
to undertake large-scale land development and marketing. Recommendations
on a suitable public sector institution, empowered to assemble or acquire,
package, develop and dispose land will be prepared. Terms of reference
include an examination of possibilities and drafting necessary legislation.
Various models exist, in particular new town development corporations. The
design of this regional and land developer agency will be linked closely to
those made for urban administration and finance. In particular the following
will be examined:
(a) the scope for establishing a regional development authority;
(b) its powers over land assembly, purchase and transfer;
(c) maintenance of services;
(d)  provision and management of industrial estates;
(e) its relationships to the proposed Land Bank Agency;
(f) sources of long-term funds; and
(g) recommended powers and staffing.
9.        Some considerable work has already been completed on many of
these topics, including the Physical Plan, the Smale Report on local
government, public utility pricing in water, and within the Ministry
of Economic Planning and Development itself. The task is as much one
of review, consolidation and decision as it is of original study. About
9 months are allotted to the preparation of a position paper based on



- 60 -
ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 7
18 months of technical assistance and the direct involvement, participation
and agreement of the Municipalities, the NTA and TMU, the CWA, Ministries
of Communications and Works, Local Government, Housing, the National Solid
Waste studies and others.
10.       Government will adopt its own position with regard to these
proposals within 12 months. A further 12 months will be required for
detailed articulation, draft legislation and necessary recruitment and
creation of agencies and authorities.
11.       Technical assistance funds will be available for the unit for
specialist expertise as required to finance expatriate or local consultants
or secondment from foreign or local agencies as follows:
Land taxation, betterment tax           4 staff months
Local Government tax and
administration and functions            4 staff months
Developer institution                   3 staff months
Public utility pricing                  2 staff months
Fiscal implications                     4 staff months
Miscellaneous                           1 staff month
18 staff months
Valuation of Property on an Island-wide Basis
12.       Since the district councils are not empowered to levy property,
land or betterment taxes, no property outside the municipal councils is
valued. The majority of new development will occur in these areas and
since much of the highest value land use already occurs in these areas
(sugar, tourism industry), notwithstanding the particular recommendations
to be made in the Finance and Administrative study, it is proposed to
begin immediately the task of valuing property outside the municipal
areas.
13.       A revaluation of property in the municipal councils has
been completed with the assistance of three expatriate valuers. It is
proposed to continue the exercise, at the same level of effort to
cover the whole island. The program will last for 3 years. An important
element of the program will be having sufficient valuers to allow a
continuous cycle of property valuation and registration. Terms of



- 61 -
ANNEX 4
Page 6 of 7
reference for technical assistance therefore include training and possibly
establishing a course for valuers at the university. Technical assistance
for 36 staffmonths is included in the project for these purposes. Implementa-
tion responsibility will rest with the Government Valuer with funds made
available to him by the Plan Development Unit.
Plan Implementation Feasibility Study
14.       To avoid future locational decisions which may circumvent and
eventually destroy the growth pole policy, it is important that the impli-
cations of the proposed framework are well understood, and accepted through-
out government and in the private sector. Consequently, a prefeasibility
study, which was not carried out as an integral part of the NPDP is
necessary to:
(a) establish priorities and phasing of the developments
proposed in the NPDP; and
(b) explore positive relationship between the policy and
the Rural Development Program.
The feasibility study will analyze the impact of the decentralization
policies contained in the NPDP as compared to the rejected options which
might be more immediately attractive, paying particular regard to:
(a) the spatial distribution of population and the likelihood
of its attainment;
(b) the ensuing distribution of employment;
(c) optimum use of existing infrastructure;
(d) minimum use of good quality agricultural land;
(e) likely entrepreneurial response, particularly from
overseas investors;
(f) transportation implications;
(g) time scale needed to implement proposals;
(h) land availability;
and make recommendations on priorities for development phasing, and
attainable annual levels of implementation.

15.       In the light of these recommendations, initial costings,
socioeconomic and financial analyses will be carried out for a proposed
three-year program. The program recommended to assume allocation of
responsibilities, financial resources and developer capacity implied by
the findings and recommendations of the Urban Finance and Management
Study. The study will last approximately two years and six months of
consultancy funds are provided under the project.
