MEMORDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE                 DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE STATE OF PARANA (BRAZIL)
W E TH3E GUJUXANTEE OF
THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION QUALITY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the State of PandnA, with the guarantee
of the Federative Republic of Brazil, of US$96.0 million equivalent to help
finance a project for the improvement of primary education in the state. The
loan would be for 15 years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, on a
fixed amordzation schedule including a five year grace period.
Background
2.   Despite ParanA's location in the more developed south of Brazil, its
educational system suffers from many of the problems found in the rest of the
country. Educational attainment is poor: in 1990, 60 percent of ParanA
residents over 10 years old had 4 years of schooling or fewer. Although
nearly 92 percent of children aged 7-14 were in primary school in 1990, grade
repetition rates are very high, particularly in the early grades. Simulations of
student flows in 1989 indicate that of every class of 100 students entering first
grade in Parana, only 47 students eventually graduate from eighth grade, and
only 2.7 students do so without repeating. The cost of yearly repetition in the
state system alone is estimated to be about US$80 million equivalent, or
approximately 28 percent of state spending on primary education. Moreover,
learning levels are also low, although slightly above national averages.
3.    Factors underlying the poor performance of the educational system
include: (a) insufficient provision of bools and other essential instructional
inputs; (b) poorly trained teachers and rigid pedagogical practices; and (c)
problems in sector management and governance. Decentralization of education
services has become a major sectoral issue since the promulgation of the 1988
federal Constitution, which supports decentralizaton but does not clearly
define the respective roles of the federal government, states, and municipalities
in the financing and provision of services. Currently all hee levels of
govemment are involved in the financing and provision of education, with
considerable overlap of responsibilities and large differences in quality and
spending per student between regions and types of provider.
4.    Parana's recognition of problems related to the quality of primary
education has led to a number of initiatives for reform. In 1988, Paran;
introduced the concept of the ciclo bdsico de alfabedzagao (CBA) to its
educational system. CBA provides for: (a) automatic promotion from grades
one to two, in order to give more time for children to acquire basic literacy



-2-
and numeracy without the stigma of repetition; and (b) aiterations to and
enrichment of the basic curriculum for these grades. Since the introduction of
CBA, repetition rates in the first two grades of primary school have been
falling, although some of these gains have been off-set by higher repetition in
subsequent grades.
5.   In 1991, the state moved to the forefront of educational decentralization
in Brazil through the introduction of a program of 'educational partnership'
with municipalities. The initiative attempts to: (a) improve coordination and
planning between the state and municipal educadon systems; (b) transfer
administrative and financial responsibility for the provision of grades one to
four to municipalities willing and able to assume it; (c) ensure that all
municipalities spend the Constitutionally mandated 25 percent of their fiscal
revenues on education; and (d) minimize inequities in educational quality
through state support in the form of training, technical assistance, and financial
transfers to those municipalities not able to achieve a minimum spending level
per student. Unlike many parts of Brazil, municipalities in Paran have on
average greater financial resources to spend on primary education than the
state. Financial capacity vanes between municipalities, however, with some
municipalities able to spend much more per student than the state, while
others, particularly in low-income urban areas where there has been substantial
in-migration, spend less. Currently 320 municipalities in Parara, or 86
percent of the total, have formal partnership agreements with the state.
6.    Parana's decision to seek external financing from the World Bank to
support its educational reforms is a measure of the priority given to primary
education by the current administration. The state prepared an initial proposal
and received federal government approval of creditworthiness in March 1992,
well before the first Bank identification mission.
Rationale for Bank Involvement and Relationship of Project to Bank
Country Assistance Strategy
7.    As presented to the Board on June 29, 1993, the Bank's country
assistance strategy for Brazil focuses on reducing poverty and stimulating
macroeconomic growth. Primary education offers one of the best investments
for attaining both, since research shows the central importance of education in
raising incomes, reducing income inequality, and increasing labor productivity.
Wihiin primary education, the Bank's objectives are to improve the quality,
efficiency, and equity of education, as measured by: (a) improvements in
student cognitive achievement; (b) reductions in the high repetition rates which
currently characterize the Brazilian public primary education system; and (c) a
narrowing of the large disparities in school quality and productivity (among
states, between states and municipal systems, and between schocls themselves)



-3-
that result in part from disparities in spending per student. In pursuing these
objectives, the Bank strategy has emphasized: (a) support of innovative
approaches to improving educational quality which could serve as models for
the rest of Brazil; and (b) assistance to regions where problems in educational
quality and outcomes are most acute, particularly the Northeast.
8.    The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy.
Through its adoption of CBA, the partnership program with municipalities,
and other policy initiatives, Parana has already demonstrated a commitment to
improving the quality of public primary education. Like the recently approved
project in Minas Gerais and proposed project in Espfrito Santo, Parani's
experience could also prove an excellent testing ground for strategies that
could serve as models elsewhere in Brazil. All three states have adopted CBA
(although at different stages), and all three are experimenting with different
forms of decentralization (Minas Gerais and Parana to schools; Espirito Santo
and Paranl +;o municipalities). To fully implement its educatioui reforms,
however, Parann needs additional resources and advice in their deployment.
Given its extensive involvement in basic education both in other countries and
in other Brazilian states, the World Bank is well placed to provide technical
advice and facilitate a cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches that could be
vital to the success of the proposed project.
Project Objectives and Description
9.    The goal of the project is to improve educational attainment in the State
of Parana, as defined by increases in student learning and graduation from
primary school. To reach this goal, the project will support the delivery of a
package of essential educational inputs to primary schools and improvements
in educational management. The project's objectives are to: (a) improve
children's and teachers' access to adequate quantities of learning materials; (b)
improve teachers' effectiveness in the classroom; (c) provide children in low-
income urban areas with physical space adequate for learning; (d) provide
school, municipal, and regional level administrators with tools, skills and
incentives to improve management practices and take on new responsibilities;
and (e) achieve greater equity between state and municipal school systems in
terms of spending per student and the availability of essential educational
inputs.
10.   The project proposes to achieve the above objectives by means of the
following components:
(a)   Instructional Materials (US$75.5 million equivalent, including
contingencies; 38 percent of total project cost). The component would
finance: (a) the regular provision of textbooks to children in both state



-4-
and municipal schools; (b) a basic package of educational materials and
equipment to all state and participating municipal schools; and (c) a
school library enrichment program;
(b)   Teach  Training (US$27.1 million equivalent, including contingencies;
14 percent of total project cost). T'he component would finance an in-
service training program for school principals, supervisors, and
teachers through both face-to-face workshops and distance training;
(c)   Schl llpgadin and Eansion of Access (US$75.4 million
equivalent, including contingencies; 38 percent of total project cost).
The component would finance school construction and furnishing in
low-income areas where schools are either in sub-standard condition or
population shifts have produced a surge in demand;
(d)  Institutional DoT,10=  (US$18.0 million equivalent, including
contingencies; 9 percent of total project cost). The component would
support: (a) a project coordination unit witiin the State Secretariat of
Education (SEED); (b) the developmrent of capacity at the state level for
quantitative assessment of student learning; (c) restructuring and
decentralization of existing management information systems; (d)
activities to strengthen management at various levels, including training
for regional administrators and municipal staff; and (e) promotion of
quality improvements in schools and municipalities through
establishment of a prize fund; and
(e)   Studies and Evaluation (US$2.4 million equivalent, including
contingencies; 1 percent of total project cost). The component would
support policy, project evaluation, and impact studies.
Project Costs and Financing
11.  The total cost of the project is estimated at US$198.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$29.0 million equivalent.
Base costs are expressed in dollar equivalents of June 1993 prices, as updated
and confirmed at negotiations. Base costs include taxes and dudes of
approximately US$38.4 million equivalent, or about 19 percent of total project
costs. The proposed Bank loan of US$96 milion equivalent would finance 48
percent of total project expenditures, or 60 percent of expenditures net of
taxes. Textbooks, incremental salaries, and operations and maintenance would
be financed entirely by the state. A breakdown of the costs and financing plan
is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of up to US$5 mili;on equivalent (5 percent of the



proposed loan) would be provided for expenditures made in accordance with
Bank procurement guidelines for a period of up to twelve months prior to the
date of loan signing. Retroactive financing is recommended to cover
contracting of technical assistance and equipment necessary for the
establishment of monitoring systems, and limited renovation of the State
Secretariat of Education building in order to install computer equipment. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report
No. 12699-BR, dated June 8, 1994, is being distributed separately.
Project Implementation and Sustainability
12.  Implementation. The pIOject would be implemented over a five and
one-half year period, starting in 1994. Primary responsibility for project
implementation will be vested in the State Secretariat of Education (SEED),
which will be responsible for coordination between departments internally,
with other state institutions (such as Planning, Finance, and the Department of
Public Works), and with municipal agencies. Coordination will be enhanced
through the establishment of a Coordinating Committee composed of
representatves of departments and agencies involved in project implementation
and supervision, as well as a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) reporting
directly to the Secretary of Education. All municipalities will benefit from
textbook provision and assessment activities under the project. Those
municipalities having concluded partnership agreements with the state will be
further eligible to benefit from in-ldnd transfers of training, equipment, other
instructional materials, and civil works construction. Where municipalities are
involved in the implementation of civil works under the projeat, resources will
be transferred to the municipal level according to agreements acceptable to the
Bank. SEED will also be responsible for coordination with the Ministry of
Education (MEC) to implement the textbook subcomponent within the
framework set out by the national resolution issued in July 1993, which
reconfirmed the federal govemrnent's obligation to finance, procure, and
distribute textbooks for all public students in Brazil. Implementation
arrangements for textbooks have been further defined in a workplan to be
transmitted to the Bank in final form as a condition of effectiveness.
13.   Sustainability. By the time of the closing date of December 31, 1999,
it is estimated that additional resources of US$12.2 million per year would be
needed to sustain project investments. This estimate excludes financing for
textbook provision (approximately US$7 million per year) which the recet
resolution of the National Fund for Educational Development (FNDE)
reconfirmed as a federal govemment obligation. Most of this increase would
go towards sustaning non-salary invesL-nents, as SEED expects to rely heavily
on existing personnel for the staffing of additional classrooms built under the



-6-
project (most new construction would replace eyisting classrooms).
14.   Assuming no municipal contributions to project recurrent costs, this
increase would represent about 5 percent of state spending on primary
education in 1992, which is considered sustainable with government
commitment. Under the partnership initiative, however, municipalities are
expected to assume the maintenance costs of buildings and equipment
transferred by the state, including replacement of instructional materials and
any new staffing of classrooms serving grades one to four. Given that
municipalities in Parana have in aggregate greater potential per-student
spending capacity than the state, over the medium term increased municipal
contributions to the administration of primary education (particularly personnel
costs) should mean that the state will have greater flexibility both to subsidize
poorer municipalities and to devote additional resources to non-salary recurrent
costs. Declining Bank financing is not being proposed, given that even the
US$12.2 million estimate is less than the approximately US$13.4 million per
year that the state would be required to budget as counterpart funds during
project implementation. Sustainability concerns have also been addressed in
the project by activities to strengthen management capacity at both the state
and municipal level, and through the state's commitment (as indicated in a
Declaration on Educational Policies signed by the Governor) to maintaining
key policy reforms such as the CBA and the partnership program.
Lessons Learned
15.   The design of the proposed project draws from lessons learned from
past education projects in Brazil, particularly the EDURURAL Project (Loan
No. 1867-BR, approved in 1980) and the Urban Basic Education Project (Loan
No. 2412-BR, approved in 1983). In particular, the three critical lessons that
have influenced the design of this project are: (a) textbook provision and
school upgrading are highly cost-effective investments; (b) teacher training
aimed at improving specific skills and classroom management tec'niques are
promising investments, and (c) effective implementation and longer-term
sustainability of education projects depend on improving the efficiency of
educational management and the establishment of effective management
systems at all government levels.
Agreed Actions
16.   Prior to negotiations, the Borrower submitted to the Bank: (a) a draft
worFplan for the provision of textbooks under the project within the
framework of the new MEC resolution; (b) copies of governmental decrees
establishing the structure and composition of the PCU and Coordinating
Committee, as well as curriculum vitae of PCU staff, all of which were found



-7-
acceptable to the Bank; (c) a preliminary version of the Project Operational
Manual, including inter alia, project monitoring indicators and draft model
bidding documents for LCB procurement of goods and works, as well as legal
opinions as to their acceptability under state law; (d) a revised version of the
Project Implementation Plan, including a detailed timeline and implementation
targets for all components over the first 18 months of the project; (e) evidence
that sufficient counterpart funding has been included in the 1994 state budget
to cover the first year of project implementation; and (f) a Declaration on
Policies for the Improvement of Basic Education in Parana, signed by the
Governor, and acceptable to the Bank.
17.   At negotiations, assurances were obtained that, during the life of the
project, the Borrower will: (a) assume full responisibility for the adequate and
timely provision of textbooks to children in both state and municipal schools,
starting in 1995, regardless of the nature of federal goveniment support; (b)
with the exception of textbooks and student assessment, direct project benefits
exclusively to state schools and those municipal schools where municipalities
have concluded a valid partnership agreement with the state; (c) submit for
Bank review and approval by June 30 of each year, during implementation of
the project, an Annual Implementation Plan for all project components for the
subsequent fiscal year; (d) maintain, at all times, a Project Coordination Unit
with a project manager and core staff with qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Bank, and a Coordinating Committee under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank; (e) submit for Bank review, by March 15 of
each year, starting in 1995, an annual progress report, assessing progress
toward meeting the specific targets established the previous year; (f) no later
than 30 months after the date of project effectiveness, conduct jointly with the
Bank, a Midterm Review of project implementation according to terms of
reference mutually agreed.
18.   As conditions of project effectiveness, the Borrower will provide to
the Bank: (a) a final version of the workplan for implementing the project's
textbook provision subcomponent in cooperation with the Foundation for
Student Assistance (FAE); and (b) a revised version of the Operational Manual
satisfactory to the Bank, including final project monitoring indicators and
revised LCB bidding documents incorporating Bank comments at negotiations.
19.   Conditions of disbursement will be: (a) no withdrawals from the
Loan Account would be made for the teacher training component prior to Bank
approval of a Training Plan for the first year of the project; (b) no withdrawals
would be made for expenditures incurred by a municipality under the civil
works component, unless the Bank has been furnished with evidence that the
state and municipality have entered into an agreement (convenio) satisfactory
to the Bank; (c) unless the Bank should otherwise agree, no withdrawals would



be made for expenditures incurred by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of a
municipality, other than a municipality that has entered into a partnership
agreement with the state; and (d) no withdrawals would be made for the prize
fund, unless the Bank has been furnished with an operational manual,
acceptable to the Bank, for the implementation of the frt 1.
Environmental Aspects
20.   The project is raJt expected to have any adverse environmental impacts.
Environmental safeguards will be incorporated into contract arrangements as
well as site-selection criteria for new school construction.
Program Objective Categories
21.   Consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy for Brazil, the project
contributes to human resource development and poverty reduction objectives.
School construction will be targeted under the project to areas of high demand
for school places where the majority of families earn three minimum Walaries
or fewer. By raising learning levels and educational attainment among public
school children, the project should particularly benefit low-incorne children
who are exclusively served by the public school system.
Benefits and Risks
22.   Benefits. The project is expected to benefit approximately 1.6 million
primary school students in both the state and municipal systems. By
improving the quality of education, it is expected that the project -will
contribute to reductions in grade repetition and associated resource waste, and
increased student learning. Targeted construction of new classrooms should
also directly benefit approximately 64,000 children who live in low-income
urban areas. Additional benefits of the project include: (a) better information
and management practices within SEED and municipal education offices; (b)
the development of a decentralization model in education. that includes critical
quality and equity concerns; and (c) enhanced knowledge of the relative cost-
effectiveness and impact of various educational interventions on system
productivity through evaluation studies and support for systematic student
assessment.
23.   Risks. The project's principal risks include: (a) problems in
coordination between the state and the federal government on textbook
provision and financing; (b) the possibility of diminished political support once
the government changes in March 1995; (c) problems in the implementation of
the state's decentralization strategy; and (d) delays in implementation stemming
from SEED's lack of familiarity with Bank guidelines and procedures. With



-9-
regard to textbooks, the project aims to assure adequate provision through
requiring up-front coordination with FAE, while at the same time requiring the
state govemment to assume full responsibility for textbook provision,
regardless of the nature of federal government support. Provision of textbooks
will be carefully monitored, and will be a key element in the Bank's ongoing
evaluation of project implementation. Regarding (b), the inclusion of
municipalities should help foster a municipal constituency for the project that
will carry over beyond the change in state government in 1995 (municipal
administrations do not change again until 1997). Regarding (c), Bank support
to the state in fulfilling its part of the decentralization agreement (mainly
through the provision of training and educational materials) should provide an
incentive for the remaining 14 percent of municipalities not yet in partnership
agreements to join. With regard to (d), the project design has attempted to
minimize this risk by building institutional capacity through the establishment
of a PCU, and early attention to the development and use of standard bidding
documents and other procedures. The project Midterm Review will provide an
opportunity to reassess implementation risks and make adjustments if
necessary.
Recommendation
24.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
