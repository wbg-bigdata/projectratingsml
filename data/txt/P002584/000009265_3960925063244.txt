MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Sudan
Aaricultural Services Proiect (Credit 1 201 -SU)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on
Sudan Agricultural Services Project (Credit 1 201 -SU)" prepared by the FAO/CP. The
Borrower did not submit Part II. The Project Completion Report is inadequate. It
estimates economic returns from aggregate trends in the project areas, not from
differences between participants and non-participants.
This project strengthened Agricultural Bank of Sudan in a difficult
economic environment. It permitted thousands of farmers to buy irrigation pumps,
spare parts, sprayers and other imported inputs. Due to economic distortions,
incremental production was not exportables as anticipated but basic food staples.
Data are absent,  but farmers presumably made good use of their imported
purchases. Overall, the outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory but
sustainability as unlikely given serious sector policy deficiencies.
An audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF SUDAN
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(CR 1201-SU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Agricultural Services Project for
which Credit 1201-SU in the amount of SDR 15.7 million (US$18.0 million equivalent) was
approved in January 1982. The credit became effective in October 1982. The actual closing date
was September 30, 1989, three years behind schedule. Actual disbursements totalled SDR
14.7 million (US$17.7 million equivalent) or approximately 94% of the originally approved credit
amount. The last disbursement was made on October 10, 1990, after which SDR 1.0 million was
canceled.
This PCR (Parts I and III) was prepared by staff of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program
(FAO/CP), who visited the Sudan in May 1991. The Government has not yet submitted Part II.
The PCR is based on data provided by the Agricultural Bank of Sudan and other
Government of Sudan officials, as well as on project documentation such as the Appraisal Report,
Credit and Project agreements, project correspondence and supervision reports.

AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(CR 1201-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.   Throughout the 1970's the Sudanese economy was characterized by sluggish growth, a
stagnation of exports, a rapid increase of imports, and a rising deficit in the balance of payment
and Government budget. During this period the agricultural sector, which dominated the Sudanese
economy, provided livelihood for 80% of the country's population, contributed about 40% of
GDP, 95% of its exports and almost all the inputs for the industrial sector. The government's
development objective for agriculture was primarily focused on the irrigated and mechanized sub-
sectors as well as on the promotion of exports. It aimed at alleviating the scarcity of foreign
exchange which was depriving the agricultural sector of needed farm inputs, machinery and spare
parts. Lack of timely access to credit was another factor constraining agricultural development.
The Agricultural Services Project (ASP) was formulated in accordance with the above government
development objectives and designed to address some of the major constraints by strengthening
and expanding institutional arrangements for credit and providing for farm inputs.
Project Objectives
2.   The project's objectives were to: (a) strengthen the Agricultural Bank of Sudan (ABS) by
providing institutional support to both its Headquarters in Khartoum and the regional branches
and (b) to increase agricultural production and incomes in three areas -- Umm Ruaba (rainfed
area), Abu Hamed and Dongola (irrigated areas) by providing a supervised package of credit and
complementary services, including imported inputs. The introduction of supervised credit was
an alternative to the presently widespread sheil system of credit, where farmers borrowed money
from traders by pledging their future crops at an agreed price, usually very low. The subprojects
were seen as the first phase of a series of similar packages for other parts of Sudan.
Project Implementation
3.   Project effectiveness was delayed for almost a year due to delayed fulfillment of
effectiveness conditions, which included the settlement of outstanding accounts (Lsd 2.8 million)
owed to ABS by the Government and other GOS agencies. The procurement of irrigation
equipment, agricultural machinery and annual farm inputs registered significant delays during the
early life of the project, mainly because of conflicts between IDA and Ministry of Finance
procedures. Notwithstanding the initial difficulties, total procurement, in terms of physical units,
was much higher than expected (Table 4 Part III). Funds were available because the SAR cost
estimates were inflated, and also because of the devaluation of the US dollar against the SDR.
Data on the distribution within the sub-projects of the ASP procured machinery and inputs was
not available.
4.   The lack of support from  other Government agencies hampered progress in the
subprojects. Assistance from the Agricultural Research Corporation (for the introduction of
confectionary groundnuts), the National Water Authority (for digging tubewells), and the



- iv -
Department of Cooperatives (for establishment of cooperatives) did not materialize because the
project did not provide resources for their activities. As a result, the 250 tubewells at Dongolo
were not dug. At Umm Ruaba the creation of cooperatives (48) which started well, came to a
stop when ABS was left alone to train and support these cooperatives. At Abu Hamed,
confectionary groundnuts suffered from  disease problems.  This subproject was further
jeopardized when a government agency took over export of the crop and purchased them at low
prices; this decision totally discouraged farmers who stopped producing the crop.
5.   The construction program was implemented smoothly and was completed on schedule.
The technical assistance package and training component were both fully implemented.
Consultants assisted in the installation of a new accounting system, implementation of a new
budgeting system, review of the ABS loan portfolio and establishment of a computerized
Management Information System (MIS). They also trained ABS staff and conducted studies. The
functions of monitoring and evaluation were upgraded as planned to a Department. However,
the system was not set up until the last project year, which made collection of data difficult.
Sustainability
6.   The main issue is the country's macroeconomic situation. Continued high inflation, for
example would seriously erode the financial position of ABS. Also, the shortage in foreign
exchange would hamper the country's ability to import agricultural inputs. Another issue is the
role of ABS in input supply and marketing. This has been much argued and there have been
attempts to move the institution away from it. ABS's dominant position in this area has
suppressed the emergence of the private sector and therefore continued to influence sustainable
input supply systems.
Project Results
7.   The project was successful in strengthening ABS and introducing supervised credit as an
alternative to "sheil", especially in the rainfed areas where very little credit was available. As
a result of the project, ABS internal organization, systems and procedures, financial position and
loan portfolio achieved a substantial improvement. The provision of loans to cooperatives also
facilitated the access of small farmers to short and medium-term credit. Agricultural productivity
in the subprojects, however, did not increase as much as expected. This was partly because of
the drought and partly because of the lack of technical packages. There was a spectacular
expansion in cropped area but that was more because of other factors such as crop prices. The
economic rate of return for the three subprojects is estimated at 7 percent.
Lessons Learned
8.   The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)        Despite ABS's improved management and financial situation, the country's
macroeconomic situation can seriously undermine ABS's viability. When
lending to Sudan resumes, appropriate macro and financial conditions would
be requisites to any follow on project. Also, the role of ABS in input supply
and marketing should be re-examined.



v -
(b)        Projects which rely exclusively on the sustained commitment of Government
agencies for their success are high risk.
(c)        The trade-offs between project simplicity and a more comprehensive
approach must be carefully assessed. In particular, in this case:
(i)    Crop production development cannot be achieved solely
through input supply and credit. It must be accompanied by
timely and relevant extension and research support services,
particularly when new cultivars are to be introduced and
technical packages confirmed;
(ii)    Provisions should have been made in the project to finance
services of Government agencies, such as the ARC and NWA,
designed to support the implementation of project activities; and
(iii)   Legal agreement should have been reached with Government on
marketing and pricing of the project's agricultural production,
namely, confectionery groundnuts.
(d)        If an early mid-term supervision had been carried out, cost savings might
have been used to provide financial support to the key institutions of ARC
and NWA.

Background
1.   Economic context. The Agricultural Services Project (ASP) was formulated when the
performance of the Sudanese economy was characterized by sluggish growth, stagnation of
exports, a rapid increase of imports, and a rising deficit in the balance of payments and
Government budget. Against this background of serious economic difficulties, the Government
of Sudan (GOS) took some steps, in 1978/79, to restore the economy's development momentum.
These involved the establishment of a financial stabilization program with the support of the IMF,
the creation of an Export Action Program and a Three-Year Public Investment Program. The
latter was part of a new strategy aimed at completing ongoing projects, rehabilitating existing
production schemes and alleviating major bottlenecks.
2.   Sector development objectives. Throughout the 1970's, the agricultural sector which
dominated the Sudanese economy, provided livelihood for 80% of the country's population,
contributed about 409% of GDP, 95% of its exports and almost all inputs for the industrial sector.
Modern capital intensive irrigation schemes and rainfed mechanized activities coexisted with
traditional agriculture. The government development objective for agriculture was primarily
focused on the irrigated and mechanized sub-sectors as well as on the promotion of exports. Both
sub-sectors, however, were exhibiting a marked decline in productivity. Due to the lack of
foreign exchange, the agricultural sector was starved of farm inputs, machinery and spare parts.
Lack of timely access to financial resources was also a constraint to agricultural production.
3.   To support the recovery effort of the GOS, Bank Group lending in the Sudan emphasized
agricultural and infrastructural investments in order to help the country increase overall
production and generate more export earnings. ASP was formulated in accordance with these



- 2 -
government economic and development objectives and designed to specifically address some of
the major bottlenecks by strengthening and expanding institutional arrangements for credit and
farm input procurement and delivery.
Project Objectives and Description
4.               The project's main objectives were to: (a) strengthen the Agricultural Bank
of Sudan (ABS) by providing institutional support to both its Headquarters in Khartoum and the
regional branches and (b) to increase agricultural production and incomes in three areas -- Umm
Ruaba (rainfed area), Abu Hamed and Dongola (irrigated areas) by providing a supervised
package of credit and complementary services, including imported inputs. The introduction of
supervised credit was an alternative to the presently widespread sheil system of credit, where
farmers borrowed money from traders by pledging their future crops at an agreed price, to buy
inputs and daily necessities of life. Since this was the only available source of credit, farmers
were obliged to sell their crops at very low prices. The subprojects were seen as the first phase
of a series of similar packages for other parts of Sudan.
5.   Project description. Specifically, the project was to provide:
(a)        agricultural machinery, equipment, pumpsets and spare parts for the three
sub-project areas;
(b)        incremental annual farm inputs, research/extension support and cash advances
for these same areas;
(c)        additional ABS buildings in Khartoum and in the regions for offices, stores
and staff housing as well as motor vehicles to improve timely services to
farmers and increase ABS's efficiency;
(d)        technical assistance and training to improve ABS' operations and procedures
and to conduct studies.
Project Design and Organization
6.   Project processing. The project had its origins in a previously scheduled agricultural
credit project prepared by the FAO/Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) in August 1977.
Subsequently, a local ABS team undertook the preparation with the assistance of a seconded WB
staff member. The final version of the preparation document was presented to the Bank in July
1979 and its appraisal took place in 1980. This rather long preparation period had the merit of
involving many key staff of ABS/GOS and contributed to a better understanding of its
fundamental concept of improving agricultural productivity through the supply of input, credit
and support services by a strong agricultural bank and other GOS agencies.
7.   Design and preparation. The project was conceptually well designed and brought about
a major innovation by initiating lending to farmer's cooperatives in rainfed areas, thereby
facilitating the access of small farmers to short and medium-term credit. At the time of project
preparation, ABS operations were concentrated mainly in the mechanized farming subsector with
private irrigation. Traditional rainfed areas were neglected.



8.   The construction as well as the technical assistance components were designed with a scope
and scale commensurate with their goal of strengthening ABS operations and expanding its out-
reach capabilities. Project designers recognized that in order to increase agricultural productivity
through credit, input supply and creation of farmer's cooperatives, there was a need to
coordinate and complement ASP activities with those conducted by Government development
institutions such as the Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC), the National Water Authority
(NWA) and the Department of Cooperatives. What the preparation failed to provide was a
concerted plan of action for all these agencies and the material means to ensure that the needed
activities would indeed take place.
9.   The project design did not pay sufficient attention to marketing and pricing arrangements
which significantly altered the cropping pattern in the project areas. The Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR) states that the marketing monopoly by the Sudan Oilseeds Company (SOC) had been
withdrawn, and that confectionery groundnuts (grown under a subproject) would initially be
arranged by ABS in conjunction with European agents and local traders. However, there was
no binding agreement on this arrangement. During the project period, the SOC took over the
marketing of confectionery groundnuts, purchasing them at low prices and causing production
to decline.
10.  The project was designed at a time when the Bank did not require that appropriate
macroeconomic conditions be established before it invested in certain projects. The absence of
these conditions had resulted in an uncertain environment for the sustainability of ABS. Although
the project managed to strengthen the institution, its future viability is questionable given the high
inflation rates, GOS's financial policies, and unavailability of inputs due to a shortage of foreign
exchange.
Project Implementation
11.  Implementation period: the ASP was approved in January 1982 and became effective in
October of the same year. Its implementation (see Table 2 of Part III) was expected to span a
period of 5 years, with completion planned for September 1986. However, due to a slow start
and delays in procurement, four extensions had to be granted to see the project completed in
September 1989. The last credit withdrawal was authorized in October 1990 when the remaining
balance of SDRs 0.962 million was canceled.
12.  Project effectiveness was delayed for almost a year due to delayed fulfillment of
effectiveness conditions. These included the settlement of outstanding accounts (Lsd 2.8 million)
owed to ABS by the Government and other GOS agencies, the conclusion of a management
agreement between ABS and the Government concerning the operation of the Gadaref and Port
Sudan silos and the conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between the GOS and ABS.
13.  The procurement of irrigation equipment, agricultural machinery and annual farm inputs
registered significant delays during the early life of the project, mainly because of procedural
conflicts. ABS had to abide by IDA's guidelines as well as other stringent procurement rules set
by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). After bids were prepared and the best bidders identified,
proposals were sent to both IDA and MOF for approval. Since the criteria for bid acceptance in
MOF were different from those of IDA, proposals were not accepted immediately and
amendments were often requested by one or the other of the supervising institutions. This,
coupled with the slow movement of correspondence between ABS and IDA, caused considerable



delays which resulted in the cancellation of several bids. This problem was somewhat alleviated
when supervision missions were staffed with a procurement specialist.
14.  Notwithstanding the initial difficulties, total procurement, in terms of physical units, was
much higher than expected (Table 4 Part III). Funds were available because the SAR cost
estimates were inflated, and also because of the devaluation of the US dollar against the SDR.
The procurement of most items were much higher than appraisal estimate -- pumpsets amounted
to 580% of quantities originally planned, tractors 450%, tilling equipment 400% and 4WD -
Station wagons 800%. Urea fertilizer purchases amounted to US$ 2.8 million instead of US$ 0.6
million, or about 467 % of the original expected expenditures. Data on the distribution within the
sub-projects of the ASP procured machinery and inputs was not available.
15.  Improvement of Agricultural productivity at one of the sub-project areas (Abu Hamed)
started even before the project became effective. ABS purchased confectionery groundnut seeds
in the USA with funds from the US$ 600,000 Project Preparation Facility (PPF) granted by IDA.
While confectionery groundnuts were being introduced at Abu Hamed with the assistance of
ARC, plans were being made by ABS and NWA at Dongola to assist farmers in digging deeper
and more efficient tube wells. Farmers cooperatives were also being set up at Umm Ruaba.
However, due to lack of means for the support of these institutions, the expected coordinating
and complementarity between ABS and ARC, NWA and the Department of Cooperatives of the
Ministry of Commerce, Cooperative and Supply waned rapidly. By year five of the project, little
was being achieved and even less came to be expected from the interaction of ABS with these
institutions.
16.  The introduction of confectionery groundnuts was jeopardized further when SOC took over
export of the crop and decided that because of their low oil content they would not command a
higher price than oil groundnuts. This decision was erroneous since low oil content in
confectionary groundnuts was a premium. Farmers were totally discouraged and stopped
producing the crop. The little export taking place stopped, the corresponding foreign currency
was no longer earned by ABS, prompting the loss of its expected sustainable source of foreign
currency income. The NWA's awaited assistance did not materialize, nor did the 250 tubewells
that were to be dug at Dongola. At Umm Ruaba the creation of cooperatives (48) which started
extremely well, basically came to a stop when ABS was left alone to train and support these
cooperatives without the expected assistance of the Department of Cooperatives.
17.  The construction program was implemented smoothly and was completed on schedule.
In view of the fact that some of the civil works components had to be imported (steel structures
for the stores) and suffered some delays, project management deserves much credit for its success
in completing these works on schedule. Five branch offices and five staff housing units were built
along with four stores (totalling 6,200 m2) and three floors (1,100 i2) in the Headquarters office
building in Khartoum.
18.  The technical assistance package and training component were both fully implemented.
A consultant firm assisted in the installation of a new accounting system which became effective
as of January 1983. Other consultants also helped ABS verify its assets and liabilities, implement
a new budgeting system, review its loan portfolio and train its staff (96 staff members trained).
Approximately 128 man months were used for this exercise which also included the services of
a financial advisor (24 man months) and other consultants (8 man months) used to establish a
computerized Management Information System (MIS) and conduct studies. The functions of



monitoring and evaluation were upgraded as planned to a Department. However, the system was
not set up until the last project year, which made collection of data difficult. Information was
available on the number and type of loans granted by ABS but not on crop production. Only a
few branches are at present involved in the M & E effort.
19.  Actual project costs (Table 5 of Part III) are estimated at US$31 million, compared with
the original estimate of US$35.6 million. The credit of SDR 15.7 million (US$18 million
equivalent) was 94 percent disbursed.
20.  Risk assessment. Project risks were only taken into account in the economic analysis and
the assessment of project effects on the environment. Risks affecting project implementation and
agricultural production were not identified or accurately quantified. The issue of pricing of
confectionary groundnuts was not recognized as a risk; neither was the incidence of root wilt that
affected groundnut production. In Umm Ruaba the high incidence of droughts kept yield levels
low in spite of the increased availability of credit, seed and seed dressing chemicals. Also the
ability of the ABS to carry out the project, particularly procurement, within the SAR schedule,
was not questioned.
Main Project Results and Impact
21.  The project was successful in strengthening ABS and introducing supervised credit as an
alternative to "sheil", especially in the rainfed areas where very little credit was available.
However, the project did not succeed in making interest rates closer to positive, which meant a
fair amount of subsidy was involved in ABS credit. Because of unforeseen drought conditions,
agricultural productivity did not increase as much as expected. Nonetheless, in the rainfed area,
the availability of credit made it possible for farmers to stay afloat.
22.  Crop Production Development. As a result of the increased availability of irrigation
equipment, credit, inputs and complementary research and extension support, agricultural
productivity was expected to improve markedly. In addition, the area cropped in sesame and
groundnuts at Umm Ruaba, vegetables and confectionery groundnuts at Abu Hamed as well as
broad beans and wheat at Dongola were to increase significantly in response to project activities
(Table 6A of Part III). In actual fact, however, yields of most major crops in all three sub-project
areas were lower than those expected and the changes that did occur in areas cropped were not
those anticipated by the SAR.
23.  Yields. As shown in the table below, average yields of sesame and groundnuts at Umm
Ruaba were lower than appraisal estimates because of a series of droughts (1984185, 1985/86,
1989/90). At Abu Hamed, while yields of vegetables were 80% higher than expected, those of
confectionery groundnuts never came close to the expected levels. Aside from the distorted
pricing (see para. 16), disease (root wilt), poor site adaptation, and inadequate research and
extension support contributed to their decline. ARC support to the introduction of confectionery
nuts was erratic and did not provide the necessary technical package that would have ensured the
success of the crop. Erroneous technical practices were found in other crops as well, such as the
application of the wrong type of fertilizer on crops. At Dongola, yields of broad beans and
wheat were both about 20% lower than appraisal estimate.

24.  Area cropped. Assuming the data obtained from ABS and the Regional Directorates of
Agriculture are accurate, the changes in area cropped in the three subproject districts were
spectacular. Most, however, did not follow the trend anticipated in the SAR and could not be
attributed to the project but to other factors such as crop prices and weather conditions. In the
irrigated areas, the project's provision of new irrigation pumps did permit higher cropping
intensities. Some of the increase was done with the farmers' own resources or informal credit.
The area cropped to sesame and millet at Umm Ruaba increased (see table below) by more than
1,000%. While the area in sesame evolved according to the trend foreseen in the SAR, that of
millet was totally unexpected and resulted from the need to grow a drought resistant crop. The
expansion of millet took place at the expense of the drought sensitive groundnut. At Abu Hamed,
relatively high prices and demand explained the increase in wheat area.   Confectionery
groundnuts, however, did not catch on in spite of ABS efforts to introduce the crop. As
mentioned previously, the effects of low yields, caused by root wilt and lack of a proper technical
package, were compounded by the low prices imposed by SOC resulting in the rejection of the
crop by farmers. After peaking at 2,600 feddans in 1986 the area cropped in confectionery
groundnuts was practically nil in 1990. At Dongola, both broad beans and wheat expanded at a
high rate due mainly to relative high prices. The failure to implement the planned 250 tubewells
did not seem to have significantly hampered the expansion of the area cropped at Dongola.

25.  Farmers' Income. The over-optimistic SAR estimates of increases in income in the sub-
project areas did not materialize to the extent anticipated. Increases in farm income at
Umm Ruaba, Dongola and Abu Hamed were respectively 15, 17 and 18% compared to the SAR
estimates of 58, 229 and 292%. However, farm income rose significantly in both irrigated areas
more in response to changes in relative prices rather than to ASP. At Umm Ruaba, the impact
of the project on subsistence farmers' income was even more limited due, to a large extent, to
a succession of severe droughts. Still, access to credit by Umm Ruaba cooperative members
allowed them to buy seeds and continue cropping in spite of the drought conditions mentioned
previously.
26.  Economic Rate of Return. A global indicative economic rate of return for the project
was reestimated on the basis of available information (Table 4) and was found to be about 7%
as opposed to 33 % estimated by the SAR. It was not possible to calculate rates of return for each
district because the project cost for each was not broken down. The rate was calculated by
comparing the situation of project participating farms ("With Project") with that of non-
participating farms ("Without Project").   The PCR mission found that the yields in the
participating farms increased only minimally. Cropped area increased at the same rate for both
participating and non-participating farmers except in Abu Hamed, where project farmers had a
greater increase due to better irrigation. Another reason for the lower rate of return was that
delays in procurement of needed inputs affected on-farm development and thus the net benefit
stream. The export earnings from confectionery groundnuts also did not materialize.
27.  ABS Strengthening and the Introduction of Supervised Credit. As a result of ASP,
ABS internal organization, systems and procedures, financial position and loan portfolio have
achieved a substantial improvement. At the time of the PCR mission, ABS Headquarters was
organized on functional lines into three Departments headed by Assistant Managing Directors who
reported directly to the Deputy Managing Director. Its presence in the regions had been
strengthened appreciably. A total of 43 branches, including 24 with commercial services, were
operating under the supervision of six regional Directors. Five more Agricultural Branches and
26 village counters were to be established by 1993.



- 8 -
28.  Following the recommendations of the Organization and Management study,  ABS
redistributed responsibilities and workload among its staff. Administrative procedures at both
headquarters and the branches were streamlined and a communication system was put in place,
resulting in a measurable improvement in the efficiency of its operations and the establishment
of a functional Management Information System. In addition, the new accounting system
developed a set of complementary accounting procedures for headquarters, the agricultural
branches, the commercial branches, the port clearing branches and the silos which permitted ABS
to produce accurate annual statements of accounts. The system was, however, unable as yet to
provide a measure of the cost effectiveness of the various banking, non-banking and trading
activities undertaken by ABS because it did not provide sufficient information on expenditures
per type of activity. Achievement of this goal is currently being pursued by the Accounting
Department of ABS.
29.  Total loans granted by
ABS between 1982 and 1989           NUMBER OF LOANS ISSUED OVER 1981/1990

the ASP's sub-project areas
(See graph). It is interesting to    +  .
note that, amid the general loan
portfolio rising trend, the share
of medium-term loans had declined from 36% in 1982 to 16% by 1989 mainly because of
difficulties in importing agricultural machinery. Overall, official loan recovery rates were around
80% for the period 1982-1989, compared with 50% before the project. Recovery rates varied
from a minimum of 31 % at Umm Ruaba after a severe drought to a maximum of 100% also at
Umm Ruaba after a good rainfall year (see Table 2 in Appendix). Recovery rates were high
because farmers knew that those who did not repay could not get further credit from ABS. In
general, supervised credit in the Sudan was more constrained by the timely availability of loan
funds and inputs than by the absorption capacity of farmers.
30.  Information on ABS credit allocation by farm size and type of farmers was not available.
However, the farmers interviewed by the mission confirmed that ASP was instrumental in
significantly reducing their dependence on credit obtained from the Sheil system. The increase
in the total number of ABS loans and the large number of farmers who have contracted these
loans through cooperatives is another indication that ABS and ASP contributed to facilitating the
access of small farmers to short and medium-term credit. Furthermore, the project established
a mechanism for channelling credit to small farmers, by grouping them into cooperatives to
contract loans based on joint liability.

31.  Interest Rates/Service Charges. Charging of interest was legally abolished in 1983-84
after the introduction of Islamic Banking in Sudan. However, ABS imposes an annual service
charge, which increased from 14% to 15% on short term loans in 1984 and to 19% in 1988.
Charges for medium-term loans were on the basis of profit sharing charges equivalent to 38%
of the total loan over a three-year period. These rates were negative in real terms, since inflation
was much higher. In 1991, the inflation rate is estimated at 130%.
32.  Financial Statements. Analysis of the total income (Tables 3a and 3b in Appendix),
earned by ABS in its lending as well as commercial and trading activities over the project life,
and the total expenses incurred in the same period indicates that ABS's net profits grew from Lsd
2 million in 1981 to Lsd 46 million in 1989. However, the ratio of income from its lending
operations to total income did not increase as anticipated, but declined from 47% in 1981 to 29%
in 1989. This was mainly due to increased commercial and Government-sponsored food security
activities. Although the operating results of ABS exhibited a satisfactory financial position, its
general administration costs (including loan administration) had been increasing (as high as 75%
of total income). This increase reflected the effect of inflation on ABS operating costs and could
very well jeopardize its profit earning capacity in the future.
33.  Studies. Several studies were conducted, the most important of these were the Rainfed
Agricultural Study and the Credit study. The latter resulted in an assessment of credit demand
and supply and the formulation of a policy to enhance the agricultural credit system. Many of the
recommendations of these studies were to be acted upon by the GOS before a second phase ASP
could be considered for financing by the World Bank; no action, satisfactory to the Bank, has so
far been taken by the GOS.
Sustainability
34.  With the improvement of the financial status of the ABS through better management and
loan recovery, the institution has the potential of becoming a financially sustainable agricultural
credit agency. The main issue, however, is the country's macroeconomic situation. Continued
high inflation, for example, would seriously erode the financial position of ABS. Also, the
shortage in foreign exchange would hamper the country's ability to import agricultural inputs.
Another issue is the role of ABS in input supply and marketing. This has been much argued and
there have been attempts to move the institution away from it. ABS's dominant positiohi in this
area has suppressed the emergence of the private sector and therefore continued to influence
sustainable input supply systems. Subsequent to this project, ABS has received support from IDA
under the Flood Recovery Project (Cr. 201 1-SU) as well as from other donors.
35.  Although the demand for agricultural credit remains high, IDA has not financed a second
agricultural services project. In the last two years, IDA's lending program to Sudan (except for
disaster recovery projects) has been interrupted by the state of the economy in the country.
Discussions on agricultural credit have also been suspended. When lending resumes, appropriate
macroeconomic and financial conditions would be requisites to any follow-on project.
Bank Performance
36.  The project benefitted from the clear position the Bank took in requiring that important
conditions be met. The settling of ABS's outstanding debts, the production of audit accounts and
the increase of its capital helped it achieve a reputation for being one of the best organized banks

in the Sudan. World Bank missions were extremely helpful in providing guidance to ABS and its
consultants in building up the institution and increasing its efficiency; this was particularly true
during the early life of the project when a Bank financial analyst was in charge of the project.
The main weakness was in the staffing of supervision missions which did not always include an
agriculturalist or a procurement specialist. The presence of these specialists (e.g. under an early
"mid-term review") would have highlighted at an early stage the problems resulting from the lack
of participation of and coordination with institutions such as ARC and NWA (and possibly result
in the use of the project's cost "savings" for the financial support of these key institutions). It
would also have speeded up procurement, as occasionally happened when missions were
adequately staffed.
Borrower Performance
37.  It should be recognized that ABS pursued the project's objectives with resolution. This
included the commitment to change its methods of operations in pursuit of more efficiency, and
the speedy construction and staffing of branches for a closer interaction with farmers and
cooperatives. ABS, however, shares in the responsibility of not recognizing the need to address
(even by amending the project documents) the lack of research/extension support by ARC and
technical assistance for tube wells by NWA. In addition, an adequate Government pricing and
marketing policy would have given the introduction of confectionery groundnuts a better chance
of success.
Project Relationship
38.  The relationship between the Bank and ABS Management was good. The exchange of
views with the Bank's financial analyst during the supervision missions helped create a real and
constructive movement of ideas between the Bank and ABS. The frequency of supervision
missions kept the contacts alive and lines of communication open.
Consulting Services
39.  The consulting firms for setting up the MIS, M & E and accounting systems made a major
contribution to strengthening ABS and consolidating its role as the major vehicle for agricultural
credit in the Sudan. A total of more than 128 man months of consulting services were provided
by the project in addition to the secondment of a World Bank staff to assist ABS in preparing the
project.
Project Documentation and Data
40.  Adequacy of Staff Appraisal Reports and Major Working Papers. Original
documentation (SAR and implementation volume) were adequate but did not contain sufficient
explanations on the crop and farm models.
41.  Availability of Relevant Data to PCR Mission. Project costs and crop production data
were incomplete and often conflicting when obtained from different sources within ABS. While
some data on the loan portfolio existed at the M & E department, data related to crop yields and
area cropped in each sub-project area were often inconsistent and hard to come by.

Lessons Learned
42. The main lessons learned are:
(a)       Despite ABS's improved management and financial situation, the country's
macroeconomic situation can seriously undermine ABS's viability. When
lending to Sudan resumes, appropriate macro and financial conditions would
be requisites to any follow on project. Also, the role of ABS in input supply
and marketing should be re-examined.
(b)       Projects which rely exclusively on the sustained commitment of Government
agencies for their success are high risk.
(c)       The trade-offs between project simplicity and a comprehensive approach must
be carefully assessed. In particular, in this case:
(i)    Crop production development cannot be achieved solely
through input supply and credit. It must be accompanied by
timely and relevant extension and research support services,
particularly when new cultivars are to be introduced and
technical packages confirmed;
(ii)    Provisions should have been made in the project to finance
services of Government agencies, such as the ARC and NWA,
designed to support the implementation of project activities; and
(iii)   Legal agreement should have been reached with Government on
marketing and pricing of the project's agricultural production,
namely, confectionery groundnuts.
(d)       If an early mid-term supervision had been carried out, cost savings might
have been used to provide financial support to the key institutions of ARC
and NWA.

Underlying Assumptions
1.    Project Life. The economic life of the project was assumed to be 15 years. Due
consideration was given to residual values.
2.    Prices. All values are expressed in 1990 constant terms. Shadow prices for traded items
were derived on an import parity basis using World Bank forecasts. The value of non-traded
items was converted by applying a Standard Conversion Factor of 0.6.
3.    Exchange Rate. The official 1990 official exchange rate (US$1 = LSd 4.5) was used.
4.    Farm Labor. The going market wages of LSd 70 per day in Dongola/Abu Hamed and
LSd 35 per day in Umm Ruaba served as the basis for the economic valuation of labor.
Comments:   Since cost data was not broken down by area, ERRs for individual sub-project
areas could not be calculated.
