F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The overall objective of this second series of PRSCs (PRSC 3-4-5) is to support
implementation of Mali’s GPRSF adopted in 2006. Specifically, the development
objectives to which the PRSC-5 contributes are to:

 (1) improve the policy environment for infrastructure and private investment,
 with a particular emphasis on actions to ensure a well-managed transition
 to private ownership in the cotton sector, enhance governance in the office
 du Niger, improve the ease of doing business, enhance the financial
 sustainability of the electricity utility, and to strengthen transparency and
 accountability practices in the mining sector;

 (2) strengthen public financial management, through a strengthened legal
 framework for procurement, increased transparency and strengthened
 external oversight;

 (3) strengthen PFM in the sectors in charge of basic education and health in
 the Malian context of decentralization; and

 (4) increase the utilization of health services by the poor.

Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The objective of the second PRSC series was to support government reform to improve

strengthen public financial management and improve basic service delivery. More
specifically, PRSC 3 sought to (i) improve the business environment and enhance
governance and efficiency in the cotton and telecommunications sectors; (ii) strengthen
and modernize budget preparation, execution, controls and accountability; and (iii)
improve education and health outcomes through school feeding programs, improved
management of health human resources and public-private partnerships in the provision
of drinking water. In the business environment area, PRSC 4 focused on the agriculture
and mining sectors; in the budget area, on reporting and accountability; and in the social
sectors area, on improved management of human resources in education and health, fiscal
decentralization and co-financing the contribution of the poor in the mutual insurance
schemes. In the business area, PRSC 5 focused on actions to (i) ensure a well-managed
transition to private ownership in the cotton sector, (ii) enhance governance in the Office
du Niger, (iii) improve the ease of doing business, (iv) enhance the financial
sustainability of the electricity utility, and (v) strengthen transparency and accountability
practices in the mining sector. In the public financial management (PFM) area PRSC 5
sought to (i) strengthen the legal framework for procurement, (ii) increase transparency
and (iii) strengthen external oversight. In the social sectors area, PRSC 5 sought to (i)
strengthen PFM in the sectors in charge of basic education and health in the Malian

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2008, Mali ranked 168 out of 179 countries in the UNDP Human
Development Index. Despite numerous adverse external shocks, during 1994-2006, Mali
was able to achieve a 5 percent GDP growth rate on average per annum. This favorable
performance was attributed to political and social stability since the transition to electoral
democracy in 1992, effective implementation of financial stabilization and economic
liberalization policies before and after the 1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc, and a large
influx of external assistance (about 15 percent of gross national income on average).
Despite progress, however, Mali remained highly dependent on gold exports (69 percent of
total exports in 2008) and rain-fed agriculture, subject to wide variations in rain patterns.

2.      Four presidential elections took place peacefully, including the latest one in
April 2007. In that election, President Amadou Toumani Toure won a second and last
five-year term. His party won 117 out of 147 seats in Parliament. The political
environment was competitive, with civil society holding an important place in the national
dialogue. However, conditions have deteriorated in the semi-desert part of the country due
to perceptions of central government neglect, an upsurge of Islamic terrorism in the
broader Saharan region of West Africa and, more recently, the presence of former
mercenaries, coming from Libya. Also, numerous teachers’ and students’ strikes have
seriously undermined the functioning of the education sector. Presidential and
parliamentary elections are scheduled for April and July 2012, respectively.

3.      In past decades, Mali had made some progress in poverty alleviation.
According to government estimates, poverty declined from about 73 percent in 1989 to
68.3 percent in 2001 and to 64.4 percent in 2006. However, while the incidence of poverty
declined in urban areas, it remained virtually unchanged in rural areas, where about 70
percent of the population lives. Moreover, high population growth estimated then at about
3 percent per annum 4 made it difficult to reduce poverty rapidly. The Government adopted
a first Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF) in 2002. The growth
and poverty objectives of the GPRSF were not achieved. In November 2006, the
Government adopted an ambitious Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework
(GPRSF) for 2007-11, with an increased emphasis on measures to accelerate growth in line
with poverty reduction objectives.

4.      During the period 2003-2007, growth averaged 5.1 percent per annum, with
wide variations from year to year reflecting Mali’s high vulnerability to external factors,
including climatic conditions, commodity prices fluctuations (primarily cotton, oil and
gold), and events in neighboring countries, such as the crisis in Cote d’Ivoire. Average
inflation remained low at 1 percent, but it varied considerably due to food price
fluctuations. Mali’s external position was weak for most of the period despite an
improvement in the terms of trade in 2006-07. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants)
deteriorated from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2003 to 7.9 percent in 2007. Tax revenues


4
    Population growth was estimated at 3.6% in the 2009 census.

                                              1
increased from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 15 percent in 2006, but declined to 14
percent in 2007 due to tax exemptions to offset rising oil and food prices. Despite a
difficult international environment, macroeconomic stability was maintained in 2008.

5.      The Bank supported implementation of the GPRSF through a series of two
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). The Implementation Completion and
Results (ICR) Report of December 2009 rated the outcome of the two credits moderately
unsatisfactory. The overall macroeconomic performance was satisfactory, but a number of
indicators related to prior actions were not met, in particular as concerns reforms for
improving the business climate. Initially the first series of PRSCs was designed to include
3 credits, but the series was discontinued because it was not sufficiently focused on key
reforms.

6.      The 2007-2011 GPRSF focused on accelerating growth for poverty reduction.
It emphasized (i) development of infrastructure and economic sectors, to enhance
productivity by improving the business environment; (ii) continuation and consolidation of
public sector structural reforms, to increase public sector efficiency, particularly through
pursuing decentralization, strengthening the rule of law and fighting corruption; and (iii)
strengthening of social sectors to improve the delivery of basic social services, including
improved access for the poor

7.      The Country Assistance Strategy for FY08-FY11 (CAS) was discussed by the
Board in February 2008. The CAS stressed that higher economic growth combined with
lower population growth was essential for achieving a more rapid decline in poverty.
Higher economic growth required addressing key constraints, including an unfriendly
business and investment climate, and weak capacity, which had their roots in suboptimal
governance. The CAS was designed to assist the Government achieve the two key GPRSF
objectives on growth and public sector management. Under the first objective, the focus
was on linking Mali to the rest of the world, improving availability of factors of production
and supporting an indigenous private sector. Under the second objective, the focus was on
ensuring that public financial management would result in better service delivery by
improving the links between sector strategies and the budget.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The objective of the second PRSC series was to support government reform to
improve the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and private
investment, strengthen public financial management and improve basic service
delivery. More specifically, PRSC 3 sought to (i) improve the business environment and
enhance governance and efficiency in the cotton and telecommunications sectors; (ii)
strengthen and modernize budget preparation, execution, controls and accountability; and
(iii) improve education and health outcomes through school feeding programs, improved
management of health human resources and public-private partnerships in the provision of
drinking water. In the business environment area, PRSC 4 focused on the agriculture and
mining sectors; in the budget area, on reporting and accountability; and in the social
sectors area, on improved management of human resources in education and health, fiscal
decentralization and co-financing the contribution of the poor in the mutual insurance
schemes. In the business area, PRSC 5 focused on actions to (i) ensure a well-managed
transition to private ownership in the cotton sector, (ii) enhance governance in the Office
du Niger, (iii) improve the ease of doing business, (iv) enhance the financial sustainability
                                             2
of the electricity utility, and (v) strengthen transparency and accountability practices in the
mining sector. In the public financial management (PFM) area PRSC 5 sought to (i)
strengthen the legal framework for procurement, (ii) increase transparency and (iii)
strengthen external oversight. In the social sectors area, PRSC 5 sought to (i) strengthen
PFM in the sectors in charge of basic education and health in the Malian context of
decentralization and (ii) increase the utilization of health services by the poor.

and Reasons/Justification

N/A

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Policy area 1: Improving the policy environment for private investment and
infrastructure.

Rural development: In this area the objective of the PRSC series was to improve
agricultural productivity and competitiveness, with special emphasis on the cotton and
irrigation sub-sectors.

9.      Cotton used to be the main cash crop, but its share in exports of goods had
declined from 35 percent in 2004 to 15 percent in 2007. It was fully under government
control through Mali Textile Development Company (CMDT), a public sector monopoly
in charge of providing inputs and collecting and ginning the cotton. Cotton production was
more than halved from 410,000 tons in 2006-07 to 190,000 tons in 2008-09, due to
declining international prices, inadequate incentives for producers and low cotton yields. In
2008, CDMT fell behind in its payments to farmers for their crops from the previous
planting season. After long internal debates, the Parliament approved the privatization of
CDMT in August 2008. With the onset of the global financial crisis, however, there were
concerns that private sector interest may not be forthcoming. A gradual process was
adopted accordingly. The first step was to transfer budget resources to CDMT to pay
arrears to farmers and adopt a price mechanism aligning the seed cotton price to
international prices. The next step was to establish key institutions for the private
management of the cotton sub-sector, notably 4 joint subsidiary cotton producers/private
ginning companies, inter-professional association and the service provider for cotton
grading. The high debt burden accumulated by CMDT and producers’ organizations (POs)
in previous years was a major constraint to further improvement in the sector. It was
important to assess the dimension of the problem concerning the POs. An audit of POs’
debt was to be conducted and a plan of action would be finalized to address the problem as
a trigger for PRSC 5. The trigger was dropped, however as there were delays in recruiting
consultants to carry out the audit.

10.     In February 2010, the Government launched the bidding process for the
privatization of CMDT, with the expectation that privatization would be completed by
the end of the year. Several scenarios were envisaged, including privatization of the four
CDMT subsidiaries, privatization of some of them and no takers for any of the four
ginning companies, which would continue to be owned by the state and producers. In any
event, there was the need to create a new regulatory framework for the cotton market and
to formulate a policy for government support to the sector after privatization. Adoption of
                                            3
the legislative framework establishing the regulatory structure for the sector was a trigger
for PRSC 5.

11.     At end-2010, the partial privatization of CMDT was expected to be finalized
by mid-2011. Out of the seven companies which manifested their interest in bidding for
the four CMDT subsidiaries, eventually only one submitted an offer meeting bid
requirements according to a government report. It was eligible for a maximum of two lots.
The completion of a report on the evaluation of the financial proposals for the purchase of
shares of CMDT subsidiaries was a prior action for PRSC 5.

12.      Agricultural productivity was low. It could be increased by exploiting the
irrigation potential of the country, in particular the large land area under the control of
Office du Niger (ON), a public agency. A master plan for ON was adopted in early 2009,
after much delay. Clarifications were needed, however, as to ON’s role and responsibilities
with respect to water management and land tenure. A program and cartography of public
and private investments for the ON zone during the 2008-12 plan was approved by ON
Board in 2009. A participatory mid-term review of the plan was carried out in 2010, to
build a shared vision for the development of Mali irrigation resources among government,
large private investors, producers’ organizations and donors. Strengthening governance of
ON based on that shared vision and a participatory management of ON’s irrigation scheme
was a prior action for PRSC 5. Donors were concerned with a potential land grab by large
investors in a context of water scarcity. They agreed it was important to promote a
consensus among stakeholders for a transparent management of water resources.

Infrastructure development: the objectives in this area were to increase power access
and reliability, and improve the legal and institutional framework for key sectors. This
would contribute to improve the competitiveness of Mali’s firms.

13.     Electricity. After a failed privatization in 2005, EDM - the utility - suffered from a
large investment deficit, significant internal inefficiencies and inadequate tariff levels. A
strategic vision note on tariffs and subsidies was adopted in March 2009, indicating that
EDM’s financial equilibrium could be reached in 2011. The Government also finalized a
restructuring plan for EDM, which would be implemented with support from a Bank-
financed project. The trigger for PRSC 4 was adoption by the Cabinet of the new tariff and
subsidy policy for electricity. The Government needed more time to complete formulation
of the policy, however. The adoption of a satisfactory interim electricity tariff mechanism
became a prior action for PRSC 5.

14.     Telecommunications. Progress was made in telecommunications reform, including
the licensing of a second operator and the creation of an independent regulatory agency.
Further progress was needed, however, to expand coverage, improve service quality,
reduce cost and strengthen the capacity of the regulatory agency. The prior action under
PRSC 3 was the nomination of the council members of CRT, the telecommunications
regulatory agency. A new Communications Code was submitted to Parliament in early
2011.

Business environment: the objective in this area was to improve the investment climate
and strengthen the viability, competitiveness and performance of the private sector.


                                              4
15.     An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in 2005 showed serious obstacles to
private sector development, including a widespread perception of corruption, weak
infrastructure, heavy regulatory constraints, low labor qualification and absenteeism due to
malaria. In the 2009 Doing Business (DB), Mali was ranked 166 out of 181 countries. The
Investment Code and the Mining Code needed substantial improvements.

16.     In 2009, the Government announced a number of initiatives for improving the
business environment, including (i) establishing a one-stop window; (ii) operationalizing
the unique firm identification number (iii) simplifying corporate taxes; (iv) extending the
period of validity of import and export licenses issued to twelve months; (v) adopting
transparent procedures to allocate lands; and (vi) approving a new Investment Code. The
one-stop window was established in May 2009 and progress was made in streamlining
taxes and fees. The extension of the validity of import and export licenses to 12 months
was a prior action for PRSC 3. The submission to Parliament of a new Investment Code,
which would shift emphasis from administering incentives to assuring investors’ rights and
obligations was a trigger for PRSC 4. Preparation of the Investment Code was delayed,
however, and its submission to Parliament became a prior action for PRSC 5. In the mining
sector, an audit report of mineral taxation was expected to be completed before PRSC 3.
The completion of all validation steps and submission of a validation request to the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Secretariat was a trigger for PRSC 4. It
was not met on time, however, and became a prior action for PRSC 5.

Policy area 2: Strengthening Public Financial Management

The objective in this area was to improve the efficiency, transparency and control on
government operations and reduce opportunities for corruption.

17.     In April 2005, the Government adopted an action plan to improve and
modernize its public financial management system (PAGAM). The plan was centered
on (i) improving the quality of budget preparation and execution; (ii) enhancing the
effectiveness of tax and financial administrations; (iii) incorporating external financing into
national budgetary procedures; (iv) increasing the effectiveness and transparency of public
procurement procedures; and (v) strengthening governance through enhancing
accountability, transparency and participation. It was supported by number of donors.
The PAGAM I has since been updated to a PAGAM II in 2010/2011.

18.     Good progress was made in the preparation of medium-term expenditure
frameworks (MTEFs) for a number of ministries under the first PRSC series.
Expanding the MTEF to four additional ministries (in charge of finance, economy, security
and youth) was a prior action under PRSC 3. Another prior action under PRSC 3 was the
submission to Parliament of the draft 2007 budget execution report. Two other actions
were also expected: (i) the interconnection of ministries and regions to the chain of
expenditures system would be completed and (ii) an action plan would be adopted to
strengthen the institutions responsible for control functions of the budget.

19.     A trigger for PRSC 4 was the issuance and publication on the Ministry of
Finance’s website of budget execution reports within four weeks of the end of each
quarter. These reports would include information on the investment budget. Another
trigger was the submission to Parliament of a new organic law on the Accounts Section of
the Supreme Court (ASSC) and a new law on the status of financial judges. To improve
                                            5
budget preparation, it was also expected that the Government would adopt a framework for
project selection and prioritization, which would facilitate the alignment of donor support.
To better monitor budget execution, the Government would submit to Parliament the draft
2008 budget execution law within the deadline. Finally, to better monitor expenditure to
destination, the Government would also issue a circular to define appropriate mechanisms,
including the use of public expenditure tracking systems (PETS).

20.     There was no trigger for PRSC 5 in the area of budget preparation and
execution foreseen at the time of PRSC 3. Several actions were expected to be completed
before approval of the operation, including (i) the revision of the MTEFs for several
ministries using the new harmonized methodology, (ii) the issuance of quarterly reports on
the status of payments to suppliers within 6 weeks of the end of the quarter, (iii) the
preparation of a public expenditure beneficiary analysis in the health sector; (iv) allocation
of resources in the 2011 budget for at least 10 financial judges; and (v) submission to
Parliament of the draft 2009 budget execution report.

21.    For PRSC 5, a prior action was the submission to Parliament of the draft 2008
budget review Act, including the opinion of ASSC and definition of the modalities for the
audit of public accounts. Other actions included implementation of the new expenditure
management software PRED 5, and a change in the minimum qualifications required from
auditors in the audit section from the obligation to be in the exceptional category of civil
servants to the requirement of having adequate qualifications in accounting and auditing.

22.      A Law enacted in 2009 established the regulatory and control agencies for
public procurement. A prior action under PRSC 3 was the establishment of the regional
procurement control directorates and the independent procurement regulatory body, and
the nomination of their managers and members. Regular publication of the public
procurement gazette was expected before PRSC 3. No triggers were foreseen for PRSC 4
and 5, but a series of actions, including capacity strengthening in the new procurement
institutions, ensuring preparation of annual procurement plans in all ministries, extending
the procurement database to all contracting authorities, and preparation of an audit of the
10 largest contracts awarded in 2009.

23.    PRSC 4 included a trigger for PRSC 5 in the area of public procurement, the
submission to Parliament of a draft law revising the laws that created the Procurement
Directorate and the Regulatory Agency to align them with a directive enacted by the West
Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The Government was also expected to
submit to Parliament a draft law on Public Private Partnerships (PPP) procurement in
accordance with WAEMU directives.

Policy area 3: Improving basic social service delivery

24.    The delivery of basic services in education and health is the responsibility of
local governments. The transfer of resources from the center to the periphery has lagged
behind, however, for a number of reasons, including lack of capacity as well as
considerable resistance to change from officials at the central and regional level. The
second PRSC series sought to get the process moving.



                                              6
Education: the objective in this sector was to improve access to and quality of education.
The second PRSC series sought to support the government policy of improving access to
education in remote and poor areas and initiate a process of decentralization in the
sector.

25.     The Government launched a school feeding program in the poorest communes
to help improve the access of children, particularly girls, and retain them in school.
This program would also contribute to improving nutrition in a country where one in three
children is underweight. A prior action for PRSC 3 was the allocation of CFAF 1.6 billion
in the 2009 budget for the school feeding program in the poorest regions of the country. To
improve human resource management in the sector, the Government would complete a
national survey of education staff. A trigger for PRSC 4 was the adoption by the Ministry
of Education of a human resource management strategy to retain teachers in remote areas.
This strategy was expected to be adequately financed in the 2011 budget. A trigger for
PRSC 5 was the signing and commencement of implementation of at least 230 State/local
government contracts on regional and local programs, including teacher management.

Health: the objective in this sector was to improve access to and quality of health
services. The focus in the second PRSC series was on decentralization, human resource
management, and the development of health insurance for the poor.

26.     A prior action under PRSC 3 was the adoption by the Ministry of Health of a
human resource policy aimed at improving the availability of staff in health facilities,
with emphasis on peripheral services. A trigger for PRSC 4 was the operationalization of
the health human resource policy by establishing the National Directorate of Human
Resources in the Ministry of Health and allocating in the 2010 budget resources to finance
the deployment of at least 20 percent of the annual needs of midwives and medical doctors
in the Mopti, Kayes and Timbuktu (MKT) regions.

27.     An evaluation of the financial resources to be transferred to the local
governments was to be conducted in 2009. A trigger for PRSC 4 was the adoption of
operational guidelines for the transfer of resources to local governments and the
establishment of monitoring and oversight mechanisms at the regional level. A trigger for
PRSC 5 was the adoption and implementation by the Ministry of Health of a training
program for local elected officials and technical staff on the application of these guidelines
covering at least three health districts.

28.    In preparation for the development of a health program for the poor, the
Government was expected to build up an information system on safety net programs in
2009. A trigger for PRSC 4 was the signature of conventions regarding government co-
financing of the poor who adhere to health mutual insurance schemes, and the allocation of
corresponding resources in the 2010 budget law. In parallel, the Government was expected
to adopt and submit to Parliament a draft law creating two insurance agencies, one for
health (AMO) and the other for medications (RAMED). The Government was also
expected to elaborate a new targeting methodology and a Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) action plan for safety net programs and start implementation. In 2011, the
Government was expected to operationalize the two insurance agencies, and allocate
adequate resources in the 2011 budget to co-finance health mutual schemes.


                                              7
Drinking water: the objective in this sector was to improve health outcomes through
access to clean drinking water.

29.    A prior action for PRSC 3 was the delegation of the management of five
drinking water supply systems to private operators. The management of 15 additional
systems would be delegated to private operators in 2010 and of 30 systems in 2011.

31.     There were 9 prior actions for PRSC 3, 8 for PRSC 4 and 11 for PRSC 5. All
prior actions were met. Three triggers for PRSC 4 were dropped, one concerning ON
because the relevant actions were completed and the emphasis was put on other
instruments to achieve the objective. The two other triggers were dropped because of
delays in the formulation of a new tariff policy for EDM and of a new Investment Code.
The corresponding triggers for PRSC 4 became prior actions for PRSC 5. There were also
delays in recruiting consultants for auditing POs debts. The corresponding trigger for
PRSC 5 was changed. On the other hand, a prior action on ON governance was added for
PRSC 5 because of its critical importance for ON reform. The trigger for PRSC 4 on the
submission of the validation request to EITI was diluted because of delays in completing
the relevant steps. It became a prior action for PRSC 5. The EDM tariff adjustment
mechanism was watered down as discussed below. A large number of triggers were
reformulated to improve clarity. One was reformulated to increase the scope of the
measures concerning health insurance.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

32.     Adequacy of government’s commitment. The Government was strongly
committed to maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework and improving the
indicators in the social sectors. On the other hand, over the past decade, it has consistently
shown a reluctance to move away from state involvement in the economy, including
through ownership of key enterprises, and subsidization and tax exemption policies. The
delays in addressing the ever expanding crisis in the electricity sector and in reforming the
Investment Code are symptoms of this penchant.

33.     Soundness of background analysis. A key analytical work was the country
economic memorandum (CEM) completed in August 2006. Building on previous studies
and analyses, it highlighted priority policy measures to sustain and accelerate Mali’s
economic growth and provided the underpinnings for the growth agenda. It emphasized the
critical importance of reforms in the agriculture sector, notably cotton and irrigation
management, in overcoming vulnerability to climate shocks and enhancing food security.
Building up on an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in FY05, it indicated the
measures required to improve the business and infrastructure environment. The second
PRSC series also benefitted from a number of reports on cotton reform in West Africa by
the Bank and the IMF. The effectiveness of public spending was analyzed by a series of
reports, including the 2008 Public Expenditure and Financial Management Assessment
(PEMFAR), the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) and the
updated review of procurement in 2004. The second PRSC studies also benefitted from a
European Union study on implementing the decentralization policy based on two pilot
regions. Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and sector studies in education, health
social development and water supply highlighted the challenges facing Mali in its efforts to
move towards the targets set for 2015.

34.     PRSC 3 was designed in late 2008-early 2009, well before preparation of the
ICR for the first PRSC series. The ICR concluded that the unsatisfactory results of the
first PRSC series were in part due to the complexity of the two operations, their lack of
selectivity, and their tendency to focus on processes rather than outcomes. The second
series suffers from the same problems, but to a lesser degree.


                                             12
35.     Risk analysis. Four broad risks were identified in the three PRSCs, external risks,
such as the impact of the global slowdown, Mali’s vulnerability to climate shocks, and
impact of political crises in neighboring countries (Cote d’Ivoire), budget risks due to the
poor financial situation of major public enterprises in the cotton, electricity and banking
sector, political economy risks due to the complexity of decision making in Mali and
resistance to change, and weak implementation capacity at the national and local levels.
The external and implementation capacity risks were considered significant, the two other,
moderate.

36.     Mali’s strong track record in macroeconomic management and a comfortable
level of reserves would mitigate external risks. The implementation capacity risk would
be mitigated by technical assistance provided by the Bank under ongoing projects and by
other donors. The risk that ailing public enterprises would require large financial transfers
to public enterprises would be mitigated through strengthened financial management in
CDMT and EDM, as well as through the policy dialogue between the Government and the
Bretton Woods institutions. The slow decision making process risk would be difficult to
mitigate, as it is the by-product of a well-established tradition of political stability,
dialogue and social harmony in Mali. This tradition may be used by special interest groups,
however, as a smokescreen for resisting changes that would remove their source of rent
seeking.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

37.     A number of indicators selected in PRSC 3 were discontinued and/or replaced
by others in subsequent operations, making monitoring less than optimal. These
changes are outlined in the PDO indicator tables (pages 1-4 above) as well as discussions
in the section on M&E design (below). The reasons for these changes can be categorized
as follows.       On the one hand, programmatic PRSCs allow for a certain
adjustment/revisions of triggers as reforms evolve over several years. This may lead to
adjusting indicators (dropping and/or replacing). This was the case for several indicators in
the PRSC series, especially for electricity reforms, which did not move forward as
intended. On the other hand, on some occasions the team adjusted the original indicator as
it did not correctly capture the action and results related to the action or the originally
chosen indicators were not available due to lack of data. This was the case of some of the
social sector indicators. These changes make monitoring less than optimal as there can be
a loss of M&E continuity of the reform program and its outcomes.

38.     M&E design. The M&E design was based on the government matrix of
measures and its corresponding monitoring and results framework included in the
government’s letters of Development Policy. These letters of Development Policy and
results frameworks were in turn based on the national poverty reduction strategy
documents (GPRSF II) for 2007-2011. The M&E of the PRSC series was therefore to take
place within the GPRSF framework. The Ministry of Economy and Finance was
responsible for coordination of program implementation and monitoring of the
development results. The authorities have established a donor budget support group to
support their reform agenda, allowing better flow of information and coordination between
the government and donors and among donors. This donor budget support group meets
regularly and coordinates with the authorities as regards the content of the joint matrix of
reforms.

39.      The three operations had targets for cotton production, but actions under the
reform program would not have any influence on them. PRSC 3 had targets for ON’s
area under irrigation, but this indicator was dropped in subsequent operations. Perceptions
had changed, and there was an emerging consensus that it was important to promote a
transparent management of water resources with participation of all stakeholders, including
small farmers. The indicator was replaced by a process indicator on the number of
meetings of ON’s surveillance committee in PRSC 5. PRSC 3 had targets for EDM’s
losses, but this indicator was dropped subsequently. PRSC 4 introduced an access rate
target, but this was discontinued in PRSC5, which introduced an operating margin
indicator, which was not monitored. An income tax burden target was set under PRSC3,
but there again, it was discontinued thereafter. PRSC 5 introduced an indicator on the
number of days it takes to announce a decision on incentives under the investment code.
As indicated below, the baseline for that indicator does not appear well informed or
realistic. PRSC 4 and 5 introduced a process indicator concerning the publication of annual
reports by CRT (the telecommunications regulator). As concerns EITI, the three operations
had as indicator the publication of information. The three had indicators concerning
exports (number of documents required, time to export and cost of licenses).

40.     In the area of public financial management, the indicator concerning the
number of sectors with budget ceilings aligned with MTEFs in PRSC 3 was replaced
by an indicator on the share of primary expenditure of sectors with a fully costed
strategy in PRSC 4 and 5. On budget execution reporting and auditing the three
operations had recourse to PEFA ratings to gauge progress. Concerning procurement, the
indicator used was the share of contracts awarded after competitive procedures, not the
amounts involved, which as shown in Annex 6, has become a big concern in the
contracting process.

41.     In the delivery of basic social services area, the three operations included
targets concerning budget allocations for co-payment of teachers and the number of
children benefitting from school feeding programs in the 166 poorest communes.
PRSC 4 and 5 added the teacher pupil ratio and the primary school enrollment rate in the
166 poorest communes (total and girls). In the health sector, the three operations included
an indicator on the share of operating budget transferred to decentralized entities, the
number of midwives recruited in the MKT regions, and population covered by mutual
insurance schemes. There was no outcome indicator in the sector. In the water supply
sector, the share of days with water service indicator in PRSC3 was abandoned in favor of
the access rate in the MKT regions.

42.     M&E implementation. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) was
responsible for overall coordination of program implementation and for overseeing
progress in achieving program objectives. The monitoring of outcomes was expected to be
carried out within the M&E framework of the GPRSF. The government was expected to
produce quarterly reports on the PRSC program execution. However, this was not done.
On the other hand, annual progress reports of the GPRSF are prepared, providing
information on reforms, included some of the reforms related to the PRSC program. The
last GPRSF progress report was issued in September 2011. It reviewed four years of
GPRSF implementation (2007-2010) and set the tone for the preparation of the next
national growth and poverty reduction strategy (GPRSF-3, 2012-2017). A GPRSF unit
within the MEF has been functional and prepares these reports. A “poverty observatory?
(Observatoire de Pauvreté) works in tandem with the GPRSF unit and the statistical office
                                           14
(INSTAT) to gather and evaluate the data related to these annual reports. Sectoral
technical staff is included in the annual reviews of the GPRSF. The functionality of the
national technical units, together with the efforts of various donors to strengthen the
national capacity in M&E should be recognized as a step towards a stronger and more
effective M&E system.

43.     M&E utilization. The Bank monitored program implementation through three
implementation status and results reports (ISRs). The first one dated December 2009 did
not include a results framework. The second ISR was issued in December 2010 and
modified in March 2011. It provided information on indicators as of end-December 2010.
The last ISR issued at end-December 2011 revisited the results framework. Indicators were
not used to inform decision-making per se. M&E opportunities, during supervision
missions and during the ISRs enriched team understanding of the sectoral issues, in terms
of policy content of reforms, implementation issues, adequacy of indicators, and adequacy
- or lack thereof – of data to monitor them. This in turn affected the revision of the prior
actions/triggers and the revision of indicators. Also, the increased supervision missions of
PRSC 4 and 5 allowed further dialogue and coordination among donors within the
framework of the joint budget support group. Within this group, exchange of information
on content and progress of the budget support programs of different donors helped improve
complementarity of reforms.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

44.     The 2012-2017 GPRSF was approved by the Government on December 28,
2011. In the fall 2011/winter 2012 a single tranche development policy lending operation
(DPL) was under preparation, but has been suspended due to the March 2012 coup in Mali.
The operation was originally intended as 3rd PRSC series, but was simplified to a single
tranche design based on two factors: (i) the realization of the PRSC 3-4-5 results signaled
potential design issues for the PRSC series that were related to (ii) lack of national appetite
for a three year reform program in light of the elections that were expected to take place in
April and July 2012. It was decided to move ahead with a single tranche operation to
consolidate results achieved under the second PRSC series, and reprise further policy
discussions with the newly elected government. It was focused on (i) facilitating private
sector development through an enhanced framework for private investment in irrigation,
increased clarity in payment of taxes and reduction of transit cost at the Mali/Senegal
border; (ii) further improving public financial management, including extension of IT to
tax revenues and enhanced internal and external controls; and (iii) extending the social
protection safety net in health and the availability of midwifes in the poorest communes. A
programmatic series of two DPLs was also under preparation to improve access to quality
basic education and to strengthen the education sector management efficiency and
effectiveness.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.   The objectives of the second PRSC series are as relevant to the country’s needs
and priorities today as they were when each of the operation in the series was
appraised. The operations were fully aligned with the 2007-11 GPRSF and the FY08-
FY11 CAS. Their objectives were also in line with the two key objectives of the new
                                         15
GPRSF, which are to promote accelerated, inclusive and employment generating growth,
and to build up the human resources bases for long-term development with equitable
access to quality social services. The reforms related to the business environment (cotton,
electricity, incentive structure, investment code, DB measures and the like) were key to
achieving the GPRSF objective of promoting accelerated, inclusive and employment
generating growth. The reforms to improve PFM and access to basic services directly
supported the second objective of building up the human resources bases for long-term
development with equitable access to quality social services. Two prerequisites for
achieving these two objectives are the reinforcement of peace and security and a stable
macroeconomic framework, including sound public financial management.

46.    The design of the second PRSC series was similar to that of the first one. In
view of the unsatisfactory results of the first series, it would have been preferable to make
a pause and examine other ways for supporting implementation of the GPRSF in close
cooperation with other donors. Implementation of the second series suffered from a lack of
government commitment in the cotton and electricity sectors, and in the investment climate,
as had been the case under the first PRSC series.

Relevance for the second PRSC series is rated substantial, based on high relevance of
objectives but modest relevance of design. As noted in paragraph 46, the program
content was highly relevant to the GPRSF goals. On the other hand, the second PRSC
series had design issues, suffering from uneven government commitment. So relevance of
design is rated of modest.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

47.     Despite external shocks, including the impacts of the long political crisis in
Cote d’Ivoire and the global financial crisis, Mali has been able to maintain
macroeconomic stability and achieve a 5.1 percent average annual growth rate (see Annex
2 for more details) up to end 2011. It has satisfactorily implemented the program supported
by the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), which was
approved by the IMF in May 2008. A new three-year arrangement for about US$46.3
million was approved by the IMF Board in December 2011. Progress was made in
improving the management of the budget cycle (preparation, execution, reporting,
accounting), though further reforms are warranted in this area as well as procurement and
external control. Progress was also made in expanding access to basic social services to
poor areas. The business environment is improving, but slowly, as shown in the progress
made by Mali in the Doing Business indicators. However, as for the previous PRSC series,
the pace of reform in the cotton and electricity sectors and in the modernization of the
incentives framework was slower than anticipated. The results framework is in Annex 3.

Objective 1. Improve the policy environment for infrastructure and private
investment.

48.     Agriculture. A joint working group, including representatives of the
government, the national organization of producers and the donors has been
established. The working group has an annual meeting in which agriculture sector issues
are discussed. A draft public investment review was prepared by consultants in July 2011
for the rural development sector. The main conclusions of the report are as follows: (i)
there are a large number of poorly coordinated policies and projects in the sector; (ii)
                                            16
financing needs are huge, but disbursement rates under foreign assistance are low; and (iii)
the large potential for irrigation is poorly developed.

49.     The second PRSC series was expected to help the government complete the
reform of the cotton sector with the objective to ensure a well managed transition to
private ownership of the sector. Five steps were envisaged for that purpose: (i) help Mali
Textile Development Company (CMDT) pay arrears to producers; (ii) adopt a price
mechanism aligning the seed cotton price to international market prices; (iii) establish the
Cotton Inter-professional Association and the service provider for cotton grading; (iv)
complete the evaluation of financial proposals for the purchase of shares of the subsidiaries
of CMDT; and (v) adopt the regulatory structure for the cotton sector. All these steps, but
the last one, have been implemented. A draft law establishing the regulatory structure for
the cotton sector has been submitted to Parliament, but not yet adopted.

50.     Thanks to increased producer prices, payment of arrears to producers and
government subsidies for fertilizers (CFAF 19 billion for the CMDT zone in 2011),
cotton production has considerably increased in past two years from 190,000 tons in
2007-08 to over 400.000 tons in 2010-11. The production in 2011-12 is likely to be lower,
however, due to a rain shortfall. Privatization of CMDT remains a moving target due to
lack of government commitment. Privatization of two ginneries out of four was expected at
end 2010, then at end 2011. The opening of the financial proposals for the privatization of
CMDT ginneries took place on February 17, 2011. Discussions between the government
and the Chinese enterprise, which was selected, were ongoing as of February 2012,
however, the authorities had informed the World Bank that they did not intend to move
ahead with the privatization process before the national elections (April and July 2012).

51.     The prior action concerning Office du Niger was a step in the right direction,
but did not bring about solutions to deep-seated issues, that continue to prevent the
agency from achieving its full potential. First there is still a lack of coordination among
key decision makers on allocation of land to large investors. Second, a vision on how best
to use scarce water resources has not yet been agreed upon by all stakeholders. Third,
despite progress, ON continues to suffer from weak technical and financial management,
and low efficiency of its irrigation facilities. A steering committee for monitoring
implementation of the 2008-2012 contract-plan was established. The committee meets on a
quarterly basis under the chairmanship of the Minister of Finance.

52.     Infrastructure. The Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (CRT) has been
established and is adequately staffed. It issues an annual report which is available on the
web (www.crt.ml). The last report indicated that the turnover of the two private companies
increased by 15 percent in 2010, of which 88 percent from mobile phones. The number of
subscribers (slightly below 7.5 million in 2010) has increased by a huge 65 percent in one
year. Opening the sector to a third operator is being considered.

53.     In the electricity sector, key actions initially foreseen included: a 4 percent tariff
increase in 2009 and the adoption of a restructuring plan for EDM and its implementation,
and following a set of studies, the adoption by the Cabinet of the new tariff and subsidy
policy for electricity to gradually restore the financial balance of the utility (this was a
trigger for PRSC 4). The 4 percent tariff increase was enacted in July 2009. A five-year
restructuring plan was approved by EDM Board in July 2009 and is being implemented. In

                                             17
March 2009, the Government adopted a strategic vision note on tariffs and subsidies. To
operationalize the vision, consultants were hired to prepare an electricity tariff mechanism.

54.     Adoption by the Government of a satisfactory interim electricity tariff
mechanism was a prior action for PRSC 5. The Bank expected initially that a tariff
mechanism would be adopted. A mechanism for tariff adjustment was adopted by the
electricity regulator, but the Government indicated that it needed to be tested. The prior
action was watered down following a telephone call from the Vice President, Africa
Region, to the President of Mali, who gave her assurances that tariff adjustments would be
made. A consultant was hired in March 2011 to test the mechanism. His report was
validated in June 2011. As of May 2012, no decision has been made, however, on the
follow up to this work as regards implementation of the new tariff mechanism. Throughout
this reform process, the government has undertaken multiple consultations with
representatives of the Malian society to ensure buy-in, which had the side-effect of
delaying the reform process. In the meanwhile EDM’s financial position has continued to
deteriorate, requiring a CFAF 40 billion government subsidy for 2012 (about 5 percent of
expected tax revenues).

55.     As indicated above, Mali made noted progress in the Doing Business (DB)
indicators, but not in competitiveness. It was ranked 166 out of 181 countries in the 2009
DB report, and 146 out of 183 countries in the 2012 DB report. Mali’s ranking improved
under most indicators except for paying taxes. Progress was made particularly as concerns
the starting a business indicator, mostly the result of the setting up of the one-stop window.
For a number of activities, however, an authorization to operate is required. Hence an
enterprise may be created in 8 days, but it cannot operate without that authorization.
Moreover, Mali’s competitiveness index has not improved, as indicated in the Africa
Competitiveness 2011 report issued jointly by the World Economic Forum the World Bank
and the African Development Bank. In that report, Mali is ranked 132 out of 139 countries.
The three most problematic factors for doing business are access to financing, corruption
and inadequate infrastructure. For more details see Annex 4.

56.     The submission of a new Investment Code to Parliament was a trigger for
PRSC 4. This was not done, however, and it became a prior action for PRSC 5. The code
was submitted to the Parliament in February 2011. Its approval was delayed by almost a
year, during which the Parliament consulted on the code, including with representatives of
the private sector, some of whom did not agree with the content of the draft code. In
January 21012, the Parliament approved unanimously a new Investment Code that includes
16 amendments to the original draft submitted in February 2011. The new code was not
promulgated as of February 2012, however, and the government administration did not
disclose the new version of the code to the Bank. The indicator related to the investment
code action was the reduction of the number of days it takes to announce a decision on
incentives from 30 in 2008 to 3 in 2011. Actually, the 30 days mentioned in the results
framework for 2008 is not accurate. The administration is expected to announce a decision
within one week and 20 days, or a total of 27 days. In reality, because of a complex
bureaucratic circuit, a one-year delay or more is the norm. Unless deep changes are
introduced to streamline the regulatory framework and bureaucratic processes, a new code
per se will not make a difference.

57.     On August 28, 2011, Mali completed the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) validation process. It completed the 2006 audit of payments made by
                                           18
the industry and revenues received by the government in December 2009. The report for
2009 was completed in December 2011. Payments made by mining companies increased
from CFAF 120.3 billion in 2006 to CFAF 171.3 billion in 2009. In 2006, the government
received 3.8 percent less than declared by mining companies, and, curiously, 2.5 percent
more in 2009. The reports are available on Mali’s EITI secretariat:
www.itie.mines.gouv.ml.

Objective 2: Improve the efficiency, transparency and control on government
operations and reduce opportunities for corruption.

58.     Further progress was made in extending the MTEF discipline to most
ministries. The system is now well established. The relevant indicator has been surpassed.
The interconnection of the chain of expenditure has been finalized. A prior action for
PRSC 4 was the publication of quarterly budget execution reports for the last quarter of
2009 and the first quarter of 2010 on the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) website
(www.finances.gouv.ml). The publication of quarterly budget execution reports has
continued, in general about 3 months after the end of the quarter. The related PEFA
indicator (quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports – PI 24) has marginally
improved.

59.     As a prior action for PRSC 3, the government submitted to Parliament a draft
budget executing law for 2007. Since then, the government has submitted the draft budget
execution law for year n-2 when submitting the draft budget for year n. Since 2011, the
draft budget execution law includes the opinion of the Accounts Section of the Supreme
Court (ASSC). In 2011 ASSC started to work on the backlog of unaudited accounts, dating
back to 1960. It prepared a report on the 1960-91 accounts. The report has to be approved
by Parliament before ASSC can start working on the period 1991-2008. The PEFA
indicator on the scope, nature and follow-up of external audit (PI 26) has marginally
improved. ASSC staff has been reinforced, but is not yet up to the task. The Auditor
General of Mali (BVG) prepares an annual report which assesses public financial
management. The report is addressed to the President of the Republic and the President of
Parliament. In addition, BVG prepares a number of reports on various issues. In the
presentation of his annual report on 2010, the Auditor General emphasized that it
uncovered inadequate practices, resulting in a cost for government of CFAF 34.8 billion.
In view of the scarcity of competent auditors, the government would be well advised to
merge BVG and ASSC.

60.     A PEFA report for 2010 was finalized in July 2011. The table in Annex 5 shows
the PEFA indicators for 2006 and 2010. It shows improvement for 17 indicators out of 28
(excluding donor practices), which is commendable. Most progress was made with
indicators PI 2,3 and 6 (composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original
approved budget, aggregate revenue out-turn compared to original approved budget and
comprehensiveness of information included in budget documentation). On the other hand,
ratings for two indicators (effectiveness of payroll controls and legislative scrutiny of the
annual budget law) deteriorated. Taking account of PEFA 2010, a consultant prepared an
evaluation of public finance management in 2011, including a review of PAGAM 1 (2005-
2010) implementation and assessment of PAGAM 2 (2010-2015). The report estimates
that the fiduciary risk is high for 83 percent of operations. The report noted in particular an
insufficient control of extra-budgetary expenditures due to the proliferation of accounts
(over 3,400 accounts in commercial banks, without taking into account externally funded
                                               19
project accounts) and public agencies. The report made a number of recommendations for
improving PAGAM 2.

61.     Progress was made in building up procurement institutions. The government
has advanced with a program of reforms that included a number of institutional, legal and
implementation facets. Regional procurement control directorates and the independent
procurement regulatory agency have been established. A law has aligned the institutions
with WAEMU directives. Staff in procurement agencies has been trained. Annual
procurement plans are prepared by Ministries. The General Directorate for Procurement
(DGMP) publishes statistics on public procurement. The measures included in the PRSC
series fit within this program of reform. These measures were completed. The PRSC
indicator used for the PRSC program (Open competitive bidding procedures as percentage
of total recorded government contracts managed by DGMP) met the targets indicated in
the PRSC document.

62.      However, the procurement system still faces serious challenges in ensuring
appropriate processes and sustainable outcomes. Institutionally, a significant number of
contracts entered by public enterprises and public agencies are not processed, controlled or
even monitored by DGMP. A recent report indicated that the ministries of public works
and transport use AGEROUTE, an autonomous implementation agency, to execute their
investment budget. About 70 percent of AGEROUTE’s contracts are single source.
Furthermore, problems with budget management and treasury cash management lead to
release of credits late in the year. This in turn causes pressure on procurement procedures
and leads to single sourcing of some contracts in order to advance with needed purchases
or public works. While the percentages of single source contracts declined during 2009-
2011, the average value of each contract increased steadily (see Annex 6). And Mali is
still above the targets set by WAEMU in procurement in single source contract: maximum
of 5% of contracts should be under this form of contracting (in value as well as number of
contracts). Annex 6 provides more details on public procurement.

63.    The government has taken some measures to address procurement weaknesses,
but more is needed. One positive step is the existence of complaint mechanisms that
function relatively well. For instance, up to August 2011, according to the report
evaluating the national procurement system, of 70 complaints, 67 decisions were agreed to
and remedied by contracting parties. The decisions include remedial measures to correct
the deficiencies of the procurement processes undertaken. Also there is a control and
review of single source contracts that pass through DGMP.

Objective 3: Improve access to basic social services

64.     In the education sector, a first component of the program was to ensure an
adequate supply of trained teachers, particularly in remote areas. The Ministry of
Education completed a national survey of education staff at central and decentralized level
in 2009. As a prior action to PRSC 4, the Ministry adopted a strategy for the management
of its human resources. The strategy provided incentives to help retain trained teachers in
remote areas. As a prior action for PRSC 5, the Ministry signed 230 contracts with states
and municipalities to define the roles and responsibilities at each level. To help poor
municipalities pay their community teachers, the Government has allocated an annual
amount of about CFAF 2.2 billion in its budget since 2008. Local teachers were not happy
with their status, however. They want to be part of the national civil service. They went on
                                            20
strike for about two months to put pressure on the government regarding this demand. In
2011 the authorities, responding to teacher demands, started incorporating the teachers and
their salaries into local administration. Thus the amount of subsidy paid as incentive fell to
1.6B CFAF.

65.     A second component of the program supported by the second PRSC series in
the education sector was to improve access to schools in poor areas and enhance the
nutritional status of school children through expansion of the school feeding program.
The government was expected to allocate sufficient funds for that purpose (CFAF 1.6
billion in 2009). The program had a positive impact on enrollment rates. The number of
children benefitting from the school feeding program in the 166 poorest municipalities has
increased from close to 69,834 (of which 33,056 girls) in 2009 to 108,354 (of which
51,557 girls) in 2011. This helped increase the gross enrolment rate from 61.4 percent in
2009 to 64.3 percent in 2011. The rate for girls increased from 55 percent to 58.7 percent.
These figures are below targets, however. These achievements have been jeopardized by
conflict in the north of Mali that started in November 2011, intensified in mid-January
2012 and ended up with rebel groups taking over the north of Mali since late March 2012 5.
It is estimated that by end-May over 320,000 people have fled the combat zones, with
about 55 percent of the refugees going to neighboring countries. A large number of the 166
poorest municipalities are in the areas under rebel control.

66.     In 2009, the Ministry of Health adopted and started implementing a health
human resource policy to improve the availability of medical staff in rural and
remote areas. A national directorate of human resources was established in the Ministry of
Health. Sufficient resources were allocated in the 2010 budget of the Ministry of Health to
finance the deployment of 20 percent of medical doctors and midwives in the Mopti,
Kayes and Timbuktu (MKT) regions. Operational guidelines, including a framework for
the transfer of resources to municipalities, were adopted as a prior action for PRSC 4. A
prior action for PRSC 5 was the training of local elected officials and technical staff on the
application of the guidelines in three health districts. Health budget resources transferred to
states and municipalities increased from CFAF 0.8 billion in 2009 to 2.73 billion in 2010
and 4.31 billion in 2011, well above the target (2.9 billion). The number of midwives
recruited in the MKT regions increased from 21 in 2008 to 33 in 2010 and again 33 in
2011, well above targets

67.    In 2009-10, 51 conventions regarding the co-financing of at least 50 percent of
poor households who adhere to health mutual insurance schemes were signed.
Corresponding resources were allocated in the 2010 budget. In the 2011 budget, a budget
line was created to track budget expenditures for the expansion of health mutual insurance
schemes. The beneficiaries of health mutual insurance schemes increased from 234,000 in
2008 to about 360,000 in 2011, close to revised targets.


5
  On March 22, 2011, a military junta led by a captain took power declaring that the government was
incompetent in handling the rebellion. In the following days, a mix of Tuareg rebels and Islamists linked to
Al Qaeda took over the cities of Kidal. Timbuktu and Gao in the North of the country. They declared the
independence of Azawad, a territory covering about half of Mali.




                                                     21
68.     In the water sector, the government delegated the management of 12 drinking
water supply systems to private operators in the Gao, Mopti, Koulikouro and
Timbuctu regions during program implementation. In 2008, the management of 7
water systems had been delegated to private operators in these regions. From 2008 to 2010
(data are not available for 2011), the access rate to drinking water has improved from 61 to
62 percent in Gao, from 67 to 70 percent in Kayes, from 49 to 53 percent in Koulikouro
and from 56 to 66 percent in Timbuctu. It has not improved in the Mopti region. Overall,
in these regions it is reported that the access rate improved from 56.4 percent in 2008, to
61.4 percent in 2010. The target for 2011 was 63 percent.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory.

69.     The outcome in the first component of the program, private sector
development, is unsatisfactory. As described in paragraphs 47-58, noted progress was
made in telecommunications, EITI and Doing Business indicators. Telecommunications
Regulatory Agency (CRT) has been established, is adequately staffed and produces annual
reports. The government became full signatory of the EITI reporting process and released
its 2009 report in December 2011. DB indicators have improved markedly in the past 4
years. In the cotton sector, a cotton professional association was created and a pricing
mechanism was adopted early on to benefit producers, although this pricing system was
changed markedly in mid-2011, reducing direct payments of their earnings from cotton
sales.

70.     Key actions in the cotton, electricity and investment incentives areas were not
taken, however. These reforms are critical in determining the future growth opportunities
and growth path of the country. Mali’s growth reached a respectable 5.1 percent per year
on average up to 2011, but this growth was not job-creating. Also, in comparison, GPRSF-
2 (2007-2011) had an ambitious agenda of over 7 percent GDP growth per year, which was
not achieved partially due to lack of structural reforms. The cotton sector, the major
agricultural export of the country and source of livelihood millions of Malian farmers,
remains under the control of a public enterprise which has no clear incentives to respond to
producers' needs and remains a major obstacle to further involvement of the private sector.
Without clear incentives for the farmers and participation of the private sector, the country
is not in a position to benefit from diversification and employment creation opportunities
in the agricultural sector. Furthermore, the sector is vulnerable to cotton price and
production shocks, and when affected in the past, has turned to government for financial
support. This public financial support to bail out the sector has occurred at least twice over
the past dozen years, causing fiscal stress to the national budget. Also, since the
government has not adopted an effective tariff adjustment mechanism, the electricity
company EDM’s financial situation continues to deteriorate, leading to frequent electricity
cuts, and curtailing economic activity, especially in secondary and tertiary sectors. EDM’s
precarious financial situation has forced the authorities to provide it subsidies from the
national budget to keep it afloat. In 2011, this support added up to about 40-45 million
dollars, clearly unsustainable for the national budget in the long run. While DB indicators
have improved, the economy’s competitiveness has not due to serious challenges in the
incentive structure, infrastructure weaknesses, access to finance and governance related
issues. The new investment code, adopted in early 2012, includes 16 additional
amendments to the original draft submitted to the parliament in early 2011.

71.     The outcome of the second component, public finance management, is
moderately satisfactory. As indicated in paragraphs 57-59, there was good progress in
improving budget preparation, execution and reporting. The rating is satisfactory. However,
while there was progress in control and oversight, this was limited: (i) there was only
marginal improvements in external audit (PEFA 2010, indicator 26); and (ii) effectiveness
of payroll controls and legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law have deteriorated
(PEFA 2010 indicators). Therefore, in this area the rating is moderately satisfactory. On
the other hand, in the area of public procurement, the rating is moderately unsatisfactory in
view of the challenges still facing the system in ensuring appropriate processes and
sustainable outcomes.

72.    The outcome in the third component, access to basic social services is
moderately satisfactory. As described in paragraphs 61-65, the outcome is satisfactory in
the health sector. It is moderately satisfactory in the education and drinking water sectors,
where indicators have increased, but are lower than expected.

73.     It is not possible to give a separate rating to each operation in the series. There
was a continuum in the three operations, with adjustments in the second and third
operations to take account of delays in taking key steps and difficulties in monitoring
indicators.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

74.     The average economic growth rate of 5 percent is not sufficient to generate the
employment required by a population increasing at 3.6 percent per annum, one of the
highest rates in the world. The growth agenda has been hampered by critical constraints,
which are not reformed due to considerable resistance by special interest groups. Budget
support by a number of donors, including the Bank, has helped increase allocations to the
social sectors. The second PRSC series has focused on improving access to basic social
services in the poorest areas of the country, with some success. The number of
beneficiaries from mutual health insurance schemes, particularly in the poor segments of
the population, has considerably increased. The accelerated recruitment of midwifes in
poor regions will no doubt have an impact on maternal and infant mortality. These
achievements are being jeopardized, however, by a resurgent Tuareg rebellion, which has
caused a large displacement of population in the country.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.     The operation, by focusing on Doing Business indicators, has helped the one-
stop window of the Investment Promotion Agency (API) to improve its performance
and build capacity. It has also contributed to improving the capacity of the planning units
in sectoral ministries through the discipline of the MTEF. Progress made in developing
capacity in public procurement was undermined, however, by an increasingly
unsatisfactory implementation of existing regulations.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

76.     There are substantial pressures on macroeconomic management despite the
authorities' intentions to continue the reform track/safeguard past
economic/development achievements. Already, poor rainfall in 2011 had placed some 3
million people in jeopardy and the government had launched an emergency mitigation
program in late 2011. The March 2012 coup and subsequent security and political
developments leave little room for the government to focus on development policies and
objectives in the short term. When a transitional period is launched, there may be room to
introduce some reforms 6 . Security considerations are likely to distract decision makers
from development policies at least for the short term. Security-related expenditure may
increase substantially, crowding out other sectors in the short- and even medium- term.
Hostilities have triggered the displacement of some 320,000 by end May 2012, of which
approximately half are internally displaced persons. Taking care of the internally displaced
refugees will require additional expenditure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

77.     The quality at entry is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory. The second series
of PRSC was launched without analyzing the results of the first one and the reasons for its
serious shortcomings. In November 2007, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) issued
an evaluation of the country assistance to Mali. The report concluded that in many areas,
such as macroeconomic stability, the strategy led to good progress, but there were major
shortcomings as well, which dampened prospects for sustainable growth, because the
strategy did not get full government support, as was the case with the disappointing
progress in energy and cotton sector reform.

78.     The objectives of the three operations in the second series were highly relevant.
Their design was less than adequate. It was clear from the outset that there was little
government ownership in key reforms (cotton, electricity and incentives), leading to weak
outcomes in the series. At least on one occasion, technical assistance was to be extended to
help the Government implement the program, but it did not arrive in a timely manner,
affecting the reform content and timeline. This is the case of delays in recruiting
consultants for auditing POs debts. It led to the corresponding trigger for PRSC 5 to be

    The ICR was drafted before the military coup and the subsequent declaration of independence of Azawad.

                                                     24
changed. Several triggers had to be reformulated or changed because of lack of progress.
Several indicators were dropped in mid-course and/or replaced by others because of
revised triggers, inappropriate choice of indicators, and/or not taking into account the
weakness of the statistical system in gathering the data needed for the indicators chosen
originally.

79.     Furthermore, the decentralization agenda in the social sectors was not
supported by a set of critical accompanying measures, such as, for instance linking
allocations to performance. Also, the grant for the TA project to support governance and
decentralization efforts which was supposed to be launched with PRSC 3, and support the
PFM and service delivery reforms of the PRSC series only became effective in August
2011, at the end of the PRSC series. The delay was partially related to the complexity of
developing a multi-sectoral approach to support the decentralization efforts, in a national
environment marked by weak capacity. The multi-sectoral team at the Bank took time to
develop a well identified and appropriate technical assistance project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

80.     There was a clear break in the quality of supervision between PRSC3 and
PRSCs 4 and 5. This was due to the fact that at end of PRSC 3, the ICR for the first series
of PRSCs (PRSC 1 and 2) came out noting the need for much closer supervision. The
supervision of PRSC 3 is rated moderately unsatisfactory. No attempt was made to monitor
results indicators. The supervision report did not provide any information on actions taken
and on potential issues. However, the supervision of PRSC 4 and 5 is rated satisfactory.
After the ICR, in both cases, there were more missions of longer duration and closer
supervision. The results framework was updated and the reports were focused on issues.
The two first supervision reports rated the operations moderately satisfactory. The third
report rated PRSC 5 moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

81.     The Bank should have looked more carefully into the reasons for continued
delays in taking appropriate actions for improving the investment climate and
reforming CMDT and EDM. There was a disconnect between Bank supervision of the
first PRSC series and the ICR. The second PRSC series suffered from the same design
weaknesses than the first one.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

82.     The performance of the borrower is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The
Borrower maintained macroeconomic stability in spite of a difficult international
environment, but did not implement the structural reforms required for improving the
capacity of the economy to accelerate growth and create jobs, undermining the goals of its
GPRSF. This was primarily due to lack of ownership of certain structural reforms, but also
due to the lack of national capacity to implement the reforms Mali was interested in
undertaking. Furthermore, despite the two series of DPLs focusing on public financial
management, the efficiency of public expenditure is still low. During implementation,
insufficient attention was devoted to monitoring progress regularly at the national level.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance did not prepare quarterly progress reports (as had
been agreed to with the Bank) and did not keep track of indicators related to the program
on a regular basis.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

83.     The program was complex, ambitious and clearly did not have the full buy-in
of the national authorities on key structural reforms. The lesson to take from this is that
credibility of the World Bank is diminished when key actions are constantly delayed or
watered down to maintain a program, such as, for instance, the adoption of a mechanism
for electricity adjustment. Therefore, content of program and prior actions should be
carefully selected, ensuring full buy-in of authorities, potentially on a more focused range
of reforms. It is interesting to note that in spite of two series of PRSCs focusing on
improving public financial management, inter alia, major problems, such as the
proliferation of bank commercial accounts of public entities, remained unaddressed. The
creation of a single Treasury account should have been a major feature of early operations.
It was eventually picked up in the recently approved IMF-supported program.

84.     Building a consensus is essential for introducing reforms. The decision making
process is slow in Mali, as leaders seek to build consensus. As experience has shown,
however, this results in constantly postponing much needed reforms. It can also act as a
smokescreen for a small rent seeking elite that is likely to resist any reform that would
reduce its privileges, even if it would benefit a large part of the population. As already
indicated in the ICR for the previous series of PRSCs, a political economy analysis is
needed to better understand opposition to reform, particularly in sensitive areas, such as
cotton, electricity and incentives in Mali.

85.   Technical assistance is critical to help a low capacity administration
implement a complex reform program. A technical assistance project was envisaged to
accompany the second PRSC series, but its processing was considerably delayed.
                                            26
Eventually a governance and decentralization TA project was approved on April 28, 2011
to strengthen capacity for public financial management at decentralized level for improved
budgetary decision-making and enhanced transparency and oversight. This project came on
stream too late to help implement the decentralization agenda supported by the second
PRSC series in the social sectors. This agenda was complex and could not bring about
expected results without specific mechanisms put in place, such as linking transfer of
resources to performance on a contractual basis. At the same time, provision of technical
assistance cannot affect reforms where there is no national buy-in and commitment by the
authorities, no matter the timing and quality of such assistance.

86.     Rapid population growth (3.6 per cent per annum estimated in the 2009
census) is not conducive to significant poverty reduction in a fragile environment.
Economic growth at about 5 percent per annum is a solid achievement, but not strong
enough to make a sufficient dent in poverty. The main obstacle to higher economic growth
is the poor investment climate due to weak physical infrastructure, limited access to
finance, and corruption. Over the past decade the Government has been slow in
introducing structural reforms which would improve the business environment, with the
result that private investment remains at a low level and job creation in the private sector
remains weak.

87.     Indicators are signals given to stakeholders on expected outcomes. They have
to be carefully selected and monitored. World Bank credibility is diminished when many
indicators are dropped/revised/introduced in mid-course. In this series too many indicators
had to do with processes. Several were dropped in mid-course, others replaced. For some
of them, the baseline was inaccurate. If indicators are not taken seriously by the Bank, it is
not surprising that the Borrower does not take appropriate measures to monitor them.

88.    After an unsatisfactory program, it is necessary to take a pause and review in
detail with the Government the reasons for poor performance. This was not done,
however, and the PRSC series 2 was launched immediately after completion of the first
one. Budget support should not be seen by the government as an entitlement.

89.      In the health and education sector, a lesson from the PRSC series is the clear
need to continue strengthening service delivery for education and health in rural and
underserved areas for more equitable access. In this perspective, the need to move
ahead with the decentralization agenda is clear, as regards strengthening administrative and
institutional capacities and financial resources. It is important to link allocation of
resources to performance for the decentralization to be successful

Table 2: Average value of contracts by method of procurement (CFAF million)
                             2009                2010            2011
 Open competition            150,523             210,517         185,850
 Limited competition         107,712             335,475         397,901
 Sole source                 332,237             510,663         859,223

Table 2 above shows that on average the value of contracts based on open competition is
lower those based on limited competition, which is lower than single sourced contracts,
which runs against all generally accepted practices. It shows also that while the average
value of contracts based on open competition does not increase over the period, this is not
the case for the other contracts. The average value of a single sourced contract in 2011 was
CFAF 859 billion, about US$ 1.8 million.

       Annex 9: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


Mali experienced a military coup on March 22, 2012, while the ICR report was being
prepared. Subsequently, the World Bank declared OP 7.30, suspending the World Bank
program except for emergency assistance. At the time of the finalization of the report, the
WB was still operating under OP 7.30.
