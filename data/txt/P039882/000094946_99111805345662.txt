A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The objective of the project is to improve Benin's business enviromnent, local enterprises'
competitiveness, and access of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises to credit.
This would in turn help the country diversify its economy and reach its goal of achieving a GDP growth of
at least 5 percent per annum over the coming years.
The project will address lingering constraints in the regulatory and institutional framework for private
sector development, through an improved dialogue between business representatives and Government and
accelerated privatization of some key enterprises. It will seek to enhance the competitiveness of
enterprises and help them become more efficient and export-oriented through support to export
associations and firms. Finally, it will help strengthen two promising financial institutions, the credit
institution for micro-enterprises (PADME) and the credit institution for small and medium enterprises
(PAPME).
Performance indicators include increase in private sector investment, reflecting an improved business
environment, growth of employment in the private sector, growth of non-traditional exports, and financial
and institutional sustainability of the two credit institutions.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
The May 1994 CAS indicated that the Bank would assist the Government achieve its medium-term target
of 5 to 6 percent GDP growth by supporting increased private sector investment, expanding the scope of
the divestiture program to infrastructure and public utilities, and creating a favorable environment for
private sector activities.
CAS document number: IDA/R94-81          Date of latest CAS discussion: May 1994
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Following a decade of economic decline, the Government of Benin launched a structural adjustment
program in 1989 aimed at restoring the conditions for sustained growth and achieving a viable external
and domestic financial position. The program included: (i) rebuilding a sound banking system; (ii)
establishing the basis for a market economy through a policy of economic liberalization and privatization;
and (iii) restructuring essential Government activities and strengthening priority social services.
The CFA franc devaluation in 1994 provided a strong impetus to the Government's reform program. The
economy responded well. Spurred by a strong private sector supply response, growth accelerated
significantly since 1995 to reach an average of 5.6 percent in 1996-97. The economy remains highly
vulnerable to extemal factors, however, as evidenced in 1998 by the difficulties in securing adequate
power supply from Ghana, and in 1999 by the decline in the world price of cotton, which represents about
85 percent of Benin's exports.
Despite progress in recent years, the private sector investment rate remains at a low 12 percent of GDP. A
more pro-active stance is required to maximize Benin's growth potential and fully exploit opportunities
created by political stability, the devaluation of the CFA franc, macro-economic reforms, a vibrant
commerce sector, and a large pool of SMEs and micro-enterprises.
The remaining key obstacles to a stronger and sustainable private-sector supply response include: (i)
inefficient port and customs operations; (ii) high cost and low reliability of public utilities; (iii) low
productivity of the labor force; (iv) inadequate technical and managerial skills; (iv) and a poorly

performing judiciary system. SMEs and the informal sector are expected to make a major contribution to
the structural transforination of the economy and growth sustainability. They are however constrained by
lack of access to finance and business support services, and high production costs due to the narrow
industrial base (inputs, spare parts, packaging material, etc.).
The Government's strategy was defined during the 1994 Private Sector Development Round Table and the
National Economic Conference held in December 1996. It aims at: (a) improving the legal and regulatory
environment; (b) strengthening private sector representation (i.e. Chamber of Commerce, professional
organizations); (c) upgrading the provision of support services to entrepreneurs; and (d) improving the
economic and institutional infrastructure for domestic and export activities. To address sector issues, the
Government has taken a series of steps. It participated in the OHADA initiative to update and harmonize
business laws at the regional level, and organized a workshop resulting in recommendations to address the
deficiencies of the legal and judicial system (Etats Gen6raux de la Justice in December 1996). With
respect to improving infrastructure, the Government is developing a comprehensive electricity sector
policy aimed at bringing competition in generation, privatizing the distribution company, and setting up a
new regulatory framework. In the transport sector, the Government is examining options to improve the
performance of the port of Cotonou to reduce delays and costs. As regards telecommunications, an ad-hoc
committee has been appointed to design a comprehensive telecommunication reform with the aim of
opening-up the sector to competition and separating postal activities from telecommunication services.
The Government also presented donors with plans to establish an enterprise financing mechanism (Fonds
de Promotion Economique) and to create an Export-Processing Zone (EPZ). The positive element in the
Government's strategy is a clear commitment to private sector development and the increasing role of the
private sector. The potential danger is a reversion to a more interventionist role. Thd7onds de Promotion
Economique may become a new version of the old development banks, and the EPZ initiative may be a
substitute to implementing structural reform in the utilities sector and to improving port and customs
operations efficiency.
After the banking crisis of the late eighties, Benin's financial sector recovered with support from a number
of donors. Although the formal financial system (including five banks, two insurance companies and three
non-bank financial institutions) has improved during recent years in terms of management and services to
clients, small and micro-enterprises continue to have difficulties accessing credit.  This situation
contributed to the establishment of a number of institutions (most of them through donor-financed
projects) aiming at addressing the problem of access to financial services by clients with limited resources.
They include cooperatives, saving and loans associations, and credit programs. Two of these, Projet
d'Assistance a la Petite etMoyenne Entreprise (PAPME) and the Projet d'Appui au D6veloppement de la
Microentreprises (PADME) were created in 1993 under a now closed Bank-financed project (Public
Enterprise Sector Rehabilitation Project-FY86). PAPME has been providing technical assistance and loans
(cofinanced with Bank of Africa-Benin) to smal enterprises, while PADME focuses onmicroenterprises.
PAPME and PADME have been quite successful in their lending operations and have increasingly been
able to cover operating costs from the spread of their operations.With the exception of certain types of
micro-finance institutions, financial institutions are regulated and supervised at the level of the West
African Economic and Monetary Union. Regional agreements provide special arrangements for the
supervision of microfinance institutions.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project strategic focus is consistent with the CAS objectives. The project will address two main
sector issues:
a) it will improve the business environment and competitiveness of local enterprises by developing new
markets, developing non-traditional exports, improving access to business support services, and providing
more tailored business information to exporters.



4
b) it will foster private-sector supply response by providing financial and other services toSMEs and
micro-enterprises.
In parallel, the weaknesses in the legal and judicial environment need to be addressed. Given the scope of
the support required, a self-standing IDA-financed project is currently envisaged. Itwould include a
review of business laws and regulations, a large trainingprogram for the Ministry of Justice and court
staff, an increase in budgetary allocations, and the rehabilitation of court buildings and facilities. Two
ongoing Bank-financed projects support the privatization of utilities and the improvement of port
operations.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The project includes three components. The first component aims to remove remaining policy
constraints to private sector development and exports through concrete actions agreed in the context of an
improved dialogue between the Government and the private sector. This component will also support the
privatization program. The program will include the privatization of two textile companies and the
adoption of a new sectoral policy for the textile sector. It will also include the design and implementation
of a revised sectoral policy in the telecommunication sector to increase sound competition and efficiency.
Some of the remaining public enterprises will also be privatized. The second component will help local
firms enhance their competitiveness and develop extemal markets for their products. It will assist ADEX,
the recently established association for export development in providing services to its members. The
component also includes a matching grant fund and support for trade information services. It will help in
the review of the feasibility of an EPZ in light of progress made in privatizing utilities and in improving
port and customs operations performance. Thethird component will build on recent efforts to develop
PAPME and PADME into sustainable financial institutions specifically geared to meet the needs oiSMEs
and micro-enterprises. PAPME and PADME were established in 1993 as projects to provide credit to
SMEs and micro-enterprises. Their performance to date has exceeded expectations, with collection rates
above 92 percent. These two institutions are expected to be fully sustainable by the end of the project.
The component will also strengthen micro-finance supervision in the Ministry of Finance and support the
development of ALAFIA, a micro-finance NGO providing training services to its members.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project will help the Government focus on remaining policy and institutional constraints to private
sector development through a proactive dialogue with business. It will help the textile and
telecommunications sectors become more efficient through the privatization of two textile companies and
the implementation of competition-oriented regulatory frameworks in the textile and telecommunication
sectors. Finally, it will help develop institutions providing technical and financial services toSMEs and
micro-enterprises.
3. Benefits and target population:
By promoting a better business environment, the project will contribute to sustained economic growth and
employment creation. By focusing on competitiveness and exports, the project will contribute to the
strengthening of the country's budding SME sector and diversification of its exports. By supporting the
development of specialized financial institutions forSMEs and micro-enterprises, the project will help
local entrepreneurs expand their business.
Target population: SMEs and micro-enterprises; exporters; potential foreign investors, including nationals
living abroad; Benin's workforce and the unemployed through increased job opportunities.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Implementation period: four years and a half (January 2000 to June 2004)



6
Executing Agencies:
The business environment component will be implemented by ADEX and by the technical coordinating
unit CAT (Comite d 'Appui Technique) in collaboration with the Commission de Denationalisation
(CDN), the privatization unit in the Ministry of Planning. ADEX has a broad mandate to address
competitiveness and export development activities. Its 12-member Board includes representatives from
the private sector, banks and Government (2). ADEX's secretary general was recently selected from the
private sector. The privatization sub-component will be managed by CDN.
The competitiveness and export development component will be managed by ADEX, including the
matching fund, with assistance from an intemational consulting firm for the first two years. ADEX will
execute its part of the project under a grant agreement with the Govermnent. The EPZ sub-component
will be managed by the technical unit (CAT) established in the Ministry of Industry andSMEs to provide
overall project coordination.
The financial institution component will be implemented by PAPME and PADME for their respective
components, and by CAT as regards strengthening (a) the micro-finance supervision unit in the Ministry
of Finance and (b) ALAFIA, the microfinance network. PAPME and PADME will implement their part
of the project under financing agreements with the Govemnment.
Project Coordination. A National Committee was established to follow-up on recommendations of the
Private Sector Round Table (Comite National deSuivi - CNS), with representatives from the ministries
concemed and the private sector. CNS is a deliberative body. Its implementation arm is CAT. CAT will
be in charge of ensuring coordination between the project components and conducting the dialogue with
the Bank and other donors. It will also have a supervision role over procurement, disbursement and
accounting. CAT will ensure compliance by the executing agencies with their financial reporting and
auditing requirements. CNS will be in charge of project oversight and will conduct annual reviews of
progress and achievements.
The Government will make available funds from the credit to ADEX on a grant basis. The Government
will provide funds from the credit for technical assistance, training, and operating costs to PADME and
PAPME on a grant basis. Onlending interest rates on the lines of credit will be tied to the interbank rate.
Procurement, disbursement, accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements. The project
will have three Special Accounts, one for PAPME, one for PADME, and one for CAT for the overall
coordination and the other components. Under CAT supervision, each will have responsibility for
procurement and financial management issues. CAT will review all disbursement requests. To this end,
CAT will recruit an additional financial management specialist with procurement skills to provide
assistance to the executing agencies.
An overall procedure manual designed for the project was agreed upon during negotiations. An
intemational audit firm is preparing the accounting manual. The establishment of the financial
management and accounting systems, and the matching accounting manual will be a condition of credit
effectiveness. The three special accounts for CAT, PAPME and PADME for their respective components
will be opened at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. All project accounts, including special accounts,
and all disbursements under SOEs will be audited annually according to international auditing standards
by an independent auditor already identified. The annual audit report will be submitted to IDA within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, the financial statements of ADEX, PAPME, and
PADME will be audited annually.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements. Each implementing agency will prepare quarterly progress
reports, on the basis of the project implementation plan and the initial logical framework. CAT will

prepare an overall progress report prior to Bank supervision missions and for the project mid-term review.
The Government will prepare and transmit to IDA an implementation completion report within six
months of the closing date.
Key performance indicators for each component have been agreed upon during appraisal and finalized
during negotiations. As regards the competitiveness and export promotion component, it was agreed
during negotiations that a set of indicators would be reviewed annually by the representatives of all major
stakeholders through project implementation workshops. The output of these workshops will serve as a
basis for monitoring and evaluating project effectiveness. A mid-term review will be carried out by
December 31, 2001. The review will be to assess the overall progress in project implementation. An
evaluation of the matching grant fund scheme will be carried out with recommendations for any
modifications. Proposals for actions determined through the dialogue process betw-een the Government
and private sector representatives will be reviewed. The competitiveness and export increase outputs will
be evaluated. Overall project coordination activities will be reviewed.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Broader range of intervention. Given the large number of constraints facing the private sector, the most
appealing approach was to prepare a much broader operation including a large legal and judicial
component. However, given the different requirements and readiness of each component, such an
approach would have led to delay the support to the two credit institutions at a critical stage of their
development. In addition, management of the overall operation would have been more complex in an
environment characterized by limited government capacity. Finally, the involvement of other donors, and
the necessity for the private sector to take a more pro-active stance in identifying problem areas and
seeking solutions without relying heavily on donors, led to the proposed project design.
Bank involvement in the EPZ. Bank experience with EPZs in Africa has raised doubts about the
efficiency of such schemes as a means to enhance and diversify exports and attract investment. In the
absence of structural reforms in the areas of infrastructure, customs and port operationsEPZs have not
perfonned well. These reforms are being initiated under ongoing Bank-financed projects and must be
carried out first. Therefore, Bank involvement under this project will be limited to carry out feasibility
studies and define critical actions for the Government to design a successful EPZ.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The proposed project draws heavily on Bank-wide best practices developed in micro-finance, export
development, and matching grant design and management.
Business development, competitiveness and export promotion. As in other African countries, policy
adjustment alone aiming at setting-up the right macro framework has proven insufficient to generate a
strong private sector supply response. A more proactive approach is needed. The policy dialogue on
export competitiveness and the proposed design of the matching grant scheme take into account lessons
learnt from IDA- and Bank-supported projects in other African countries such as Senegal and Madagascar.
Key success factors have been several. An engaging public-private sector dialogue on specific issues with
clear performance indicators was initiated.  Specialized and well-tailored services to firms and
associations were provided. Through the use of the matching fund scheme the capacity of local
consultants was strengthened to improve the availability of business support services over time.
Recipients were required to share the cost of services to ensure high quality and commitment. An
independent, private sector-based agency was hired to manage the scheme to ensure operational
independence and transparency. Market-based knowledge of international business opportunities was
built. Participatory tools were used to build ownership and commitment to remove obstacles to exports
and engage in foreign markets.
Financial support to SMEs and micro-enterprises. This component builds upon two successful
ongoing Bank-supported SME and micro-enterprise finance schemes in Benin. With the SME pilot
scheme (PAPME), a new financial mechanism was set up to provide loans jointly with commercial banks.
Since 1993, the risk-sharing process has gradually evolved from 10/90 to 25/75, and several banks are
now using the mechanism, although not on a consistent basis. The outstanding portfolio is currently
US$2.5 million. The ultimate objective of the pilot is to successfully transfer part of the portfolio to the
banks. With the micro-finance pilot scheme (PADME), more than 3,000 micro-entrepreneurs have
borrowed a total amount of US$1.8 million. Repayment rates at above 92% and growing demand have
enabled the pilot schemes to scale up and recover most of their operational costs. At present, PADME and
PAPME are entering the institutionalization phase. Technical assistance will be provided under the project
to successfully implement this critical stage for their sustainability. Experience gained with these pilot
schemes is reflected in the design of the project.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Overall commitment to reforms. The Government has sponsored a series of joint public/private sector
initiatives (Private Sector Round Table in 1994, SME workshop in October 1995). It has set up the
Comite National de Suivi, a joint steering committee, to coordinate donor activities in the area of private
sector development. It has committed adequate funding to finance the action plan resulting from the
Private Sector Round Table. The Government is committed to pursuing its adjustment program, despite
an uneven pace, including the privatization of the largest remaining public enterprises (public utilities) and
the adoption of pro-competition regulatory frameworks. It has specifically requested Bank assistance in
the areas of legal and judicial reform and enterprise development.
Business development, competitiveness and export promotion. Major changes are required to boost
Benin's competitiveness and exports at the policy, institutional and firm level. Government commitment
can be measured by several factors. The Government is willing to engage in an active policy dialogue. It
is supporting ADEX, a private sector-led organization, to play the lead role in export promotion. It has
accepted to transfer proceeds of the IDA Credit as a grant to finance part of the matching grant to
beneficiaries. It has agreed to establish benchmarks and a timetable to implement reforms in the
telecommunication and port sectors to create an enabling environment for the proposed EPZ.
Micro-finance and enterprise development. The Govenunent and other micro-finance institutions
recently adopted the PARMEC law. It organized a sub-regional micro-finance seminar in May 1998 to
disseminate best practices. It has established a micro-finance supervision unit within the Ministry of
Finance and is strongly committed to supporting the transformation of the two pilot project schemes
(PAPME and PADME) into autonomous and sustainable private institutions. The Government's
commitment is shown in a signed agreement to transfer all of PADME's and PAPME's assets on a no-cost
basis to the institutions.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank is the best-placed institution to combine an active policy dialogue for the removal of obstacles
to private sector development, with a pro-active involvement in the attainment of growth objectives at the
sector level. Most of the policy reform measures over the past few years in Benin were carried out under
the Bank-supported structural adjustment program. Major reform areas included trade liberalization,
privatization, and the restructuring of the banking sector.
To generate a strong supply response, ongoing reforms must be complemented by concrete, targeted and
more pro-active actions aimed to overcome market imperfections, such as lack of business information,
poor institutional capacity and an inadequate financial system. The Bank is well positioned to assist all
stakeholders in Benin achieve a long-term shared vision for economic growth and private sector
development.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic Analysis (supported by Annex 4)
Cost Benefit Analysis: NPV = US$ 23.2 million; ERR = 27.8%
The net present value of the project is estimated at about US $ 23.2 million for a 12% discount rate, and its
internal economic rate of return is estimated at 27.8%. The component on Competitiveness of Enterprises
showed a high rate of 34.6%. The payback period is estimated at 3 years and the NPV is zero when the
ERR is 12%. It is also expected that 2,300 jobs will be created in the export sector. The fiscal impact is
estimated at US$ 10.6 million mainly from corporate and personal income taxes.
2. Financial Analysis: n.a.

3. Technical Assessment:
There is a growing body of evidence that sustainable export-led growth requires removal of obstacles at
the policy level, while addressing sector institutional constraints and fostering competitiveness at the finn
level. The project will intervene at all levels by supporting result-oriented public-private sector dialogue
for removing policy obstacles, restructuring the export promotion framework to transform it into a joint
private sector-led organization more responsive to the needs of firms, and setting-up a matching fund to
foster firm-learning and access to markets. The micro-finance and enterprise development component is
built on the successful experience of the two pilot operations.
4. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: (See Section 4)
b. Project management. Ongoing projects, identified by other donors during the Private Sector Round
Table held in 1994, are often impeded by lack of strategic coordination and perspective between various
donors. It was therefore agreed during appraisal that CAT will ensure internal project coordination and
dialogue with the Bank and other donors. With respect to management, procurement and accounting, the
three project components will be carried out by private associations under CAT supervision, and by CAT
itself for assistance to the EPZ, support to ADEX, and the privatization sub-component. Over the past
years, CAT, PAPME and PADME have acquired good knowledge of Bank guidelines and procedures
under the Public Enterprise Sector Rehabilitation Project, now closed. In addition, during the appraisal
mission, an agreement was reached with Government representatives that CAT would recruit an additional
financial analyst with procurement skills to assist in the supervision of the financial management,
procurement and disbursement aspects of the project. The recruitment of the financial specialist will be a
condition of effectiveness.
5. Social Assessment:
The project will address poverty issues by increasing investment and generating employment
opportunities in the informal and formal sectors. Through financing provisions and support to the micro-
enterprise and SME sector, it will help generate employment for the rural and urban poor.
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category     I A   [XI B   [ I C
Infrastructure development in the EPZ and disposal of solid and liquid waste could have negative
environmental impact. Possible pre-existing environmental impact liabilities of the two textile companies
to be privatized will be assessed, and the legislative and regulatory framework will be reviewed to
determine the necessary mitigation plan. An environmental assessment of the EPZ was carried out during
project preparation. The Government has agreed to complete the environmental audit of the textile
companies by March 31, 2000.
7. Participatory approach:
The business enviromnent, competitiveness and export promotion components were designed with a large
participation of stakeholders from various origins: business community, civil society, small and micro
entrepreneurs, and civil servants. In addition, the project was designed in such a way to enable full
participation of key stakeholders, from inception to implementation. For policy dialogue and export
development strategies, the Govermnent and the private sector will set the objectives and performance
indicators on an annual basis.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability
Factors critical to the sustainability of project benefits include:
Policy dialogue and privatization. It is important that the Govermment maintains and deepens its pro-
reform stance. Although there is a broad consensus on reforms, vested interests do at times delay the
process. Increased competition in the textile and telecommunications sectors may be resisted by current
operators and unions.
Business development, competitiveness and export promotion. Although designed as temporary
interventions, policy dialogue, participatory actions for export development and the matching fund
components are expected to have a lasting impact on the policy environment of private enterprises and
their capacity to compete in export markets. However, if the Government does not review and implement
the recommended policy changes or interferes with the matching-grant mechanism, this could seriously
affect the outcome of the project. Key areas for policy dialogue include: (1) improving the legal and
judiciary environment, (ii) streamlining the taxation system and business regulations and procedures, (iii)
reforming the telecommunications and energy sectors, (iv) reducing costs and delays in customs and port
operations, (v) promoting a sound framework for regional integration. On an annual basis, the
public/private sector committee will choose two or three binding constraints for export development or
business operation. The committee will then carry out studies and make recommendations for reforms. It
will follow-up on implementation with the support of a senior civil servant coordinating all policy reforms
related to competitiveness and export development.
Micro-finance and enterprise development. It will be of critical importance that the Government (a)
maintain and expand a market economy framework, (b) not interfere with the operations of PAPME and
PADME, and (c) support the institutional process to transform PAPME and PADME into autonomous
financial institutions. The Government also will have to ensure timely provision of counterpart funds to
cover the operational costs of the micro-finance supervision unit in the Ministry of Finance.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Business environment. Privatization of infrastructure may be controversial, as it would eliminate rents.
Competitiveness and Export development.  Potential controversial aspects include Government
agencies' reluctance to give the private sector leadership in export-development activities and provide
matching-grant to private enterprises.
Credit to SMEs and micro enterprises. PADME's and/or PAPME's lack of financial sustainability at
the institutionalization stage could trigger criticism about the use of public funds to subsidize non-viable
schemes. PADME is at an advanced stage of self-sufficiency. The sustainability of its operations can be
achieved only if they are carefully expanded and the institution remains soundly managed. On the other
hand, experience shows that, even in developed countries, full cost recovery is difficult to achieve in
financing schemes for SMEs. PAPME's goal is not to become another bank. It provides an entry point to
small entrepreneurs who have limited access to formal credit. If and when these entrepreneurs become
successful, they are expected to move on to established banks for their credit needs. PAPME's
sustainability may thus be more problematic. Its sustainability can be achieved only if it finds the right
niche and products/services.
G: Main Credit Conditions
To avoid project delays in effectiveness or implementation, the most critical actionsto be taken by the
Government were set as conditions of negotiations and included: (a)the creation of a private sector-led
export promotion association; (b) the appointment of a general manager from the private sector after a
competitive selection process; (c)the adoption of the basic principles of the cost-sharing mechanism; (d)
the transfer of the micro-finance supervision unit from the Ministry olPlan to the Ministry of Finance and
Economy; (e) the transformation of PADME and PAPME into non-profit organizations andthe signature
of two decrees to grant tax exemption for an interim period; (f)signed agreements between PAPME and
PADME and the Government for transfer of assets and liabilities; and (g) adoption of the project
procedure manual.
1. Effectiveness Conditions
- Establishment of the financial management and accounting systems and the matching accounting
manual.
*  Appointment of a financial management expert to the staff of CAT.
* Recruitment of the firm to manage the matching grants scheme.
•  Signature of the Subsidiary Financing Agreements between the Government and PAPME and
PADME, respectively, and signature of the Subsidiary agreement between the Government and
ADEX.
* Establishment of the Private-Public Sector consultative structure.
* Opening of the project account and initial deposit of CFAF 25 million by the Government.
2. Disbursement conditions
* Matching grant sub-component: adoption of the procedure manual.

ANNEX 2
Benin
Private Sector Development Project
Detailed Project Description
The project will include three components to improve: (i) the business environment; (ii) the
competitiveness of enterprises, particularly for export development; and (iii) access ofSMEs and micro-
enterprises to credit.
Component 1: Business environment (total cost: US$3.6 million)
Over the past decade, Benin has made considerable progress in moving from a state-dominated to a
market-based economy. Further reforms are needed, however, to make Benin a good business address and
to build upon its competitive advantages, including a vibrant trade sector, a tradition ofentrepreneurship,
and a fast growing cotton sector. Public utilities must be privatized to reduce the cost and improve the
reliability of their services. Port operations must be streamlined to reduce delays and costs. These
reforms are being initiated under an ongoing Transport Project (FY97). The technical skills of the
workforce must be enhanced. This is the purpose of another ongoing Education Development Project
(FY94).
To improve the business environment, the project will support a proactive dialogue on constraints to
investment, business operations and exports between the Government and representatives of the private
sector. It will also help the Government privatize two textile companies with the objective of increasing
the value added of cotton exports and implement pro-competition regulatory framework in the
telecommunications and cotton sectors.
(i) Reduce policy and administrative obstacles to investment and exports (total cost: US$1.0 million)
The project will support the organization of a dialogue between the Government and the private sector in
the newly created association of exporters, ADEX. They will meet regularly with the following mandate:
(i) identify and analyze policy and regulatory constraints to investment and export development; (ii)
develop detailed proposals for policy change; (iii) submit the reform agenda to decision-makers; and (iv)
monitor the adoption and implementation of the action plan. The success of this dialogue depends on the
credibility of participants, access to senior levels of Government and public awareness on the obstacles
identified. To build the credibility of the new association, the project will provide assistance to
commission experts to carry out diagnostic studies, formulate policy options, and invite practitioners to
present best practices. To create conditions for a continuing and fruitful dialogue during and beyond
project implementation, the Government will designate a senior coordinator to present periodically,
together with a representative of the export association, the reform proposals to the Council of Ministers.
Finally, the export association will conduct a continuing public awareness campaign to disseminate
findings on obstacles to investment and exports. In addition, to allow for these actions to take place, the
project will support the new association by financing part of its operating costs over a four-year period.
The Government-Private Sector Committee will be chaired by the president of ADEX who will work
together with a senior official appointed by the Head of State to coordinate investment and export-related
matters within the Government. The Committee will be composed of five representatives of the private
sector and five Government representatives. Representatives from the private sector will include the
president of ADEX, the president of CNEX, the president of CCIB, and two representatives of export
organizations. Government representatives will include permanent secretaries of the Ministry of Finance,



2
the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of commerce, the Ministry of Rural Development, and a senior
Government coordinator to be appointed by the Head of State.
At the operational level, the committee will be managed by the Secretary General of ADEX with
assistance of a high level staff. The Committee's work program will include the carrying-out of a
competitiveness study to define Benin's competitiveness profile and benchmark against key competitors.
The Committee will also plan three studies to be conducted annually on policy and administrative
obstacles to investment and exports. It will mobilize and conduct a continuing public awareness
campaign to support reforms and disseminate the findings and recommendations.  To facilitate
implementation of the recommendations, it was agreed to launch the third study only if the Government
has reviewed recommendations of the first two studies and undertake their partial implementation.
Priority areas for reforrns identified during project preparation include: (i) policy and regulatory obstacles
to investment and exports, including an inadequate taxation system; (ii) transportation network and key
infrastructure; (iii) access to markets; and (iv) quality management. The credit will finance consulting
services (US$0.9 million) and the Commission's operating expenses (US$0.03 million).
(ii) Privatization (total cost: US$2.6 million)
The cotton sector provides the bulk of Benin's export earnings. Several studies have shown that the
sector's competitiveness is hampered by inadequate regulation and the Government has decided to review
the sector's organization prior to privatizing SONAPRA, the state-owned production and ginning
company. In the textile sector, the steering committee set up by the Government to define a new strategy
for its restructuring has submitted its report to the Government.  It is expected that the cabinet will
review and adopt the recommendations before December 31, 1999.
As regards to telecommunications, the Govemment has prepared a new law to open-up the sector to
competition and to privatize the state-owned operator.
The Government has requested Bank support for the following activities. A new framework in the cotton
sector will be adopted to lead to the privatization of SONAPRA.  The Government also intends to
privatize the remaining Public Enterprises (PEs) operating in the textile sector( SITEX, and Sobetex).
New laws and regulations in the telecommunications sector will be adopted and implemented, including
the creation of a regulatory agency. The credit will finance consulting services (US$2.2 million),
operating expenses (US$0.3 million) and equipment (US$0.1 million) of the privatization unit over a
period of four and a half years.
Component 2: Competitiveness of enterprises (total cost: US$10.7 million)
(i). Assistance to ADEX, the newly created association of exporters (total cost: US$1.4 million)
The Association of Exporters (ADEX) was set up in January 1999 to implement a broad range of
Competitiveness and Export Development activities. The Board of ADEX is comprised of twelve
members, including three representatives of business organizations, three representatives of individual
exporters, two representatives of producers, one representative of CNCB (the shippers' association), one
representative of banks and two Government representatives. ADEX secretary general was recently
selected. He will be assisted by high-level staff to manage policy discussions with the Government,
export development activities and the information center. He will also oversee the matching grant fund to
be managed by an international consulting firm for the first two years of the project, before it is
transferred to a local director.
ADEX resources will come from membership fees, donations and subsidies from Government and donors
and, on a two-year interim basis, from taxes of CFA francs 400 per ton levied on exports by the shippers'



3
association, CNCB. Exporters have agreed that paying the tax for another two years was the most
efficient way to help establish ADEX. The project would finance operating costs of ADEX (US$1.0
million), equipment (US$0.2 million) and consulting services (US$0.2 million).
(ii) Strategies and actions to develop exports (total cost: US$1.6 million)
The main challenge facing Benin in achieving and sustaining a private sector-led growth is to move from
a dependency on cotton to a more diversified export base. Reducing policy and administrative obstacles
to exports and restructuring the export promotion framework is not sufficient to meet this challenge.
More pro-active measures are required, including the possibility of undertaking studies to identify sectors
with high growth potential in world markets, and preparing and implementing action plans to realize the
potential. To ensure ownership and commitment, the project will provide flexibility in the choice of
studies. The exporters' association will define the nature of sectors and timetable for implementation.
The project wiHl support the following activities: (i) annual planning workshops to determine the agenda,
timetable for implementation and corrective measures; (ii) studies and actions to develop exports. The
first series of strategies and actions to be conducted will address the development of exports in the textile
sector.
(iii) Matching fund (total cost: US$6.8 million)
The project will finance the establishment and operation of a matching fund scheme. The matching grant
fund will be a cost-sharing mechanism designed to foster exporters' competitiveness through increasing
their access to local and foreign expertise. The fimd is also intended to provide technical support to small
and medium domestic companies to improve the efficiency of their operations and help business
organizations improve the quality of services to their members. To this end, the ftmd will provide partial
financing to individual firms and business associations for such activities as technical and management
consultancies, training courses, contacts with potential buyers and suppliers, design and implementation
of export marketing campaigns, quality control, market research and visits to strategic buyers.
To ensure independence, the matching fund will be under private management. A private contractor
specialized in managing such a matching grant scheme will be hired to establish the procedures manual.
The hiring of the consulting firm is a condition of effectiveness. This firm will recruit the local director,
who will report to a Board comprising representatives of the new private sector-led export association and
representatives of domestic firms. The fund will have two different windows: one for the exporters that
are usually large firms, and one for small and medium enterprises whose needs are generally substantially
different. A detailed procedure manual to promote transparency and efficiency will govern its operations.
This manual will specify eligibility criteria, financial thresholds, and procedures for hiring consultants,
cost-sharing mechanisms, and evaluation of services and performance criteria. During negotiations, it was
agreed that the amount of subsidy would not exceed 50% for firms and 70% for associations. The
procedure manual for the arrangement mechanism is a condition of disbursement for this component.
(iv) Trade Information Center (total cost: US$0.5 million)
Export promotion services in Benin are weak, dispersed and not responsive to exporters' needs. The
current Government-led framework is not conducive to attracting and building up the competencies
necessarv for an effective export promotion scheme. Service providers include (a) CBCE (Centre
Beninois du Commerce Ext&rieur), the Government agency in charge of export promotion; (b) CNEX
(Centre National pour I 'Exportation), a very small and not representative business association for export
promotion; and (c) CCI (the Chamber of Commerce and Industry). Both CBCE and CCI are perceived by
exporters as bureaucratic organizations with limited incentive to respond to exporters' needs. Local
exporters have not been able to take advantage of business opportunities provided by the information
technology because they operate in an information-poor environment. Recent studies demonstrate that the



4
country is a poor performer by sub-regional standards both in terms of the quality and cost of services.
This sub-component aims at using information technology to improve exporters' competitiveness
through: (i) providing access to data bases available internationally on export markets, business
opportunities and suppliers and; (ii) helping the exporters in developing communications tools such as
web pages on their products, capabilities and business needs. To achieve that objective, the project will
support the restructuring of the various entities involved in providing services to exporters. These services
are expected to be subsidized during the start-up period and evolve increasingly towards cost recovery.
The credit will finance equipment and operating costs over a four-year period for the new entity that will
emerge after the restructuring process.
(v) Initiation of the EPZ (total cost: US$0.5 million)
As part of its strategy to promote exports, the Government has requested Bank support to establish an
EPZ. Such a scheme may make sense, but only if reforms are implemented to make public utilities and
port operations more efficient. The credit will finance a feasibility study to review the proposed
parameters and to define critical actions to be implemented by GOC in order to achieve success. If the
study concludes that an EPZ is feasible and desirable, the project would assist the Govermment in selecting
private operators to implement and manage it.
Component 3: Access to credit (total cost: US$39.0 million)
(i) Promoting the Micro-finance Sector and support to theALAFM Network (total cost: US$0.6
million)
The project will support ALAFIA, a large micro-finance network, in two ways. It will help the
dissemination of best practices and provide a variety of services such as training and information.
Consultants will be recruited to assist the micro-finance network in producing and implementing its action
plan, and provide institutional support and training. It will strengthen the dialogue between the
Government and micro-finance institutions (MFIs) through the provision of resources for seminars and for
the design a national strategy for micro-finance development.
(ii) Strengthening the Ministry of Financefor supervision of the micro-finance sector (total cost: US$0.9
million)
As in other Westem African countries, the PARMEC law that regulates micro credit financial institutions
has been adopted. However, it is not yet fully implemented, and effective supervision of credit
institutions has yet to start. The project will provide support to thesupervision unit within the Ministry of
Finance. More specifically, the project willdevelop capacity through participation to training seminars
organized on a local and regional basis. It will support the setting-up ofa database for supervision. It will
encourage dissemination of the law and related regulations. Finally, it will finance operational expenses
on a declining basis. In addition, the project will support exchanges at the regional level to disseminate
best practices in the supervision of micro-credit institutions.
(iii) Supporting the SME pilot (PAPME) and the micro-finance pilot (PADME)(total cost: US$37.5
million)
After the banking crisis ofthe late eighties, Benin's financial sector recovery was supported by a number
of donors, including the Bank under the first structural adjustment program. There are now five banks:
Bank of Africa (BOA), Ecobank Bank Benin (ECB), Banque Internationale du Benin (BIBE), Continental
Bank Benin (CBB), and Financial Bank (FBB) In addition, there are two insurance companies and three
institutions specializing in lending and leasing. Although the formal financial system has improved over
the years in terms of management and services to their clients, small and micro-enterprises continue to



5
have difficulties accessing financial services, including credit. This situation has led to the establishment
of a number of institutions (most of them through donor-financed projects) aiming at addressing the
problem of access to financial services by clients with limited resources. These institutions are grouped
into three categories: cooperatives, savings and loans associations, and institutions (credit programs)
channeling credit where deposits are not a pre-condition to access credit. The latterinstitutions are
relatively small compared to the savings and loans associations and cooperatives. In 1997, they had less
that one- percent of the total members of theMFIs (microfinance institutions), while they received less
than one percent of the total deposits of MFIs and provided about 21 percent of total loans from MFIs.
The Govermnent of Benin has no direct control over bank supervision. With the exception of certain
types of micro-finance institutions, financial institutions are regulated and supervised at the level of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), of which Benin is a member. The banks and
credit institutions are governed by the regional banking law and the statutes of theBanque Central des
Etats de I 'Afrique de I 'Ouest (BCEAO). The Commission Bancaire, also established at the regional level
supervises them. To introduce some flexibility in the financial system and integrate graduallyMFIs in the
formal sector, BCEAO supported a new legislation (Projetd 'Appui a la Reglementation sur les Mutuels
d'Epargne et de Credit, PARMEC), and issued regulations applicable to micro-finance institutions.
The average annual lending rate charged by commercial banks in Benin has been in the order of 12 percent
per annum (August 1999). Lending rates charged byMFIs vary between 10 and 30 percent. Although
these rates are higher than the maximum rate of 14 percent charged by the banks,MFIs offer greater
flexibility, and consequently attract clients from the banking sector. Between 1994 and 1997, deposits at
MFIs increased by 146 percent and loans by 483 percent.
The Projet d'Assistance a la Petite et Moyenne Entreprise (PAPME) and the Projet d'Appui au
Developpement de la Microentreprises (PADME) were both created in 1993 under a now closed Bank-
financed project (Public Enterprise Sector Rehabilitation Project-FY86). The setting up of PAPME was
cofinanced by CIDA (Canada). PAPME has been providing technical assistance and loans (cofinanced
with Bank of Africa-Benin) to small enterprises while PADME focuses on microenterprises (this
institution has an approach similar to ACEP, a successfulmicroenterprise program in Senegal). PAPME
and PADME have increasingly been able to cover operating costs from the spread they get from their
lending operations. The collection rate for PAPME is of the order of 95 percent and 98 percent for
PADME.
Prior to their recent institutional transformation into associations, PAPME and PADME had operated as
credit projects. They have used sound financial and management principles on the basis of a set of clear
procedures included in their respective procedure manual. The project will provide support to complete
the transformation of PAPME and PADME into autonomous financial institutions over a four- to five-
year period. To this end, the credit will finance operating costs on a declining basis, equipment and
consulting services needed for the institutional reforms, including business plans and training to
management and staff. In addition, the project will provide lines of credit of US$4.7 million for PADME
and US$5.7 million for PAPME.
Credit arrangements. Funding for the line of credit by PAPME for on-lending purposes to small and
medium size Investment Enterprises will finance fixed assets and permanent working capital for
investment projects. Sub-borrowers will need to be private enterprises and contribute a minimum of 10%
of the investment project amount. Funding for the line of credit by PADME for on-lending purposes to
micro-enterprises will finance equipment and working capital.
Financial terms and conditions. Funds for onlending will be provided by the Government to PAPME and
PADME as loans. The interest rate will be tied to theinterbank rate, with a maturity of five years for
PADME and seven years for PAPME. PADME's sub-loans will be for periods between one and two



6
years, with no grace period. PAPME's sub-loans will be for a maximum of seven years. The interest rate
charged will be freely determined by both institutions. Out of the IDA Credit, maximum sub-project loan
sizes will be about US$65,000 equivalent forSMEs borrowing from PAPME. PAPMEcan increase the
loan size with their own funds at the request of the sub-borrower and depending on the quality of the
investment project. Out of the IDA Credit, maximum sub-project loan sizes will be US$6,000 equivalent
for micro-enterprises borrowing from PADME. Funds under the Credit to finance technical assistance,
training, and operating costs (on a declining basis) will be provided to the institutions on a grant basis.
Credit delivery arrangements. A manual outlining operational procedures is available for each institution.
PAPME and PADME presently have competent technical staff. When a sub-borrower presents a request
based on the preliminary eligibility criteria, this request is assigned to a loan officer for review and
submission to a credit committee. The committee examines the requests for approval or rejection. The
credit committee meets every two weeks at PAPME and every week at PADME. If a request is approved,
the sub-borrower receives a check payable through a commercial bank.

international institutions are about US$140,000. National consultants are paid US$200/day equivalent.
Per diems and travel costs are the standard use by UN agencies.
- A 5% contingency, on both price and physical, has been applied across the board.

ANNEX 4
Economic Analysis
Introduction
1.     The economic analysis of this type of private sector development project presents special
difficulties particularly when there is an indirect relationship between the project's actions and the stream
of benefits. The difficulty in measuring benefits lies in the fact that the project would be supporting an
acceleration process leading to an outcome rather than supporting the direct outcome. Moreover, it is
equally difficult to estimate the amounts and types of investment, production and exports that would be
financed through the project's microfmance activities and matching grant's scheme to the emerging
exporters. Despite these difficulties, an attempt has been made to present a quantified measure of the
benefits that are expected from the project. Therefore, a brief project description has been given to
highlight the intentions of the project, as to what it hopes to achieve, create or establish in a "with" and
"without" project framework. This is followed by an explanation on how the benefits have been
quantified. A cost-benefit analysis framework has been used to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV)
and Economic Rate of Return (ERR).
2.     The economic analysis has produced an NPV of US$ 30.0 million at a discount rate of 12 percent
and an ERR of 32.2 %. This estimate has been based on a methodology whereby the project is assumed to
accelerate an increase in output by 3 years. I Such an increase in outputis therefore expected not to be
realized without the project. Nonetheless, to simplify the analysis the indirect benefits have been
excluded, thus, giving lower results than would have been the case otherwise.

Project Objectives
3.     The main development objective of the Private Sector Development Project for Benin is to
facilitate the increase private sector's contribution to sustainable economic growth through increased
levels of investment, production and exports. This will enable Benin to achieve a high growth rate of 5 %
per annum over the 1998 - 2002 period. This is necessary for the achievement of sustainable poverty
reduction in Benin. The project will contribute to that goal by: (a) supporting two financial institutions
aimed at providing credit to rmicro and small enterprises, through institutional strengthening and provision
of long-term financial resources; and (b) facilitating export development and diversification through the
setting-up of a cost sharing fund and provision of technical assistance to export oriented firms and export
ISame method has been applied by the World Bank on similar programs with Matching Grant Schemes. See Report #16524-ZA. Zambia:
Enterprise Development Project SAR. 1997 and Report #15062-ZIM -Zimbabwe: Enterprise Development Project. SAR. 1996.

companies. Progress towards the attainment of these objectives will be measured and monitored through:
(a) increase in the number of loans provided by PAPME and PADME to small and medium enterprises,
and jobs created; (b) sustainability of PAPME and PADME after five years; (c) number of companies that
will have benefited from the matching grant mechanism; and (d) increase in value of export by the
companies that will be supported by the project. An interesting element in the design of the project is that,
the private sector is the key player in particular, during implementation. The private sector through the
Export Development Associationl, will commit their own financial resources to match the amounts
supported by the project and will take risks by investing in technical support services to increase non-
traditional export sector activities. This element will allow the discipline of the export market to operate in
an efficient way and to ensure that, the types and levels of investments made by the 150 firms and 50
associations assisted under the project will generate sound economic returns to the country.
4.    Implementation. The project will support both SMEs and export oriented firms in Benin to
increase their economic returns on their investments and thus become more profitable. This would mainly
be achieved through a reduction in costs, as outputs are expected to be sold in competitive markets (for
example in import-competing or export markets). This reduction in costs can also be manifested as, an
improvement in productivity, is expected to be achieved through:
* Access to Markets - support services for exporters and SMEs;
* Access to credit - for the SMEs through institutionalization of the two savings and credit unions
(PADME and PAPME);
* Improved Technology - through utilization of improved technology for strategic, functional and
technical information;
* Access to Information - the project will establish an information database that will facilitate
information interchanges between local exporters and foreign markets.
Cost-Benefits Analysis
5.     Ideally, the effect of each of the project interventions on the costs of the firms should be the
starting point for the examination of potential increases in profits. However, such data is not readily
available. Although most firms have an estimate of potential increases in output that could result from
specific actions including project interventions, such information is not readily available. This is mainly
due to the fact that most private firms will not volunteer such information because of income tax purposes.
Thus, this information has not been used for estimating the potential increases in individual firm profits
(benefits) expected from the project.
6.    Instead, the output generated from the project supported export oriented firm has been used as an
alternative measure for the benefits. This approach has indicated a very high valuation of the project's
benefits. Some adjustments have thus been done to accommodate the opportunity cost of the private funds
utilized in the project (See par. 1.1 1). It was therefore judged that the profit numeraire was not ideal for the
cost benefit analysis of investment projects that have matching grant schemes.
Assumptions
7.     The first underlying assumption is that the financial costs and benefits can be equated with the
economic costs and benefits of the operations of assisted firms. This assumption has its problems because
the financial statement does not always capture economic externalities associated with environmental
resource use. Another source of divergence is labor, especially if the shadow wage rate is significantly
below the market wage rate. In this case, the financial return understates the economic return, other things

being equal. Nevertheless, with the liberalization of the economy, it is assumed that prices in the economy
reflect the forces of market supply and demand as opposed to policy distorted price levels. In the absence
of precise information on these types of considerations, it is practical to assume that the financial and
economic values are concurrent. Therefore, the hypothesis applied is that the firms assisted in the project
face largely undistorted prices.
8.     The second assumption is that the Association des Exportateursl (ADEX) will provide matching
grants to 150 firms and 50 subsector associations, as follows: in the first year, 20 individual firms and 10
subsector associations; in the second year, 30 individual firms and lOsubsector associations; in the third
year, 35 individual firms and 10 subsector associations. By year four and five it is expected that more
firms will participate with 35 and 30 individual firms, respectively, and lOsubsector associations in each
will receive matching grants.
9.     It is also assumed that the L'ADEX subsidy rate for individual firms will vary from 50% for firms
and 70% for associations. For the purpose of this analysis, the average subsidy is assumed to be 50%. The
average total cost of a firm level intervention is assumed to be US$25,000 for individual firms and
US$35,000 for the subsector associations.
10.    The valuation of the benefits uses a two-stage calculation which first estimates the extra output
created by assisted firms and second estimates the profit associated with that output. Ideally, the additional
output is defined as the difference between the level of output achieved by firms assisted by the project
and the level of output these same firms would have achieved in the absence of the project. According to a
methodology developed by Levy, Berry and Nugent2, which is based on empirical evidence in similar
schemes in East Asian countries, it assumed an output increase of about 15 times of the matching grant
amount. Nevertheless, in this analysis, the project's assumptions are very conservative by expecting the
matching grant to accelerate increases in firm's output 10 times. Two-thirds further reduces expected
increase. This reduction in net benefits is based on an assumption that important resources would be
diverted from other economic activities to facilitate the achievement of project results.
11.    The matching grant is also expected to inject know-how in companies to stay competitive apart
from creation of additional jobs. Employment creation has been taken into account as a secondary effect
of the matching grant scheme. Therefore, about 3,000 jobs would be created in the non-traditional export
sector by the end of the project.3
12.     Measurement of economic benefits of institutional development support in the enterprise
development and investment promotion is difficult because they furnish provision of services to firms
indirectly. For the sake of consistency, it was assumed that the support provided would increase efficiency
of the supported recipients and would yield an increase in economic outputs at a multiple of two times the
amount of support.
Results
13.    The analysis explained above yielded a series of accelerated increase in output levels per
component. The same scenarios were then repeated, albeit, staggered three years behind the first analysis.

This was based on the assumption that, the principal result is the acceleration of the process by three years.
As indicated in Table 2. Above and Chart 1. Below, the final economic results are represented by the
present value calculations of the difference between the first scenario of increases in output resulting from
the project and the same scenario, three years behind it.
The results suggest that the overal project can be strongly justified in NPV and ERR terms. The
Competitiveness of Enterprises component showed a high rate of return of 34.60/2. The payback period
for the investment is estimated at 4 years. The NPV is less than zero when the ERR is around 12%.

Sensitivity Analysis
14.       The sensitivity analysis switched values on the competitiveness of enterprise component and kept
the institutional disbursements as in base case scenario. The first evaluation was done by elongating the
I Reduced by 2/3.
2 Similar schemes in Zimbabwe showed an ERR of 46%, in Zambia's showed 42% and that of C6te d'lvoire 34.9%.
It therefore means that the scheme is highly profitable.

disbursement over a period of 9 years, the effect on the project was that the NPV was reduced from US$
23.2 million to US$ 17.1 million and the ERR from 27.8% to 21.2%. This suggested that a slower
implementation period would not have a material effect on the economic impact of the project.
15.   The second evaluation was done by modifying the reduction in the level of output attributed to
diversion from other resources. In this case, by increasing the reduction from 66% (the base case) to 75%,
the NPV remained positive at US$ 9.3 million. In reducing the level of reduction in the level of output to
50%, the NPV increased significantly to US$ 47.9 million with an ERR of 40.5%. Thus, although the
outcomes are sensitive to the effects of modifying this variable, all of the outcomes presented positive
NPVs within the parameters (50-78% reduction) established in the theoretical foundation for this
approach.

output for each firn from 10 to 15 as that of the East Asian countries and Kenya. The results showed an
NPV of US$ 41.2 million and an ERR of 38.3%. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the multiple value can go
as low as 2.2 before the NPV becomes negative.
Nature of Benefits

Additional benefits from the project includes:
*   Improved awareness of economic opportunities that do not directly result in increases in output and
employment by the finns supported.
+   Secondary and tertiary effects of increases in output.
*  Development of know-how within the consultant industry will reduce the heavy reliance on foreign
expertise especially when put to use beyond the enterprises supported.
*  The reduction on reliance of foreign consultants will help reduce pressure on balance of payments for
payment of fees in foreign currencies.
*   Reduction of costs of doing business in Benin and business laws will be enforced at a faster pace.
Main Beneficiaries
18.    The main beneficiaries of the project would be about 150 local firms and 50  subsector
associations and consultant industry. The individual beneficiaries would thus be the principals and
employees of the firms affected. More generally, the whole consultant service industry will benefit as they
improve their efficiency for business services. The fiscal impact is estimated at US$ 10.6 million mainly
from corporate and personal income taxes.

Procurement, Disbursement and Financial Management Arrangements
PROCUREMENT
Procurement organization
Procurement capacity is generally weak in Benin and has led, among other factors, to slow down
disbursements under IDA-financed projects. However, CAT, PAPME and PADME are familiar with
World Bank procedures and their capacity has been strengthened during a previous IDA operation. They
will be the executing agencies in charge of procurement. CAT will closely supervise all operations and
support the other executing agencies as deemed necessary. To ensure that CAT is able to play its role
efficiently, an additional financial specialist with procurement skills will be hired. All contracts and
expenditures will have to follow World Bank guidelines with the exception of the matching fund sub-
component where commercial practices will be in effect. The Export Development Association (ADEX)
will handle procurement for export development; including the matching find. The matching fund will be
executed by ADEX through an international consulting finn to be recruited under a performance-based
contract. The consulting firn will recruit a local director of the fund who will be responsible among other
assignments for reviewing terms of reference for consultants, and a financial manager who will handle
other procurement matters and ensure compliance with the Project Agreement and the Operating Manual
(for commercial practices). Procurement staffs from all the executing agencies and CAT (Project
Coordination Unit) will attend a Bank procurement and disbursement seminar before credit effectiveness.
Procurement of goods
All goods and services under the IDA Credit shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance
with Guidelines for goods, works and services: Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA Credits, January
1995, revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999 (Procurement Guidelines).
IDA standard bidding documents will be used for contracts subject to ICB procedures.
The project is expected to procure mainly vehicles, video / computer and other office equipment, and
materials. Contracts to supply goods, and equipment for the project will be procured by International
competitive bidding national competitive bidding and national/International shopping depending upon
their amount (see table below) and would be the responsibility of the implementing agencies under the

Consultants and services
Most of the procurement for the project will be in the form of technical assistance and training.
Consultants contracts shall be awarded in accordance with Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997 revised September 1997, January 1999 (Consultant
Guidelines).

Auditing services, estimated to cost less than $50,000, may be procured under contracts awarded
according to the Least Cost Selection Method.
Consultant recruitment under the matching grant scheme will follow commercial practices, on the basis of
a detailed procedure manual, which would guarantee transparency without introducing cumbersome
procedures incompatible with a private sector organization. The procedure manual would contain
guidelines regarding the qualification of consultants and conflict of interest to ensure they have no part in
the business for which they serve as consultants. Adoption of this procedure manual satisfactory to IDA
will be a condition of disbursement of this sub-component
The procurement methods applicable to the various expenditure categories are summarized in Table A

Special accounts:
As the project will use the traditional method of disbursements for the first year (not LACI-based) of their
implementation, the initial deposit amount in the special account should be estimated for fo.ur months
expenditures. The special accounts will be replenished on a monthly basis.
The disbursement method will be reviewed in December 2000, when the project is expected to graduate to
the LACI, PMR-based disbursement.
The project will have three special accounts, one for PAPME and one for PADME for their respective
component, and one for CAT for all the other components. During negotiations, the possibility of having
a fourth special account for ADEX was discussed. Unlike PAPME, PADME and CAT, ADEX is a newly
created association and is therefore not yet familiar with World Bank guidelines and procedures. It was
agreed that the first year of the project will be used to strengthen ADEX capacities in that area and, once
the operations will be transferred to LACI, a PMR-based disbursement, a joint Government/IDA review
will assess the need to open a special account for ADEX.

Assessment of the Financial Management System
(See Assessment Report and Action Plan)
Financial Management System
Accounting
An accounting and auditing firm has been selected in September 1999 to design and implement a
computerized accounting system in all the components. The firn will also prepare a detailed financial and
accounting procedures manual, including internal control systems and providing reasonable assurances
that accounts are properly recorded and resources safeguarded. Finally, it will select qualified accountants
to strengthen the capacity of the executing agencies. In addition, this firm will include in its mandate the
PMR based disbursement requirements and train the accountants identified so that the project can shift to
the new standards by end December 2000.
The Chart of Accounts for the project is based on the National Chart of Account and in conformity with
the International Accounting Standard satisfactory to the Bank (IDA).
Financial Reporting
CAT and all executing agencies will prepare quarterly Activity Reports together with quarterly Financial
Reports.
The annual Financial Statements of the project will be prepared in accordance with accounting principles
acceptable to IDA. The Financial Statement will include at least a statement of sources and uses of funds,
a statement of reconciliation of the special accounts and a balance sheet.



6
The Financial Statements will be submitted to IDA no later than two months after the end of each fiscal
year.
3.    Auditing
An Independent Auditor acceptable to IDA will audit the financial statement of the project.
The auditor will provide an opinion on:
a)    Adequacy of Accounting and Internal Control System
b)    Financial Management System
c)    Project Financial Statements
d)    Special Accounts and Statement of Expenditures
Project accounts will be audited annually; special accounts and all disbursements underSOEs will be
audited semi-annually for two years. The annual audit report will be submitted to IDA within six months
of the end of each fiscal year, and the semi-annual audit report within three months of each period.
4. Staffing
CAT, the project coordination unit has already a financial unit headed by a qualified accountant/financial
analyst. This unit will be strengthened with the hiring of an additional financial specialist with
procurement skills. This recruitment will be a condition of effectiveness.
The financial management units of PAPME and PADME have so far been successful in dealing with
accounting and other financial issues. However given the increasing scope of their operations, the
accounting firm that has been hired to implement the overall management system of the project will assess
the new requirements of PAPME and PADME and identifies/selects suitable staff to strengthen those
units. ADEX will also recruit a Chief Financial Officer for its own needs and those of the project.
5.    Project Management Reports
The Bank is introducing an initiative to change loan administration in Bank Group projects, the Loan
Administration Change Initiative (LACI). This initiative assists projects to put in place sound Financial
Management, Procurement and output Monitoring Systems. Where appropriate, if these systems are in
place, disbursements may be made on the basis of agreed quarterly Project Management Reports (PMR)
rather than on the basis of individual invoices or statements of expenditures.
An assessment has been made that the executing agencies will gradually apply LACI. PMR procedures
will be implemented progressively during the first year of project implementation. There is the need to
ensure that the systems puts in place are operating smoothly. The monitoring and evaluation process will
include output of reports that are consistent with the PMR requirements.
The financial, procurement and output monitoring systems will be reviewed in December 2000 to assess
whether it will be appropriate to move to Full PMR based disbursement at that time.
