REPUBLIC OF KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a third education project in
the Republic of Korea for which Bank assistance of US$22.5 million equivalent
is proposed. Two other education projects are being assisted under Credit
151-KO (1969) and Loan 906/Credit 394-KO (1973) amounting to US$14.8 million
and US$43.0 million, respectively. The first of these was aimed at qualita-
tive improvements and selective expansion of education in the fields of in-
dustry, commerce and agriculture at secondary and post-secondary levels, and
of teacher training in universities. The second project also supported this
investment policy by assisting technical/agricultural education at sub-pro-
fessional level and teacher training, and by preparing the way for specific
educational reforms through technical assistance. After initial delays both
projects are progressing satisfactorily.
ii.       Korea's education and training system is quantitatively well devel-
oped. Its distinguishing characteristics are: high enrollment ratios, high
internal efficiency, low costs per student, a high proportion of post-primary
students enrolled in work-related courses, good employment rates for gradu-
ates and moderate urban/rural enrollment disparities. These achievements are
the result of the consistent high priority assigned to educational expendi-
tures in the post-war period. Nevertheless, important qualitative shortcom-
ings and structural imbalances remain. Weaknesses include inappropriate
curricula, lack of suitable teaching equipment and specialized facilities
and academically-oriented teaching practices for technical education. The
structural imbalances are reflected in specific deficits for technicians and
a general shortfall in training capacity for skilled workers.
iii.      The proposed third education project would help pursue three
objectives:
(a) to meet manpower requirements for specific economic sectors
at the skilled worker and technician levels, while improving
the quality of instruction in the respective segments of the
education system;
(b) to establish the basis for a flexible employment-oriented
system of non-formal vocational training; and
(c) to assist from the manpower development perspective the
Government's policy of geographic deconcentration of
industries.

(a) construction and equipment of a new technical
high school;                                    10-12      1,980
(b) equipment and extensions of buildings for:
-    three agricultural junior colleges;        13-14        600
-    one fisheries college; and                 13-16        180
-    three fisheries high schools;              10-12      1,080
(c) equipment for one merchant marine junior
college; and                                    13-14        640
(d) construction and equipment of seven new
vocational training institutes.                     -      2,520
The project would also include financing of engineering and technical serv-
ices for the preparation of future education projects.
V.J,      Specifically, the project components would serve the following
purposes:
(a) the new technical high school would supply about 660 skilled
industrial workers per year mainly for new industries to be
located nearby;
(b) the agricultural junior colleges would undergo qualitative
improvements and limited expansion eventually to supply
about 1,200 technicians annually required for increasingly
complex agro-industrial development;
(c) the fisheries college and the fisheries high schools would
increase in quality and size to meet specific middle level
manpower requirements resulting from plans to double Korea's
fishing fleet by 1981;
(d) the merchant marine junior college would contribute towards
the personnel requirements of the country's rapidly
expanding merchant fleet, expected to become an important
source of foreign exchange earnings;



- iii -
(e)  the seven vocational training institutes would train
about 3,800 skilled industrial workers annually and
provide additional training opportunities for 2,500
terminal students from middle schools p.a. This
non-formal system of training would be closely linked
with employment opportunities and could respond quickly
through adaptation of its short courses to changing
labor market requirements. Equity considerations would
also be taken into account;
(i)  through a 50% enrollment quota for rural students; and
(ii)  indirectly through the location of the institutes in
new growth poles outside the Seoul-Incheon and Busan
areas.
vi.       A tracer system would be established under the project to determine
the employment status of graduates and their performance on skill tests.  The
information col'ected by this systerm, would be used to ascertain whether the
objectives of the project are being attained and to identify weaknesses in
curricula and teaching methods that need to be rectified.  Technical assis-
tance would be arranged by the government to implement a program to strengthen
the training of technical teachers in technical high schools; and to support
the establishment of the vocational training institutes.
vii.      The total project cost is estimrated at US$39.1 million with a for-
eign exchange component of US$22-3 million equivalent, or 57% of the total
project cost. Implementation is expected to last four and a half years.
The proposed project would be administered by two project units. The exist-
ing project unit in the Ministry of Education would be expanded to enable it
to carry out added responsibilities for implementation and supervision as a
result of the proposed third project. A unit in the Office of Labor Affairs
would assume administrative and financial control and liaison with the Bank
with regard to the vocational training institutes.
viii.     Both project units would work closely with the Office of Supply,
Republ-c of Korea, for the procurement of civil works, furniture and equip-
ment. Furniture and ecuipment contracts over US$50,000 would be awarded on
the basis of international co.mpetitive bidding. Contracts for civil works
and small amounts of furniture and equipment (under US$50,000) would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding open to K(orean and foreign
firms foilow±-ng domestic advertising because of the limited sizes involved
in eacho institution and difficulty in "packaging," contracts to attract for-
eign bidders.  Suitably qualified domestic rtanufacturers of equipment wo'ld
he allswed a margin of preference equivalent to the existing customs duties
for coopetingh im-ports, or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.  Pres-
ent customs duties on most equipment exceed this percentage.
ix.       Bank assistance would meet 100% of the estimated direct and indirect
foreign exchange costs. Disbursements would be made against the c.i.f. cost



- iv -
of imported equipment, the ex-factory cost of locally produced equipment, 70%
of the cost of imported equipment locally procured, 30% of total expenditures
on civil works, furniture and professional fees and 90% of total expenditures
on engineering and technical services for the preparation of future projects.
x.        Up to 1981, the project institutions would contribute about 3% to
the total supply of technicians and skilled workers over the period 1974-81.
Improvements in facilities, equipment, teacher training and curricula would
enable more practical training and skills to be taught than at present. This
improved training is expected to contribute to productivity growth by increas-
ing worker efficiency and decreasing the amount of defective work and acci-
dents. The project would also assist in improving educational opportunity
and subsequent employment prospects by the location of its new institutions
in new industrial areas and by establishment of quotas for rural students.
In sum, the project would form an integral part of the Bank lending strategy
to Korea to assist a balanced development among sectors and regions.
xi.       The project is suitable as a basis for a Bank loan of US$22.5 mil-
lion equivalent to the Republic of Korea with a term of 25 years, including
a 7-year grace period.



REPUBLIC OF KOREA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The World Bank group's first education project in Korea (1969)
under Credit 151-KO (US$14.8 million equivalent) was designed to contribute
to priority improvements in the educational system in accordance with per-
ceived manpower needs for economic development (Appendix I). These improve-
ments included extensions to, and equipping of, 27 technical, commercial and
agricultural high schools, five post-secondary higher schools, four depart-
ments of education at the university level and technical assistance to com--
plement these project items. Project implementation was slowed at the start
because of delays in appointment of consultants and inexperience in equip-
ment procurement. Implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily. Con-
struction is complete and 75% of the equipment has been procured. Installed
equipment is being used effectively. Time lost due to initial delays cannot
be fully recovered and the Closing Date has been extended by one year to
December 31, 1975.
1.02      The second education project (1973) under Loan 906-KO/Credit 394-KO
(US$43 million equivalent) continued to support the Government's policies on
economic development by an improved alignment of the education sector to the
needs of agriculture, industry and social development (Appendix I). The
project consists of equipment and extension of buildings for 18 technical
and 14 agricultural high schools and in 43 post-secondary institutions in
selected fields where manpower shortages had been identified. It also in-
cludes pre-investment studies in management and health education. Imple-
mentation of the second project is satisfactory after overcoming some initial
delays in the appointment of consultant architects. Substantial cost over-
runs due to recent inflationary developments are expected on civil works;
these will be financed by the Government.
1.03      The design of the proposed third education project is based on a
UNESCO project identification report (May 1974), complemented by subsequent
discussions with the Government. It includes priority education and train-
ing items. A Bank mission visited Korea in July-August, 1974 to assist the
Government in completing the preparation of the project and to appraise it.
The mission consisted of Messrs. S. Z. Sung (technical educator), A. S.
Naimie (architect) and H. H. Thias (economist) of the Bank and Messrs. N.
Fujinami (fisheries education specialist, FAO), R. Ganeff (general educator,
Unesco) and R. Maxwell (agricultural educator, consultant). The project
would cost an estimated US$39.1 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$22.3 million.

II.  DEVELOPMENT AND MANNPOWER NEEDS
Socio-Economic Background
2.01      Korea's population of 33.5 million (1974) is presently growing at
an annual rate of 1.7% compared with over 2.0% in the 1960s. This decrease
will somewhat ease the burden of education financing as smaller cohorts enter
primary education in the coming years. Another factor that favors education
is the high population density now approaching 350 persons/km2 which means
that even in rural areas economical sizes can be maintained for primary and
middle schools without imposing excessive commuting distances on pupils.
Primary education has become virtually universal, and the adult literacy
rate has reached 92%.
2.02      During the last decade the Korean economy has been among the fast-
est growing ein the world.  GNP increased by an unprecedented 16.9% in 1973,
after having averaged an annual growth rate of 9.5% between 1963 and 1972.
Average employment growth during that period was 2.6% p.a. implying a rapid
increase in the output per worker of about 7% p.a. Sectoral output (employ-
ment) growth rates in real terms during 1963-1972 were 4.1 (1.1%) for agri-
culture, 17.4 (9.4%) for industry and 10.3 (6.2%) for services. This growth
is remarkable since Korea has limited natural resources. Economic develop-
ment is centered on the availability of human resources - a hardworking,
welt educated labor force combined with entrepreneurial initiative - sup-
ported by appropriate economic policies.
2.03      Korea's economic developrment strategy aims at transformation from
a semi-agrarian to a highly industrialized economy closely integrated with
the world market. While continuing its emphasis on agricultural and rural
development, a major aspect of the Government's long-term strategy is the
development of industry, particularly heavy industry. Korea's long-term
industrial plans are based on the premise that the growth-path followed
over the last decade or so can be extrapolated through the early 1980's
-y ontinuing to rely on export-led industrial growth to provide the
momentum for economic development. The pattern of industrial growth is,
however, expected to change and show a much greater emphasis on investment
in neavy industry botn in order to realize the benefits of import-substitu-
tion and to counteract the effects of: (a) the trend towards protectionism
.n some of Korea's potential markets for light manufactures, and (b) in-
creasing competition in this field from other developing countries with
cheaper labor costs. The structural implications of the planned growth
for the period 1972-81 are as follows:
(a) the share of the primary sector (agriculture, forestry
and fisheries) in GNP is estimated to diminish from
almost 29%o in 1972 to 18% in 1981, and in total em-
ployment from just over 50% to 35%;



(b) the secondary sector (mining and manufacturing) is
expected to increase its proportion in GNP from 24%
to almost 35% and in total employment from 14% to 23%;
(c) the tertiary sector (social overhead capital and
other services) would maintain its share of about
47% in GNP while becoming the largest employer with
almost 42% of total employment in 1981 compared with
about 35% in 1972.
2.04      This industrial growth will have important geographic and equity
dimensions.  Economic expansion would be concentrated in a number of new
locations to relieve the regional imbalance resulting from the present con-
centration of industry in the Seoul-Incheon and Busan areas. Because of
short distances and high population density, the economic benefits result-
ing from the establishment of new industrial centers will eventually spread
throughout the rural areas. By providing the rural population with increased
opportunities for non-farm employment, and by continuing to supply urban jobs
for surplus labor from agriculture, rural incomes are projected to achieve
near-parity with those in urban areas by 1981.
2.05      The recent changes in the world economy have had a significant
impact on Korea.  Mhile its GNP growth in 1974 was still impressive Korea
is experiencing several difficulties including a deterioration in its bal-
ance of payments situation and substantial domestic price increases. 11
Economic Development and Manpower Reguirements
2.06      To support its economic development programs with adequate human
resources, the Korean Government has developed a series of long-term man-
power forecasts for the period 1967-86, as well as more specific demand and
supply estimates for scientific and technical manpower covering the years
1972-81.
2.07      Based on an overall GNP growth projection of 10.3% p.a. total em-
ployment is projected to increase by 3.2% p.a. over the period 1972-81, the
sectoral employment growth rates for agriculture, industry and services
being -0.1%, 8.5% and 4.5% p.a., respectively. The manpower projections
refer to three broad 'Levels of technical manpower: scientists and engi-
neers, technicians and skilled workers (Annex 1).  The corresponding educa-
tion levels are sroadly speaking a university or four-year college degree
in one of the science or engineering disciplines, graduation from a two-
year junior technical college and three years of technical high school
1/   T'he recent economic developments are explained more fully in the
President's Report for this Project.



- 4 -
education or an equivalent amount of non-formal training, respectively. The
growing skill intensity anticipated for the Korean economy is reflected in
the projected growth rate for technical manpower at an average of 18% p.a.
2.08      In order to test the implications of alternative manpower demand
and supply assumptions, the mission has attempted a simple sensitivity
analysis. It has assumed that technical manpower requirements between now
and 1981 would drop to half the projected levels. This would correspond to
a reduction of real GNP growth from an anticipated annual average of 10.3%
to slightly under 7% for the original planning period 1972-81, or to about
5% for 1974-81. At the same time the supply projections for trained man-
power have been revised upwards to reflect (a) an increased output of tech-
nicians resulting from the conversion of the 5-year higher technical schools
to 2-year technical junior colleges and (b) a greater supply of skilled work-
ers due to increased capacity in the technical high schools and the voca-
tional training institutes. The results are as follows:
Requirements for Technical Manpower, 1974-81
(in '000s)
Cumulative              Cumulative             Surplus (+) or
Requirements               Supply                Deficit (-)

Source:  MOST and mission estimates.
2.09      According to the original projections the supply capacity of the
education and training system would exceed the needs for scientists and en-
gineers, but deficits for technicians and skilled workers were anticipated.
This conclusion would call for an expansion of specific segments of the edu-
cation and training system as well as for qualitative improvements to keep
pace with the increasing complexity of industrial occupations. Measures
would be required by the Government to curtail the supply of scientists!
engineers and to facilitate the occupational transfer of surplus graduates.
However, the possibilities of effective enrollment control by the Government
are presently limited due to the prevalence of private institutions at this
level (w:hich account for almost three quarters of college and university
enrollments) over which it exercises only a limited amount of control.



2.10      According to the sensitivity estimates the surplus of scientists
and engineers would more than double. In the case of technicians, the
reduced deficit of 20,000 technicians could be partly made up by downward
substitution from the scientist/engineer level. However, in specific sectors
such as fisheries and merchant marine, such substitution possibilities appear
to be limited. At the skilled workers level the anticipated deficit, while
greatly reduced, would still seem to warrant an expansion of the correspond-
ing segments of the education and training system. To sum up, even with
economic growth well below the Government's expectations, the proposed lim-
ited expansion appears to be justified.
2.11      The foregoing analysis points to the main dilemma inherent in all
manpower projections and related estimates of education requirements, namely,
their dependence on projections of sectoral output that rarely encompass a
time horizon of more than five - seven years, whereas investment decisions
in the education and training system result in "outputs" with a worklife of
40-50 years. One possible response to this dilemma is to complement the
comparatively inflexible formal education and training system by an array of
non-formal training modes, such as the vocational training institutes. These
would permit a prompt reaction to incipient specific manpower shortages and
surpluses, due in part to the short duration of the training but also to its
integration with other Government activities in the field of labor resulting
in more intensive contacts with industrial establishments. Recent modifica-
tions of the Industrial Training Act, to become effective in 1975, will
delegate a large share of skill training activities to private enterprises
as a further important step towards such a complementary system (see
Appendix II, para 33).
III. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Summary Evaluation
3.01      The Korean education system is comprised of the following cycles:
primary education (grades 1-6), junior secondary education (middle schools,
grades 7-9), senior secondary education (high schools, grades 10-12) and
post-secondary education in junior colleges (grades 13-14) or colleges and
universities (usually 4 years, grades 13-16) (Chart 9083). This formal
education system under the Ministry of Education (IIOE) is complemented by
several vocational and technical training schemes for which the Office of
Labor Affairs (OLA) in the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs is responsible.
3.02      The education and training sector has a sound basis for develop-
ment:



- 6 -
(a) relatively high enrollment ratios 1/ at all levels (97%
in primary, 69% in junior secondary, 32% in senior secondary
and 8% in higher education) (Chart 9084);
(b) high internal efficiency, (92% of the entrants at primary
level, 95% in junior secondary and 93% in senior secondary
education complete the cycle without delay);
(c) low recurrent expenditure per student (about US$25 at primary,
US$35 at lower secondary and US$60 at upper secondary) mainly
due to economical average class sizes;
(d) a substantial proportion of students in vocational or
professional courses in senior secondary (43%), and university
(48%) education;
!C3 a satisfactory level of employment of graduates (nearly two
t,hirds of terminal students in technical high school and
three fourths of junior technical college graduates found
immediate employment in 1973 in the fields for which they were
trained);
(f) moderate regional and rural/urban enrollment differentials
at the basic education level (see Annexes 2 and 3); and
(g) an increasing number of non-formal vocational training
programs supplementing the formal education system accompanied
by a closer cooperation between schools and enterprises.
3.03      Weaknesses include imbalances in the educational structure which
are ex-pected to result in manpower deficits at the skilled worker level and
for certain categories of technicians (and conversely, an oversupply of
soientists ard engineers) during the period 1974-81 (see paras. 2.08-2.11).
Further shortcomings are inappropriate curricula and lack of suitable equip-
ment and specialized facilities in technical secondary education, particularly
i.n the private school segment which accounts for 53% of the 428,000 students
enrolled. Teachers in technical high schools receive an insufficient amount
of puractical training relative to the complexity of their future tasks in
workshop instruction. The combined effect of these weaknesses is an overly
theoretical approach to technical education in most schools. As a result,
many school leavers do not have the necessary practical skills expected of
them in their Jobs as skilled workers.
/   Enrolment ratios include overage students except for primary education.
For purposes of international comparison, see the Comparative Education
Indicators preceding Annex 1.

Education Development Objectives
3.04      Education planning in Korea, apart from the annual budgeting pro-
cess, has been done both as a long-range perspective planning exercise
embodied in the Long-Range Comprehensive Educational Plan 1968-86 (CLEP)
and as a part of the Five Year Development Plan (1972-76). The latter
attempts to formulate concrete investment decisions within the broad frame-
work of the long range plan.
3.05      The main thrust of educational development at primary and middle
school levels is to provide good quality education while maintaining the
present high level of cost-effectiveness. At the high school and post-
secondary levels particularly in technical fields, investment decisions fol-
low manpower requirements. As in the case of primary education, quality and
internal efficiency are supplementary objectives.
3.06      Some recent policy measures in the field of education and train-
ing are aimed at increasing the supply of technicians and skilled workers
through a conversion of the five-year higher technical schools (Gr. 10-14)
to two-year junior technical colleges in response to a covenant in the
Credit Agreement (394-KO) for the second education project, and the partial
delegation of vocational training responsibilities to private enterprises.
Various steps to strengthen co-operation between industry and the education
and training system (such as the creation of a special office in MOE and the
introduction of industry practice for students) are intended to enhance the
external relevance of the education and training system, as are changes in
secondary education curricula, generally in the direction of an increased
proportion of practical subjects.
3.07      The future aims of the Government in the field of education and
training are broadly:
(a) to extend the period of compulsory education to nine years
and to combine the present primary and middle school cycles,
while giving them a stronger practical orientation;
(b) to permit a selective expansion of senior secondary education,
particularly of technical high schools, in accordance with
perceived manpower needs while continuing quality improve-
ments (Annex 4);
(c) to'control expansion of post-secondary enrollments (Annex 4);
(d) to increase the flexibility of the education and training
sector through the addition of non-formal training schemes,
with an active participation of the private enterprises.
The imminent preparation of the next Five Year Development Plan (1977-81)
will provide an opportunity for confirming recent trends in education and
training and for setting new targets within this broad framework.



- 8 -
3.08      The proposed project would contribute towards overcoming the weak-
nesses of the education system (para. 3.03)1_/ by increasing the supply
capacity for skilled workers and by improving the quality of their instruc-
tion, and by giving support to technician training in specific fields where
manpower shortages are anticipated. The government has agreed to develop
and implement a new curriculum for technical teacher training with greater
emphasis on workshop practice (para 4.05).
Financing Educational Development
3.09      Over the last nine years, education expenditures in constant 1970
prices by the MOE have increased at an annual rate of 18.4%, slightly faster
than the central government budget (17.0% p.a.). The 1973 budget of the MOE
(Annex 5) stood at Won 126 billion of which Won 118 billion were for educa-
tional expenditures. Together with the financial contributions of the lower
levels of government (Won 25 billion), and of the private sector (estimated
at Won ,7 billion), total education expenditure reached just over Won 200
billion, or 4.1% of GNP. 2_/
3.10      Tentative projections for education expenditure in constant prices
in 1976 and 1981 are given in Annex 6. They assume an increase in education
and training expenditures from the present level of about Won 200 billion to
Won 250 billion in 1976 and Won 310 billion in 1981, which would amount to
4.2% and 3.1%, respectively, of the projected GNP. These figures do not
suggest the emergence of an education financing problem.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project would pursue the following main objectives:
(i)  meet manpower requirements at the skilled worker and
technician levels for specific economic sectors, while
improving the quality of instruction in the respective
segments of the education system (see paras. 2.08 to
2.11 and 3.03);
(ii)  lay a sound basis for a flexible, employment-oriented
system of non-formal vocational training (see para. 2.11);
(iii)  assist from the perspective of manpower development the
Government's policy of geographic deconcentration of
industries (see para. 2.04).
1/   The quality improvement process would not yet comprise private technical
secondary schools as the preparation of one relevant project item
(centralized workshops) was still incomplete by the time of appraisal.
2/   For purposes of international comparison, see the Comparative
Education Indicators preceding Annex 1.

4.03      A tracer system would be established by the Government in the
project institutions to collect infor-mation on: (a) the employment status
of graduates, one month, six months and o-ne year after leaving school, in-
cluding data on occupation, sector and place of emplcyment and (b) skill



- 10 -
attainments of graduates as measured on performance in license and trade
tests. Information from the tracer system would be used (a) to ascertain
whether the objectives of the project, as summarized in para 4.01, are being
attained, and (b) to identify weaknesses in curricula and teaching methods
which need improvement.  During negotiations the Government agreed that such
a system would be established and that a summary analysis of the relevant
information would be sent to the Bank annually for five consecutive years
in accordance with an agreed schedule.
The Project Items:
A.   Ministry of Education (MOE)
Technical High School (proposed outlay: US$4.2 million)
4.04      The new technical high school at Iri would concentrate on mech-
anical and electrical engineering and plumbing courses to support the in-
dustries to be established nearby in a new industrial complex. The school
would use facilities vacated by a university, most of the buildings still
being in satisfactory condition. The planned enrollment would be just under
2,000 and the annual output 660.
4.05      The 80 technical teachers needed for this school would have to attend
an intensive in-service training course, centering on workshop practice, to
bring their teaching skills to an acceptable level.  During negotiations the
government agreed that an intensive in-service training program on practical
work would be carried out for the technical teachers of the new Iri Mechanical
Technical School within two years after signing the Loan Agreement. In
addition, the curriculum for the pre-service training of technical teachers
should be strengthened in its practical content (paras 3.03 and 3.06), which
would require additional facilities and equipment. The Government also agreed
that (a) within one year after signing the Loan Agreement, a new curriculum
for the Dre-service technical teacher training course would be developed and
sent to the Bank for comment; (b) within three years after signing the Loan
Agreezment, this curriculum would be implemented in the existing industrial
education departments of university colleges of education and (c) the Govern-
ment would make arrangements to provide the additional facilities and equip-
ment required for implementation of the new curriculum.  Technical assistance
cotalling 12 man/years for the training of technical teacher-trainers would
be arranged by the government within nine months after signing of the Loan
Agreement.
Agricultural Junior Colleges (proposed outlay: US$2.9 million)
4.C,,6    The ongoing process of diverslfiStion in Korea's agriculture, the
increasing complexity and capital-intensity of the technologies employed,
and agro-industrial development call for better trained personnel, particu-
larly az the intermediate level. Earlier Bank Group lending (paras 1.01 - 1.02)



- 11 -
assisted the training of agricultural technicians through investments in
three of the six public junior colleges of agriculture. The proposed project
item would consist of equipment and construction for minor extensions to the
existing facilities for the remaining three public junior colleges of agricul-
ture. Each junior college would eventually enroll 800 students, compared
with about 600 at present. Due to the remote location of the colleges,
boarding facilities would be required for 13%, 10% and 25% of the student
body at Yesan, Sangju and Suncheon, respectively. The two colleges at Yesan
and Sangju would need more farmland for practical work. During negotiations,
the Government stated that over 5 ha of easily accessible farmland had been
allocated to each college.
4.07      The junior colleges train technicians in agronomy, livestock (animal
science), horticulture, forestry, agricultural civil engineering, farm
machinery, filature, sericulture, home economics and food processing. Be-
cause of the conversion from five-year to two-year programs (para 3.06) a
revision of curricula to suit better the specific training needs of techni-
cians was required. The Government has just completed this work, and the
revised curricula are satisfactory.
4.08      About 50 teaching staff would be needed in each institution.  The
present supply of university trained teachers is adequate, but some in-
service training would be necessary to familiarize the present teaching
staff with the new curricula. A fellowship program of eight man-years for
teaching staff of the agricultural junior colleges would be arranged by the
Government within nine months after signing of the Loan Agreement.
Fisheries College (proposed outlay: US$2.7 million) and Fisheries High
Schools (proposed outlay: US$2.3 million)
4.09      Between 1974 and 1981 the country plans almost to double its
fishing fleet to permit a broadening of the nutrition base of the population
and to increase foreign exchange earnings. Since expansion will be partic-
ularly marked in the category of deep-sea vessels, skilled manpower needs
will increase substantially (Annex 7). The project would finance extensions
of physical facilities and equipment for the only existing fisheries college
at Busan, and for three of the nine existing fisheries high schools (at
Jumunjin, Pohang and Geoje), all at the east and southeast coast of Korea
where most of the country's fishing fleet is based. The expanded fisheries
college would have an output between 1974 and 1981 of 1,720 graduates in
fishing, marine engineering, processing, aquaculture, fisheries management
and fisheries education, or 80% of the total expected output. 1/ The three
fisheries highi schools would produce during the same period, 4,000 graduates
in fishing, marine engineering, communications, aquaculture, processing and
naval architecture, over 40% of the total output at this level.
1/   Including graduates trained by the Department of Fishteries, Cheju
University.



- 12 -
4.10      About 90% of fisheries college graduates become licenced naviga-
tors, engineers and radio operators. Total output up to 1981, increased
to 10,600 by the second and proposed third project, would meet about 80% of
the expected demand. The remaining deficit of about 3,000 could be met
from merchant marine school graduates. The 20 additional staff for the
Fisheries College would be recruited from the ranks of the college's graduates.
The specialist teachers for the fisheries high schools would be graduates of
the Fisheries College and Cheju University. The Geoje Fisheries High School
would include a specialization on naval architecture with 540 students to
train draughtsmen for the planned shipbuilding center at Geoje, the country's
second after Ulsan.
Marine Junior College (proposed outlay: US$0.9 million)
4.11      Korea's merchant marine fleet is planned to become an important
source of foreign exchange earnings (5% of the total by 1981). To realize
this goaal, a rapid increase is required in the number of vessels and, in
specialzzed manpower. To facilitate this, the project would include financ-
ing of equipment for the Mokpo Marine Junior College to enable it to train
better qualified navigators, engineers and radio operators.
4.12      The college would expand its enrollment from 960 1/ to 1,600 with
700 each in the navigation and marine engineering courses and 200 in the radio
operators course. The annual output would increase to 350 navigators, 350
engineers and 100 radio operators totalling about 40% of the expected demand
uJ to 1931.  The Government has already started to build the required add-
i ional 'acilities.  A new large training vessel would be desirable for this
college but is not essential at present because the college has a 700-ton
vessel which can be used for 120 trainees. The additional 60 teachers re-
quired for the expansion would be recruited from among graduates of the
Busan Marine College.
B.   Office of Labor Affairs (OLA)
Vocational Training Institutes (proposed outlay: US$14.9 million)
4.13      Korea's anticipated industrial development will require large
numbers of skilled workers (paras 2.08-2.11). To assist the development of
a flexible and employment-oriented system of non-formal vocational training
as exemplified by OLA's existing Vocational Training Institutes (para 2.11),
the project would include the establishment of seven new VTIs under the
responsib4lity of OLA, each with 360 places and 50% boarding facilities
reserved for rural students. The VTIs would be located at Chungmu, Changweon,
Jeonju, Gumi, Suncheon, Pohang and Cheorngju. The regular one-year courses
would concentrate on meeting the requirements for skilled workers of the new
heavy industries. They would comprise training related to tool and die-making,
machine work, general fitting, sheet metal work and welding, plumbing,
1/   Including students in grades 10-12 which will be discontinued.



- 13 -
electricity and electronics (Annex 8). The program would also inclutde up-
grading and supervisors' courses. About 80% of the training would consist
of workshop practice.
4.14      Since the 2,520 places would be used in 1-1/2 shifts, the annual
output from the regular courses would be about 3,800. The successful
precedent of the Busan VTI (so far the only one in full operation) suggests
that most of the trainees would be able to pass the grade II trade tests 1/
and obtain employment related to their training. There should also be an
ample supply of trainees, given the present application/admission ratio
of four to one which makes it necessary to use aptitude tests as an additional
selection criterion.
4.15      Instructors for the new VTIs would be provided hy the Central VTI
which presently graduates 210 trainees a year following a 2-year course of
high standard. This would be adequate to meet the staff requirements for all
VTIs presently under construction or planned. To give the VTI expansion
program adequate support in curricula development and staff training, 11.5
man-years of specialists services and 17 man-years of fellowships would be
required during implementation. The Government agreed during negotiations
to make arrangements for such technical assistance within nine months after
signing of the Loan Agreement.
Technical Assistance (proposed outlay: US$0.5 million)
4.16      During negotiations, the Government agreed that arrangements for
technical assistance (Annex 9) for the proposed project (paras 4.05, 4.08
and 4.15) would be made within nine months of signing the Loan Agreement.
An amount of $500,000 for engineering and technical services for the pre-
paration of future projects has been included in the proposed project
(para. 5.12).
V. PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND INPLEMENTATION
Cost Estimates
5.01      The estimated costs and foreign exchange component of the various
parts of the project are given in Annexes 10 and 11 and are summarized below.
1/   OLA performs trade testing at four levels, grades I and II combining a
theoretical paper and skill tests. The tests are demanding by interna-
tional comparison.

5.02      Base cost refers to estimated prices in November, 1974.  Construction
cost estimates have been derived from recent school building costs in Korea.
The average cost estimated at US$120 per m2 is comparable to construction
costs in other Asian countries. Unit capital costs per place are US$5,500
for the VTIs, and US$2,100 1/ for the technical high school. These figures
are reasonable in view of recent inflation which doubled unit building costs
in Korea over the last two years. Utilization factors for the classrooms,
workshops and laboratories of the project i.istitutions are economical at
about 80% for about 40 hours of use per week. Estimates of equipment costs
are based on preliminary equipment lists prepared by the Korean authorities
for each project institution, as reviewed and revised during appraisal.
These estimates, which take account of the equipment already available in
the institutions, are reasonable.
1/   70% of the buildings already exist.



- 15 -
5.03      Physical contingencies (Annex 12) add 10% for unforeseen factors to
the cost estimates of site development, construction, furniture, professional
fees, equipment and technical services. A total price contingency of US$7.7
million equivalent is included for expected price escalation at the following
annual rates for various components: 15% - 12% for civil works, and
furniture, 11% to 7.5% for equipment and 10% for professional services.  Al-
together, price contingencies would amount to about 25% of the base cost of
the project plus physical contingencies.
5.04      Based on detailed analysis during appraisal, the foreign exchange
component has been estimated as follows: (a) site development, 15%; (b)
construction and furniture, 25%; (c) equipment, 90%; (d) professional fees,
10%; (e) engineering and technical services, 83%. These percentages have
been slightly increased by the effects of the recent devaluation. Including
contingencies, the foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$22.3
million, or 57% of the total project cost.
Financial Plan
5.05      The financial plan proposed by the Government provides for Bank
assistance to finance a part of the costs of civil works, furniture, equip-
ment, professional fees and engineering and technical services.  By a grouping
of MOE and OLA project items, the project would be financed as follows:

5.06      The recurrent expenditure generated by this project would amount
to about 0.7 billion Won p.a. for the Ministry of Education and 0.6 billion
Won p.a. for the Office of Labor Affairs in 1974 prices, or about 1% and
6% of their budgeted total recurrent expenditures in 1973 and 1974, respec-
tively. The additional expenditures could be accommodated without undue
financial difficulty to the Government within the feasible growth of educa-
tion expenditures (para 3.10).

Project implementation
5.07      Administration.  The existing project unit established in the
Ministry of Education (MOE) for the implementation of the first and second
projects would be responsible for administration, financial control and
liaison with the Bank for the MOE project items. However, it would need
to be strengthened to carry out the additional work on the third project.
During negotiations, the Government agreed that within one year from the
signing of the Loan Agreement, at least six additional architectural,
engineering and maintenance staff would be appointed to the project unit
for the supervision of the design and construction of civil works, and
delivery and installation of equipment.
5.08      A project unit existing in the Office of Labor Affairs in the
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs for the implementation of the current
VTI program would be responsible for administration, financial control and
liaisol- w th the Bank for the seven VTIs.  In line with additional respons-
ibilities lt would increase the staff by adding a full-time assistant to
the Project Director, a full-time project architect, a project engineer and
a procurement officer. During negotiations, the Government agreed that the
additional staff would be appointed in consultation with the Bank within six
months after signing the Loan Agreement.
5.09      Civil works would be based on the space standards established, and
equipment lists to the extent practicable on the master lists approved for
similar institutions in the first and second projects. In all cases, sketch
plans for civil works and major components of lists of furniture and equip-
ment would be reviewed by the Bank before procurement.
5.10      The proposed project would be implemented in about 4.5 years, but
construction and procurement of the equipment and furniture should be
completed for (a) the Ministry of Education project items in about three years
and (b) the Office of Labor Affairs component in about 3.5 years (Annex 13).
S5.1      Procurement.  Both project units would work closely with the Office
of Supply, Republic of Korea for the procurement of civil works, furniture
and equipment. Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding following domestic advertising and local procedures
satisfactory to the Bank, because (a) all the civil works contracts in the
first and second education projects have been awarded to local building
contractors and no foreign firms, although allowed to, have submitted bids
and (b) there is an efficient and large construction industry in Korea.
Therefore, it is expected that all of the civil works contracts would be
awarded to local contractors. Furniture and equipment contracts over
US$50,000 Twould be aw'arded under international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and
!DA Credits. All furniture contracts are, however, likely to be won by
Local contractors. Although most of the equipment contracts would be awarded
to foreign suppliers, domestic manufacturers are becoming competitive in
selected areas of equipment. Most of the equipment to be procured consists



- 17 -
of inexpensive items (i.e. with unit costs less than US$1,000) to be distri-
buted to dispersed locations. Furniture and equipment items that cannot be
grouped in packages of at least US$50,000 and with unit costs less than
US$5,000 would be procured without prior Bank approval on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures,
which are satisfactory to the Bank. It is expected that all furniture and
20% of the equipment would be procured on this basis.  Foreign suppliers
are not prevented from submitting bids under local procurement procedures.
Suitably qualified domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential
margin of 15%, or the existing customs duty, whichever is the lower, over
the c.i.f. price of the competing imports. Customs duties on most of the
items to be procured under the project exceed 15%.
Professional Services
5.12      Design and supervision of civil works would be the responsibility
of consultant firms acceptable to the Bank selected and commissioned by MOE
and OLA respectively on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Korea
has sufficiently qualified consultant firms to design and supervise this
project. Provision is also made in the project for US$500,000 to cover the
costs of engineering and technical services required to prepare future
education proj ects.
5.13      Satisfactory implementation of the project depends on the timely
preparation of architectural designs and equipment lists and on an adequate
phasing of procurement. Past experience shows that selection of consultant
firms is a time-consuming procedure. During negotiations, the Government
agreed to select consultant firms for MOE and OLA to design the civil works
of the project within four months after signing the Loan Agreement and appoint
them within eight months after signing the Loan Agreement.
Sites
5.14      The site for the Iri Mechanical Technical School has been estab-
Lished and is suitable.  Sites for the VTIs have been selected but not yet
acquired. During negotiations, the Government agreed that suitable sites
for the VTIs at Chungmu, Changweon, Jeonju, Gumi, Suncheon, Pohang and
Cheongju would be acquired in accordance with a schedule agreed with the
Bank.
Disburs ement
5.15      The proposed loan of US$22.5 million would finance the foreign
exchange component of civil works, professional fees, furniture and equip-
ment, the ex-factory costs of equipment awarded to domestic manufacturers
and 90% of the total expenditures for the engineering and technical services.
Bank Group financial assistance would be equivalent to about 58% of the total
project cost and would be disbursed to meet:



- 18 -
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. costs of directly imported equipment,
and 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment;
(b)  70% of the total cost of imported and locally procured
equipment;
(c)  30% of total expenditures on civil works (including
professional fees) and furniture, equivalent to the
estimated foreign exchange component; and
(d)  90% of the total expenditures on engineering and tech-
nical services.
The above percentages would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursements
over the implementation period of the project and to ensure full disburse-
ment. Savings under one category would be available to cover overruns in
other categories. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 14.
Disbursement is expected to be completed by mid-1980.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The proposed project would contribute to economic growth by pro-
viding more and better skill training in key sectors. It would help train
the manpower required, both quantitative and qualitative, to support Korea's
industrialization program, particularly in expansion of heavy industries,
and in the development of special sectors such as agriculture, fisheries
and merchant marine.
6.02      Quantitatively, the accumulated additional outputs of institutions
in the project up to 1981 would be about 2,700 for technicians and about
18,000 for skilled workers. This output would meet:
(a) 3% of the cumulative supply for technicians between
1974-81, and
(b) 3% of the cumulative supply for skilled workers
between 1974-81 (para 2.08).
No greater expansion of skill training can be envisaged at this time because
of constraints on teacher supply and finance. The remaining deficits would
be met through downward substitution from the engineer/scientist level in
the case of technicians and, for skilled workers, through in-plant training
and up-grading of semi-skilled workers.
6.03      Qualitatively, the project would provide improved facilities and
equipment which, together with new curricula to be developed by the govern-
ment, would enable more practical training and skills to be taught than at



- 19 -
present (para 3.03). With these improvements it is expected that the con-
tribution of training to worker productivity would increase. A survey
conducted by the Research Institute for Industrial Development of Korea
indicated that, on average, (i) a worker gains 20% in efficiency from
training; (ii) training brings about a significant reduction in the rate
of defective work (10% to 40% depending on the industry); and (iii) the
accident rate among trained workers is about half of that among untrained
workers.
6.04      By supporting the country's industrial development program, the
project would also make an indirect contribution towards the equalization
of economic and social opportunities, and more specifically, towards re-
ducing urban/rural income differentials. Since the unused agricultural
potential of Korea is diminishing, the scope of non-agricultural activities
in rural areas has to increase rapidly lest the moderate income gap between
the countryside and the cities widens. The location of the new vocational
training institutes follows closely the Government's policy of geographic
deconcentration of industries. A more direct pursuit of the equality ob-
jective would be through a 50% recruitment quota for rural youth in the
VTIs made possible by adequate boarding facilities. About 2,500 of the
rural middle school leavers would benefit annually from this avenue to
economic and social promotion.
6.05      The realization of these benefits would depend crucially on
adequate instruction in workshop practice for the technical teachers at
the technical high school and adequate technical assistance to support the
establishment of the new VTIs. Arrangements for adequate and appropriate
technical assistance to meet the above conditions (paras 4.05 and 4.16).
The stipulated establishment of a tracer system would permit periodic
checking on the achievement of the project's objectives and, in addition,
provide the Government with a model for monitoring the performance of its
entire education system.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following principal points:
(a) the establishment of a tracer system (para 4.03);
(b) provision of an intensive in-service training program
on practical work for the technical teachers of the
new Iri Mechanical Technical School (para 4.05);
(c) development and implementation of a new curriculum
for the pre-service technical teacher training course
with additional facilities and equipment (para 4.05);



- 20 -
(d)  arrangements for obtaining technical assistance
required for the project (pata 4.16);
(e)  appointment of additional staff for the two
project units and consultant firms (paras 5.07,
5.08 and 5.13); and
(f) acquisition of suitable sites for the seven vocational
training institutes (para 5.14).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank Loan
of US$22.5 million equivalent to the Government of Korea for a term of 25
years including a 7-year grace period.

SUMARY OF PREVIOUS WORLD BANK GROUP
EDUCATION PROJECTS IN KOREA
Education Project I (Credit 151-10)
1.        The first education project in Korea was signed in 1969 under
Credit 151-K0 with an estimated total project cost of US$26.8 million of
which US$14.8 million is financed by the Credit.  The principal objective
of the project is the improvement of existing schools to enable them to
produce well-trained people suited to the needs of Korea's growing commerce
and industry, rather than a substantial increase in pupil enrolments.
2.        Accordingly, the project provides urgently needed facilities to
assist teaching agricultural, commercial, scientific and industrial subjects
at 32 schools. one university agricultural education department, and 3
university science teacher training departments. Technical teacher training
is included at 3 schools. Student enrolments in these schools and departments
in 1974 totaled 33,600 which is expected to reach 36,000 on completion of the
project in 1975. Consultant architectural services to carry out the school
construCtion program and a team of specialists to assist in developing
agricultural and technical education were also provided for the project.
3.        Implementation is about one year behind original estimate principally
due to delays in the appointment of consultants and inexperience of the
project unit in equipment procurement. These causes of initial delay have
now been overcome. All civil works have been completed and equipment procure-
ment is also near complpSetion. Further extension of the Closing Date (December
31, 1975) is not anticipated.  Total project cost is now estimated at US$26.1
million which is about 3% below the original estimate. Disbursement has
reached 75% of the Credit.
4.        The experiences gained from the implementation of this project are
as follows;
(a) the enrollment targets appear to have been achieved;
(b)  the achievement oi improved educational quality has not
yet been demonstrated and its measurement must await
the time when the equipment has been installed and used
by the students for at least one full cycle of their
education. i.e., three years, but there has been a
visible improvement in the teaching environment in those
schools with installed equipment;



APPENDIX I
Page 2
(c) delays in the appointment of consultant firms are crucial;
steps should be taken to avoid such delays in future projects;
and
(d) the use of expatriate specialists services should be carefully
weighed in comparison to the use of local expertise.
Education Project II (Loan 906-KO/Credit 394-KO)
1.        The second project, under Loan 906-KO/Credit 394-KO of 1973,
consists of:
(a) equipment and extensions of buildings for:
(i) 14 agricultural and 18 technical high schools;
(ii) ten higher schools/junior colleges for agricultural,
industrial, fishery and nursing training;
(iii) selected colleges of agriculture, engineering,
science in ten universities and a college of
merchant marine; and
(iv) ten junior teacher colleges and twelve colleges of
education;
(b) specialist services and fellowships for carrying out two
pre-investment studies to complete programming in the fields
of health and management education respectively and for
assisting staff development in the project institutions at
the university level.
The project institutions will eventually have a total of 44,200 student
places, of which only 5,900 are new since emphasis is on the improvement
of the quaLity of the output and on the efficiency and productivity of the
sector rather than on expansion.
2.        The improvement program of vocational education in the agricul-
-ural and technical high schools (grades 10-12) of the project (27,800
student places and 9,000 student places respectively) provides for the
iatroduction of n.# and more practical curricula and the establishment of
cioser ties with the agricultural extens.ion and with industry.  In addition
to their regular three-year programs, the schools will conduct accelerated
training and evening courses.
.The project will assist the reorganization of six higher schools
e;des 70- 4 at present) to provide two-year post-secondary technicial
so.rses e(zrades 13-14) and the improvenent of four schools of nursing (grades
73-15). The reorganization of the higher schools (4,720 student places)



APPENDIX I
Page 3
will expand output at the subprofessional level in line with estimated manpower
needs, rationalize the system and improve equality of educational opportunity
since all secondary school graduates will be able to compete for entry into
such higher schools. The improvement of a limited number of schools of
nursing (1,200 student places) where training is geared to the needs of rural
areas, together with provision for a pre-investment study on health education,
will be a first step toward comprehensive development of medical and para-
medical training.
4.        The colleges to be strengthened as a part of the project were
selected in accordance with the Government's university development plan
for:
(a) improving the quality of a limited number of the 71
Korean universities, giving priority to Seoul National
University and to national universities in the provinces;
(b) emphasizing relevance to regional manpower needs; and
(c) continuing enrollment control but making the present
system more flexible.
The colleges of agriculture in the project (1,700 student places) will pro-
vide teaching and research support to other agriculture colleges and emphasize
instruction and research in animal production and high yielding rice varieties,
two fields of special significance to increased food production. In the
colleges of engineering and sciences (12,000 student places) curricula will
be modernized in support of the planned development of heavy and chemical
industries. The college of merchant marine (800 student places) when pro-
perly equipped, will update instruction in navigation and marine engineering
techniques in line with the plans to promote the shipping industry.
5.        Ten junior teacher colleges for primary teacher training (8,800
student places) will be equipped to permit the implementation of a training
program designed to prepare the teachers for wider responsibilities in com-
munity development and for the use of modern instructional techniques. The
12 colleges of education, equipped and expanded as a part of the project
(11,200 student places) will increase the supply of secondary teachers in
accord with estimated needs and promote the institutional and administrative
changes required to give pedagogical training to the increasing number of
graduates from other colleges (agriculture, liberal arts and sciences,
engineering) expected to enter the teaching profession.
6.        The total project cost is estimated at US$70.2 million and Bank/IDA
assistance comprises a credit of US$20 million and a loan of US$23 million.
The latest estimate of total project cost at about US$98 million represents
a 40% increase over the original estimate and is mainly due to sharp increases
in building costs in the past two years. After 14 months of implementation
US$0.12 million has been disbursed, about 70% of the scheduled disbursements.
The need for more counterpart funds from the Government may result in an



APPENDIX I
Page 4
extension of the building program from two to three years and consequently
a delay of the project completion by one year. The Government has been
requested to provide more funds to avoid this delay.
7.        Implementation is still at an early stage.  Civil works for the
first group of the project schools have commenced and equipment procurement,
although in the preparation stage, is satisfactory. Conversion of the
five-year to two-year program in higher schools is taking place as a result
of the covenant requirement in the Credit Agreement. Other benefits from
the project cannot be determined yet.



APPENDIX II

THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Structure
1.        The structure of the education system (Chart 9083) is six years
of primary education (Gr. 1-6), three years junior secondary education
(Gr. 7-9), three years senior secondary education (Gr. 10-12) and four years
of higher education (Gr. 13-16).
2.        Only primary education is compulsory.  The Government intends to
introduce by the early 1980s a compulsory nine-year education. Middle schools
(grades 7-9) may be integrated with primary schools after the completion of a
US$7.5 million project financed by USAID and executed by the Korean Education-
al Development Institute (KEDI), on formulating objectives, developing
curricula and reviewing the necessary cnanges in teacher training and the use
of modern education technologies. Senior secondary enrollments are divided
between general and vocational high schools in the proportion 57% to 43%.
Comprehensive schools with general and vocational streams are new and account
for only about one-seventh of the total enrollment at this level. Hligher
education consists of two levels, the junior colleges for grades 13 and 14,
and the universities and colleges with most courses of four years duration
for grades 13 to 16. The five-year programs in higher schools (grades 10-14)
are being phased out.
3.        The education system also includes trade schools (61 with some
11,000 pupils) at the junior secondary level and higher trade schools (53 with
12,500 pupies), civic schools (40 with 3,000 pupils) and higher civic schools
(264 with 52,000 pupils). Sixteen primary teacher training colleges with
about 13,000 students operate at the junior college level. The education
system is supplemented by non-formal training which consists of farmer train-
ing centers, 4-H Clubs, rural training centers, vocational training institutes,
in-plant training and correspondence courses. In the past, apprenticeship
schemes have not been developed due to lack of interest from enterpreneurs,
but implementation of recent revisions of the Industrial Training Law may
bring a change.
4.        Schools are classified as national, public and private according
to their source of finance. National schools are maintained by the Central
Government, and public schools by the Provinces and Special Cities, with
subsidies being paid by the central authorities. The distribution of
enrollments (Chart 9084) among those three categories by level of education
is as follows:

Administration
The responsibility for Korea's formal education rests mainly with
tne MIinistry of Education (MOE). Other Ministries, such as Agriculture and
isneries, Commerce and Industry, Communications, Construction, Health and
Social Affairs, National Defense and Transportation, share responsibilities
£or training related to their work. The Office of Labor Aifairs (OLA) rLow
under the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, however, has been delegated
a large r.are of responsibilities for non-formal vocational training outside
thie 1M1inistry of Education.
6.        The Economic Development Plan is the responsibility of the Econo-
mic Planning Board (EPB), headed by the Deputy Prime Minister.  In con-
,unction with the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) responsible
for manpower forecasts, and MOE and OLA which are mainly responsible for
short--term planning, administration and plan execution EPB also prepares
long-range education and manpower development plans within the overall
-co.omic development strategy.  MOE has an Office of Planning and Management
to work out programs to implement educational development plans.
Both the MOE and OLA are well-organized and efficient admin-
istative bodies.  The MOE is assisted by Boards of Education in each of the
nine provinces and the two special cities. OLA is assisted by 28 regional
offices located strategically in accordance with labor densities.
General Education
2.        Primary Education reached 97% of the children within the age group
of 6 to 11 in 1973. The total enrollment of about 5.7 million at this level
is expected to decline slightly to about 5.5 million in the next six years
due to low population growth (para 2.01). This natural decrease will permit
more financial resources to be devoted to other levels and to quality
improvements. Repeater and dropout rates are low, both under 5% p.a. Inter-
nal efficiency is high; about 92 out of 100 entering students complete the
full six years of primary education. The curriculum is sufficiently broad,
textbooks are available, almost all teachers are qualified (less than 1% are
unlicensed) and quality is satisfactory. The average class size is 58 and
the pupil teacher ratio is 53:1. Large class size is thie principal factor
responsible for low cost per student. The unit recurrent cost in 1973 was
about US$30, low by international comparison. Primary education is compulsory



APPEiiDIX II
Page 3
but not free; contributions to the school-support fund from Won 1,200
to 7,200 p.a. per student. However, about 60% of the students are partially
or totally exempt.
9.        At the junior secondary (middle school) level, there were about
1,920 schools and 1,832,000 students in 1973, reaching a gross enrollment
ratio of 69%. There were still no middle schools in 380 "miens" 1/ in 1974.
These miens are in remote areas, mostly islands. Primarv school leavers are
permitted to enter middle schools without examination if they so wish.
About 70% of the primary school leavers enrolled in middle schools in 1973.
10.       Class sizes average 64 students and the average pupil/teacAer ratio
is 43:1.  Almost all teachers are university graduates.  The progression
rate by grade is high at about 98%.  The recurrent cost per student is about
US$70, low by international standards, chiefly because of large class sizes.
'The curriculum emphasizes academic subjects, but is being revised by KiLDI
under the USAID project to include more science and practical subjects and
allow for the use of modern education technology including educational radio
and television. This will necessitate additional facilities and equipment
together with corresponding changes in teacher education. The Government
realizes the importance of this re-orientation but gives higher priority
to other types of education (e.g. technical high schools) . Only a pilot
scheme is contemplated which would test tihe suggested innovations and would
be limited to a sample of mostly rural schools.
11.       Admission to high schools is through a combinatior, of entrance
examinations and, if necessary, a lottery, should the number of successful
candidates per school exceed the number of available places. In this case,
however, additional factors, such as proximity to the school, are taken into
account.  For some vocational high schools, recommendations by the heads
of the candidates' middle schools are used in lieu of examinations. About
7(>, of L-he students in the final year of middle school have in the past
found places in high schools.  For terminal students, about 150,000 every
year, some form of non-formal education would be desirable to facilitate
their transition into worklife.
12,       At the senior secondary level, 839,000 students were enrolled in
1973 and the enrollment ratio was 32% of the relevant age group (including
overage students).  !bout 49% of the students were in general higig  senools
and 51% in vocational high schools including comprelhensive schools. 2/ Tihe
average enrollment growth rate between 1971 and 1973 was 11.5% (17.5T for
vocational courses and only 6% for general courses). Enrollment in compre-
hensive schools more than doubled during that period. Tfhe government assigns
high priority to both quantitative and qualitative improvements at this level,

particularly for technical high schools which offer courses related to heavy
and chemical industries. Plans include tne establishment of public cen-
tralized workshops for private technical high schools, but the preparation
work has not progressed to a stage which would permit inmmediate implementation.
13.       The internal efficiency at this level is also high; about 93 out
of 100 entering students complete the 3-year course. The average class
size is 57 and the pupil/teacher ratio 31:1. The unit recurrent cost is
about US$70. About 30% of the high school graduates are admitted into
higher education institutions. The employmnent prospects of those who do
not proceed to further education are good, particularly for school-leavers
from vocational schools.
Technical Education
14.       Technical education is insignificant at the junior secondary level.
At the senior level, there is a variety of institutions whicn can be grouped
in t'ne following broad categories:
Enrollment                                 Teacher/

The present policy on currlculum is to introduce more flexibility
cya1½w-ng students electives up to one third of tthe total school time
compared with 20% or less at present.  About 70, of the curriculum is for
specialized subjects and slightly over 40% for practical training. This

provides about 2,000 hours of practical work in three years, a satisfactory
length of time in which to acquire prescribed skills. The actual practical
training periods in most schools are less than foreseen in the curricula,
mainly due to lack of equipment. Required equipment is gradually being
procured, delivered and installed in public technical high schools with
the assistance of the World Bank. An emerging constraint for achieving
high quality training appears to be the quality of technical teachers.
Teachers presently receive only a total of 1,000 hours of instruction in
practical work themselves during pre-service training (Gr. 13-16), and will
probably be unable to supervise the students effectively in the more complex
exercises.
16.       Relationships between schools and industry are now being strengthened.
A new section has been established under the Science Education Bureau of MOE.
Students in technical high schools are normally required to work in industry
for about six months if places are available in nearby factories.
17.       Employment prospects of graduates are good.  About 70% of the
graduates are absorbed by related industries; about 30% proceed for further
studies and military service. A few selected technical high schools follow
a special curriculum with about 70% of weekly time spent on practical work.
Their graduates receive about 3,000 hours of training and almost all find
industrial employment soon after graduation at attractive starting salaries.
Agricultural Education
18.       Agricultural education in Korea is organized in a three-tiered
system consisting of agricultural high schools (Gr. 10-12); agricultural
junior colleges (the former agricultural higher schools Gr. 13-14) and
the agricultural faculties at the universities (Gr. 13-16). The relative
decline of agriculture as an employer and contributor to WP in recent
years has been reflected in a decline in the number of agricultural
high schools and a stronger emphasis on agro-industrial components in all
agricultural education. The number of schools has fallen from 133 in 1962
to 66 in 1973. Total 1973 enrollment was 35,200 with 9,700 graduates.
A further decline in school numbers is predicted while total enrollments
in three levels are expected to stabilize. Non-formal agricultural education
efforts center on the farmer training centers run by ORD 1/ and on OLA's
rural vocational training centers. The latter also encompass pre-vocational
training for rural youth, as a means to facilitate their transition to an
industrial work life.
19.       Tne public agricultural higher schools (Gr. 10-14) are being
phased out and coverted to two-year agricultural junior colleges (Gr. 13 -
14). Only one private higher school will continue its present program.
Three of these junior colleges were assisted by earlier Bank Group loans.
Total enrollment at these schools in 1973 was 5,350. Of these students,
1/   ORD - Office of Rural Development.

Page 6
1 ,020 were in the first year of the new two-year program. During the tranisi-
tion period all available space vacated by graduates of the five-year pro-
gram will be utilized by intake for the new junior college program. Total
enrollment in the six public Junior colleges is expected to rise to 4,600 dy
97& and to a maximum of 6,200 by 1978. In 1973, 29 colleges and universities
w,th 108 departments enrolled 10,300 students and produced 2,300 graduates.
About 300 students were enrolled in graduate programs.
z0i.      The system of agricultural education shows signs of imbalance.
The two well-developed layers of university and high school education botn
produce surpluses of graduates, while the middle level (junior agricultural
colleges) lags behind in development - both in size (a deficit of agri-
cuLtural technicians is expected to persist through the period 1972-81)
and in quality (as evidenced by inadequate facilities and equipment).
Curriculum revision and teacher up-grading are considered essential for
successful conversion of the agricultural higher schools to junior colleges.
Fisheries and Merchant I4arine Education
21.       Fisheries education institutions exist as three levels.  The nine
fisheries high schools 1/ (Gr. 10-12) enrolled 5,500 and graduated 1,200
in 1973 with courses in fishing, marine engineering and communications; a
fisheries junior college (Gr. 13-14) enrolled 2,900 and graduated 3,600
in i973 is to be joined in 1975 by three more such institutions which are
presently operated as higher fisheries schools, offering also courses in
rishIng, marine engineering and communications. Eleven fisheries departments
colleges and universities enrolled 2,000 students and graduated 420 in
1Pi3, with courses in aquaculture, fishing, food product processing, marine
biology, marine product, fisheries management, marine engineering, navigation
and communications.
22.       There are two merchant marine junior colleges (Cr. 13 - 14) and
one college (Gr. 13 - 16) with three departments each, viz.,:  navigation,
marine engineering and communications. Enrollments and outputs are included
in the figures for fisheries education.  The graduates from the two levels
are to some extent interchangeable. The education qualifications required
for fisheries and merchant marine personnel vary with the range of opera-
tions and the size of vessel (Annex 7).
Teacher Training
23,       Primary school teachers are trained in two year courses (Gr.
13 - 14) at 16 junior teachers training colleges (Gr. 13 - 14). Recent
outputs, slightly under 6,000 p.a., have exceeded available teaching positions
due to a declining primary enrollment. Enrollments will therefore be
curtailed from 12,700 in 1973 to about 9,700 in 1976, thereby reducing the
output to about 4,700, adequate to meet requirements for attrition and some
reduction in class sizes. Generally, the curriculum is balanced by group of
1/   Plus one comprehensive higih school with fisheries courses.

subjects.  Tne standard of training is acceptable and will be furthier
improved as a result of tne second education project witn additional equip-
ment.
,4.       Secondary school teachers are trained in four year courses (Gr.
13-16) in 207 education departments of universities and colleges.  The
enrollment was 23,000 and the output, 3,000 in 1973.  In view of middle and
high school enrollment projections (Annex 4) and the fact t:hat university
graduates with some additional pedagogical training can reasonably substitute
for regularly trained teachers, the Government has assigned low priority to
further quantitative expansion in this sub-sector of education.
25.        Technical teacher training is carried out in industrial education
departments of eleven university faculties of engineerinn.  The annual supply
from these regular courses is 225 at present, but is expected to grow to
440 by 1978.  Tne stock of technical teachers in 1973 was 2,200 with a snort-
age of about 1,400.  Estimated additional requirements for technical teachers
up to 1981 are about 2,000 for expansion and 500 for replacement.  Total
supply over this period falls short of the total anticipated requirements of
3,900 by about 1,200 but this shortage could be met from the expected
continuing surplus of engineer college graduates.  The tecihnical teacner
training curriculum contains only about 1,000 hours of practical work in tue
four-year course for acquisition of skills, and (as pointed out in para 15),
this seems to be inadequate for teaching skills to students in a program
totalling about 2,000 hours of training and encompassing complex operations
in its final stage.  The Government has become aware of thi1s shortcoming and
plans to revise the curriculum by introducing increased practical content
and by providing the additional facilities and equipment required.
iigher Education
26.      'Twelve junior colleges operate two year courses (Gr. 13 - 14),
enrolling 4,250 students in 1973.  Ten nurses training scihools gave three-year
courses to 2,410 students (down from 5,330 in 1971) and graduated 1,730 nurses
in 1973. The five year courses in higher schools are being phased out except
a few private ones.
27.       The 70 technical junior colleges (Gr. 13-14) which train tech-
nicians, enrolled 41,000 students 1/ in 1973, i.e., the majority of students
(71%) at junior college level. The output is expected to increase from
6,300 in 1973 to some 20,000 after completion of the changeover in about 1977
from five to two-year programs. However, the expanded output still appears
to be insufficient when compared with the MiOST manpower requirements projections
up to 1981.

29.       The Government's present policies on higher education are:  (a) con-
trolling expansion, (b) designating selected universities for specializa-
tion, (c) improving college-industry relationships and (d) spacing work
experience with academic training (e.g., sandwich courses) wherever feasible.
The 1inistry of Education is responsible for the implementation of these
policies. For the immediate future large-scale capital investment is
therefore considered inappropriate. Improvements may be necessary in tne
priority fields of health and management education, but investment needs to
await the results of ongoing pre-investment studies.
Non-Formal Training
30.       The 61 trade schools (Gr. 7-9), 53 higher trade schools (Gr. 10-12)
and 74 miscellaneous schools (no grade specification) operated by MOE offer
a variety of courses including abacus, baking, barber, cosmetics, confectionery,
tourism, etc. Total enrollment in all three categories is about 30,000. In
1973 about 4,600 students completed courses in "trade schools" and "higner
trade schools" and 7,000 in "vocational schools for young men". The radio
and correspondence junior colleges enroll about 24,000 students. About
174,000 are attending private institution training courses, of which over 50%
are art, clerical and physical exercise courses.
31.       The Office of Labor Affairs (OLA) in the Miaistrx of H-ealtlh ar. :ocia
Affai,-s has the main responsibility for non-formal vocational training. OLA
operates a well-equipped and well-staffed Central Vocational Training Institute
(CVTI) at Incheon under a UNDP/ILO project with 430 students attending the



APPENDIX II
Page 9
two-year regular course for instructors and an output of about 210 per annum.
Tle training standard in skills is high and graduates are qualified to be--
come shop instructors. The total enrollment at CVTI is about 8,000, including
6,800 students in correspondence courses for those wiho wish to take the tiheory
section in trade tests. OLA also runs another well-equipped and well-staffed
Vocational Training Institute (VTI) in Busan with German aid. About 210
are attending the regular one-year skilled worker courses and 350 tile three-
month retraining courses. The training standard in skill is also higih.
Courses conducted by CVTI and the Busan VTI are much in demand as evidenced
by tne application/admission ratio of four to one wthich makes it necessary
to use aptitude tests as an additional selection criterion.  There is clc?se
cooperation between the VTIs and industry.  The Asian Development Bank ex-
tended a loan of US$3.7 million in 1973 for the construction and equipment
of five VTIs with a total capacity of 5,160. The first two are due to be
completed in 1974 and start courses in September, 1974.
32.       The present government policy is to emphasize non-formal training
outside the IiOE, especially at the skilled workers level.  About 0.8 million
of tihe 1.7 million skilled workers needed between 1973 and 1981 are planned
to be trained through OLA from new VTIs and in-plant training centers.
For tihis purpose, 62 public VTIs (38 urban and 24 rural) and 818 in-plant
centers are being planned. The feasibility of the plan depends on avail-
bility of funds and instructors. Within this framework, ten additional
public VTIs are planned to be established with external aid before 1980
with a total capacity of about 6,000 and an output of about 9,000 per
annum.  The seven proposed VTIs in the project would forn a part of these
ten. They will be located close to new industrial complexes and will
include boarding places for rural trainees in agreement withi the 50%
enrolment quota for their group.
33.       The vocational training law passed in January 1967 was amended in
larch 1973 together with a Special Lawq for Vocational Training to oblige
firms with more than 200 workers to give training to at least 15% of t'heir
total number of employees. This legislation, whicih will become effective
on January 1, 1975, marks a shift towards a greater involvement of private
enterprises in vocational training activities.  It will introduce a much
greater degree of flexibility into tile process of industrial skill acquisi-
tion, both in terms of the volume of training operations and the orientation
of training programs.
Education Finance
34.       Financial responsibility for education is shared by the Central
Government, the provincial and local (city, county) authorities and tne
private sector. Educational institutiones are classified according to the
mode of their financing:



APPENDIX II
Page 10
(i) national institutions are financed entirely by the Central
Government;
(ii) public institutions are financed by the lower levels of
Government with more than 75% of the costs being met by
Central Government transfers; and
(iii) private institutions are financed mainly from non-governmental
sources with minor government subsidies.
35.       Over the last nine years, education expenditure at constant prices
by the MOE have increased at an annual rate of about 11% compared to a
growth of the Central Government budget of about 10% p.a. The 1973 budget
of the MOE stood at Won 126 billion of which 118 billion were for educational
expenditure. Together with the financial contributions of the lower levels
of government (Won 25 billion) and of the private sector (estimated at Won
57 bill-ion), total education expenditure was just over Won 200 billion, or
4.1% of GNP.
36.       The composition of the recurrent expenditure by level of education
is as follows: primary education 65%; lower secondary 17%; upper secondary
20%; and post-secondary 8%. The relatively high share of primary education
expenditure is explained by the virtually universal enrollment attained.
37.       Since in the coming years somewhat smaller cohorts will enter
primary education, one can expect a gradual shift in the percentage
distribution of recurrent expenditure towards the post-primary levels,
particularly lower and upper secondary education, brought about by enroll-
ment increases and quality improvements.
38.       Capital expenditures over the last six years have averaged 20%
of total expenditures, ranging from 8% for colleges and universities to
almost 23% for primary education. The latter high figure is due to the
investments required to achieve universal primary enrollment. Future
allocations should be expected to show a reduced percentage for primary,
and increased shares for post-primary levels.
