PANAMA
SECOND PANAMA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The Government of Panama has requested Bank financial assistance
for the expansion and improvement of sewerage and water supply services in
Panama.   The proposed project would be the Bank's second operation in the
sector and a continuation of the first Bank-financed project (Loan 1280-
PAN), which was essentially completed in August  1982.   It would improve
health and living conditions by rehabilitating and extending water supply
and sewerage systems in Panama City, Santiago, La Chorrera, Arraijan Dis-
trict and Colon.  In Colon, a part of the storm drainage system would be
repaired and replaced.   The total cost of the proposed project, including
capitalized front-end fee but excluding interest during construction, is
estimated at US$39.6 million equivalent. A Bank Loan of US$21.6 million is
recommended to finance the foreign exchange component of the project and
the front-end fee on the Bank Loan.
II. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
Climate and Water Resources
2.01        Located between latitudes 70 and 90 North, the country has a
tropical climate with average annual rainfall of around 1,800 mm in Panama
City and 3,000 mm in Colon.   Rainfall is concentrated during the April-
December period in most of Panama.   Because of the seasonal pattern of
rainfall, pronounced variations in streamflow limit the firm yield that can
be drawn from natural water courses.    The two largest bodies of fresh wa-
ter are Lake Gatun and Lake Madden. Both were constructed to provide water
for the operation of the Panama Canal, but also serve as water sources for
nearby Panama City and Colon. In recent decades, watershed destruction has
led to increased sedimentation and has affected adversely natural stream
flow patterns.   Efforts are underway to initiate a watershed protection
program to decrease the sedimentation rate of Lake Gatun, whose storage
volume is vital to the canal's operation.
2.02       Exploration of groundwater sources has been limited in the past,
because of the abundant supply of surface water. Groundwater is currently
used mainly to supply small urban communities and rural areas, while large
communities  depend  on  surface  water  sources.    With  the  prospect  of
increased surface water shortages, efforts to explore and exploit ground-
water sources are being intensified.  In the recent past, several attempts
to locate aquifers suitable for large-scale exploitation have not been suc-
cessful (Arraijan-Vista Alegre Area and Tocumen).

Population and Income
2.03       Based on preliminary results of the 1980 census, Panama's total
population in mid-1980 was about 1.83 million.  About half the population
is considered urban.1/ In mid-1980, there were 46 urban communities with
total population of about 900,000.  The rural population lives in some 300
communities of between 500 and 1,500 inhabitants and some 1,000 villages
with populations of less than 500. The Panama City Metropolitan Area alone
had about 660,000 inhabitants, or 36% of the country's total and 73% of the
urban population.
2.04      Panama's total population increased by 3.1% per year between 1960
and 1970, and by 2.5% per year between 1970 and 1980.  Growth rates were
higher in urban areas (2.8%) than in rural areas (2.2%) because of migra-
tion of people seeking employment opportunities.   The Panama City Metro-
politan Area, with an average annual growth rate of 3.7% between 1970-80,
was one of the main targets of this migration.  Population growth in most
urban regional centers was also high (Santiago 4.1%; David, 3.7%; and
Chitre, 3.3%).  The population of the economically depressed Colon Metro-
politan Area grew at only 0.4% per year.
2.05      In the future, the trend to slower population growth rates is ex-
pected to continue.   Table 2.1 presents mid-year populations recorded for
1970 and 1980 and projections for 1990 and 2000.

a/ Population in millions; average annual growth rate.
The Government intends to divert some of the migration from Panama City by
declaring medium-size regional centers (Santiago, David, and La Chorrera)
poles of development and providing them with increased infrastructure in-
vestments. Population growth rates in these centers, therefore, are pro-
jected to be substantially higher than the urban rates presented in Table
2.1.
2.06       Average annual per capita income in Panama was US$1,730 in 1980.
The median monthly salary at that time was about US$350 for both public and
private  sector  employees.    In mid-1982,  the monthly  minimum wage was
US$185/month.  There are significant differences among income levels in the
Metropolitan Region, regional centers and rural areas.  The per capita in-
come in regional centers is about 70-90% of that found in Panama City and
I/ Communities with more than 1,500 inhabitants.



in rural areas it is even lower. The absolute poverty income level in 1982
is estimated at around US$550 per capita/year in the Panama City Metropoli-
tan Area, US$450 per capita/year in regional urban centers, and US$250 per
capita/year in rural areas.  About 25% of the urban and 30% of the rural
population fall into the absolute poor category. Most of the absolute poor
live in Panama City (20% of total population) and Colon (30% of total popu-
lation) where they inhabit congested, decaying tenements and squatter set-
tlements.  In the regional centers, the portion of absolute poor is esti-
mated to be around 25%.
Public Health
2.07       The Government has made strong efforts to improve the provision
for basic services to all its citizens. Under the motto health for all by
the year 2000," it has spent in recent years about 5% of gross domestic
product on health and related services, among them water supply and sanita-
tion. As a result, basic public health indicators for 1979 2/ were gener-
ally better than those found in most middle income developing countries.
Most pronounced is the decrease in the death rate per 100,000 inhabitants
attributed to enteritis and diarrheic diseases from 38.8 in 1971 to 7.7 in
1979, a 500% drop. The generally bright outlook in public health is taint-
ed somewhat by the apparent increase in the incidence of diarrheic diseases
in recent years (36,000 cases reported in 1976 vs. 50,400 in 1980).  There
are marked differences in the public health situation among various regions
and public health standards are better in urban than in rural areas.  Re-
gional centers   closer to Panama City   appear to be somewhat better off
than those farther away, except for Colon where poor public health condi-
tions reflect the town's low socio-economic level.   Although many factors
determine the status of a population's health, the Government's efforts to
increase water supply and sanitation service levels have contributed sig-
nificantly to the recent improvement.
Institutional Framework
2.08        In Panama, sector responsibilities are shared primarily by the
Ministry of Health (MH) and IDAAN.   The Ministry of Planning and Economic
Policy (MIPPE), responsible for inter-sectoral planning, reviews and ap-
proves the investment programs of both IDAAN and MR.  MR is formally re-
sponsible for the orientation and determination of public health policies.
Its operational arm, the Department of Environmental Health, is responsible
for carrying out water supply and public health programs in rural communi-
ties with 500 or less inhabitants (about 33% of Panama's total popula-
tion). The Department plans and constructs rural systems which, after com-
pletion, are maintained and operated by local committees. IDAAN is respon-
sible for the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of
water supply and sanitation systems in all communities with more than 500
inhabitants (about 67% of Panama's total population). The Ministry of Pub-
lic Works (MOP) is responsible for the planning, construction, operation
and maintenance of all urban storm drainage facilities. Several other Gov-
ernment organizations are active in sector development.   The Ministry of
Housing (MIVI), as developer of low-cost housing schemes, depends on water
and  sewerage  infrastructures  provided  by  IDAAN.         Another  important

provided by IDAAN. Another important institution is the Panama Canal Com-
mission (PCC), which sells water in bulk to IDAAN from its Miraflores and
Mount Hope Water Treatment Plants to supply water to Panama City and Colon.
Present Service Level and Quality
2.09      Water supply and sanitation  service levels in  anama are high in
comparison with those in South American countries. During the last decade,
much progress has been made in improving service levels (Table 2.2).  Ac-
cording to 1980 census figures, 84.6% of Panama's total population has ac-
cess to public water supply systems, either through private house connec-
tions (more than 60%), public standpipes (about 13%) or protected wells
(11%).  In urban areas almost all people are served by public systems and
about 95% receive water through house connections. In rural areas, a serv-
ice level of 69.8% is reported. People in rural areas are served in almost
equal parts by house connections (27%), standpipes (20%) and protected
wells (22%).  Most of the population without access to safe water supply
lives in small, isolated rural communities where dwellings are dispersed,
making the provision for public water services expensive.

2.10       The quality of water supply services provided by IDAAN is gene-
rally good. In urban systems, water service is available around the clock
for the great majority of consumers.   In some areas, particularly at the
urban fringe, insufficient transmission capacity results in low pressures
during peak hours or, in the extreme,  intermittent service.  The quality
and quantity of water service in rural communities is generally less reli-
able, depending to a large degree on the community's commitment to and or-
ganization in maintaining and operating its water system.
2.11      About 97% of the urban population has access to sanitation faci-
lities. Almost 70% of the people are connected to public sewer systems, 7%
have individual septic tanks, and 22% use latrines.   As the few existing



treatment facilities are generally underdesigned and poorly maintained,
they are in most cases ineffective.   Consequently,  receiving waters near
densely populated areas are heavily polluted.  Water quality in the Bay of
Panama, for example, has deteriorated to the extent that fishing is prohi-
bited within five miles of the coast. Pollution of water courses is a ser-
ious problem in almost all of Panama's urban centers and poses a health
hazard in most areas. The statistics on rural sanitation (80% of the popu-
lation has access to sanitary excreta disposal facilities) may overstate
actual service levels. Although no exact figures are available, it appears
that a large portion of latrines and septic tanks are in poor repair and do
not give the protection which these systems can provide.  In summary, Pan-
ama's population enjoys generally adequate water supply services, but there
is need for improvement and rehabilitation of urban and rural sanitation
facilities and for reduction of environmental pollution.
Past Sector Investments
2.12       Sector investment since 1971, excluding contributions from deve-
lopers, amounted to a total of about US$155 million in 1981 prices.  More
than 90% of this investment was made by IDAAN. Annual average sector in-
vestments made by IDAAN during the 1970s were about US$14 million in 1981
prices.   External  financing has supported all major investment programs.
Major lenders have been the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID) with 37% of total investment since 1961, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) with 11%, and most recently the Bank with 7% (Loan
1280-PAN). Internal funds, either from the Government through general bud-
getary allocations or from IDAAN itself accounted for 45% of total sector
investment.  Of the past sector investments, 68% were devoted to expanding
urban water supply coverage, 22% to urban sewerage and about 10% was in-
vested in rural areas for water supply and sanitation.
Sector Objectives
2.13      With the targets of the International Water and Sanitation Decade
in mind, IDAAN and MH have formulated the following sector goals for 1990:
A.  Urban Water Supply - Maintaining existing systems in good repair
and expanding services to the incremental future urban population
(about 40,000 additional people per year);
B.  Urban Sanitation  - Expanding  sewerage  to reach a 90% service
level in Panama's 15 largest urban centers and providing at least
primary sewage treatment (oxidation ponds) in those urban cen-
ters, where environmental pollution is most serious.  In view of
the enormous investments required, IDAAN has postponed plansfor
providing sewage treatment in Panama City until other priority
goals have been met;
C.  Rural Water Supply - Providing adequate and safe water supply
services through public systems to 85% of the rural population;
and



-6-
D. Rural Sanitation - Providing safe excreta disposal facilities by
individual means of disposal (septic tanks, latrines) to 90% of
the rural population.
Limitations and Constraints
2.14       It is estimated that investments on the order of US$300 million
(1981 prices) would be required during the remainder of this decade to meet
all sector goals.   About US$220 million would have to be spent for water
supply and sewerage in urban areas.  IDAAN's  1983-88 investment program
projects total investments of about US$110 million in 1981 prices.  During
the same time, MH's investment program is estimated to be about US$16 mil-
lion (1981 prices), bringing total projected sector investments through the
end of 1988 to a total of about USS126 million in 1981 Drices. Considering
that the projected annual investments required to meet sector targets are
more than twice as high as those made in the past, it is unlikely that all
targets will be fully met.  Insufficient financing and absorptive capacity
of both IDAAN and MH would be the two major bottlenecks. It appears, how-
ever, that the objectives for urban and rural water supply could be met,
but that the targets for rural and urban sanitation in all likelihood will
not be reached.
Experience with Previous Loar
2.15       Loan 1280-PAN (US$12.0 million) was approved by the Bank's Board
in June 1976 and became effective in July 1976.  The works financed under
the Loan were completed during August 1982, and all -funds should be dis-
bursed by October 1982. Project completion was delayed by about two years
in comparison with the appraisal estimate9 mainly because of difficulties
in preparing designs and bidding documents on time.  Once the initial de-
lays were overcome, project execution and disbursements followed at essen-
tially the pace projected at appraisal. IDAATN's record of compliance with
the covenants stipulated under Loan 1280-PAN has been generally satis-
factory with the exception of the revenue covenant in 1980-81 (para.
6.01).   The tariff increase of April 1, 1982 would allow IDAAN to comply
with the revenue covenant in 1982.
2.16       IDAAN's performance in rmeeting the operational targets projected
at appraisal has been mixed.    The total number of water house connections
in 1982 was 30% higher than projected at appraisal.   The percentage of
water connections metered at the end of 1981 was somewhat lower. With the
recent purchase of 12,000 water meters from the proceeds of Loan 1280-PAN
and the proposed purchase of another 45,000 meters (20,000 under the pro-'
posed Bank loan and 20,000 under the fourth IDB Project), IDAAN expects to
increase the portion of metered connections to a satisfactory 70% by 1985.
The percentage of unaccounted-for water is estimated at about 36% for all.
of IDAAN's systems compared to the appraisal target of 28% for 1981.  The
metering and water system rehabilitation programs to be undertaken under
the proposed project are expected to reduce unaccounted-for water to an ac-
ceptable 25% by the end of 1986.  In summary, the objectives of the first
project have been largely achieved.   The proposed project would assist
IDAAN in its efforts to further improve its financial and operating
performances.

III. PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
General
3.01       The Borrower of the proposed Loan and the executing agency for
the water and sewerage components of the project (about 90% of total pro-
ject cost) would be IDAAN.  The storm drainage component in Colon would be
executed by MOP under an onlending agreement with IDAAN.   The following
paragraphs highlight the institutional capabilities of IDAAN and MOP.   A
more detailed assessment of IDAAN is presented in Annex 1.
IDAAN
3.02      IDAAN is an autonomous tax exempt public entity headed by an Ex-
ecutive Director.  An eight-member Board of Directors, chaired by the Min-
ister of Health, provides policy guidelines and makes major operational de-
cisions.   Any actions on tariffs and charges  require Cabinet approval.
IDAAN's budget is subject to approval by the National Controller's Office.
With a total of 2,300 employees, IDAAN's employees/1000 water connections
ratio is 15 which is high compared to comparable institutions in the Re-
gion. Agreement was reached during negotiations that IDAAN would gradually
improve this ratio to 9 employees/1000 connections by the end of 1988.
3.03       IDAAN's management systems are largely acceptable, but more im-
provements in accounting, budgeting, planning, information and especially
in internal auditing practices and procedures are necessary.  During the
proposed project technical assistance would be financed to reduce deficien-
cies in these areas.   The external audit of IDAAN's financial statements
and revaluation of fixed assets would be continued during the proposed pro-
ject.   Assurances  regarding  the latter  two items were obtained  during
negotiations.
3.04      Although much improved during the last 2-3 years, IDAAN's collec-
tions record needs to be improved further. In 1981, gross accounts receiv-
able were equivalent to 5 months of billings for water charge and one year
of billings for valorization charges.  Assurances were obtained during ne-
gotiations that IDAAN would reduce accounts receivable to the equivalent of
three months by the end of 1983 for water and by the end of 1985 for valor-
ization charges.
3.05       IDAAN employs 20 engineers who carry out design work and super-
vise construction. Although most of the engineers have only limited exper-
ience, they perform satisfactorily on routine engineering tasks under the
guidance of more experienced colleagues. Engineering consultants are hired
for more sophisticated work.  With few exceptions, operation and mainten-
ance practices are poor and require substantial improvement. Technical as-
sistance and the acquisition of equipment would be financed under the pro-
posed Loan to strengthen IDAANts capabilities in this area.



MOP
3.06      MOP is responsible for the construction and maintenance of high-
ways, urban streets, urban storm drainage systems, and the maintenance of
national government buildings.  MOP is executing two highway projects fi-
nanced by the Bank (Loans 1565-PAN and 2020-PAN, with a combined Loan
amount of US$31 million), and in recent years has acquired experience in
the execution and administration of large projects under Bank policies.
MOP has evolved through the merger of a number of different agencies.   An
improved organizational structure is being implemented (Annex 2). The main
features of the new organization are: the creation of three in-line re-
gional offices (Western, Metropolitan, and Central) to coordinate the work
of the 11 provincial offices, and the establishment of eight specialized
National Directorates. The National Directorate of Storm Drainage would be
responsible for preparing and executing the proposed storm drainage compo-
nent in Colon.
3.07      MOP had some 9,500 employees in 1981, including about 100 profes-
sionals and about 1,550 technical support staff.   In early 1982, 138 em-
ployees, including 4 engineers, 22 technicians, 19 support staff and 93 la-
borers, worked in the National Storm Drainage Directorate. The four engin-
eers assigned to the unit appear to be experienced and capable, and would
be able to direct the preparation of designs and execution of the Colon
storm drainage project with the assistance of qualified consultants.
IV. POPULATION, SERVICE AND DEMAND
4.01        The following paragraphs summarize present and future popula-
tions, service levels for water supply and sewerage, and demands for all
of IDAAN's systems.   Condensed projections of population,  service levels
and demand and details for each of the project areas covered under the pro-
posed project (Santiago, La Chorrera, Colon, District of Arraijan and Pan-
ama City) are presented in Annex 3.
4.02       In mid-1982 IDAAN served a total of about 156,000 water connec-
tions.  About 149,000 (95%) of these were residential connections serving
about 1.16 million people (about 60% of the country's total and about 83%
of IDAAN's target population).  The remaining connections provided water to
industrial and commercial enterprises and to Government institutions.
About half the connections are concentrated in the Panama City Metropolitan
Area.   The other half serve some 42 regional urban centers and about 180
communities with populations of 500-1,500.
4.03       Residential water consumption is high, averaging currently about
56 gcd. It is highest in Panama City (65 gcd) and lowest in small communi-
ties where it may reach only 30 gcd.  Total commercial, industrial and of-
ficial  consumption  is  around  30%  of  residential  consumption.    Unac-
counted-for water is high at about 36% for all of IDAAN's systems com-
bined. The total water production capacity at IDAAN's disposal in mid-1982
was about 152 mgd, close to the estimated demand of about 144 mgd.



- 9 -
4.04        IDAAN will have to expand its systems considerably in order to
fulfill its objective of providing adequate service to 95% of the popula-
tion of all communities of 500 or more.   Between 1982 and 1990, IDAAN must
provide production and transmission capacity sufficient to meet the needs
of an additional 400,000 people.   Assuming that the recently introduced
progressive tariff and improved meter coverage (70% by 1985) in the future
will prevent further increases in per capita water consumption and that the
level of unaccounted-for water will be reduced to 25% by 1986, IDAAN would
have to increase its average daily water production capacity by about 14%
between now and 1990.   In addition to providing more production,  trans-
mission and distribution capacity, IDAAN will have to carry out consider-
able rehabilitation work (Panama City and Colon) and improve its operation
and maintenance practices.
4.05      IDAAN's statistics on sewer connections are unreliable.  The sur-
vey of sewer connections being carried out by IDAAN is expected to provide
a reliable inventory of connections by mid-1983.   It is estimated that in
mid-1982 IDAAN operated around 95,000 sewer connections serving about
660,000 people.   Close to 80% of all sewer connections are in the Panama
City Metropolitan Area.   The remaining connections are located in 13 re-
gional centers. To meet the 1990 targets for urban sewerage service levels
(90% of people to be connected in the 15 largest urban centers), IDAAN
would have to serve an additional 400,000 people through about 50,000 new
connections.  As many of the existing sewer systems are old and deterio-
rating, IDAAN must also make a significant effort to repair and rehabili-
tate existing systems.
4.06        The proposed project would contribute significantly to IDAAN's
goals for 1990.  Water transmission capacity would be increased in Panama
City (Juan Diaz, Pedregal, Tocumen) and the Arraijan District.  With com-
plementary investments in storage and distribution, these two project com-
ponents would serve an additional 190,000 people by 1990, including about
100,000 who now have access to water, but suffer from rationing. The sew-
erage components in Panama City, La Chorrera and Santiago would provide
services  to an additional  45,000 people by 1990.   The proposed project
would support IDAAN's efforts for system rehablitation and strengthen its
operation and maintenance capabilities.  The rehabilitation works in Colon
in sewerage and storm drainage are of particular importance as they are es-
sential to the urban renewal project on the Isla de Manzanillo, which is
partly financed under Loan 1878-PAN.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The proposed project would be a follow-up of the first Bank sup-
ported water supply and sewerage project (Loan 1280-PAN).   Preparation of
the project has been under way for the last four years with the assistance
of consultants and Bank staff.



- 10 -
Objectives
5.02       The major objectives of the project would be to improve health
and living conditions in several urban centers in Panama through the im-
provement and expansion of water supply, sewerage and storm drainage ser-
vices. About 41% of the estimated 260,000 direct beneficiaries (Table 7.2)
of the proposed project would belong to the lowest income population in the
project areas.  The gains achieved under the proposed project would be re-
inforced through technical assistance and training to both ID4AN and MOP.
Specific objectives are:
Sewerage: to expand sewer coverage in Panama, Santiago, La
Chorrera and Colon to allow about 65,000 additional people to
connect by 1990; and reduce environmental pollution in the first
three cities;
Water Supply: to eliminate water shortages in Panama City and im-
prove service quality to benefit some 170,000 people by 1990; re-
habilitate parts of the water supply systems in Panama City and
Colon; and provide a water supply infrastructure (pumping, trans-
mission) for the Arraijan District and the Vacamonte Fishing Port
benefitting a total of about 22,000 people by 1990;
Storm Drainage: to improve storm drainage facilities in Colon
benefitting some 5,000 mostly low-income people;
Technical Assistance and Training:   to improve maintenance and
operating practices of IDAAN and MOP and further strengthen
IDAAN's financial, commercial and administrative functions.
5.03        The Government has given high priority to all project compo-
nents,   The sewerage works would improve sanitation standards in some of
the poorest districts of Panama City.  The components in La Chorrera, San-
tiago, and the Arraijan District are viewed as important measures towards
making these regional centers more attractive to migrants from rural areas,
thereby reducing the migration pressure on Panama City.  The project com-
ponents in Colon are essential to the success of the Government's efforts
to revive this economically depressed city and support the urban renewal
project financed under Loan 1878-PAN. The project's objectives are consis-
tent with the Bank's sector and country policy.
Project Description
5.04      The scope of the project is summarized below:
A. Expansion and Improvement of Sewerage Services (IDAAN)
(a)  In Panama City:   construction of sewer networks  in seven
neighborhoods (about 32 km total length); six sewage col-
lectors (about 15 km total pipe length); and rehabilitation
of the sewage pumping station at Ave. Brazil.



- 11 -
(b)  In Santiago:  construction of about 40 km of sewer laterals
and collectors; 2 sewage pumping stations; and 2 oxidation
ponds.
(c)  In La Chorrera:  construction of about 60 km of sewer later-
als and collectors.
(d)  In Colon:   rehabilitation of four sewage pumping stations
and replacement of about 6 km of sewer pipe.
(e) Provision for credit to finance in-house sanitary
installations for low-income people in the project areas.
B. Expansion and Improvement of Water Supply Services (IDAAN)
(a) In Panama City: construction of a 5 km transmission main be-
tween Los Andes No. 2 and La Pulida and implementation of a
rehabilitation and operations improvement program, including
installation of pressure regulators, rehabilitation of
storage tanks, replacement or repair of about 600 valves,
leak-detection, and the improvement of about 20 pumping
stations.
(b)  In Arraijan District:   construction of a 8.6 mgd treated-
water pumping station at the Miraflores Water Treatment
plant and water transmission mains between the Miraflores
Pumping Station and Cocoli (including crossing of the Panama
Canal) and Arraijan and Vista Alegre (about 9 km total
length).
(c) In Colon: implementation of a rehabilitation and operations
improvement program, including the replacement or repair of
about 200 valves and about 100 hydrants.
C. Metering Program (IDAAN)
Purchase and installation of 20,000 house water meters in Colon
and Panama City; 60 source water meters throughout the country;
and equipment for meter repair shop.
D. Purchase of Equipment (IDAAN)
Purchase   of   sewer   maintenance   and   radio   communication
equipment and vehicles.
E. Technical Assistance and Training (IDAAN)
Provision for assistance and training concentrating on mainten-
ance and operation; system rehabilitation; tariff structure re-
view; metering; and commercial and administrative systems and
procedures.



- 12
F.  Consultants' Services (IDAAN)
Provision of services for the supervision of construction and the
preparation of a sewerage master plan for Colon.
G.  Colon Storm Drainage Component (MOP)
Rehabilitation of two pumping stations; repair or replacement of
storm drains; purchase of maintenance equipment; consultants'
services for the preparation of final designs and supervision of
construction; provision of technical assistance for the organi-
zation of a storm drainage system operation unit in Colon and
training of engineers and operators in maintenance techniques.
Status of Project Preparation
5.05      Feasibility studies for the major project components, prepared by
IDAAN and its consultants, were reviewed during appraisal and are available
in the project file.   Final designs, including bidding documents, repre-
senting about 50% of total project costs requiring such designs are com-
plete (Annex 4).  Consultants are preparing final designs for the Mira-
flores pumping station, the Canal crossing, and the sewerage works in San-
tiago. Consultants for the final designs of sewerage works in La Chorrera
are being selected.   IDAAN is financing these consulting  services with
loans from Panama's Preinvestment Fund.   IDAAN's engineers are working on
the final designs for the Los Andes No. 2-La Pulida transmission main.
Bidding documents for the purchase of meters, valves and pressure regula-
tors are almost complete.  It is expected that 70-80% of all designs  will
be ready by the time the proposed loan is submitted for approval to the
Bank's Board.  The final scope of the storm drainage component in Colon is
still being prepared by MOP (para. 5.15).
Least-Cost Solution
5.06       All project components correspond to the least-cost solution to
reach project objectives and are technically feasible.  For the sanitation
components, a comparison between individual solutions and traditional wa-
terborne sewerage taking into account technical, economical and social con-
siderations showed that sewerage is the appropriate solution. Water supply
and sewerage projects are being designed in conformity with satisfactory
engineering standards and at reasonable per capita consumption levels.
Cost Estimates
5.07       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$28 million, in
June 1982 prices, and at US$39.3 million, including physical and price con-
tingencies (Table 5.1).  The project would be exempted from taxes and du-
ties. The IDAAN project accounts for US$36.2 million, or 92% of the total
cost. The total foreign exchange cost is US$21.3 million (54.3% of the to-
tal project cost). Interest during construction is estimated to be US$6.65
million (US$6.35 for IDAAN and US$0.3 million for MOP).  The front-end fee
of US$0.32 million would be included in the proposed Bank Loan of US$21.6
million. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Annex 5.



- 13 -
5.08       The base cost estimates were prepared by IDAMN and MOP, and  re-
viewed by the Bank. Cost estimates for civil works and equipment are based
on recent bids for similar works in Panama.  The cost estimate for the re-
habilitation of storm drainage pipes in Colon assumes that about 50% of the
pipes in the project area need to be replaced and that the remaining pipes
require only repairs.  The average allowance for physical contingencies is
12% and varies from 5% to 15% of a component's base cost, depending on the
status of design and the nature of the component. Price contingencies are
based on a 5.5 year construction schedule (Annex 6). International infla-
tion rates of 8% in 1982 and 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985, and 6% there-
after were applied to both the foreign and local exchange components. This
assumption is justified since, historically, domestic inflation rates have
been close to international inflation rates.
5.09        Costs for consultants' and engineering services, excluding con-
tributions from IDAAN's and MOP's own personnel are estimated at US$1.85
million (US$1.53 million for the IDAAN portion and US$0.32 million for the
MOP portion of the project) for a total of 275 man-months (107 man-months
for expatriate and 62 man-months for local technical staff, and 106 man-
months for local support staff).   The average man-month costs, including
salaries, overhead, travel and subsistence are estimated as follows:
US$11,000 for expatriate technical staff, US$4,000 for local technical
staff and US$2,000 for local support staff.  Annex 7 presents details on
consultants' costs and manpower estimates. The supervision of construction
which would be carried out by IDAAN's Department of Supervision of Works
(para. 5.13) is estimated to cost about US$1.3 million equivalent to 9.3%
of the construction costs of the works to be supervised.

Project Financing
5.10      Total financing required for the project, including interest dur-
ing construction and the front-end fee on the proposed Bank Loan, would be
US$46.3 million, US$42.8 million (92.6%) for the IDAAN portion and US$3.4
million for the MOP portion. The proposed Loan would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component of the proposed project, including the capita-
lized front-end fee.   The total Loan amount would be US$21.6 million, of
which US$20.0 million would be allocated to the IDAAN component and US$1.6
million to the MOP component.   For the IDAAN portion, the difference be-
tween total financing required and the financing provided by the Bank would
be financed from IDAAN's internal cash generation (US$14.1 million), cover-
ing 33% of the investment and interest during construction, and from the
Central Government in the form of an equity contribution of US$8.7 mil-
lion.   For the MOP portion of the project,  the Central Government would
provide US$1.8 million from its budget to meet the difference between the
Bank Loan and the total financing required.   A breakdown of project costs
and financing is presented in Table 5.2.

Project Implementation - IDAAN
5.11      IDAAN's portion of the project would be executed between January
1983 and June 1988 in accordance with the bidding and construction sched-
ules shown in Annexes 4 and 6. As project preparation is well advanced and
bidding for several major works would begin soon after negotiations, an ex-
ecution period of 5-1/2 years is judged to be reasonable, considering that
IDAAN executed the first project (Loan 1280-PAN) in six years and its im-
plementation capacity has improved.  As under the first Bank-financed pro-
ject, IDAAN would designate a capable project manager who would be directly
responsible to the General Manager.  Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that IDAAN would continue to employ a qualified project manager
for the duration of the project.
5.12      Urban development in some areas of the Rio Caimito sewer district
of La Chorrera must proceed as forecasted to justify the provision of sew-
erage services to most of this area.   The works proposed  in this area
amount to about 30% of the La Chorrera sewerage component.   IDAAN agreed
during negotiations that it will present to the Bank for review the final
scope and justification of this component based on a review of population
density patterns before  undertaking any sewerage works in the Rio Caimito
sewer district of La Chorrera.
5.13      Qualified consultants would provide technical assistance to IDAAN
in maintenance and operation, administrative procedures and the preparation
of a tariff study (para. 7.09) under terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank (Annex 14).  IDAAN would present terms of reference for the Technical
Assistance Program satisfactory to the Bank by no later than January 31,
1983, and would hire the technical assistance consultants by no later than
July 31,  1983.   These consultants would also assist IDAAN in the formu-
lation and organization of a training program for operation and maintenance
personnel which would be presented to the Bank by not later than March 31,
1984.  The sewerage master plan for Colon would be prepared by engineering
consultants who would be assisted by engineers and support staff assigned
by IDAAN.    IDAAN would present terms of reference for the master plan sa-
tisfactory to the Bank by not later than January 31, 1984 and would hire
qualified consultants by July 31, 1984.  IDAAN's Department of Engineering
would supervise the construction of the less complex project components.
Qualified engineering consultants would be engaged for the supervision of
construction of the Miraflores Pumping Station, the canal crossing and the
five sewerage pumping stations.   IDAAN would present to the Bank terms of
reference for the supervision of construction   consultancies by not later
than January 31, 1983.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations from
IDAAN that it would carry out the tasks outlined above.
Project Implementation - MOP
5.14      MOP would carry out the Colon storm drainage component as a sub-
borrower of IDAAN under on-lending arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.
The construction of this project component would be carried out between
mid-1983 and mid-1985.   The on-lending terms would be identical to those
agreed  by  IDAAN  and  the  Bank.    IDAAN's  involvement  with  MOP  would



- 17 -
essentially be limited to the passing on of funds from the Bank.  MOP and
the Bank would communicate directly on such project-related matters as pro-
curement,  supervision,  reporting,  etc.   In view of its experience with
other Bank-financed projects, MOP is expected to carry out these tasks sa-
tisfactorily.   MOP and IDAAN have presented a draft on-lending agreement
satisfactory to the Bank during loan negotiations.   Disbursements for the
MOP component would be contingent on MOP signing the on-lending agreement
with IDAAN.
5.15      During negotiations, the Bank and MOP agreed on the scope of the
storm drain rehabilitation program which was developed by MOP on the basis
of the results of a recently completed survey of storm drains.  The rehab-
ilitation program includes the replacement of around 2 km of damaged pipes
and about 100 street inlets.  MOP would hire consulting engineers to pre-
pare designs for the replacement of storm drains and the rehabilitation of
the two storm drainage pumping stations (Annex 7) under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank. MOP personnel would supervise the storm drain re-
placement component and engineering consultants would supervise the rehab-
ilitation of the pumping stations.  Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that MOP would hire qualified consultants satisfactory to the Bank
for the design of the works and supervision of construction for the pumping
station rehabilitation,   according to the  timetable agreed  upon during
negotiations.
5.16       As part of the Colon storm drainage project, MOP would establish
and equip an adequate storm drainage maintenance and operation unit in
Colon by no later than January 31, 1984. MOP would engage by no later than
June 30, 1983 consultants under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank
to assist in organizing the unit.    MOP would present to the Bank a plan
for the organization and staffing of the unit, its equipment needs and a
training program for the unit's key personnel by no later than November 30,
1983.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that MOP would act in
accordance with the schedule outlined above.
Environmental and Health Aspects
5.17        The sewer projects in Panama City,  Santiago, La Chorrera and
Colon would substantially reduce environmental pollution in the project
areas. In Panama City the reduction of pollution in the project area would
result in an undetectable increase in the pollution load of the Bay of Pan-
ama. In La Chorrera water pollution would increase in the Caimito and Mar-
tin Sanchez Rivers downstream of the discharge points.   Since there are
very few people living in these areas, the incremental river pollution
would not create major problems now.  The provision of sewage treatment in
La Chorrera is planned for the 1990s.   Overall,  the sewerage components
would result in a marked improvement in environmental conditions in popu-
lated areas and are expected to reverse the trend of increased incidence of
waterborne diseases in Panama (para. 2.07).  In the Arraijan District, the
anticipated future population growth and the availability of adequate water
supply services via house connections would eventually require improved ex-
creta and wastewater disposal.



- 18 -
Procurement
5.18      It is estimated that about 45 contracts would be awarded to carry
out the project (Annex 4).  Following IDAAN's and MOP's policy, construc-
tion contracts (about 25 and totalling about US$29 million including con-
tingencies) would combine supply of equipment and materials and installa-
tion. This would simplify project execution and supervision considerably.
Under International Competitive Bidding (ICB), local contractors would pro-
bably win most construction contracts, except those for the pumping station
at the Miraflores Treatment Plant and the canal crossing.   Construction
contracts under US$300,000 and up to an aggregate amount of US$2.3 million
(US$2 million for IDAAN and US$0.3 million for MOP) would be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank,
with foreign bidders having the opportunity to participate. All other con-
struction contracts would be awarded through ICB.
5.19        With the exception of sewerage pipes, all equipment, vehicles
and pipes are likely to be supplied from abroad.  Equipment and vehicles
(pipes would be procured under combined lay and supply contracts) are esti-
mated to cost US$4 million and require about 15 separate biddings.  These
items would be grouped into bid packages and procured under ICB with the
exception of miscellaneous equipment items in lots of less than US$50,000
and up to an aggregate amount of US$0.4 million (US$0.3 million for IDAAN
and US$0.1 million for MOP), which would be procured under local competi-
tive procedures satisfactory to the Bank.   Qualifying domestic manufac-
turers would receive a preference of 15% of the  CIF price or the prevail-
ing import duty, whichever is lower.
5.20          Contracts  for technical  assistance  and  consulting  services
(US$0.3 million for IDAAN and US$0.1 million for MOP) would in all likeli-
hood be awarded to foreign firms or joint ventures between local and for-
eign firms.   These contracts (about 8) are estimated to cost about US$2
million and would be placed following the Bank's guidelines.
5.21        The procurement arrangements outlined above would assure that
contracts accounting for more than 90% of project cost would be awarded,
through ICB. For the IDAAN portion of the project all bidding packages for
construction contracts (including supply and installation), estimated to
cost more than US$500,000 equivalent and bidding packages for goods over
US$100,000 equivalent, would be subject to the Bank's prior review of pro-
curement documents.  The balance of contracts would be subject to ex-post
review. For the MOP portion of the project all procurement documents would
be reviewed by the Bank. This review procedure would result in a coverage
of about 80% of the total estimated value of works and goods contracts.
Disbursement
5.22        The proposed allocation of Loan proceeds and the disbursement
percentages are shown in Annex 8.  Proceeds allocated to the IDAAN portion
of the project would not be transferable to the MOP portion and vice
versa.   Disbursements for the revolving fund established by IDAAN for in--
house sanitary facilities (para. 7.12) would be made under statement of ex-
penditure procedures, documentation for which would be reviewed by



- 19 -
supervision missions. IDAAN would initiate and maintain a separate account
for the fund. IDAAN's accounting and internal control practices are satis-
factory to prepare and maintain records for this purpose.   Disbursements
for all other items would be fully documented. The Loan closing date would
be December 31,  1988.   The disbursement period would thus be six years.
Although significantly shorter than the average disbursement period for
sector projects in the region (about eight years), this disbursement period
is reasonable considering the advanced stage of project preparation and
that Loan 1280-PAN was fully disbursed in six years. A schedule of expect-
ed disbursemet,ts by quarter is presented in Annex 9.
Retroactive Financing
5.23        In view of the urgency of the Colon storm drainage project in
connection with the urban renewal project financed under Loan 1878-PAN, MOP
plans to begin the preparation of final designs before Loan Signature
(para. 5.15).  Retroactive financing of up to US$50,000 for consultants'
services is proposed.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance and Present Financial Position
6.01       Key financial data (Table 6.1) extracted from IDAAN's financial
statements for the 1976-81 period (Annex 10) show that IDAAN's financial
performance deteriorated in the recent past.   Nevertheless,  IDAAN main-
tained a satisfactory cash position which allowed the company to finance a
reasonable part of its investment program, and has initiated corrective ac-
tions to improve its earnings.

- 20 -
IDAAN's net income declined in 1979 and net losses were incurred in 1980-
81, mainly because of its failure to raise tariffs after early 1978. The
revenue covenant under Loan 1280-PAN required that, starting in 1979, funds
from internal sources  3/  amount to at least 3.8% of the average current
net value of IDAAN's fixed assets in service and under construction; IDAAN
was close to compliance in 1979 (3.5%) but its performance deteriorated in
1980-81.  Its net internal cash generation during those years, however, was
satisfactory because of substantial reduction in its working capital re-
sulting from improved collection of overdue receivables, and to some extent
from an increase in short-term liabilities  (legal guarantee witholdings
from contractors).
6.02        During the 1976-81 period, IDAAN's investments (Annex 10) to-
talled to about US$74 million (in current prices).  About 25% of these in-
vestments were financed by IDAAN from two main sources: net internal cash
generation (13.6%) and users contributions  (11.4%).   The remaining funds
came from developers donations (26%), government equity contributions (14%)
and about 35% from loans made by international lending agencies (Bank, IDB,
AID).
6.03      The 30% tariff increase (para. 6.05) implemented in April 1982 is
expected to improve IDAAN's financial position substantially in 1982.  Net
income is forecasted to rise to US$1.4 million, bringing the working ratio
to below 70%.   The net internal cash generation is expected to increase
four times.  The tariff increase is also expected to allow IDAAN to comply
with the revenue covenant under Loan 1280-PAN.
IDAAN's Internal Sources of Funds
6.04      IDAAN's internal sources of funds originate most importantly from
tariffs for water services and contributions from users through valoriza-
tion payments.   Other minor sources of income include penalties for late
payment, connection fees and interest charges on deferred payments of val-
orization charges.
6.05        IDAAN's organizational law requires that tariffs and charges be
set at levels sufficient to cover operating costs, depreciation, debt ser-
vice payments, and to provide for system expansion.   In April 1982 IDAAN
introduced, for the first time, a more progressive tariff structure (Annex
11).   The new  tariff  scheme has  raised  the average  tariff by 30% to
US$0.28/m3.   There is no separate charge for sewerage services.   IDAAN's
current tariff structure needs further improvement (para. 7.09).
6.06       IDAAN has the authority to collect users' contributions (valori-
zation) from property owners who benefit from water supply and sewerage
works.   IDAAN's current policy is to recover costs of constructing water
distribution systems and sewage collection networks by apportioning the to-
tal cost, including financial costs to property owners, either on the
3/ Funds from internal sources are defined as the difference between gross
revenues (operating income + users contributions (valorization) + net
non-operating income) and the sum of all operating expenses (excluding de-
preciation), debt service and any other cash outflows other than capital
expenditures.



- 21 -
basis of lot frontage or property size.  The system of apportionment and
conditions for payment are decided for each project individually, and must
be approved by the Panamanian Cabinet.   Property owners may pay valoriza-
tion charges in installments of up to 20 years.  IDAAN bills its customers
for valorization with the regular water bill.   Up-to-date payment of the
charges is a condition for real estate transactions.
Investment Program and Financing Plan
6.07       During the project execution period (1983-88), IDAAN plans total
investments of US$139 million (Table 6.2, Annex 10).  About  US$43 million
would be invested under the proposed Bank project, and US$42 million under
the fourth IDB project, which has been signed recently.   The remaining
funds (US$54 million) would be used to expand water and sewerage services
throughout Panama. IDAAN's contribution (including valorization) would be
about 56% of the total investment.   The remaining funds would come from
borrowings (31%) and Government equity contributions (13%). The borrowing
requirements would be met by the proposed Bank Loan (US$20 million) and the
IDB loan (US$26 million). The Government's total equity contribution is
estimated at US$18.0 million (US$6 million for the fourth IDB project, US$9
million for the proposed project, and US$3 million for other projects).

Financial Forecast
6.08      Selected data on IDAAN's projected income statements and key fi-
nancial indicators for 1983-88 are shown in Table 6.3.  Financial state-
ments for 1982-90 including assumptions are presented in Annex 10.  IDAAN's
revenues are expected to grow from US$37 million in 1982 to US$63 million
in 1988, an average annual increase of about 9%.  Operating costs are pro-
jected to grow from US$26 million in 1982 to US$40 million in 1988, an av-
erage annual increase of about 7.5%.  As a result,  IDAAN's gross internal
cash generation is forecasted to almost double from US$12 million in 1982
to US$23 million in 1988.
6.09        The projected financial performance depends on IDAAN taking a
number of measures to improve its operations and generation of revenues.
Specific measures already being implemented by IDAAN include increased me-
tering, improvements in estimating consumption of unmetered connections,
the introduction of a progressive tariff structure in April 1982, and the
reduction in accounts receivable.  Measures to be implemented during pro-
ject execution include increasing meter coverage to 70% of all customers by
1985, reducing unaccounted-for water to 25% by 1986, and cost control. The
successful implementation of these measures would allow IDAAN to comply
with the proposed revenue covenant in 1983 and 1984 without additional tar-
iff increases.  The revenue increase projected to become necessary in 1985
would be accomplished through the revision of the tariff structure, which
for the first time, would include a separate sewerage charge.   At this
time, a 20% sewerage surcharge over water bills appears to be sufficient to
raise the additional revenues required. This surcharge has not been esti-
mated on the basis of the real cost associated with providing sewerage ser-
vices, which will be determined by the tariff study to be carried out under
the proposed project (para. 7.09).   No further tariff increases are ex-
pected for 1986.  Thereafter, the average tariff should be raised period-
ically to maintain the 1986 levels in real terms.

6.10      IDAAN's debt to total capitalization ratio would remain under 25%
at all times during project execution, reflecting a good equity position.
The debt service coverage ratio would not be less than 1.5. Any large bor-
rowings in addition to those shown in the financing plan (para. 6.07)
could endanger IDAAN's financial performance.   Assurances were obtained
from IDAAN during negotiations that it will not incur without the Bank's
consent any additional long-term debt that would cause the debt service
coverage ratio to drop below 1.5 during any twelve month period following
such incurrance.
Revenue Covenant
6.11       The proposed revenue covenant (Annex 12) would be an internal
cash ratio requiring that net internal cash generation 4/  plus user con-
tributions (valorization) be at least 3.5% of average net revalued operat-
ing fixed assets. The proposed revenue covenant is consistent with IDAAN's
revenue policies and organizational law, but is slightly different from the
one formulated under Loan 1280-PAN in that works in progress are excluded
from the rate base.  This adjustment has been introduced because revalua-
tion of works in progress is not a generally accepted practice in Panama
and, as experience has shown, has been cumbersome and difficult to mon-
itor. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that IDAAN will annual-
ly review its tariffs and maintain charges at levels sufficient to generate
the covenanted internal cash ratio.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.12      IDAAN would submit to the Bank semi-annual reports (due on Febru-
ary 28 and August 31) on the progress of project implementation and its op-
erating and financial performance during the preceding semester ending on
December 31 and June 30, respectively.   Specific targets for IDAAN as a
whole and for each of the project areas (Panama City, Colon, La Chorrera,
Santiago and the District of Arraijan) would include, inter alia, a com-
parison of projected and actual project construction schedules, dis-
bursements, and selected monitoring indicators.    MOP would submit to the
Bank semi-annual reports according to the schedule outlined above for
IDAAN. These reports would compare progress in the execution of the Colon
storm drainage works with the project implementation schedule.    IDAAN and
MOP would also prepare a project completion report within six months after
the completion of the project according to the guidelines to be provided by
the Bank.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that IDAAN and MOP
would submit semi-annual progress reports and a project completion report
acceptable to the Bank.   Annex 13 presents the monitoring indicators for
TDAAN agreed upon during negotiations.
VII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
7.01        The proposed project has been conceived to meet the short- to
medium-term water supply and sewerage needs of the population in the pro-
ject areas.  It comprises ten major components in three subsectors (water,
4/    Operating  revenues  +  non-operating  revenues  -  operating  costs
(excluding depreciation) - debt service payments - non-financed interest
during construction - increase in working capital - any other cash outflows
other than capital expenditures related to water and sewerage operations.



- 25 -
sewerage, storm drainage) and five separate locations. None of the project
components account for more than 18% of the total base cost.   Some of the
components were designed to rehabilitate existing facilities or to supple-
ment larger investment programs already carried out or planned.   The pro-
ject's objectives are consistent with existing urban upgrading and develop-
ment programs and with the broad objectives of the Panamanian Government
regarding the provision of safe water supplies and adequate sanitation.
The project would help to improve living conditions in extensive areas of
the cities and towns to be served, where lack of safe water and adequate
sanitation constitutes a health hazard. In the various project areas, most
components are interrelated with existing facilities, and interact to pro-
vide services at the lowest possible cost. The project emphasizes rehabil-
itation and maintenance works in areas where aging systems are in need of
repair.
Return on Investments and Project Justification
7.02      Benefits derived from sewerage and drainage systems are not mean-
ingfully quantifiable.   The absence of a cost-based sewerage tariff makes
the calculation of the financial rate of return impossible for the sewerage
components of the project. These components account for about 55%, and the
storm drainage component for about 10% of the total cost.
7.03       There is, however, some quantitative evidence which can be pre-
sented for the sewer network components to judge their economic viability
and to support qualitative analysis.   The construction of sewer networks,
representing about one-third of total project cost, would improve the eco-
nomic value of properties located in the project area, which would be par-
tially reflected in the increase of their market values.   Based on actual
market prices in similar areas with sewerage services, it is estimated that
land values are likely to increase by about 30% in real terms as a conse-
quence of the project investment. A comparison of the present value of the
total benefits, accruing from land appreciation with those of investment
and maintenance and operation costs, indicates that land appreciation ben-
efits would exceed costs in real terms at a discount rate of 12% (the esti-
mated opportunity cost of capital in Panama). Since land appreciation does
not include expected public health benefits, socio-economic benefits taken
together would clearly outweigh the cost of the project investment for sew-
er networks in Panama City, Santiago and La Chorrera.
7.04        Using expected revenues as a proxy for economic benefits, the
combined incremental rate of return (IRR) was calculated for the two major
water supply components:   the transmission main in Panama City and the
works in the District of Arraijan which account for about 20% of total pro-
ject cost.  The estimated IRR is 14.6%.   Since positive externalities and
consumer's surplus are not fully reflected in revenues, this rate under-
estimates the economic rate of return of the two components.   It exceeds
the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12% and establishes the eco-
nomic viability of these two project components.



- 26 -
7.05      No rates of return could be calculated for the various water sup-
ply system rehabilitation and improvement measures in Panama City and Colon
since neither benefits nor incremental revenues can be meaningfully esti-
mated considering the complexity of the rehabilitation measures proposed.
and the data available.  To generate a data base sufficiently detailed toc
permit such an analysis would require an extraordinary effort, which would
not be justified considering the magnitude of these project components in
relation to total project cost.
7.06      Since a rate of return can be estimated meaningfully only for two
water supply components accounting for 20% of total project cost, the cal-'
culation of an aggregate rate of return for the project is not possible.
Long-Run Marginal Cost and Tariffs
7.07      Long-run average incremental cost (AIC), calculated at a 12% dis-
count rate, was used to approximate long-run marginal costs (LMC) for water
supply and sewerage in the project areas. The resulting AICs in June 1982
prices are shown in Table 7.1.
TABLE 7.1: Long-Run Average Incremental Cost (US$/m3) a/
Water Supply             Sewerage            Combined

a/  Tables showing the AIC calculations are contained in the project
file.  US$ and m3 equivalents were used instead of B/. and US gallons to
facilitate understanding.
Because of the lack of a basic water supply infrastructure (Annex 3), the
AIC for water supply in the Arraijan District, is about twice as high as
that calculated for the other three project areas which may be considered
more representative for AIC of water supply and sewerage services in larger
urban areas.
7.08      The substantial difference between IDAAN's current average tariff
level (US$0.28/m3) and the combined average AIC for water supply and sewer-
age (around US$0.50/m3) is more apparent than real.  It is estimated that
IDAAN recovers in real terms about 30% of its investments in water and
close to 60% of those in sewerage through valorization.  Thus, under cur-
rent tariff levels and cost recovery arrangements, IDAAN's customers pay-
ments in real terms come close to the combined AIC for water and sewerage.
The problem with IDAAN's current tariff structure is therefore not its ab-
solute magnitude, but its structure, mainly because of the absence of a
separate sewer charge and insufficient progressivity.



- 27 -
7.09      With the assistance of consultants under the technical assistance
program, IDAAN would review its tariff system with the objective of intro-
ducing a more equitable structure.   This new structure would reflect as
closely as possible the cost to the economy of meeting increasing water
supply and sewerage collection needs, take into account valorization
charges, and investigate the desirability of regional tariff differentia-
tion. Draft terms of reference for the tariff study are presented in Annex
14. A prerequisite for the tariff study is a survey of sewerage connec-
tions in Panama City which would be completed by June 30, 1983. The tariff
study would be presented to the Bank by March 31, 1984 along with recommen-
dations and an implementation  schedule.   Assurances were obtained from
IDAAN during negotiations that it will carry out the sewer connection sur-
vey and the tariff review, and implement the new tariff structure for water
and a separate sewer charge in accordance with a timetable acceptable to
the Bank.
Beneficiaries and Urban Poverty Impact
7.10        The project would benefit a total of about 260,000 people di-
rectly (Table 7.2). In addition, there would be many benefits which cannot
be expressed in terms of numbers of beneficiares. These would include, for
example, supply of water to the Vacamonte Fishing Port and the reduction of
environmental pollution in Panama City through the construction of sewer
collectors.   About 41% of the identifiable direct beneficiaries would be-
long to the urban poor.

Affordability of Services to the Urban Poor
7.11        IDAAN charges low-income consumers a special tariff of US$4.26
for a base consumption of 6,000 US gal/month (22.7 m3/month). At present,
this tariff represents 2.1% of a low-income family's income in Santiago and
1.7% of that in Panama City (para. 2.06).  At these tariff levels, water
and sewerage services are affordable to all segments of the population.



- 28 -
7.12      In the future, the provision for sewerage services will create an
additional financial burden to low-income families who want to connect to
the  sewer  systems  to be  constructed under the proposed  project.   They
would have to pay a valorization charge, the house connection and in-house
sanitary facilities.   As installing even rudimentary plumbing facilities
may cost as much as US$600, many families may have to forego a sewer con-
nection unless credit is provided to them.  For this reason, IDAAN would
establish a US$100,000 revolving fund to finance in-house sanitary instal-
lations for low-income families (Annex 15).  The Bank would finance50% of
the credit to be provided by the fund. IDAAN would present to the Bank for
comments by not later than June 30, 1984 a detailed plan describing the
funding and administration of the fund, including model contracts, eligi-
bility criteria and onlending conditions for the provision of credit.  The
revolving fund would be established by IDAAN by no later than June 30, 1985
with an initial deposit of US$100,000 made by IDAAN.  IDAAN would also car-
ry out in each project area a campaign to motivate people to connect.  As-
surances were obtained during negotiations that IDAAN will comply with the
above requirements.
7.13       Even with the benefit of the credit provided by IDAAN under the
revolving fund, a family's total monthly obligation for water and sewerage
may be as high as US$20/month during the repayment of the credit (5 years
at 12%).   This would amount to about 10% of a family's income of US$200/
month (absolute poverty level in Santiago).   Based on field inquiries in
the project areas, IDAAN feels that low-income potential beneficiaries
would nevertheless be willing to undertake such an investment, as access to
a sewerage connection would constitute a substantial improvement in a fam-
ily's living conditions. To minimize the risk of people not being able to
connect to the systems, IDAAN considers easing the repayment burden for the
neediest families by providing grants or softer credit conditions.   IDAAN
would present details on these matters to the Bank in the proposal for the
establishment of the revolving fund.
Risk
7.14       The proposed project is subject to little risk.  No difficulties
of technical nature are expected during the execution of the project, since
with the exception of the canal crossing and the Miraflores Pumping Station
components, all works are simple and straightforward. To ensure a success-
ful and efficient completion of these two more sophisticated works, IDAAN
will make a special effort to engage highly qualified contractors to carry
out and experienced engineers to supervise the construction of these
works. The likelihood for cost overruns is small, since all cost estimates
are based on detailed bills of quantities and unit costs reflecting recent
bid experience.  Delays in project execution are unlikely, considering the
advanced stage of project preparation and IDAAN's project execution capabi-
lity, as evidenced during the execution of Loan 1280-PAN.
7.15      Because of the recent tariff increase, IDAAN's financial position
through 1984 is expected to remain strong. With the timely implementation
of tariff increases, no problems are expected regarding IDAAN's ability to



- 29 -
generate internally the funds required for completing its investment pro-
gram through 1988.   The risk of low-income households not being able to
connect to the sewer systems to be constructed under the project because of
insufficient funds to pay for in-house sanitary installations and house
connections is minimized by the the provision of credit to eligible house-
holds (para. 7.12).
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained as follows:
From the Government:
(a)   Regarding IDAAN, that it would approve a tariff structure
satisfactory to the Bank which would include separate water
and sewerage charges and would allow IDAAN to generate funds
from operations sufficient to meet a minimum internal cash
ratio of 3.5% (para. 6.11).   Such structure and its time-
table of implementation would be based on the recommendation
of a tariff review to be carried out by IDAAN with the as-
sistance of consultants (para. 7.09).
(b)  regarding MOP that:
(i) qualified consultants acceptable to the Bank would be
hired for the design of storm drains and storm water
pumping stations and the supervision of construction of
the pumping stations (para. 5.15);
(ii) an adequate maintenance and operation unit for Colon's
storm drainage system would be established within MOP
and that consultants acceptable to the Bank would be
engaged to assist MOP in the organization of this unit
and training of its personnel (para. 5.16); and
(iii) semi-annual progress reports and a project completion
report would be submitted to the Bank (para. 6.12).
From IDAAN, that it would:
(a)  revalue its fixed assets annually (para. 3.03);
(b)    have  its  financial  statements  audited  by  independent
auditors (para. 3.03);
(c)  reduce accounts  receivable from water sales and valoriza-
tion (para. 3.04);
(d)  continue to employ a qualified project manager during the
implementation of the project (para. 5.11);



- 30 -
(e)    engage the services of qualified consultants for technical
assistance and training, the preparation of a sewerage
master plan for Colon and the supervision of construction
for the Miraflores Pumping Station, the canal crossing and
sewage pumping stations (para. 5.13);
(f)    present a training program for operation and maintenance
personnel (para. 5.13);
(g)     not incur any long-term debt without the Bank's consent
which would cause the debt service coverage ratio to drop
below 1.5 (para. 6.10);
(h)     maintain tariff levels sufficient to generate funds from
operations  sufficient  to reach a minimum internal  cash
ratio of 3.5% (para. 6.11);
(i)    submit semi-annual progress reports and a project comple-
tion report (para. 6.12);
(j)    carry out a survey of sewer connections,  and review its
tariff structure and implement the recommendations of the
review, including the introduction of a separate sewerage
charge (para. 7.09); and
(k)     establish a revolving fund for the financing of in-house
sanitary installations and house connection for low-income
families (para. 7.12).
8.02      Disbursements for the MOP component of the project are contingent
on MOP signing the on-lending agreement with IDAAN (para. 5.14).
8.03        Retroactive financing for consulting services to MOP of up to
US$50,000 is recommended (para. 5.23).
8.04        With the above assurances and condition, the proposed project.
would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$21.6 million for a period of 15
years, including 3 years of grace.

PANAMA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Institutional Assessment of IDAAN
Organization and Management
1.        IDAAN was created in 1961 as successor to the Comision de Aguas y
Alcantarillados.   It is an autonomous tax exempt public entity and enjoys
wide administrative, but limited financial, autonomy.  Its investment pro-
gram requires the approval of MIPPE. Tariffs and charges to consumers are
proposed by IDAAN, but are subject to approval by the Central Government
Cabinet (Organo Ejecutivo).    -
2.         IDAAN is governed by an eight-member Board of Directors chaired
by the Minister of Public Health.   The Board includes representatives of
the Ministries of Housing, Public Works, and Public Health, the Control-
ler's Office, the Panamanian Association of Property Owners, the Colon
Chamber of Urban Property Owners and the Panamanian Society of Engineers
and Architects.   IDAAN's Executive Director is appointed by the President
for a period of six years.   He has ministerial rank and participates in
Cabinet meetings dealing with issues of interest to IDAAN.
3.        IDAAN's current organizational structure (Attachment 1) was   im-
plemented in February 1981.  Maintenance and operations are the responsi-
bility of 10 regional offices.  This delegation has not been fully imple-
mented, since some regional managers still require considerable supervi-
sion.   The regional managers report directly to the Executive Director.
Four national directorates at IDAAN's headquarters in Panama City provide
support and supervision in technical, operational, engineering, logistical,
administrative,  commercial and financial areas.   These directorates also
report directly to the Executive Director.   The Executive Director is as-
sisted by two advisory units: the Planning Unit, acting as liaison between
IDAAN, other Government agencies and international lending organizations;
and the Legal Unit.
Personnel
4.        IDAAN has a total of about 2,300 employees (Attachment 2), 77% of
them permanent and 23% temporary. The number of employees/1000 connections
is 15, which is very high compared to other Latin American water utilities
of similar size.  The low degree of mechanization of most systems and the
need to operate many small systems located throughout the country would
justify a ratio of around 9/1000 connections. During negotiations, it was
agreed that IDAAN will gradually improve the employees/1000 connection



- 32 -
ANNEX I
Page 2
ratio to 9/1000 by 1988 and that for the purpose of calculating such ratio,
the staff of IDAAN, which is devoting all of its working time to the execu-
tion of a project and whose labor cost is capitalized into the construction
cost, will not be included.   In view of the expanding systems, this can
largely be achieved through the expected growth in the number of connec-
tions and the reduction of personnel through attrition.
Planning and Budgeting
5.         The Planning Unit was established recently and carries out phy-
sical, economic,  financial,  and management planning.   The staff of the
Planning Unit is dynamic but somewhat limited in experience; it was very
helpful during preparation and appraisal of the proposed project.
6.          Capital and operating expenditures are formally budgeted on an
annual basis.   The Planning Unit annually prepares a five-year investment
plan, which is submitted to the Central Government and incorporated into a
National Five-Year Development Program.   Budgets must be approved by the
National Controller's Office.  Expenditures against budget allocations are
monitored daily by officials of the Controller's Office.   These officials
are paid by IDAAN and stationed at its headquarters.
Accounting
7.        All accounting is centralized at headquarters.  An accrual-based
accounting system is used and generally accepted accounting principles are
followed.  Two departments under the Financial Services Directorate carry
out financial and budget control accounting functions.   Insufficient co-
ordination between these two departments makes IDAAN's accounting cumber-
some and slow, especially at closing.   Currently, only budget control is
computerized.   To improve IDAAN's accounting, the integration of the two
accounting functions and computerization is necessary.
8.           Accounting procedures have improved under Loan 1280-PAN.  New
cost and plant accounting systems were developed by consultants and are
being implemented.   These two systems are designed for manual use, but
could be adapted to computer application. During the execution of the pro-
posed project, IDAAN, assisted by consultants to be hired under the tech-
nical assistance program, would computerize its accounting system, and in-
tegrate budget control and financial accounting systems.
Revaluation of Fixed Assets
9.         IDAAN inventoried and revalued its assets in 1979, but has been
slow in updating the revaluation.  The revaluation of fixed assets as of
December 31, 1981 was completed recently and approved by IDAAN's Board in
August 1982. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that IDAAN will
revalue its fixed assets annually in accordance with accounting guidelines
established by the Panamanian Institute of Public Accountants and using ap-
propriate indices for price increases issued by the Department of Statis-
tics of the National Controller's Office.



- 33 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3
Auditing
10.        IDAAN's financial statements are audited annually by independent
auditors, as required under Loan 1280-PAN.   The 1976-81 financial state-
ments were audited by Arthur Andersen Co., whose audit work was satis-
factory.   IDAAN's financial statements are also audited by the National
Controller's Office.  External auditing by independent auditors will con-
tinue during the execution of the proposed project and audited financial
statements, including expenses financed under the proposed revolving fund
(Annex 15), will be submitted to the Bank no later than four months after
the end of each fiscal year.
11.        IDAAN's internal auditing is inadequate.  External auditors have
pointed out many deficiencies in internal control, but few improvements
have been made.   It is essential that the Internal Auditing Unit improve
its performance.   IDAAN would present to the Bank no later than June 30,
1983 a proposal and implementation plan to improve the performance of the
Internal Audit Unit to a satisfactory level.
Information System
12.       The regional offices provide to national headquarters information
on water production, quality control, commercial activities and operations
in general.   This information is condensed for presentation to the Execu-
tive Director and the Planning Office.  Much of the information lacks con-
sistency, accuracy and conciseness.   Delays in its preparation limit the
usefulness of the information in the formulation of management decisions.
The Planning Unit has committed itself to improving the information system
with the assistance of consultants.
Operation and Maintenance
13.        IDAAN's regional offices are responsible for operating and main-
taining the water supply and sewerage systems under their jurisdictions.
They follow quality control norms, guidelines and procedures developed by
the National Logistics Directorate.  Nevertheless, the operation and main-
tenance of water and sewerage systems requires substantial improvement.
Technical assistance and equipment would be provided under the proposed
Loan to improve IDAAN's operation and maintenance capabilities.
Engineering
14.       Under its National Engineering Directorate, IDAAN maintains units
responsible for studies and design, supervision of construction and ground-
water development. The units employ a total of 20 engineers, most of whom
have limited practical experience.  Under the guidance of more experienced
colleagues, the performance of IDAAN's engineers on simple projects is ac-
ceptable.   The department responsible for supervision of construction has

ANNEX 1
Page 4
demonstrated its capability by successfully supervising several large works
carried out under Loan 1280-PAN.   IDAAN relies on engineering consultants
for more sophisticated tasks in studies, design and supervision of con-
struction.
Billing and Collection
15.        The regional offices are responsible for meter reading and esti-
mating consumption from unmetered connections.   A generally efficient bil-
ling system developed by consultants under Loan 1280-PAN is in use. Bills
are prepared at headquarters monthly using the data processing facilities
of the National Controller's Office, to which IDAAN has access at reason-
able cost.   The customer master file, however, needs to be updated.   In
particular, customers with sewerage connections must be identified.  IDAAN
is currently carrying out an inventory of sewerage connections which is
expected to be completed by mid-1983.
16.        Collections have improved considerably during the last 2-3 years
as a result of improvement of facilities to deal with customers' complaints
and a determined effort to collect overdue accounts receivable, particu-
larly from Government institutions.   Nevertheless, gross accounts receiv-
able were equivalent to five months of billings at the end of 1981.  Ac-
counts receivable from water sales will be reduced to three months of bill-
ings by the end of 1983 and will not exceed this level thereafter.
17.        IDAAN's record of collecting valorization charges has been poor.
At the end of 1981, the amount of uncollected charges was US$3.0 million,
equivalent to almost one year of billings.   One of the main reasons for
this poor record is that many property owners are reluctant to pay valori-
zation charges for land that has not yet been developed.  IDAAN is taking
steps to remedy the situation by reviewing and updating contracts and iden-
tifying delinquent property owners.  IDAAN has already initiated legal ac-
tion against some of the owners.  IDAAN will present a plan of action sat-
isfactory to the Bank by December 31, 1983 to improve the collection of
valorization charges and reduce overdue charges to the equivalent of no
more than three months of billings by the end of 1985 and thereafter.
Insurance
18.         All of IDAAN's properties are adequately insured against fire,
loss or damage.   In compliance with the covenant  under Loan  1280-PAN,
equipment and materials for works under construction are insured against
loss and damage in shipment, accidents, fire and property damage.   This
practice will be continued.

Technical Assistance and Training
19.          IDAAN has received technical assistance under Loan 1280-PAN,
mainly in engineering, administrative, commercial and financial areas. The
funds for technical assistance under Loan 1280-PAN were not fully used be-
cause IDAAN was able to secure assistance from the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) at no cost and to finance part of it with its own
funds.   The Bank funds were reallocated to other categories.   Under the
proposed project, technical assistance in operations and maintenance would
have the highest priority.
20.          IDAAN's permanent training program for staff at all levels,
covering most areas relevant to IDAAN's operations, has improved the qual-
ity of IDAAN's staff. This internal training program would continue and be
complemented under the proposed project by on-the-job training provided by
consultants under the Technical Assistance Program and external training
courses.  This training would be primarily for personnel involved in the
maintenance and operation of water supply and sewerage systems throughout
the country.

PANAMA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Population, Service and Demand in the Project Areas
General
1.          This Annex summarizes present and future populations,  service
levels for water supply and sewerage, and demands for each of the project
areas covered under the proposed project (Santiago, La Chorrera, Colon,
District of Arraijan and Panama City, see Map No. 1).
Santiago
2.         Santiago, located about 150 km west of Panama City, is the capi-
tal of Veraguas Province. It had a population of about 29,000 in mid-1982.
Santiago is attractive to migrants from surrounding rural areas. The aver-
age annual population growth rate was 5.3% in the 1960s and slightly more
than 4% in the 1970s. Annual growth rates are predicted to stay at around
4% during the 1980s and then to fall to 3% by the year 2000.  This pattern
would give Santiago a population of about 37,000 in 1990 and 47,000 in 2000
(Attachment 2).
3.         Almost all of Santiago's population has water service via house
connections (about 5,000 in 1982).   The present average water production
capacity of 1.8 mgd is not sufficient to provide Santiago's current popula-
tion with an adequate and continuous water supply.  Unaccounted-for water
in 1981 was about 37%, down from over 50% in 1979.  Under the fourth IDB
water supply and sewerage project, Santiago's water supply system will be
expanded and its production capacity will be increased to about 3.1 mgd by
the end of 1985.   This expansion is expected to satisfy Santiago's water
production, transmission and storage needs until about 1993.
4.        About 7,200 people living in the center of Santiago (about 25% of
the total population) have access to a waterborne sewerage system covering
21% (113 ha) of the city's total area. The remaining population depends on
individual septic tanks (17%) and latrines (56%).   The existing sewerage
system comprises nine independent subsystems,  each of which drains to a
communal septic tank.  All communal septic tanks are overloaded, and do not
function properly because of the absence or insufficiency of drainfields.
As a result, the communal septic tanks release virtually untreated sewage
into nearby water courses that run through populated areas on their way to
a stream on the periphery of Santiago, creating a public health hazard.
Outside the sewered area, people rely primarily on latrines or individual
septic tanks.   Most of the individual septic tanks do not function pro-
perly. As a result, the effluent from individual septic tanks and sullage



- 40 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2
water run off via street gutters and storm drains, intensifying the public
health hazards created by the sewage effluent from the communal septic
tanks.   IDAAN aims at eliminating  the resulting  pollution by expanding
sewerage coverage to about 65% of the population by 1990 and by treating
the sewage in an oxidation pond before it is discharged into a stream
outside the city's boundaries. The works required to reach these goals
would be financed under the proposed project.
La Chorrera
5.          La Chorrera, a district capital in the Province of Panama,  is
located about  30 km west of the capital.   Because of its proximity to
Panama City, La Chorrera has experienced an extraordinary population growth
of about 6% p.a. during the past two decades.  By mid-1982, La Chorrera's
urban population had risen to about 53,000 people.   For the remainder of
the 1980s, planners project an annual growth rate of about 3.9%.  At this
rate La Chorrera's population would increase to about 72,000 in 1990 and
105,000 in the year 2000 (Attachment 1).
6.         In 1964, IDAAN built a conventional water treatment plant (maxi-
mum capacity of 3 mgd) to treat water drawn from the Caimito River.  Under
Loan 1280-PAN, the plant's capacity was expanded to 6 mgd. It now provides
good quality water to about 95% of La Chorrera's population.  With few ex-
ceptions, people are served by individual house connections.  Unaccounted-
for water was close to 50% in 1981.   If IDAAN's efforts to reduce unac-
counted-for water are successful, the plant's production capacity will be
adequate until the early 1990s.
7.         Sanitation problems in La Chorrera are very similar to those of
Santiago.  About 11,000 people (21% of the population) in an area of about
310 ha in the center of the town have access to sewerage systems with com-
munal septic tanks.  The remaining population uses individual septic tanks
(15%) and latrines (64%).   Untreated sewage from poorly functioning com-
munal septic tanks and individual septic tanks and sullage water in un-
served areas combine to cause heavy pollution of storm drains. Engineering
consultants have developed a sewerage master plan that proposes a four-
stage sewer system expansion program designed to meet La Chorrera's needs
until the year 2010.   The objective of the first phase of the program,
which would be realized under the proposed Loan, would be to construct col-
lectors between the communal septic tanks and the receiving waters (Rio
Caimito and Rio Martin Sanchez) and to connect about 50% of the population
by 1990.
Colon
8.         The proposed project component in Colon would be limited to the
city's center, the Isla de Manzanillo, a peninsula of about 2.3 km2.   In



- 41 -
ANNEX 3
Page 3
the past, Colon was a thriving industrial and commercial center.  Popula-
tion growth between 1940 and 1970 averaged an extraordinary 14% p.a.
Colon's  prosperity declined  rapidly during  the last  10-15 years.   The
peninsula's population dropped by 13% from an all-time high of almost
70,000 in the late 1960s to around 60,000 at present..  Urban deterioration
on the peninsula prompted businesses and many people to leave the Colon
area or move to newly established settlements outside the peninsula.
9.        The Panamanian Government has declared the revitalization of the
Colon area in general, and the Isla de Manzanillo in particular, one of its
priority goals. During the next five years, the Government expects public
and private investments in the area to exceed US$300 million. The Bank is
assisting in this effort through an urban development project (Loa-h
1878-PAN, US$35 million). In addition to the development of the industrial
and commercial free zone, this project includes the construction of 1,750
housing units for low-income people on the Isla de Manzanillo, replacing
many of the deteriorated tenements.   This and other measures,  including
improvements in the town's basic infrastructure, are expected to again make
the peninsula an attractive place in which to live. Planners forecast that
the population will increase gradually to a maximum of about 75,000 by 2010
(Attachment 2).
10.         IDAAN provides the Isla de Manzanillo with water purchased from
the Mount Hope water treatment plant (owned and operated by the Panama
Canal Commission) through about 5,500 house connections.   Unaccounted-for
water in 1981 was around 32%.   The total per capita daily average water
consumption is about 100 gcd. About 40% of the water is used for commer-
cial, industrial and official purposes, especially by the Port Authority
which sells water to ships.  The quality of the water supplied is good and
the service is continuous.   In the future, no shortage in production or
transmission is anticipated, as population growth will be small and an ade-
quate supply of water is available from the Mount Hope Treatment Plant.
Most of the distribution and transmission network, however, was constructed
in the early l900s by the Panama Canal Commission (PCC) and substantial
rehabilitation and replacement works must be undertaken in the near fu-
ture. First steps towards the rehabilitation of Colon's water supply sys-
tem would be financed under the proposed project.
11.         Almost all houses on the peninsula are connected to the sewer
system.  Because the peninsula is below sea level, all sewage is pumped by
four stations to a submarine outfall in the Bay of Manzanillo. All pumping
stations and the sea outfall are seriously deteriorated, as is much of the
collector system, which was built in the early 1900s by PCC.    It is esti-
mated that about 30% of the pipes are badly deteriorated.   The vitrified
clay sewer pipes have become brittle and are prone to breakage when repairs
or new connections are made.   Complete rehabilitation of the pumping sta-
tions and the eventual replacement of most sewer lines will be necessary in



- 42 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4
the near future.  As an immediate measure,  sewer pipes in the areas ear-
marked for urban renewal under Loan 1878-PAN must be replaced to guarantee
the successful connection of the new housing units.   The replacement of
these pipes would be financed under the proposed project.
12.         Stormwater in the Isla de Manzanillo is collected by subsurface
drains and conveyed to two stations which pump it to the sea.  It appears
that the pipe network and pumping stations, although severely deteriorated
in several areas and in dire need of cleaning and repair, are generally
sufficient to evacuate stormwater from the peninsula.  In some areas (about
30 blocks), however, street flooding is chronic because of the complete
failure of the drainage system.   In these areas, flooding precludes com-
mercial activities, and poses a serious health hazard.  In the long run, a
complete rehabilitation of the peninsula's drainage system will be neces-
sary.   Works of highest  priority,  including the rehabilitation of both
pumping stations and the pipes in the chronically flooded areas, would be
carried out under the proposed project.
Arraijan District
13.          The District of Arraijan is located adjacent to the western
border of the old Canal Zone.  The project area is roughly defined by the
rectangle formed by the towns of Arraijan, Vista Alegre, Vera Cruz and the
Vacamonte Fishing Port  (Map No. 2).   Because of its proximity to Panama
City, the district has experienced rapid population growth during the last
two decades and is developing into one of Panama City's most important
satellite areas.   In addition,  the Vacamonte Fishing Port,  completed in
1980 with Bank assistance (Loan 1114-PAN), has become one of the largest
fishing ports and fish processing centers in Central America.  Since 1960,
the total population in the District has more than tripled and had reached
about 37,000 by mid-1982. Because of the district's extraordinary develop-
ment potential, population growth is expected to remain far above the na-
tional average for urban areas.  Projected annual growth rates of 4.5% in
the 1980s and 4.0% in the 1990s would translate into a total District popu-
lation of 53,000 by 1990 and 78,000 by 2000 (Attachment 2).
14.        Until recently, only the town of Vera Cruz had adequate public
water supply because it was located at the end of a water transmission line
owned  by  PCC  and  supplying  water  from  the  PCC-owned  and  -operated
Miraflores treatment plant, located on the eastern bank of the Canal. The
rest of the people in the area depended on wells with generally low yields
or tank trucks.   In 1977, engineering consultants studied long-term solu-
tions to the area's water supply problems.   Of the various alternatives
investigated, supplying the District from the Miraflores Water Treatment
Plant was found to be the least-cost solution.   This scheme requires the
construction of a pumping station at the Miraflores Plant and a new trans-
mission main which, after crossing the Canal, would extend to the Vacamonte



- 43 -
ANNEX 3
Page 5
Fishing Port and be routed through Arraijan and Vista Alegre (Map No. 2).
The first stage of this scheme was completed in 1981 under Loan 1280-PAN.
These works included a transmission main between Cocoli and Arraijan, a
temporary package water treatment plant (0.5 mgd) at Vista Alegre and a
transmission main connecting the plant with the Vacamonte Fishing Port.
The volume of water sent to Arraijan from the Miraflores Plant via Cocoli
is limited to 0.5 mgd because of the insufficient capacity of the transmis-
sion main crossing the Canal.
15.       The capacity of the existing systems is barely sufficient to sup-
ply IDAAN's present customers (2,100 connections serving about 12,000
people, plus the Vacamonte Fishing Port) and is not adequate to meet the
needs of several communities which are not adequately served or to satisfy
future demand of the fast growing population in the District.   The works
under the proposed project would complete the Miraflores Scheme begun under
Loan 1280-PAN and would provide the production and transmission capacity
necessary to supply the entire District of Arraijan and the Vacamonte Fish-
ing Port in the medium term (Annex 4).  Substantial supplementary invest-
ment in secondary water transmission, storage and distribution would be
required to make full use of the facilities provided under the project.
Under its fourth operation, IDB has agreed to finance such works in the
following communities: Caceres, Cerro Silvestre, El Llano, La Polvareda,
Nuevo Arraijan, Nuevo Guarare y Chapala and San Vicente de Bigue.   These
communities, with a combined current population of about 8,500, would be
the first to benefit from the proposed transmission facilities.
16.       People living in the District of Arraijan depend on septic tanks
and latrines for excreta and wastewater disposal.  These modes of disposal
do not appear to create any major problems now because of low population
densities. With the anticipated population growth and the increased avail-
ability of adequate water supply through house connections, safe disposal
of wastewater could become a problem.
Panama City Metropolitan Area
17.         The total population of the Panama City Metropolitan Area, in-
cluding San Miguelito, was about 700,000 in mid-1982.   During the 1970s,
the population grew at an average annual rate of 3.7%, far above the na-
tional average. Most of the population growth, caused mainly by migration
from the interior, has taken place in neighborhoods located on the out-
skirts of the city. These peripheral areas grew at rates of up to 9% p.a.
during the last decade.   The population in the Metropolitan Area is ex-
pected to continue to grow by above the national average, but at somewhat
reduced, rates. Average growth rates of 3.2% during the 1980s and 2.9% for
the 1990s are projected, and the total population in the Metropolitan Area
is expected to  grow to a total of about 0.9 million by 1990 and 1.2 mil-
lion by 2000.   Some peripheral neighborhoods will  continue  to attract

ANNEX 3
Page 6
migrants from the countryside. In the neighborhoods of Juan Diaz, Pedregal
and Tocumen, for example, population growth rates of 4-6% are projected for
the next two decades.
18.       Most of the people living in the Metropolitan Area have access to
sufficient amounts of safe water.  In mid-1982, about 81,000 house connec-
tions served  -bout 95% of the area's population (Attachment 3).   In the
eastern part of Panama City (Pedregal, Tocumen, Juan Diaz), however, some
90,000 people are affected by water shortages and intermittent supply re-
sulting from insufficient transmission capacity.  Under the proposed pro-
ject, transmission capacity to this part of the city would be expanded to
eliminate current water shortages and assure a firm supply for the coming
decade.
19.        IDAAN supplies the Metropolitan Area with water from two treat-
ment plants. The Miraflores Plant, owned and operated by PCC, can supply a
maximum of 33 mgd; IDAAN's Chilibre Plant can deliver a maximum of about 70
mgd, which could be increased by another 10-15 mgd at a relatively low in-
vestment cost by boosting the plant's pumping capacity.  The combined pro-
duction capacity of the two plants, including the increased pumping capa-
city at Chilibre,  will be sufficient to meet the Metropolitan Area's de-
mand at least until the early 1990s.
20.        The water supply distribution system in the Panama City Metropo-
litan Area needs repair and improvement. The most urgent measures include:
(a) pressure regulation; (b) replacement of valves; (c) rehabilitation and
improvement of pumping stations and storage tanks; and (d) leak detection
and repair. IDAAN began a rehabilitation and operational improvement pro-
gram with the assistance of consultants under Loan 1280-PAN. This program
would be intensified during the proposed project and, together with the
metering program also included under the proposed Loan, is expected to
decrease unaccounted-for water from the current high level of around 36% to
25% by 1986.
21.        The central part of Panama City has a sewer collector capacity
sufficiently large to meet the needs of the Metropolitan Area until at
least the year 2000.  Records of the number of connections to the system
are not accurately kept, but IDAAN estimates that about 65% of the people
in the Metropolitan Area are connected.   Several housing developments on
the periphery of the city have no sewerage services at all. Other develop-
ments have sewerage systems connected to communal septic tanks, most of
which are not working properly and discharge raw sewage into adjacent water
courses. As a result, environmental pollution is heavy in several neigh-
borhoods and in streams flowing through Panama City to the Bay of Panama.
To reduce this pollution, it is IDAAN's policy to connect to the extent

ANNEX 3
Page 7
possible all people living in the Metropolitan Area to the existing col-
lector system. The sewerage works in Panama City under the proposed pro-
ject would support this policy. The sewerage system is poorly maintained.
Malfunctioning of pumping stations and clogged sewers are not uncommon.
One of the objectives of the proposed project is, therefore, to improve
IDAAN's sewer system maintenance capability.

PANAMA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Consultant Services, Technical Assistance and Training
Scope
1.        Under the proposed project, consultants would be engaged to pro-
vide the following services:
For the IDAAN Project
(a)   technical assistance in various areas (para. 2);
(b)   preparation of Colon sewerage master plan; and
(c)   supervision of construction for the Miraflores Pumping Sta-
tion, canal crossing and five sewage pumping stations.
For the MOP Project
(a)   technical assistance in the organization of a maintenance
and operation unit for the storm drainage system in Colon;
(b)   preparation of final designs for storm drains and two storm
drainage pumping stations; and
(c)   supervision of construction for the rehabilitation of two
storm drainage pumping stations.
Manpower and cost estimates for consultant services are presented in
Attachment 1.
Technical Assistance
2.        The technical assistance program for IDAAN, estimated to require
about 50 man-months of specialized consultants, would cover the following
main areas:
(a)    rehabilitation and improvements in the operation of the
Panama City and Colon water supply systems;



- 54 -
ANNEX 7
Page 2
(b)   improvement of IDAAN's maintenance capabilities for water
and sewerage;
(c)   metering, including meter reading procedures and meter shop
organization;
(d)   purchasing procedures and inventory control;
(e)   tariff structure review; and
(f)   administrative and commercial systems with emphasis on ac-
counting, internal control and information.
3.        Under Loan 1280-PAN, IDAAN received advice from specialists from
Compagnie des Eaux de Marseille in several areas of management and opera-
tion.  These specialists and IDAAN staff cooperated closely in evaluating
problem areas and recommending improvements which IDAAN personnel carried
out under the supervision of the technical assistance specialists. The in-
tervention of these specialists was intermittent (2-8 weeks per visit) and
obliged IDAAN personnel to carry out agreed upon tasks between visits.
This type of implementation-oriented assistance has proven to be quite suc-
cessful and would be continued during the proposed project.
4.          The technical assistance program to MOP, estimated to require
about three man-months of specialty consultants, has the objective to as-
sist MOP in the organization of an adequate maintenance and operation unit
for the storm drainage system in Colon.
Training
5.         The technical assistance programs to IDAAN and MOP would be com-
plemented by training primarily for operators and engineers involved in op-
eration and maintenance.  Motivated and promising operators and engineers
would be given the opportunity to receive practical training either pro-
vided by specialty trainers in Panama or by attending training programs
abroad.   The training program would be prepared and coordinated with the
help  of  the  technical  assistance  consultants  for  operation and main-
tenance.    Funds  budgeted  for  training  are  US$100,000  for  IDAAN  and
US$30,000 for MOP which would be used to finance foreign costs for travel,
per diem expenses and course fees.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Past, Present and Forecasted Financial
Performance of IDAAN
Introduction
1.         This annex contains additional financial data which supplements
the information presented in Chapter VI.  The Basic Performance Indicators
and the Financial Statements shown in Attachments 1 to 5 refer to past per-
formance (1976-81); those shown in Attachments 6 to 9 refer to forecasted
performance (1982-88).  Past and forecasted results and underlying assump-
tions are discussed below.
Past Performance (1976-81)
2.           IDAAN's total revenues during the period increased from US$15
million to US$28 million (81%). As operating expenses increased from US$11
million to US$24 million (126%), IDAAN was able to finance only 14% (from
net internal cash generation) of its capital expenditures.  User contribu-
tions through valorization charges helped IDAAN to make an additional 11%
contribution to its capital expenditures.   Debt service payments  (about
US$26 million) plus increases in working capital and other assets (about
US$7 million) absorbed 76% of the US$43 million gross internal cash genera-
tion, leaving US$10 million cash for investments.
3.         The main reason for the increase of revenues was the 3% monthly
increase in water rates from February 1976 to February 1977 and 2% from
March 1977 to February 1978.   The increase in operating expenses was the
result of increase in wages, power and purchased water. Wages almost dou-
bled because of a massive hiring of staff during 1977 to comply with the
Government's emergency employment plan.   All expenses also suffered from
the effects of the high inflation rates prevailing in 1979 and 1980 (8% and
14% respectively).

ANNEX 10
Page 2
Present Position (1982)
4.           IDAAN has taken some actions to improve its financial perfor-
mance. Among them are: (a) the increase of water rates and introduction of
a progressive tariff structure starting in April 1982; (b) the improvement
in methods of es-imating consumption through unmetered connections; and (c)
the reduction in purchase of treated water from the PCC which resulted from
the commissioning in 1982 of IDAAN's new treatment plant in Colon.   As a
result, its financial performance is expected to be satisfactory.   Fore-
casted results for 1982 indicate that IDAAN could finance about 60% of its
capital expenditures in that year from its net internal cash generation
plus valorization charges.
Forecasted Performance (1983-90)
5.         IDAAN's financial performance during the eight-year period is ex-
pected to be satisfactory. Supervision would be necessary, however, to en-
sure that IDAAN attains the financial targets.
6.        Revenues during the period are expected to be sufficient to fully
cover cash operating expenses, debt service payments including non-financed
interest during construction, working capital needs, and to leave about
US$90 million of internally generated funds.  This amount plus about US$22
million of receipts from valorization charges would exceed depreciation
charges on revalued fixed assets (about US$105 million) and would finance
around 64% of capital expenditures through 1990.
7.         IDAAN is expected to finance about 56% of its total capital ex-
penditures during project execution (1983-88) through its net internal cash
generation (46%) plus valorization charges (10%).  The remaining funds to
complete its financing plan would come from Government equity contributions
(13%) and borrowings (31%).
Assumptions Used for Financial Projections
8.        Panama's consumer prices follow closely the average international
inflation rate.  Its currency, the Balboa, has been and is assumed to con-
tinue at par with the U.S. dollar.   Thus, the following inflation rates
were used when estimating operating costs: 8% during 1982 and 1983; 7.5% in
1984; 7% in 1985; and 6% for 1986-90.
Consumption Forecast
9.        Consumption was estimated on the basis of averages of consumption
per connection per month at each consumption category in the Panama City
Metropolitan Area, Colon and its surroundings, and the rest of the country,
and on the basis of the number of incremental connections IDAAN plans to
install during the 1982-90 period.   Historical consumption per connection



- 61 -
ANNEX 10
Page 3
per month figures were adjusted to account for the increase of metering,
improved estimates of consumption for unmetered connections, and the ex-
pected impact of the new tariff structure.
Income Statement Items
Revenues
10.        Revenues from water sales for 1982-84 were derived from the con-
sumption estimates described in para. 9 above and from average tariffs re-
sulting from tariffs implemented in April 1982.  The need for tariff in-
creases for 1985-86 is expected to be met through the introduction of a
separate sewerage charge (para. 12).  However, should inflation be higher
than expected (para. 8), additional tariff increases would have to be in-
troduced sooner. During 1987-90, tariffs would have to be increased only
to maintain the 1986 value in real terms. Other operational revenues were
forecasted as follows:
Penalties  for Late Payment:    IDAAN charges  10% on the total
amount of water billed when payment is made more than 30 days
after the billing date.   Foreseen collection improvements would
reduce revenues from this source.
Connection Fees and Installation Cost of House Connections:
IDAAN charges B/20 for connection rights and bills the customer
for the cost of materials and labor incurred for the installation
of the house connection. Fees and cost of materials are expected
to increase with inflation.
Interest of Valorization Charges:   IDAAN charges interest on de-
ferred payments of valorization charges. An increase in revenues
is forecasted during the 1983-90 period as a result of new works
entering into operation and higher interest rates.
11.          Non-operational revenues include earnings from invested cash,
rent of facilities, earnings on sale of obsolete or unneeded assets and
other minor revenues which are not related to water supply or sewerage op-
erations. No substantial increase of these revenues is foreseen.
12.       Revenues from sewerage services are forecasted under the assump-
tion that starting in 1985 a sewerage surcharge of 20% of the amount billed
for water consumption will be levied on connected customers. An inventory
of sewerage house connections is expected to be completed during 1983, and
a comprehensive study on a sewerage surcharge is expected to be completed
during 1984.

ANNEX 10

Costs
13.         Operating costs are segregated by main object of expenditure.
Growth is projected as follows:
Wages: at par with inflation rates. Savings on recommended per-
sonnel reductions are assumed to be offset by promotions and sal-
ary increases.
Chemicals:   in proportion to increases in production, adjusted
for inflation.
Power:  2% in real terms to account for increased pumping capac-
ity and increased use of fuel and lubricants required to improve
maintenance.
Materials:   in proportion to increase in number of connections,
including the cost of materials used for house connections.
Purchase of water: at par with inflation rates. Projections as-
sume that purchase of water will be maintained at levels which
would avoid penalties for purchases in excess of ceiling volumes.
Other:  10% per year.  Other operating expenditures include mis-
cellaneous expenses which can neither be charged to other opera-
tional cost categories nor be capitalized.
Depreciation:   2.5% per year on fixed assets.   This average re-
sults from the current composition of useful lives of, and depre-
ciation allowances for, operating fixed assets computed           fol-
lowing the straight-line depreciation method.
Other indirect costs:   1% of total billing.  Indirect costs in-
clude provisions for bad debts.
14.        No forecast of non-operational costs is made since there are no
records of prior non-operating expenditures; therefore, there is no basis
to make an assumption.
Flow of Funds Items
Contributions
15.          Government equity contributions include committed amounts for
projects to be financed by IDB, the amounts for the project to be financed
by the proposed Loan (equivalent to 24% of project costs, excluding inter-
est during construction); and amounts already committed for on-going pro-
jects.



- 63 -
ANNEX 10
Page 5
16.         User contributions (valorization)  include property betterment
levies to be billed to beneficiaries of completed projects.   Projections
take into account on-going projects that are to be apportioned to users
when completed.
17.          Developers' contributions are not included in the forecasts,
since it is not possible to forecast water supply distribution and sewerage
collection networks they will donate.   As assets donated by developers
would be reflected as contributions in the sources of funds and as invest-
ment in the application of funds, the contribution would be offset.
Borrowings
18.         New borrowings include the following amounts, terms and condi-
tions:
Loan Amount   Interest   Commitment   Front-end  Grace   Amortz.
Lender   (millions)         Rate         Charge         Fee      Period  Period
IBRD     US$20.0 a!    11.43% b/   0.075%          1.5% d/      3      12
IDB-IC   US$13.0         9.25% c/   1.25%          1.0%         4.5    20.5
IDB-SF   US$13.0         2.0% c/    0.50%          1.0%         8.5    21.5
a/  Does not include US$1.6 million for the MOP component since this amount
would be onlent to and repaid by the Government.
b/ Capitalized during construction period.
c/ Financed and capitalized during grace period.
dt Financed and capitalized during first year of loan effectiveness.
Investments
19.       Investments include works under the proposed loan and contracted
IDB loans, on-going projects, planned expansion works and capitalized in-
terest.  Cash surpluses are assumed to be invested in expansion and main-
tenance works.
Debt Service
20.        Forecasted debt service reflects interest and principal payments
on existing obligations and the borrowings described above.
Balance Sheet Items
21.        Cash balances are forecasted at levels sufficient to cover one
month of wages and about 50% of accounts payable to PCC.

22.        Accounts receivable from water sales are net of bad debt provi-
sions for they are expected to be reduced from the current equivalent of
four months of billing to three months of billing by 1983 and continue at
the same level thereafter.
23.       Receivables from valorization charges are gross (no provision for
bad debts is made).   They are expected to be reduced gradually from the
current equivalent of 12 months of billing to a maximum of three months of
billing by 1985.
24.        Inventories of material for normal operations are forecasted to
be sufficient to cover three months of materials and chemicals.
25.       Inventories of construction materials are expected to be gradual-
ly reduced from current levels of about US$2.5 million equivalent to US$1.0
million equivalent by 1985.
26.           Other current  assets are expected  to remain at levels not
exceeding US$1.0 million.
27.        All fixed assets and accumulated depreciation are revalued.   A
1.05 revaluation factor was used. This average factor is lower than infla-
tion, since results from itemized revaluation of labor, material and equip-
ment costs during 1980 and 1981 (excluding land and small equipment and
tools) averaged about 70% of Panama's consumer price index.
28.         Payables to Panama Canal Commission are assumed not to exceed
US$1.0 million per year.
29.        Payables to suppliers are assumed to be equivalent to two months
of operating costs (other than wages, power and purchase of water).
30.           Other current liabilities which include contractor deposits
(guarantees) are assumed not to exceed a level of US$10.0 million in amy
year.

PANAMA
SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Draft Outline of Terms of Reference for Tariff Study
Introduction
1.          IDAAN agrees on the need to revise the current tariff structure
for water and sewerage services provided by IDAAN. For this purpose, IDAAN
will review its tariff policy during the implementation of the proposed
project.
Objectives
2.         The purpose of the tariff study is to determine a tariff struc-
ture which is adequate to meet IDAAN's financial requirements, comprising
self-sufficiency and contribution to investments, to reflect as closely as
possible the costs to the economy of meeting increasing demands for water
and sewerage services and to assure that services will be affordable to the
whole population.
General Guidelines
3.        The tariff study should take into consideration the following as-
pects:
(a)    resource allocation objectives through the application of
tariffs that reflect as closely as possible long-run mar-,
ginal costs of water and sewerage services separately;
(b)   social  objectives  through  the  application  of  affordable
tariffs and fixed charges for minimum consumption which
allow the low-income population to have access to the ser-
vices;
(c)   financial objectives consistent with those agreed upon with
the Bank for the proposed loan; and



- 77 -
ANNEX 14
Page 2
(d)   different  tariff  levels  for  different  users  reflecting
costs of the services and differences in ability to pay.
4.        IDAAN will pay special attention to the following deficiencies of
its present tariff structure:
(a)   tariffs do not discriminate between consumers who have ac-
cess to water supply and sewerage and those who have access
to water supply only;
(b)   not sufficient progressivity of tariffs in relation to vol-
umes consumed; and
(c)   low charges for commercial and industrial consumption.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Revolving Fund for the Financing of In-House Sanitary Installations
1.        The objective of the sewerage components in Panama City, Santiago
and La Chorrera is the improvement of sanitary conditions.  Attainment of
this objective is only possible if the great majority of the households
living in the project area actually connect to the infrastructure pro-
vided.   For families which in the past depended on latrines for excreta
disposal,  the installation of in-house plumbing and  sewer lines leading
from the house to the sewer lateral may cost as much as US$600, even if
only rudimentary facilities are installed.   Many low-income  families are
expected to have to forego connection unless some financial assistance
would be provided.  The most effective way of assuring that financial as-
sistance would be provided as part of the proposed project is the estab-
lishment of a revolving fund.
2.        Based on income estimates in the project area (para. 2.06), it is
assumed that 40% of all potential beneficiary families in Panama City, 30%
of those in Santiago and 25% of those in La Chorrera would require finan-
cial assistance. No assistance is necessary in Colon since in-house plumb-
ing is provided as part of the new housing units.   It is further assumed
that, on the average, a family would need a loan of US$600, to be repaid
over a period of 5 years at 12% interest.  Based on these assumptions, the
cash flow analysis in Attachment 1 shows that through 1988, a total of US$1
million would have to be paid into the revolving fund. Through 1990, about
2,800 families would benefit from the financial assistance provided. After
1989, the revolving fund would continue to function entirely from loan re-
payments.   Since the foreign component of the in-house plumbing is esti-
mated at about 50% of the total cost, the fund's initial replenishments
would be shared in equal parts by IDAAN and the Bank.  IDAAN would make an
initial deposit of US$100,000 to the fund by June 30, 1985.
3.        All in-house plumbing work would be carried out by qualified lo-
cal plumbers in accordance with standards and unit prices approved by
TDAAN.   To initiate a loan from the revolving  fund,  the property owner
would make a request to IDAAN.  After IDAAN has inspected the premises and
agreed to the proposed installation, the property owner would enter into a



- 79 -
ANNEX 15
Page 2
contract with the plumber and sign a loan agreement with IDAAN for the
amount of the contract. IDAAN would make both progress and final payments
to the contractor from the fund. Final payment would be made after inspec-
tion of the completed installations.   IDAAN would periodically submit dis-
bursement requests to the Bank based on statements of expenses, duly certi-
fied by the external auditors.   These statements of expenses would be for
groups of contracts.
4.          The loan conditions could vary with the financial resources of
the borrower.   In certain hardship cases,  IDAAN would consider providing
grants to cover part of the installation. Details regarding on-lending ar-
rangements, eligibility criteria for loans and grants, the source of grant
funds, administrative procedures and safeguards for providing assistance
only to the truly needy would be presented to the Bank for review by no
later than June 30, 1984.
