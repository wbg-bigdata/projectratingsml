DJIBOUTI
Education Project
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:        Republic of Djibouti
Beneficiary:    Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sports (MNE)
Amount:          SDR 5.1 million (US$5.0 million equivalent)
Terms:           Standard
Project Description:
Objectives:   The objectives of the project are: (i) to expand and
improve primary education in underprivileged urban and
rural areas; and (ii) to improve the management of the
education system through educational planning and
evaluation.
Components:   (a) Urban primary schools.  Establishment of two new
schools in underprivileged areas of Djibouti-City enrolling
1,800 students.
(b) Rural primary schools.  Establishment of four new
schools and expansion of four existing schools in rural
areas enrolling 1,300 students.
(c) Management of education. Strengthening educational
planning and evaluation through three man-years of
technical assistance and two man-years of fellowships (to
be financed under the ongoing Technical Assistance Project,
Credit 1232-DJI).
Benefits:     The proposed project would assist the Government in
improving the delivery of primary education opportunities
to the most underprivileged segments of the population, and
in improving the efficiency and quality of education
through better management of the system. The project would
benefit 3,100 primary school-age children, representing an
increase of 10 percent over 1983/84 primary enrollment.
Some of the schools would also serve as literacy and
community development centers. The technical assistance
component would help ensure the best use of available
resources through planning and assessment of educational
performance.



(iv)
Risks:   Risks are judged minimal because of the simple design of
the project and the fact that schools similar to those
envisaged are already effectively and routinely
constructed by the MNE through contractors and district
departmental forces. The risk of lower than expected
rural enrollments has been minimized by a survey of the
demand for education in the catchment areas concerned
and the proposed adoption of a cost-efficient school
model, already successfully implemented under similar
circumstances.

REPUBLIC OF DJIBOUTI
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
I. SOCIO-ECONOKIC DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES
Geographic and Socio-Economic Setting
1.01      Situated at the mouth of the Red Sea, the Republic of Djibouti is
a small country (23,000 km2) with a hot and arid climate. Its rugged
terrain is similar to the adjoining deserts of Ethiopia and Somalia. Its
indigenous population is estimated at about 350,000 in 19849 while refugees
from neighboring countries account for an additional 40,000 people. The
growth rate of the population has been tentatively estimated at about 3%
p.a., excluding immigratiovr- over 9Z p.a. in Djibouti-City--, and over 50%
of the population is below 20 years of age. They have a long pastoral
tradition but little experience in agricultural, industrial or commercial
activities. Other less important groups are the Yempnites (about 18,000),
mainly engaged in trade in Djibouti-City, and about 11,000 Europeans
includingr French military personnel, technical assistance staff and people
involved in private business.
1.02      Natural resources are extremely limited and consist mainly of the
country's strategic location, 370 kms of coastal fishing ground and
identified geothermal assets under evaluation. The country is essentially
composed of three economic sub-units: (a) Djibouti-City (where about
200,000 people, i.e. 60% of the population, are concentrated) with the
port/railway terminal, an international airport, government services and
virtually all of the country's commercial activity; (b) the French military
base (with a staff of about 4,500), the main source of economic activity;
and (c) the extremely poor interior districts where the majority of the
rural population (estimated at about 150,000, excluding refugees) is either
nomad or semi-nomad, and is dispersed over the five rural district capitals
(Ali Sabieh, Dikhil, Tadjourah, Obock, and Arta) and villages.
1.03      GDP per capita for Djibouti nationals in 1983 has been
crudely estimated at about US$480 equivalentl/. However, there are wide
variations among Income levels of the various segments of the population.
A 1980 study placed average per capita income of the 47% lowest income
bracket at about 2.5% of that of the 8% highest bracket and at less than
one fifth of that of the 45% middle bracket. No major changes in these
1/ GDP data which include income of expatriate aid personnel had to be
adjusted to reflect income of nationals only.



-2-
relative positions are likely to have occurred in the last few years.
Malnutrition is extensive notwithstanding substantial amounts of food aid
provided by the UN World Food Program and other aid groups. Together with
low health levels, it affects 44% of the total population and 55% of the
1-5 age groups, particularly in the underprivileged peripheral urban areas
and in the interior where they are exacerbated by droughts and the influx
of refugees.
Recent Development and Prospects
1.04      In spite of the scarcity of natural resources and shortage of
skilled manpower, the development process has produced tangible results in
economic growth- between 1978 and 1982, GDP grew in real terms at 3% per
year. However, these results would not have been possible without the
substantial external financial aid (US$443 million equivalent in grants and
US$37 million in low interest loans) and technical assistance (in 1982
about 700 expatriates were working in the public sector) received during
the period. The fragility of the economy and its strong dependence on
foreign aid has been revealed in the last two years when the government
sought to maintain its patterns of investment and consumption despite a
reduction in French grant funds, resulting from stringent budgetary
measures in Paris compounded by the depreciation of the French franc
vis-a-vis the Djibouti franc (tied to the US dollar). The country had to
resort to increasing external borrowing and had to draw heavily on its
foreign exchange reserves.
1.05      The overall development objectives set by the Parliament in 1982
are: to reinforce the role of Djibouti in international affairs, increase
the income of the population and make its distribution more equitable. To
move towards these objectives, the following actions are required: (a)
developing human resources; (b) increasing agricultural and industrial
production; (c) expanding and improving social services; (d) strengthening
transportation and communications services in response to international
demand; and (e) halting the drop in foreign reserves. These have to be
accompanied by a sustained significant inflow of external technical and
financial assistance.
Human Resources
1.06      Labor force data in Djibouti are scanty, and those available
relate to the "modern sector' which accounts for a very small share of the
total. Thus, in the document prepared for the 1983 Donors' Conference,
only about 40,000 people in employment were accounted for, while the
potential active population is estimated at over 200,000. Furthermore, the
qualifications of nationals working in the modern salaried sector are



-3-
below standards. An ILO study carried out in 1979 2/ indicated that 55Z
of salaried staff were illiterate; only 24% could read or write French or
Arabic and only 0.5% had completed senior secondary or higher education.
For higher-level technical and professional positions, the country has to
depend heavily on expatriates who occupy 40% of these positions, many of
them in the public sector.
1.07      The critical situation pictured by the above figures, which
relate probably to the most privileged segment of the local labor force,
points to the urgency of improving and expanding education and training at
all levels. The proposed project should contribute to alleviate the
problem by helping basic education, the most urgent need in view of the
exceptionally low literacy rate (10%) of the population.
II. THE EDUCATION SECTOR AND MAJOR ISSUES
Overview
2.01      General.   Substantial progress has been made over recent years
in expanding and improving the education system. However, the output and
quality of this system, which replicates French models, still need further
improvement and adjustment to local needs and constraints with particular
regard to national staff and finance. The awareness of the Government to
the above is reflected in the onrgoing adjustment of curricula in major
subjects and teacher upgrading programs, and the recent endeavors to
improve internal efficiency, better orient secondary and technical
education to manpower needs, and introduce cost saving measures. However,
there are still no mechanisms to mor.itor and assess the quality and
efficiency Improvement process and to establish the most adequate and
affordable balance between the various types and levels of education.
2.02      The structure of formal education in Djibouti is shown in Annex
1, C-1. It consists of six years of primary education; four years of
junior secondary and three years of senior secondary general education.
Primary teacher training is provided through a two-year course following
completion of at least junior secondary education. Technical education is
provided through five-year courses following completion of primary
education, for skilled workers, and an additional two-year course, for
middle-level technicians. Nonrformal literacy, home-economics and
seai-skilled worker training are also provided to unschooled youths, adults
and refugees. Higher education is offered through fellowships abroad.

1979.



-4-
2.03      The educational system comprises three types of schools: (a)
Government public schools; (b) Government-aided private (Catholic) schools
teaching official programs; and (c) independent private schools teaching
Koranic or foreign Arab programs. Except for an estimated 2,500 students
enrolled in independent private institutions, education at all levels is
financed by the Government.
2.04      The 1983-84 enrollment in the education system is given in Annex
1, 0-2. Despite substantial progress since independence in 1977,
particularly in primary and junior secondary education, enrollment ratios
in primary and secondary education (41% and 1OZ, respectively) are still
low, as compared with those of the world (Annex 1, T-1). The major causes
of this situation are (a) high demographic increase (para. 1.01), and (b)
the high cost of education (para 2.19) which makes the country dependent on
external aid for any progress in the sector (para. 2.16). Educational
planning is difficult under such circumstances. In addition, the output of
the system is also low (Annex 1, T-2): only 29Z of the candidates to the
primary school leaving certificate (CEP) and 33% of the candidates to
admission to general secondary education, passed in 1983. The pass rates
at the junior secondary certificate (BEPC) is also rather low (50%). This
and the unequal quality of the graduates is detrimental to the recruitment
of primary teacher trainees in particular (para. 2.06). Only the 60% pass
rate at the senior secondary diploma (Baccalaureat) level meets the
standards of an acceptable senior secondary education. Moreover, this pass
rate rises to 75% among students enrolled at the senior secondary school
(Lycge). However, junior secondary pass rates could be substantially
raised, if the quality of secondary education was not adversely affected by
the deficiencies of primary education.
2.05      Drop-out is estimated to be low in general.  However, absenteeism
is high in some remote rural areas due to difficulty of access to schools
established without proper analysis of school locations and catchment
areas; insufficient support from local authorities to ensure acceptable
living conditions to students and teachers through adequate provision of
food programs and accommodation; and socio-economic traditions involving
students in their parents' agro-pastoral activities. Repetition is limited
to 10 per grade through a strictly enforced regulation. The only
exception is the last grade of primary education (Grade 6) in which
repetition affects over 40% of enrollments due to examinations (CEP and
competitive examinations for admission to secondary schools). The CEP
(para. 2.04) is a sine qua non to enter public administration, and
admission to secondary education is limited by the number of student places
available in junior secondary schools (CES) and the technical secondary
school (LEP). Therefore, the academic examination system is utilized not
only to test students' acquisitions but also to screen entrants to higher
programs on the basis of the highest test scores. As competition is high,
examinations tend to dictate the contents of the course, whatever the
curriculum, and memory prevails over reasoning and life skills. This has
been aggravated by the irrelevance of some syllabi with regard to local
environment and development needs. This problem is expected to be



-5-
alleviated by the on-going adjustment of curricula and would be addressed
by the evaluation specialist under the proposed project (para. 4.06).
Compounded by the admission to primary education of any students, whatever
their ages, in the late 1970's, low pass rates have resulted in the erratic
bunching of Grade 6 enrollments (Annex 1, C-2). Despite the resulting
bottleneck between primary and secondary education, the progression rate
between these two levels is high (40%), as compared with that in other
countries at the same level of income and development (Annex 1, T-1).
2.06      The major causes of the deficiencies in primary education which
results in the low output of the system, are as follows:
(a) Teacherst insufficient qualifications. Over a quarter of
primary teachers (excluding teachers of Arabic) are still underqualified
(suppleants). The Primary Teacher Training Institute (ENI), established in
1980 with French assistance, cannot yet recruit a sufficient number of
trainees to fill its facilities (Annex 1, T-3)3/. This is due to the
inadequate quality of many applicants, in relation to the reasonable
selection criteria consistent with the requirements and hardships of the
profession. Over its four years of operation, the ENI has admitted only
48% of applicants. This problem will be alleviated in time as the
education system expands and improves (para. 2.10), resulting in a larger
number of qualified BEPC graduates and secondary leavers (para. 2.04).
Monitoring these improvements and their impact on test-scores would be one
of the major assignments of the educational evaluation specialist to be
provided under the proposed project (para. 4.06).
(b) The language problem. French is not the students' mother
tongue. In Djibouti, the two main ethnic groups speak different languages,
Afar and Somali, which nevertheless have similarities in syntax and
etymology. A fairly large Yemeni community (para. 1.01) speaks Arabic.
French is the official language and the language of instruction although,
outside official business and school, vernacular languages are dominant.
However, French is perceived as a sine qua non for carrying on modern
business and thereby acquiring a higher social status. This results in a
strong social demand for French in education. Although French is the
language of instruction as from Grade 1 and tends to become a language of
local culture, primary students do not acquire an adequate mastery of
French. This is mainly due to teachers' inadequate preparation for
teaching French as a foreign language and to French teaching methods which
still require a better adaptation to tne national linguistic structures.
The issue is expected to be alleviated with the progressive improvement of
teachers' qualifications and the on-going adjustment of the teaching method
3/   The capacity of the ENI is 120 student places.  Therefore, the output
of the two-year program could theoretically be 60 new teachers.
However, it is more realistic to distribute the enrollment over 65 in
the first year of training and 55 in the second year, for an output of
50 to 55 new teachers annually, for the few years to come.



-6-
and course content to the specific linguistic situation in Djibouti (para.
2.10). These would be carefully monitored by the educational evaluation
specialist to be provided under the proposed project (para. 4.06).
(c) Malnutrition. This severe, widespread problem, together
with low health levels(para. 1.03), adversely affects primary students'
performance. The proposed project would help alleviate this issue through
the expansion of the infrastructure required in primary schools to deliver
food programs for children (para. 4.01).
2.07      Recent progress has greatly alleviated the former imbalance in
basic education opportunities between the various areas within
Djibouti-City, and between the Capital area and the interior districts
(para. 2.10 i).4J However, within Djibouti-City, a number of areas are
still underprYvi'.eged, such as Balbala and Gabode in which an estimated
30,000 and 20,000 people, respectively, live in extreme poverty, without
sufficient educational opportunities despite the critical social demand for
education. In the interior districts, primary enrollment ratios in a
number of areas are still well below the national average and a number of
villages are still deprived of adequate schooling facilities (Annex 1.
Table T-4). As for the interior district capitals, with particular regard
to Tadjourah, Dikhil and Ali Sabieh, although enrollment ratios are closer
to, or above the national average, this is generally due to a high
proportion of double-shifting classes with subsequent reduction of
instruction time. 5/ Also, girls are still at some disadvantage in rural
areas 6/ mainly because of the distance they have to walk from home to
school or because their nomad parents are reluctant to leave them far from
the family, when no boarding is available for them at the schools. The
proposed project would assist in alleviating the above imbalance in the
distribution of educational opportunities (para. 4.01) through the
provision of primary school facilities in the most underprivileged urban
(para. 4.03) and rural (para. 4.04) areas.
Management of Education
2.08      The Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sports (MNE) (Annex
1, C-3) has administrative, financial and academic control over primary,
secondary, higher and technical education and teacher training. Other
ministries, particularly those of Labor and Social Affairs, and Health and
national associations for youth, women and children, also provide
4/   The rural population represents about one-third of the total
population and 27% of primary students are enrolled in rural schools.

compared with 28 and 30, respectively, in full time classes.
6/   While girls represent 46% of primary enrollments ln the Capital area,
they represent 32% of these enrollments in rural areas.



-7-
non-formal programs to about 2,600 literacy students and semi-skilled
worker trainees. The staff of the MNE comprises 28 senior officers - of
whom 25 administrators and three high-caliber expatriate advisors - and 64
support and service staff members, of whom- 14 pedagogical advisors and
inspectors. The MNE operates smoothly as a traditional administration.
However, there is virtually no local expertise in educational planning,
programming and evaluation, and project designing-and implementation to (a)
establish an adequate balance between the various levels and types of
education and training (including nor-formal types), commensurate with the
country's social and manpower needs, development potential and financial
constraints; (b) regulate the flow of students within the education and
training system; (c) monitor and assess the on-going quality and efficiency
improvement process and cost saving measures; (d) coordinate Government
agencies involved in education and training; and (e) channel and control
the substantial foreign aid to education (para. 2.13). This issue would be
addressed by the proposed project which would provide educational planning
and evaluation services (paras. 4.05 and 4.06).
Assessment of Government Policy and Objectives
2.09      The Government is aware that the output and quality of the
education system should be improved and better adjusted to local needs and
constraints. Its-educational policy comprises (a) the continuous equitable
expansion and improvement of formal primary education, and non-formal
development-oriented functional literacy and socio-cultural programs for
out-of-school youths and adults, over interior districts as well as in
DJibouti-City; (b) improvement and moderate expansion of formal secondary
education with greater emphiasis placed on technical programs; (c)
improvement of the efficiency of the formal vocational training system for
middle level skilled staff; (d) selection of students for higher education
fellowships abroad on the basis of manpower needs; and (e) establishment of
no=-formal programs providing life-time educational and vocational
upgrading opportunities at all levels of skills and for unskilled
personnel.
2.10      Although no educational development master plan exists, and
priorities and precise ways and means to resolve major issues are still
unclear, the Government has been implementing measures to improve the
quality, and internal and external efficiency of the system, and to expand
it equitably. They include:
(a) Adjusting teaching programs for French, and social and
environmental sciences to local features and requirements.7/
7/   The French teaching method, originally developed for Senegal, is being
adjusted to the linguistic characteristics of local languages in
Djibouti (para. 2.06b). The revised Grade 1 program and related
teachers'guide have just been completed. Teachers'guides on the flora
and fauna ia Djibouti for primary and secondary education and
textbooks on local geography for Grades 5 and 6 are under
preparation. A study of Djibouti history is also underway.



- 8-
(b) Implementing a practically-oriented in-service teacher
upgrading program and reinforcing French and teaching practice in the ENI
pre-service teacher traiuing programs (para. 2.06).81 This, together with
the tight selection at admission, has already improved the quality and
commitment of national teachers, whose proportion among the teaching staff
has increased from 52% to 72X during the 1980-1984 period (Annex 1, Table
T-5).9/ It has also alleviated the issue of undergualified teachers
(-suppleants  and teachers of Arabic) -  whose proportion has been
stabilized at about 30Z of the staff -  through (i) continuous practical
field support; (ii) increasingly selective recruitment of -suppleants
among senior secondary leavers and (iii) tight annual screening for their
contract renewal. This results, after two to three years, in a substantial
number of originally unqualified- teachers becoming qualified through
ow-the-job experience and motivation. In 1983/84, out of 128 'suppleants-
(excluding the 29 teachers of Arabic) in primary schools, an estimated 60
could be considered qualified.  In addition, 11 -suppleants were selected
in 1983 to be admitted to the ENI for regular training. The above policy
is reasonable, as 'suppleants will continue to be necessary in the
forseeable future to constitute a permanently available supply of
least-cost replacements for absent qualified teachers, or as stop-gaps
while the ENI and external assistance cannot provide all the qualified
teachers required.
8/   The ENI teacher training programs include micro-teaching sessions in
teaching laboratory, trial teaching exercises in selected schools and
30 days of regular teaching per year under the guidance of the most
qualified and experienced primary teachers. Also, during their first
years following graduation, new teachers are followed up by the most
experienced teachers in their schools. As for underqualified
suppleants", the regular continuous upgrading program includes four
hours of training per week by highly qualified pedagogical advisors.
Each advisor is responsible for 7 to 8 -supplTants- in Djibouti-City
and 4 to 5 in rural areas on a weekly basis. This program takes
advantage of double-shifting which reduces the teachers' teaching work
load by 4 hours per week.
9/   Caution should be exercised in the future in relation to further
Djiboutization of primary teachers as it could result above all in an
unbearable financial burden (para 2.16) and also be detrimental to the
teaching of French. The best French primary teachers are assigned to
the first two grades, as the quality of the introduction to French is
decisive for the students' future mastery of the language.



- 9 -
(c) Enforcing strict regulations limiting repetition, and fixing
age limits for admission to grade 1 and to prepare formal examinations
within schools, in order to improve the students' flow. 10/
(d) Making the best use of educational facilities, expanding
double-shifting in grades in which the consequent reduction of instruction
time (para. 2.07) is less detrimental to the students' knowledge
acquisition process. 1l/
(e) Making textbooks and teachers' guides available to all
students and teachers.
(f) Introducing tertiary sector-oriented programs in senior
secondary education (management, administrative and secretarial skills and
accountancy) which are in high demand, while phasing out industrial
training programs which are irrelevant to the local labor market.
Cg) Increasing the student:teacher ratio in senior secondary
education (from 14:1 -n 1982/83 to 18:1 in 1983/84) to make better use of
lImited facilities at the Lycee (para. 2.04).
(h) Substantially expanding public educational opportunities
throughout the country with primary and junior secondary enrollments, in
particular, increasing respectively from about 8,500 to 20,100 (Annex 1,
T-6) and from 2,000 to 5,600 between 1975/76 and 1983/84, representing
annual increases of over 11% and 13%. This has increased girls'
participation to 42% and 36% of the primary and secondary enrollments,
respectively, which is high in the local context (Annex 1, T-7). Moreover,
a better balance in educational opportunities has been established
(i) within Djibouti-City, through the provision of new school facilities in
the poorer overcrowded areas (resulting in an acceptable overall 48:1
student:class ratio) and through balancing the proportion of qualified
10/ Only one repetition per grade is allowed and no mDre than 10% of each
grade enrollment (except for Grade 6 preparing for the CEP) can be
repeaters. The CPE can be prepared at any age but only one repetition
in schools is allowed. The age-limits to prepare examinations for
admission to general and technical secondary education are 13 years
and 14 years, respectively.
11/ Double shifting is not applied to either Grade 1 because introduction
of French requires full-time intensive practice, or Grade 6 in which
the preparation of the CEP also requires full-time courses.



- 10 -
teachers (70Z) in all areas; and (ii) between the capital and rural areas
where three-classroom schools (each classroom being used by two grades at
the same time to provide the six years of primary schooling) has raised the
utilization rate of schooling facilities. Accommodations for teachers and
students have also improved access to education for isolated populations,
and for girls in particular (para. 2.07).
(i) Expanding students' feeding programs provided by the World
Food Program and other aid agencies to alleviate the malnutrition problem
(para. 2.06c).
2.11      Despite the above efforts, of an estimated 140,000 5-20 year
olds, only about 33,000 (24Z) are enrolled in public and private (formal
and non-formal) schools (Annex 1, T-8). This is inconsistent with the
stated policy to provide massive basic education. Only about 1,500
students are enrolled in low-cost non-formal literacy courses which remain
marginal despite their efficiency. This results from the government not
being aware yet of the benefits of, and requisites for, non-formal
education. Assessing the cost-efficiency of on-going non-formal programs
and exploring their possible expansion would be one of the assignments of
the proposed project educational evaluation specialist (para. 4.06).
2.12      For the decade to come, pending in-depth educational planning,
the Government's target for primary education is to reach a 60% admission
ratio for 6-year olds in Grade 1 and to enroll about 50% of the 6-11 age
group in primary schools. This would result in about 36,000 primary
enrollments in public schools (and about 2,000 in private schools) in
1992/93 when the proposed project schools are expected to be in full
operation. This expansion would be compatible with the expected output of
the ENI and the policy to reduce the proportion of underqualified teachers,
which would stabilize at an acceptable 17% instead of the present 33%
(Annex 1, Table T-9). This expansion would enable the Government (a) to
establish an adequate number of schools in interior villages to induce some
nomad populations to settle, while preserving their pastoral activities
needed by the nation, (b) to expand education in district capitals to slow
down the drain towards Djibouti-City, and (c) to defuse the explosive
demand for education in critical areas of the Capital. In addition, the
Government intends (a) to expand junior secondary education slightly,
through the establishment of a 1200-student place CES, to alleviate social
pressure for secondary education in the Capital; and (b) to establish a new
technical secondary school (LEP) of a 900-student place capacity with a
view to improving middle-level skill training and converting the existing
LEP into additional facilities for the senior secondary Lycee to meet the
estimated needs for tertiary sector staff training.  However, because of
the high cost of education in Djibouti (para. 2.19), the Government will
have to choose between either concentrating on primary targets exclusively,
or expanding junior secondary and technical education and limiting



- 11 -
expansion of primary education to the proposed IDA- and Saudi Development
Fund (SDF)-financed projects (para. 2.13). These would increase public
primary enrollments to only about 25,000 in 1992/93, simply keeping pace
with the demographic increase of the age-group and maintaining the
enrollment ratio at about 40Z. Educational planning services, to be
provided under the proposed First Education Project, would help resolve
this issue.
External Assistance to the Education Sector
2.13      Extensive foreign aid has provided a high share of capital
investment in education since independence in 1977 (para. 2.22). France,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have so far fitnanced the
construction of the Primary Teacher Training Institute, 93 primary
classrooms and five junior secondary schools for a total of US $ 9.8
million. The total education program to be financed by Saudi Arabia under
a 1979 grant amounts to US $ 14.0 million and over half of total French
assistance (estimated at about US $ 55.0 million annually) goes to
education and training (para. 2.16). Together with the Arab League, they
have also provided or financed teaching, supervisory and administrative
staff. Fellowships abroad have been provided by France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Canada, Tunisia, Morocco and rhe EEC. UNICEF has
actively supported literacy and non-formal vocational and health training.
USAID has financed commercial training facilities and has provided training
specialists' services and fellowships. In addition, the Arab Labor
Organization has agreed to finance equipment and technical assistance for a
new vocational training center and, during the November 1983 donors'
conference, the African Development Fund (AfDF) confirmed its planned
financing of a new technical secondary school; Kuwait pledged to assist
with the construction of a new junior secondary school (CES); USAID
indicated its willingness to co-finance vocational education, and Saudi
Arabia proposed its contribution to expanding primary education through a
project estimated at about US$4.7 million (as appraised by the Bank
Group). This project could include construction and equipping of three
12-classroom primary schools, one each in three interior district capitals,
namely Ali Sabieh, Dikhil and Tadjourah (para. 3.02).
Education Finance
2.14      Recurrent expenditures on education in Djibouti have two main
sources of financing: (a) Government budgetary allocations and (b) external
assistance, through the provision of teachers, educational materials and
food. Even government recurrent budgetary resources contain an element of
external grant aid. Public education is free and private education which
represenLs only about 9% of overall enrollments is heavily subsidized



- 12 -
through about 8Z of Government recurrent expenditures on education.12/
As for investment expenditures on education, the bulk of their financing
originates in external resources provided by multi- and bilateral agencies
(para 2.13). The Government's participation in the investment effort has
usually consisted of limited expansions (including teachers' housing) or
improvements to structures otherwise externally financed.
2.15      Between 1979 and 1982 13/ Government recurrent expenditures in
education grew at an average of 3.4% per year in real terms, i.e.
substantially slower than total enrollments which increased by over 10%
p.a. during the period. This was made possible, despite a relative decline
in expatriate staff (paid by donors), by holding nominal wage rates
constant and moderately increasing student:teacher ratios. These recurrent
expenditures accounted on average for about 12% of the Government's
recurrent budget and 3% of GNP. In the 1983 and 1984 budgets, percentages
similar to preceding years have been allocated to the sector.
2.16      The above figures greatly understate the importance assigned by
the Government to the education sector inasmuch as they exclude the bulk of
the expenditures related to technical assistance financed by donors, while
over 50% of expatriate aid personnel is attached to education (in 1982, of
about 700 expatriate aid personnel in the public sector, 380 were
teachers). Although it is not possible to estimate the expenditures
incurred by donors in the provision of aid personnel, if these staff were
paid by the Government according to the local salary scale, the education
budget would have to be increased by 20 to 25%, which would be far beyond
the Government's financial capacity.
2.17      Within the education budget and as it is shown in the table
below, significant changes have taken place in the distribution of
resources by budgetary item, with the MNE and other ministries increasing
their shares in the total, mainly at the expense of subsidies. This
reflects the Government's priority goal for the expansion of public general
education, which is the responsibility of the MNE, and adult vocational
training provided by the Centre de Formation Professionnelle des Adultes
(CFPA), under the authority of the Ministry of Labor, the main component of
educational activities under other ministries.
12/  Aided private education (para 2.03) enrolls 2,510 students in 1983/84
out of a total of 28,236 in primary and secondary education. Private
primary enrollments have not increased over the years (Annex 1, T-10
and T-11). Private secondary enrollments have increased but remain
small in absolute numbers (Annex 1, T-8).

2.18      Within the recurrent budget of the MNE, the table below also
shows that the share of secondary education has increased very rapidly
mainly at the expense of primary education. While enrollments in secondary
education have increased only slightly faster than those in primary
education (para. 2.10 i), the increase in the number of teachers fully paid
by the Government has been substantially more rapid than at the primary
level - in school year 1983/84, the number of Government-paid teachers at
the secondary level was 3.5 times the number in school year 1979/80, while
at the primary level it was only 95% higher.

2.19      Although the salary (excluding housing allowances) of over a
quarter of primary teachers is borne by external donors (France and the
Arab League), the unit cost to the Government per primary student,
estimated at about US$ 320 equivalent for 1983/84, is high as compared with
that in other Eastern African countries.14/ At the secondary level
(including technical education) where the salary of only about 26% of the
teachers is paid by the Government, the unit cost estimated at US$ 630 is
within the range for Eastern African countries.15/
2.20      The high unit cost for primary education can be attributed to
high salary levels prevailing in the country. In a country where virtually
all consumer goods are imported, the cost of living is closer to that of
the neighboring Arab world than to that of African countries. Furthermore,
the shortage of educated manpower (para. 1.06) makes even the less
qualified teachers part of the small privileged group who have had access
to secondary education. Also the number of expatriate teachers in the
system, who are paid salaries within European scales, tends to raise the
level of local salaries. However, in a comparison with salaries in the
Yemen Arab Republic, which has similar per capita income and other common
socio-political characteristics, teachers' salaries in Djibouti are
substantially lower. For example, the salary of a Yemeni primary teacher
with minimal qualifications in his first year of service would be about
US$ 8,000 equivalent while the corresponding salary for a Djiboutian
teacher would be only about US$ 5,500 equivalent.
2.21      The Government is aware that if education costs are not
constrained, its enrollment targets (para. 2.12) cannot be met. A number
of cost-saving measures conducive to this containment are being considered
as follows: (a) to continue to hold nominal wage rates constant, which
Djiboutian teachers may be inclined to accept when they consider that their
French colleagues have lost 30% to 40% of their purchasing power in the
past three years due to exchange rate fluctuations; (b) to increase the
average student:teacher ratio progressively from the present 40:1 161 to
45:1; (c) to eliminate or at least limit cash scholarships provided to
secondary students, which account on average for about US $ 160 equivalent
of the cost per student at this level (para. 2.06); (d) to request parents'
financial contribution for the provision of textbooks and other school
materials; and (e) to obtain community participation for the maintenance of
schools.

2.22.     Since independence Djibouti has made a substantial investment
effort in school construction estimated at about US$ 17 million in the
period 1977 through 1983. As shown in the table below over one-half of
these expenditures were made in support of primary education, slightly over
one-fourth in support of secondary education including the LEP, and 15Z in
support of adult vocational training. Over two-thirds of these
expenditures were financed from external resources.

Although the above figures indicate a strong financial effort for the
country, because of the high cost of construction (para. 5.02), they
represent a relatively limited contribution in physical terms as compared
with the most urgent educational needs.
2.23      As for the new investment projects for which external financing
has tentatively been identified (para. 2.13), because of constraints in the
recurrent budget, the enrollment increases that these projects would entail
are the utmost expansion in the formal education system (in addition to the
proposed First Education Project) that could take place until the beginning
of the next decade (para 2.12).



- 16 -
Summary
2.24      The major issues in the education sector have been: (a) low
enrollment ratios, particularly in primary education, due to the high
demographic increase and the unusually high cost of education; (b) low
output of the education system, reflected in low pass rates, particularly
at the primary and junior secondary school leaving certificates, due to
teachers' insufficient qualifications, difficulties in introducing French
as the language of instruction in primary education, and malnutrition; (c)
insufficient or nonr-existent basic education opportunities in
underprivileged urban areas, interior villages and interior district
capitals; and (d) nonr-existent educational planning and evaluation capacity
to implement a balanced development of education under unusual financial
constraints, and monitor the efficiency and quality of education.
2.25      To alleviate the above problems, the Government has engaged on a
broad policy to adjust the education system to local needs and
constraints. This policy, which is in line with the Bank Group's,
concentrates on (a) improving efficiency and quality at all levels; (b)
continuous equitable expansion of basic education as much as financially
feasible; and (c) moderate expansion of secondary education, with emphasis
on technical/vocational programs, to train the high- and middle-level
manpower required for productive operation of the modern sector, with
particular regard to tertiary sector activities.
2.26      The above policy is being implemented through the following
onr-going concrete measures: (a) practically-oriented improvement in teacher
training and permanent upgrading of underqualified teachers; (b) adjustment
of teaching programs in major subjects, particularly French, to local
cultural and physical environment; (c) introduction of internal
efficiency-oriented regulations limiting repetition and implementing
double-shifting in a manner compatible with the quality of education; (d)
substantial distribution of teaching/learning aids; (e) decisions Improving
the external efficiency and relevance of secondary and technical/vocational
education; and (f) substantial expansion of educational opportunities (11%
and 13% p.a. in primary and secondary enrollments, respectively, since
independence), with equitable distribution of physical facilities and
qualified teachers, to the extent possible, over well-off and poor urban
areas, and between Djibouti-City and rural areas.
2.27      This has been made possible only through massive external aid,
including direct budgetary support, representing over two-thirds of capital
investments and about 25% of teachers' costs. Without this extensive aid
in finance and staff, the education system could not continue its
expansion. After progressing at an average 3.4% p.a. over recent years,
recurrent expenditures on education (excluding external aid) represent 12Z
of the total. Government recurrent expenditures and 3% of GNP. This results
from the unusually high costs of education due to high salaries in line
with the extremely high cost of living. The success of the o0-going
attempts at reducing these high costs and the availability of external



- 17 -
financial and technical assistance will be capital factors for the
Government to further develop the education system, with a view to
providing basic education (formal primary and non-formal literacy programs)
to the majority of the population, and secondary/vocational education to
the few required to operate the modern sector, which is the only
contributcr to foreign currency earnings.
III. BANK GROUP STRATEGY IN EDUCATION
3.01      The dialogue with the Government on the development of the
education sector and related policies, established during the early
reconnaissance missions, has been advantageous for project preparation.
This dialogue should be maintained, possibly supported by specific sector
work, with a view to furthering the efforts already initiated towards a
more efficient and economical system. Therefore, discussions with the
Government should be continued on the following major issues: financial
resources allocated to education, balance between levels and types of
education; formal versus non-formal basic education and training, teacher
training and upgrading, double shifting, cost reduction and recovery,
interministerial cooperation, coordination of external aid, population
education (para. 4.08) and cooperation with private education agencies.
3.02      Coordination with other Donors.  Other donors, notably those
indicated in paragraph 2.13, are likely to continue to provide assistance
to education. The proposed Saudi Development Fund (SDF)-financed project,
in particular, would be complementary to the proposed First Education
Project. Both projects would be complementary and would be implemented
according to similar construction and education standards. However, each
project would be justified on its own merits and could be implemented
independently. Coordination between the SDF and the Bank Group has already
been initiated and is expected to continue during the implementation of the
two projects. Close cooperation is also expected to be maintained with
French authorities which will continue to provide technical assistance,
inter alia, vital to the First Education Project.
3.03      In project terms, developing a national capacity for educational
planning is a priority to enable MEN management to handle the severe
financial constraints, the diversified demand and needs for education and
the numerous sources of aid. It is also an urgent necessity to improve the
efficiency and quality of what the Government can afford to implement.
This requires the establishment of an educational evaluation mechanism
which is still non-existent (para. 2.08).
3.04      From a global manpower development viewpoint, (a) the
overwhelming majority of the population will continue to live at
subsistence levels from non-formal sector incomes, in the foreseeable
future; (b) economic development and employment in Djibouti are likely to
rest overwhelmingly upon the expansion of the tertiary sector and the



- 18 -
possible future export of skills, requiring substantial development of a
high quality secondary education and training LI/ so that the output of
the system perform efficiently within the country and be competltive on
external labor markets (this requirement will be jeopardized as long as
primary education feeds secondary education with insufficiently qualified
graduates); and (c) there is already an acceptable general and technical
secondary education capacity able to train the most urgently needed
middle-level manpower. Therefore, in a first stage, basic education should
be expanded to Improve the overall productivity and livlng conditlons of
the population, according to universal wisdom, particularly in overcrowded
urban areas and subsistence rural areas, and to build up an adequate base
of educated population in the country. Priority should be given to formal
primary education as the whole education and training superstructure
depends on its output and quality. However, as formal primary education
cannot be universalized in the foreseeable future on the basis of the
present high unit costs, the Government should be sensitized in the course
of this first Bank Group intervention, to the needs for complementary
low-cost non-formal literacy and basic skill tralning programs (para. 2.11)
to address the basic educational needs of massive segments of the
population which cannot be served by the formal system.
3.05      In a second stage, further expansion of primary education, as
financlally feasLble, expansion of non-formal literacy and basic skill
training (para. 3.04), and/or improvement and expansion of secondary
technical educatlon and vocational training and upgrading could be
envisaged. Assistance to technical education to obtaln the highest returns
from the narrow modern sector in Djibouti and possibly export skilled
labor, is a second priorlty presently, as other donors' contributions to
this sub-sector, which is already productive, are expected in the years to
come (para. 2.13).
IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Composition
4.01      The proposed project would assist in (a) expanding and improving
primary education in underprivileged areas; (b) improving the management of
the education system through educational planning, and (c) monitoring and
assessing the ongoing cost-efficiency and quality improvement process.
Therefore, the project would establish new primary education facilities in
urban areas, where the social demand for such education is strong and
educational facilities are insufficient, and in rural areas, where it will

limited number of students at negligible cost to the country.



- 19 -
help to make populations more receptive to innovation, improve their living
conditions and increase their participation in the development process,
including the construction and maintenance of their own schools. It will
also contribute to further improving the balance between the enrollment
ratios in Djibouti-City and in the interior districts (Annex 1, T-4), and
to providing girls, particularly in rural areas, with greater opportunities
for education (para 2.07). The proposed project would provide 2,350 new
student places, of which 2,150 would be additional and 200 would replace
inadequate existing facilities (Annex 1, T-13)18/
4.02      Technical assistance in educational planning and evaluation would
also be financed by IDA under the Technical Assistance Project (Credit
1232-DJ). In a poor country, highly dependent on external aid, in which
education is unusually costly, and where the modern sector is narrow and
unemployment is widespread, educational planning would help establish the
most appropriate and affordable balance between basic education for the
-overwhelming majority of the population and costly training for the limited
number of skilled staff required by the modern sector. Educational
evaluation would assist in assessing and correcting, if required, the
educational policies aimed at making the system more effective with limited
resources.
Urban Primary Schools
4.03      The proposed project would provide for two new double-stream
schools (with 12 classrooms each and 50 student places per classroom).
These schools would be located in Djibouti-City, in the squatter settlement
of Balbala, where the Bank Group will initiate the implementation of an
urban development project in FY 85, and in the underprivileged area of
Gabode (para 2.07). Half of these 1,200 student places would be utilized
on a double-shift basis (para. 2.10 d), in view of the strong pressure for
education in the Capital area. Therefore, they would accommodate 1,800 new
primary students, representing over 12X of 1983/84 primary enrollments in
the Capital. The schools would also be utilized as community centers for
literacy and cultural activities through evening programs provided by
qualified teachers whose work load in primary classes is reduced by four
hours a week due to double-shifting of facilities. Staff housing would be
provided for the headmasters who would ensure the security of the schools.
In addition, the proposed SDF-financed project (para. 2.13) would add three
12-classroom schools, one each in Tadjourah, Ali Sabieh and Dikhil. This
would provide 1,800 student places accommodating 2,700 students (with
partial double-shifting). This would increase the 1983/84 enrollments in
the interior districts by about 46%. Together with the existing
facilities, this would enable the Government to cope with the demand for
educatioa in the district capitals by 1992/1993 when the schools are
expected to be fully operational. However, caution is recommended in
18/ An additional 1,800 student places would be provided by the proposed
SDF-financed project (para. 2.13).



- 20 -
relation to the extent of the expansion needed in district capitals, as
population figures cannot be assessed accurately; enrollment ratios are
already relatively high in Ali Sabieh (62%) and Tadjourah (43%); and
existing facilities could be further double-shifted, if need be,
particularly in Dikhil.
Rural Primary Schools
4.04      The proposed project would also provide for new or extended
facilities for eight rural schools, including staff housing units for 20
teachers and students' accommodation for about half of the enrollments.
These schools would be located in villages where schooling facilities are
insufficient or non-existent although the regional catchment area ensures
permanent full enrollment. This component would include four new schools
(Bondara, Kontali, Khor Angar and Ardo Bankouale), and extension and
equipping of four existing schools (Dammerjog, Ali Adde, Mouloud and
Dorra). A total of 23 new classrooms, of which four would replace
inadequate existing facilities and 19 would be additional, would include
1,150 student places of which 950 would be additional and 200 would be
replacements. With partial double shifting, this could accommodate 1,300
students of whom 1,000 would be new, representing an increase of 17% over
1983/84 primary enrollments in the interior. The schools would also be
utilized as community centers for cultural activities and literacy. Thus,
this component would assist the Government in carrying out one of its
priorities, namely to expand educational opportunities equitably and
increase the literacy rate of adult populations, particularly in
underprivileged rural areas. Staff housing would be an incentive for
teachers' commitment, and students' boarding and food programs are a sine
qua non for nomad parents to send their children to school, girls in
particular (para. 2.07). Boarding facilities provided under the project
would be based on most simple and economical standards. The Government has
given assurances that it would take all appropriate steps to provide the
project schools with a timely and adequate supply of goods and services,
particularly food programs, to ensure adequate living conditions for staff
and students in rural areas (para.8.01 a i).
Technical Assistance
4.05      In view of the high quality of the technical assistance provided
by France, only a small technical assistance component would be financed by
IDA (para. 4.02), namely three man-years of specialists' services, in
educational planning (two) and evaluation (one), and two man-years of
fellowships to upgrade the specialists' counterparts. The educational
planner, with a background in economics, would assist in developing a
master plan for the expansion and improvement of education and training,
including a country-wide school mapping exercise (para. 2.10). Within this
general framework, the planner's major assignments would be to assist in
(a) seeing that foreign aid is consistent with the Government's policy and
priorities (para. 2.04); (b) ensuring that the geographic distribution of



- 21 -
schools is consistent with catchment areas (para. 2.05); and (c)
implementing a balanced development of the various types and levels of
formal and non-formal education and training, consistent with the country's
financial constraints, social demand for education and manpower needs
(paras. 2.11 and 2.12). The Government has provided an assurance that the
results and recommendations of the master plan and school mapping exercise
would be submitted to the Association for review and comment by December
31, 1986 and that these recommendations would be promptly implemented,
taking into account the Association's comments (para.8.01 a ii).
4.06      The educational evaluation specialist, with some background in
linguistics, would assist in establishing an evaluation mechanism focussing
on the on-going efforts to improve the efficiency and quality of education
(para. 2.10), with particular regard to (a) teachers' recruitment, training
and upgrading processes, qualifications and commitment (para. 2.06 a); (b)
the adjustment of curricula and teaching methods in major subjects to local
Features and needs, with strong emphasis on French as language of
instruction and culture (para. 2.06 h); (c) primary and junior secondary
examination processes and test scores in relation to curricula and
teachers' qualifications (para. 2.05); (d) repetition and double shifting
in relation to test-scores; and (e) the inputs and output of non-formal
literacy and basic skill training programs (para. 2.11). The Government
has confirmed that this specialist would be placed under the direct
authority of the Minister of Education as his advisor (para.8.01 b i).
4.07      One man-year of fellowship would be provided to each of the two
above specialists' national counterparts. These counterparts are already
involved within the Direction Generale de l'Education Nationale, or DGEN
(Annex 1, C-3), in activities related to education development programming,
including school mapping surveys; monitoring of repetition, double
shifting, curricula, teaching/learning aids, teachers' work loads and
qualifications, and class sizes; and examinations and test scores. The
fellowships abroad would complement the upgrading of the national
counterparts by the technical assistance specialists in Djibouti. The
beneficiaries of fellowships would be selected and their training programs
would be established in consultation with the Bank Group.
Female Participation in the Project and Education Sector
4.08      Of project school enrollments, over 45% in Djibouti-City and
about one third in rural areas are expected to be girls. This would be
consistent with the national averages of female enrollment (Annex 1, T-7
and T-11), which are high in the local context (Para. 2.10 i), although
girls are still at some disadvantage in rural areas (para. 2.07). A
possible long-term consequence of expanding basic education, benefiting
girls in particular, through the proposed project schools, would be to
assist in reducing population growth, as studies indicate that the
fertility rate starts decreasing with the second generation of educated
women. About 34% of primary teachers and headmasters are women. The
proportion of female staff is higher in Djibouti-City (38%) than in the
interior (26%) and female staff in the interior is almost exclusively
concentrated in district capitals. At the ENI, over one third of teacher
trainees are girls, which is also consistent with the national average.

V. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
Project Cost
5.01      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 7.4 million
equivalent including duties and taxes estimated at US$0.7 million. The
estimated costs and foreign exchange component by project item and by type
of expenditure are given in Annex 1, T-14 and T-15, respectively, and are

- 23 -
5.02      Cost estimates for civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles
were reviewed in consultation with the staff of MNE and the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW).  They reflect the provision of only essential furniture
and equipment and the slmplification of established standard school
building designs and construction techniques. They have been derived from
cost data on similar items in recently completed primary education projects
in Djibouti. For construction, recent trends in the construction industry
confirmed by the MPW have been taken into consideration. For furniture and
equipment, the estimates are based on the experience of the MNE . As for
technical assistance, the estimates reflect information provided by
multilateral and bilateral agencies involved in assistance to Djibouti and
Bank Group experience. Area allocation per student place is economical,
namely about 1.2 sq.m. for classrooms. Utilization rates of facilities
would be close to 100%. About half of the classrooms are expected to be
used in two shifts. The unit cost of construction per sq.. is estimated at
about US$600.  This is high, as compared with costs in neighboring African
countries, e.g. US$ 150 in Ethiopia and US$ 250 in Somalia. However, the
costs in neighboring Arab countries such as the Yemen Arab Republic, the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and Oman reach US$400 to US$500.
High unit costs are reflected in the cost per student place, namely US$
1,470 for civil -works alone. The main causes of high building cost are
substantial labor cost and limited competition.  Although labor
productivity is low, labor wages, due to the extremely high cost of living,
are about US$250 per month for unskilled labor, US$500 for semi-skilled,
and US$850 for skilled workers.19/ However, wages in the Yemen Arab
Republic are US$850 per month for semi-skilled and US$1,250 for skilled
construction -labor, while unskilled labor is paid US400 per month.
Furniture and equipment costs are appropriate- about US$80 per student
place. The costs of technical assistance, to be financed under Credit
123Z-DJ (para. 4.02), are based on U.N. rates. The cost for specialists
include travel and housing allowances. The cost for fellowships include
cost of travel, tuition and subsistence.
5.03      Duties and Taxes. All items specifically imported for the
project would be exempt from customs duties and taxes in accordance with
the normal practice of the Government. It is expected that a substantial
share of the building materials to be used in the construction of project
institutions and some furniture of foreign origin would be acquired on the
local market. The total tax component including import duties and fuel
taxes, is estimated at about US$ 0.7 million equivalent.
19/ The figures for Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia are 50 to 75% lower.



- 24 -
5.04      Contingency Allowances.  For physical contingencies, 10% has been
added to the base costs. Estimated price increases from the base cost date
(October 1, 1984) have been applied in accordance with the implementation
schedule (Annex 1, C-4) at the following annual rates:
1984     1985     1986    1987    1988
Local/Foreign   3.5%      8.0%     9.0%    9.0%    9.0%
Local and foreign inflation rates are assumed to be similar due to the
almost complete dependence of the country on imported goods.  Estimated
price increases have been reviewed by Bank Group staff and have been found
satisfactory. Total price increases are estimated at 15% of the base cost
plus physical contingencies.
5.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  This component has been calculated
as follows: (a) construction and site development, 40%; (b) furniture,
95%; (c) equipment and vehicles, 100%; (d) professional services, 50%; and
(e) project management operation, 50%. Including contingencies, the
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$3.2 million or 43% of the
total project cost. Although all building materials, except for sand and
gravel, are imported, the foreign exchange component for civil works and
professional services is low as compared to those in other Eastern African
countries because of the relatively high cost of local labor (para. 5.02).
Financing Plan
5.06      The financing plan provides for IDA assistance of US$5.0 million
equivalent (75% of total project cost net of taxes), as follows:

of which taxes               0.69           -           0.69
In addition, US$0.5 million would be provided under the Technical
Assistance Project (Credit 1232-DJ) for the technical assistance component
(para. 4.05).



- 25 -
The IDA Credit would finance 100% of foreign expenditures (US$3.2 million)
and US$1.8 million equivalent of local costs. The Government contribution
would be US$2.4 million equivalent (including about US$0.7 million in
taxes) phased over a period of three and a half years with an average
contribution of about US$0.7 million equivalent in any one year. The
Ministry of Finance (MOF) has expressed its commitment to provide the
required Government counterpart funds for the Project because of the high
priority assigned by the Government to the expansion of primary education
within its development effort. Moreover, this proposed project, together
with the proposed SDF-financed project (para. 2.13), would constitute the
sole expected input to primary education development until the end of the
decade.
5.07      Assuming that total recurrent expenditures on education in the
coming years continue to grow in real terms at 3.4% per year (para. 2.15),
by 1992/93, when the proposed project schools would be in full operation,
the incremental recurrent costs generated by the project are estimated at
an annual US$900,000 equivalent and would account for about 6Z of total
recurrent expenditures on education, or about one fourth of the projected
increase in budgetary allocations to the sector between 1983/84 and
1992/93, based on the present salary structure and the prevailing shares of
the various types of expenditures, which are not expected to be
significantly changed.20/ This would leave the necessary margin for
covering recurrent expenditures that could be generated by other projected
new investments (para. 2.23).
VI. PROJECT INPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
Implementation
6.01      Schedule.  The project would be implemented over a period of
about four and a half years, including six months for completion of
payments and withdrawals (Annex 1, C-4). Project completion is expected by
December 31, 1988 with a Closing Date of June 30, 1989. The implementation
schedule is realistic; it is based upon experience derived from recently
completed Government programs and other primary education projects financed
by bilateral agencies, and takes into account the advanced stage of project
preparation. Existing standard school designs, equipment and furniture
lists, tender documents and construction specifications need only to be
adjusted to the proposed project, and sites have been selected (para.6.04).
20/ The proposed SDF project (para.2.13), combined with the IDA-financed
First Education Project, would raise incremental costs to about
US$1.7 million equivalent, i.e. about 11.5% of the NNE 1992/93
recurrent budget.



- 26 -
6.02      Administration.  No special new arrangements are required for the
implementation of the project since similar projects have been implemented
routinely and effectively earlier by the DGEN, with the established
assistance of the MPW and the MOF. A Project Task Force (PTF) within the
Directorate, to be in charge of project implementation, would comprise on a
part-time basis: The Director General as project director, assisted by his
expatriate technical advisor; the chief of administrative and financial
services, as deputy-director and procurement officer assisted by the MNE
Accountancy Section; the chief of the construction division of the MPW,
responsible for the design and execution of construction works, and the
director of finance of the MOF, responsible for the financial aspects of
the project. The latter would particularly focus on the coordination and
control of the aceounting operations of the DGEN and interior district
authorities, in charge of project implementation in Djibouti-City and in
the interior, respectively. The PTF would be responsible for the overall
planning, coordination and execution of the project, and liaison with the
Association. To warrant effective implementation of the project, the
existing expatriate technical advisors (Annex 1, C-3) would continue to
assist their ministerial counterparts, and therefore no technical
assistance is included in the project for project administration. Funds
have been included for some equipment, including a vehicle, internal
travels and other incremental operational costs of the PTF. The list and
responsibilities of DGEN, MPW and MOF staff constituting the FTF were
officially established by a decree of the President of the Republic, dated
June 7, 1984.
6.03      Professional Services.  Design and construction supervision for
all project institutions would be carried out by the MPW. The MPW would
handle all aspects of professional services with the possible exception of
some site supervision and topographical surveys which would be carried out
as needed, by consultants to be hired by the MPW on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Association. The DGEN has already completed substantial
project preparation work (para.6.01).
6.04      Site selection.  All sites have been selected with due
consideration to acceptable site selection criteria, namely: location of
schools in areas with primary enrollment ratios below the national average,
and strong social demand for education; no competition with existing
schools in the vicinity; availability of a sufficient number of prospective
entrants; local populations' and authorities' commitment; and availability
of water. These sites would be provided free of cost by Government.
Availability of all sites, acceptable to the Bank Group, has been confirmed
by the Government (para. 8.01 b ii).
6.05     Maintenance.  In general, school buildings are adequately
maintained, particularly those in Djibouti-City. About US$75,000 are
budgeted annually for the maintenance of school buildings. The Department
of Public Works carries out maintenance works and administers a part of the
maintenance budget. In addition, MNE provides preventive maintenance
through mobile units to primary schools in Djibouti-City. Interior
districts have their own maintenance budget and carry out maintenance in
rural areas, using their own departmental labor forces.



- 27 -
6.06      Environmental Impact. The project, which includes only simple
one-storey structures, is not likely to have any adverse effect on the
environment, as the schools would be built according to architectural
standards and features compatible with existing buildings in urban areas,
or the cultural and geographic environment in villages.
Procurement
6.07      Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below:

2/ Force account procedures (labor salaries).
Note: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts, including
contingencies, financed under the proposed Project. An additional
US$0.5 million, including contingencies, would finance technical assistance
(re. paras 4.05 and 5.06).
6.08      Contracts.   For civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles,
contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. However,
civil works for the eight rural schools, would be carried out by existing



- 28 -
district authorities utilizing departmental forces, following established
force account procedures acceptable to the Association. For the
construction of these schools, about USS 1.5 million of local construction
materials would be procured under LCB and USS 0.5 million of imported
construction materials under ICB. Those schools are small, comprising
three classrooms at the most, scattered over five interior districts where
the road network is poor. They are not expected to attract interest from
private contractors as Djibouti construction industry is concentrated in
Djibouti-City. Construction activity outside the capital (with the
exception of occasional major civil works in interior district capitals,
such as port construction in Obock), is limited to self-help construction
for the small private sector, and to construction work carried out by
district departmental forces for the public sector. However, building
materials estimated at US$ 1.5 million for construction under force account
procedures, would be procured through competitive bidding, advertised
locally, and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to the Bank
Group. Appendix I provides more information about the building industry in
Djibouti and more elaborated justification for proposed procurement
procedures for civil works. When ICB procedures are used, (a) a preference
of 7.5% would be applied to bids from qualified domestic civil works
contractors; and (b) domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment
would be allowed a margin of preference of 15%, or the existing applicable
rate of import duties. whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of
competing foreign suppliers.
6.09.    Local competitive bidding.  Contracts for furniture, equipment
and vehicles costing less than US$20,000 equivalent each would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance
with local procedures acceptable to the Association. The aggregate total
of such contracts is not expected to exceed US$70,000 equivalent.
6.10      Designs, Tender Documents and Equipment Lists.  Sketch designs,
draft tender documents and master lists of furniture, equipment and
vehicles, indicating proposed grouping and cost estimates, would be
reviewed by the Bank Group. Items would be grouped to the extent
practicable to encourage competitive bidding and to permit bulk
procurement. Review of tender evaluation documents prior to award would be
required only for contracts exceeding US$ 100,000 equivalent for civil
works, and USS 50,000 equivalent for furniture, equipment and vehicles.
6.11      Specialist and Consultant Services.  All specialists and
consultants would be hired under contracts on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank Group in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants (para.6.03).
Disbursement
6.12      Disbursement (Annex 1, T-16) would be made as follows;
(a) 85% of total expenditures for civil works, including
the transportation of personnel and the remuneration of
personnel especially employed for the project;



- 29 -
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
construction materials, furniture, equipment and vehicles,
or 85X of local expenditures if procured locally, including
transportation of such materials to school sites;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures or 80% of local expenditures for
professional services; and
(d) 80% of total expenditures for project administration,
excluding salaries.
6.13      All disbursements would be fully documented except for: (a) work
executed by the district departmental forces utilizing force account
methods, excluding materials procured under ICB or LCB; (b) eligible
operating expenses for project administration 21/; and (c) all local items
costing less than US$ 20,000 equivalent, for which disbursements would be
made against a statement of expenditure (SOE), to be signed by the Project
director, and, for force account operations, by interior district
authorities, which would submit an accounting report with supporting
documentation to the MOF through the Project director, on a quarterly
basis. The documentation of SOEs would not be submitted to the Association
for review but would be retained by the Borrower and made available for
inspection by the Association in the course of project supervision. No
country disbursement profile is yet available. The cumulative
disbursements of 100 percent at the June 30, 1988 Closing Date have been
estimated on the basis of the experience with previous construction
programs successfully implemented on a routine basis by the NNE and
district authorities; the advanced stage of project preparation (para.
6.01); and the systematically simple, straightforward nature of this
proposed first lending operation in the education sector in Djibouti.
6.14.     Special Account.  In order to ensure that funds for the project
would be made available when needed, a Special Account in US dollars
operated by the PT?, would be established at the National Treasury with an
initial deposit of about US$0.5 million (SDR 510,000)--to cover about three
months of expenditures-which would be withdrawn from the Credit account
after Credit effectiveness. The account would be replenished on the basis
of documentary evidence, to be provided to the Bank Group by the PTF, of
payments made from the account for goods and services required for the
project. The opening of an account into which the initial amount of the
Special Account would be deposited would be a condition of Credit
effectiveness (para.8.02).
6.15      No difficulty is anticipated in obtaining the required
counterpart funds within the national budget as from local FY 1985 (para.
5.06). All payments under the project and related budgets would be made by
the Treasurer upon presentation of invoices and SOEs certified by the
director of the PTF and interior district authorities, as required (para.
6.13). No exceptional provision needs to be established relating to local
21/ Mainly internal travel expenditures.



- 30 -
counterpart funds which will be disbursed directly from the funds earmarked
for the project at the National Treasury within the global budgetary
account, according to the standard Government procedures.
6.16      Retroactive Financing.  To ensure a prompt start-up of project
operations, expenditures on building design and site preparation, up to a
total of SDR 0.25 million (about US$0.25 million equivalent), incurred as
from July 1, 1984, would be financed retroactively (para.8.03).
Reporting and Evaluation
6.17      Semi-annual progress reports on implementation would be submitted
to the Bank Group by the PTF by each June 30 and December 31 following
Credit effectiveness. The format of the reports would be similar to those
routinely utilized for comparable education Bank Group projects. The
reports would briefly identify major problems, if any, and recommend
solutions; review the performance of implementing authorities and agencies;
and maintain performance key indicators in reaching project goals. In
addition, the Government would prepare and send to the Association for
comments within six months from the Closing Date, a completion report
assessing attainment of project objectives, project implementation and
initial operation, its cost and the benefits derived, the performance of
the Government, the Association and other agencies involved, and the
significant lessons learned.
Auditing
6.18      The PTF would maintain separate accounts for all project
activities in conformity with national accounting practices. These
accounts would be controlled according to normal Government financial
control procedures which are satisfactory. The PTF would prepare an annual
report summarizing the financial situation of all project operations, which
would be submitted to the Association. Auditing would be required on an
annual basis for all expenditures financed under the project with
particular attention to those reimbursed under SOEs (para.6.13). The audit
report would include a separate analysis of the use of IDA funds under the
Special Account (para.6.14). Auditing would be performed by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank Group, within six months following the end
of the Borrower's fiscal year.

VII. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
7.01      The proposed project would assist the Government in improving (a)
the delivery of primary education opportunities to the most underprivileged
segments of the population, which is a Government priority, and (b) the
efficiency and quality of education through better management of the
system, which is urgently required in view of unusual constraints.
7.02      The expansion of primary education facilities through the project
(paras. 4.03 and 4.04) would benefit 3,100 primary school-age children, of
whom 2,800 would be additional, when the schools are fully operational.
This would represent an increase of about 13Z over the 1983/84 total
primary enrollments in Djibouti.22/ The project schools would also serve
as literacy and community centerisfor adult populations to increase the
extremely low literacy rate and expand cultural activities under the MNE.
7.03      The project schools would also constitute a testing ground for
Ca) evaluating on-going attempts at Improving the efficiency and quality of
education (para. 2.06) and (b) reducing capital costs in education through
setting more economical construction standards. They would also contribute
to alleviating the malnutrition issue through the provision of additional
school infrastructure to expand the children's feeding programs (para. 2.06
c).
7.04      The technical assistance component (para. 4.05) would strengthen
key ministerial services, essential for improving the management of the
system and make the best use of available resources through careful
planning and assessment of educational performance.
Risks
7.05      With regard to the hardware, no major risks are anticipated as
the schools envisaged are already effectively and routinely constructed by
the MNE through contractors and interior district departmental forces.
7.06      As for the software, (a) the cultural traditions in remote rural
areas may result in enrollments, girls in particular, being somewhat below
expectations, as long as nomad parents are not fully accustomed to the new
schools. However, this calculated risk, which could affect only five
smaller schools, has been minimized by (i) MNE staff's and local community
leaders' careful survey of the demand for education in the catchment areas
concerned, (ii) the proposed adoption of the three-classroom school model
22/   The proposed SDF-financed project would benefit an additional
2,700 primary students (representing 12% of the 1983/84 total primary
enrollments). This, together with the proposed IDA-financed project,
would add a total of 5,500 primary students, i.e. 25% over and above
the present total primary enrollments.



- 32 -
(para. 2.10 i), utilized on a double-grade basis with only 25 students per
grade, already successfully implemented under similar circumstances, and
(iii) the provision of students' boarding and dining facilities, which
constitutes the major incentive for parents to send their children to
schools (para. 2.07); (b) the on-going food programs, and external
financial and technical assistance (para. 2.13) are likely to be
continued. The MNE gave assurances that the proposed project schools would
be included in these programs (para. 4.04); and (c) teachers' coxraitment
may be affected by the MNE policy intended to stabilize salaries. However,
this risk is minimized by the on-going careful teacher recruitment and
upgrading policy, the provision of staff accommodation, and the assurance
of a life-long decent salary, while job opportunities are getting limited
for general secondary leavers on the narrow modern labor market.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, the Government:
(a) gave assurances that: (i) it would take all appropriate steps
to provide the project schools with a timely and adequate supply of goods
and services, particularly food programs, to ensure adequate living
conditions for staff and students in rural areas (para. 4.04); and (ii) the
results and recommendations of a master plan for the development of the
education and training sector and a country-wide school mapping exercise,
would be submitted to the Association for its review and comment by
December 31, 1986, and these recommendations would be promptly implemented,
taking into account the Association's comments (para. 4.05); and
(b) confirmed that: (i) the educational planning and evaluation
specialists would be placed under the direct authority of the Minister of
Education as his advisors (para. 4.06); and (ii) all sites for project
institutions, acceptable to the Bank Group, are available (para. 6.04).
8.02      As a Condition of Credit effectiveness, the Government would open
an account into which the initial amount of the Special Account would We
deposited (para. 6.14).
8.03      Expenditures on building design and site preparation, up to a
total of SDR 0.25 million (about US$0.25 million equivalent), incurred as
from July 1, 1984, would be financed retroactively (para. 6.16).
8.04      Subject to the provisions in paras. 8.01 through 8.03 above, the
proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR
5.1 million (about US$5.0 million equivalent) to the Republic of Djibouti.

APPENDIX 1
Page X1oY L
DJIBOUTI
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION OF CIVIL WORKS
L.         The two eight-classroom schools in Djibouti-city would be built
under contract following ICB.  The nine small regional schools would be
built under force account procedures. This Annex explains in more detail
why above procurement procedures would be followed.
2. Djibouti building industry. Djibouti has about 250 construction firms,
of which only ten can carry out works over US$500,000. Five of these firms
were establtshed and are headed by foreigners. The total annual work
volume of the ten firms is about US$10,000,000. The remaining 240 firms
carry out also about US$ 10 million of construction work, some as general
contractor and others as specialized sub-contractor. Most of these
contractors are small, with a labor force of less than five and an annual
work volume of less than US$50,000 a year. Many small contractors have
liquidity problems and bankruptcies are frequent.
3.         For construction of the two urban schools estimated at about
US$ 0.8 million each, ouly about seven local firms qualify. To promote
competition, ICB is recommended. However, a bid package of about US$1.6
million is not expected to attract much interest from foreign contractors.
The latter are likely to prefer to compete for civil works contracts on the
other side of the Gulf of Aden. Compared to the building volume in these
countries (Saudi Arabia, North and South Yemen and the Gulf States),
construction of two urban schools in Djibouti is hardly significant.
4.         Construction packages for the eight small primary schools,
scattered over five rural districts and estimated at an average US$0.5
million each, are too big for the small contractors and too small for the
big contractors. Djiboutl construction industry is concentrated in
Djibouti-city. Construction activity outside the capital is limited to
self-help construction for the small private sector and to construction by
departmental forces under the authority of the interior district
administration, for the public sector. The existing district departmental
forces do construction work of acceptable quality, at a reasonable cost and
in a timely way (about six to nine months per school construction site).
5.         Force account procedures are well established for construction
work outside the capital. For the small and scattered construction sites,
contractors are unable to compete with the district departmental forces.
There are no economical reasons that would call for a departure from these
procedures. Therefore, in accordance with the Government's request, it is
recommended that the construction of the eight small schools be carried ouv
by the existing district departmental forces following established force
account procedures under which IDA would finance acquisition of building
materials and their inland transportation, the cost of casual-mostly
unskilled-labor, and transportation of labor to and from sites, including
minor subsistence expenditures.
