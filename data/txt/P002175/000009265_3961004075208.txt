twenty yers ncluding a five-ye  grace peiod, with LASG beaing
the fob n exchange risk.
Ihe primary objecOvc of the proposed project is to improve health
standards and lving conditions in areas of Lagos subject to reglar
flooding and to improve the economic fu ning of the city by
improving stormwate drainage in pdority areas of the city, and
Improving dran mantean  procedura. It would also support initial
steps in  ading other urban services by prepaing plans, feasbility
studies and designs for urban upgrading, and imprving human
_astowatK disposa, and would contie support to the Lagos State
Waste Mangemnt Authority for o tional and system
development. Physical components of the project include the
rehailitatio  readi, clearing and aligning of exist  stormwater
drains in three areas of the city.
andBRidm:    Major benefits of the project will Include the reduction of regu
flooding of dwellings, businesses, and twansport corIors, reduced
deteoration of roads, diminion of unsightly accumlations of
gaage in drains, and reduction in health hazards due to flooding by
sewage. About 1,300,000 people, may of them poor, live in the
atchmt   area under  tbn iabout 225,000 of these in areas
directly subject to flooding. A fiuther 1,400,000 people will bendefit
from reduced disrion to travel and commerce in the city during the
wet season  Risk inlude the possibility that countetpart funds will
not become avable as needed and ihat the State will fail to coninue
an adeque m     nce effort on its drinage system   hese wfll be
adresed by amangig for cwnterpt funds to be deducted at source
and by establishing proper   unce practes and a mecnmism to
ensre adequate flow of funds for maintenance.

supported a number of reorm  in economic and human resource development. It recognized
tat impving Ifastcur was cra to obWanng an adeque rponse   i the economy.
The SAP also endorsed a policy of making better use of te assets of the sector through
adoption of a          cm adtur    a mes to achieve the highest overall return
1.3   The fm of govwenmet in Nigeria Is a federaton comprising 30 states plus the
Federad Capital Terrty (PCI) of Abuja. Abuja forally became the country's capital In
December 1991, with tranr   of the PrMesdcy from LaOS. State Governts and Legislative
Couni and a Federad Legiur have bee recently democratally elected, and democratic

1.4 In 25 yoers, Lagos has grown from a city of 350,000 to a vast urban sprawl of 5.7
million people living on a poody draied plan, factors which have placed heavy demands on
administration,  eIascur and services. There hav beea substan   recent investments in
prmary networks such as highways and wae supply production faclities, but the
construcon of sondary nd teary inftcre to complete these has lagged behind
demand. To compound the proem, inadeqt mainenan  has caused exiting networks to
detiorate.  he ruk is thaLt poor drainage ces recut severe and cosdy flooding and
makes access and taffc circlation difficult; human waste disposal fcities are primitive,
and constiue a major heath hazrd, secodary and teriary roads are unpaved and inadequate
for the traffic volume; water supply is intermittent or non-existent in many areas; inadequate
telephone  es  increae itffic and fstiuon;  d power supply is unreliable. The worst
deciencies are in the most demny popuad areas where the lowest income groups live.
1.5   These deficiees sgficaty Impede productivity and result In serious reductions in
efficiency. In spite of this, Lagos has continued to attract sizeable idustra investments,
largely becase of its market poten, locaonal advantages, labor pool and service facilities.

in other urban cens and sy bigher ha in rura areas. The poverty threshold Is
also some 20% higher due to higher cost of livg In Lagos. Altbou  t    rtructur and

1.7   Federal, state and local govements share responsibility for the urb  areas. The
Federal Government is responsible for setig and coordinating overall urban development,
shelter and water resarces policy. It has aLso been responsible for the planning and
constructo of new towns developed in conjunction with major Federal i ments such as
steel, fertilizers and the new Federal capita, Abuja. Federal ministries and corporatons ae
also resoible for major tratpoat  links and aiities (roads, raiwas, ports. airports,
etc.) between and within major tDwns. Stae goverme  have pimary responsib   for
maaging the urbareas Including devdopment planning, land allocaton, land use control,
water supply, and tho provion of road and dige networ. Although        ly

1.8   Lagos State is governed by an elected  ssembly and Governor and is fimanced by
Feder grant and a mber of local taxes (paras. 3.4 - 3.5). Tbere are also fife  elected
Local Governmen Auhoitis (LGAs) resosible for loca services and financed by Federal

stormwatr drainage, sewera  and saniatin, solid wase disposal, water supply, and urban
planning and upgradig is The Envioment and Physical Pling Office (TEPO) of Lagos
State, under a Director General who reports to the Governor. In practice, water supply
responsibity has been delegated to the Lagos Stat. Water Cooraton (LSWC) and
responsibty for collection and dispos of solid wase to the Lagos State Waste Management
Author  (LAWMA), both of which operate on a semi commercial basis. An Ura Renew
Board (URB) has recently been created to accept reponsibility for the impi on of

1.10 Ihe Bank has helped financ two previous infrastructure projects in Lagos, tha Lagos
Solid Waste and S 30e Project (Lu 2620-UNI, approved Sepzmber 1985), and the
Lgos Water Supply Pojedct (La 2985-UNI, approved July 1988). Both are ongoing and no
Project Completion Report has yet been produced. The first helped finance the upgrading of
stormwater draie in pa  of lags maiand, and solid waste collection and disposal for
eentially the entire Lagos metropolitan area, including support for the establimnt of an
auonomoa rity (the LAWMA) and for introduction of revenue collection arrangements
induding the    *aon of all beeicaries in Lagos and the development of a billing and
colection system.   e prject also supported a revaluation of properties In he Stae and the
stablishment of new valuation lists. The project suffered serious procurement delays during
the early stages of its impletation but is now close to completion. Project accounting was
also inadequate during early stages of the project, but qualified accountnt were later
appointed. It has had a huge impact on cleaning up the previously ubiquitos piles of garbage
which blocked sntres and drainage channels in Lagos, and has significandy reduced flooding
In the areas served by the draae component. TMhe Lagos Wawt Supply Project has suffered
ma*jo dclays in pocurement of the larger contrats, however perfomance has now improved
considerably and a recent review indicates that most of the undisbwused loan funds (US$155
million) can be eXectd to be disbursed by lat in 1995. Two of four major contracts to be
fimaced by the Bank have been awarded, and the other two are in the tender evaluation stage.
Institionaly, the Lagos State Water Corporation is in a poor situation. While tariffs and
billings have been increased, revenue collection has lagged, due to poor management of this
fimction. Ihe prsen magaeme  of the Corporation, which has been in place since early
1992, has taken inficant steps in improvement, and has increased monthly revenue
generaion more than five fold, but development of full cost recovery is expected to take at
least a furter five years. Ihe most significant lessons learned from these projects concern the
need to give detailed aton to procurement planning and implemeion, and to ensure that
istitona development compone  are given adeqWe early atntion. The implementing
agency for the proposed projedt now has considerable experience with Bank procurement
requments, major procurement actions have been tied to project processing, and serious
delays are not anticipated with the proposed project. LASG has continued to employ a
compete  project accountant  ially recuited for the first project (para. 2.7). Other
Nigerian Ifasu         projects have suffered from lack of counterpart funds, and it is now
standard practice to re     that these funds be deducted by the Federal Ministry of Finance
(FMF) from the state's Federation Account in mountly installments and deposited into a
project account (para.2.13).

1.11   The Bank's basic objectve In Nigeia is to promote sustainable poverty reduction.
his objecdve is supported by policies and approaches uth promote effice  growth*
generag emloyment and pviding basic social serces. At the sme time, t  Bans
assistanc strategy Is tailored to meet the present realities of a large, slow moving portfolio,
the uncertainties creaed by the political taition and dippages in economic management,
and Niges limited c       t     . I oving iplemeation and maintaning a modest
and tghy focus  lending proga  is a fndamna  part of the overall strategy of the Bank.
Withn this context, the Iagos Drainage and Sanitation Project, financed by an IDA credit, is
designed to Imnrove basic living stanards for approxdimately 1.3 million people living and
working in flood prone areas. Health hazards due to floodi  by sewage and accumulated
garbage would be reduced; employment would be generat  through an anal progrm of
drainage mainten   by contract; and imprnvements in public sector management would be
pursued through technical assistce  r organizaon and system development for key
agencies. The project would irclude imple ion of a demo          urban renwal project
which could be replicated throughout Lagos to improve living conditons for the urban poor.
Ihe project is e    to be diebursed in five years, which is shorter tan the standard
proffle for simila projects in Nigeria. Ihe shorter tmefrme Is feasible because of the
simplicity of project design and the advanced state of prepartion of major components. in
addion, detailed atteition was given to procurement planning and impl on early in
project preparaion to hdp alleviate the types of proement difficulties and subsequent
disbursemnt lags  counered under previous projects.

1.12  In the cuent financal and economic context, charactrized by severe resource
constrs, the Bank's urban lendi  sateg fo' igeria must support the establishment of a
sustaible mechanism to fimd priority ura investments wfit high retuns, and focus
particulay on the reabiitation and  _       of exisdtg assets. The Ba's long term
lending strategy should promote fiscal self sufficiency at the state level, and a more efficient,
equitable and sustainable delivery of urb  services. The stategy should also support the
states in making the necsary fiscal adjustmets, primarly through a more rationl allocation
of investment funds and through mobilization of local financial resources. Improved financial
performance by the states will, in turn, enhan  their ability to raise the necessary capital to
face future urban infrstructure needs without undue recourse to public transfers. The
Improved efficiency of urban areas throu better urban manement wfll not only improve
the living conditions of a sizeable portion of the country's population, but will be essential to
strengthening the country's productive base.

1.13   The project will form part of the Bankis program of assistng to develop Nigeria's
infrructure as an essenti element in its overall economic development. It will incorporate
aspects of several of the Bank's program of special emphasis, such as poverty alleviation,
environment, and public sector management. Ihe Bank has a comparative advantage in
encouragg instXtional development and long term susinabihty, and ensuring the
qaropratene  of investmes. It wfll permit the Bank to contium its involvement with the
development of urban infrastructure in Lagos, the largest city in SubSahan Afica.

Project, sewerage ad other typ  of sanitaion will be essential. It Is doubtful, however, that
a  reso       erago system would be affordable in the am term and it would be difficult
to maitain  A mre inrentd approach to the iov           of sanitation would be

of Lagos covered by it, and in reducing em sly the problems of refuse disposal.
However several bottleneck have been revealed where major drains cross Federal Highways,
and lack of coordtion has caused culvert to be constucted which constrict the flow of
water Considerably. To sure that this problem is eliminated and full benefit of the first
project Is obtained, these calvers need to be enlaged or replaced by bridges and it is
proosed dut these sld also be fianced under the pmposed project. The State
Govement commitmet to funding reguar manance of the drainage system has been
inconsiste,with the rsult that te eslishment and imple tation of drain maienance
programs has proved difficult. This problem is to be addressed by the establishment of a
Drainage Mintena    Account to which ageed Stae Govrmet anual funding

2.13   An IDA credit of SDR44.5 miion (US$63.0 million equent) to the Federal
Govemment of Nigeria (FN) is proposed under standad IDA conditions with 35 years
maturity. Agrm       was reached at negotiations that onlending will be at the IBRD variable
interest rate for 20 years indluding five years of grace, and that the state will bear the foreign
exchnge ridrc Cofinancing of US$2 million equivalet is proposed ror part of the technical
assitac component and the Japan Internton  Coopetion Agency (JICA) has exessed
inteest in financing sewerage studies. Together, IDA and cofinanciers would finance the fidl
cost of tebnical assistance and training compoents of the project, and 75% of the cost of
goods and works exclusive of taxes and duties. In total, IDA would finance about 76% of the
total proDject cost net of taxes and duties. A subsidiary loan agreement would be required
betwean FGN and the state, and its sining would be a condition of credit effctiveness.
Local funds required for the project would be provided by the state govenment. During
appraisal, the state's finances were reviewed and it was concluded that the project would not
create an unbearable burden on state finances (par. 3.10). 're state would give instuctions,
blding over the lfe of the project, to the Federal Mnisty of Fmce to deduct its share of
the project's fiac  (except ta for drain maintenane) from its Federation Account in 18
monthly is lmems of N9 million followed by about 30 ista     of N12 million, and
deposit into a state project account as a condition of credit effectiveness An initial deposit
equal to the first monthy instllment would be made in the state project account as an
addion candl  o of ofIbUs. The finacing plan for the project is indicated below.
Counterpart funds for drain maintenance would be deposited quaterly to a drain mainenance
account by LASG to give fte annual amounts indicated in Annex 2.1. An amount of N20
milion has been included in the LASG budget for 1993 for drainage maint ce.

the major drainae compont of the project would be divided into four civil works
componen  sepae in locato  timig, or nature of work. Contracts for these would be
awarded after Intnation  C;ompetitve Bidding (ICB). Tenders have already been invited fbr
two large contac  (Lagos land and Apap) in order to advance project Implemention,
however no contracs h    been awar    and no retroactive finncig is proposed. Vehicles
and equipment valued at about US$3.4 million would also be procured through ICB. Further
goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contruac and not more than
US$1.0 million Iagegate, would be procured through inter mo   shopping with the
evaluaton of price quotatio  fom at least three suppliers. For he urban renewal

A. Contiioa Provisions for Revenue
3.1   The basic instrument of revenue sha    in Nigeria, the Federation Accoun, is
embodied in the Constiution. The major constitents of the Federation Account are: (1)
petroleum profit taxes, royadties, and licenses; (ii) customs and excise duties; (iii) corporate
profit taxes; and iv) export tax. The relative shares, which have changed over time, are:
1982          M           1922l2ne
- Federal Government      55%           50%          48.5%
- State Governmens        35%           30%          24.5%
- Local Govements          10%          15%          20%
- Special Funds           -             5%            7%
The curet  medtod of allocation among states and local governments is:
- 40% on the basis of equality of states;



- 1S-
- 30% on the basis of populatI' .
- 10% on the basis of soia t.  ,.pmet;
- 10% on the basi of land mass kad terrain; and
- 10% on the basis of revue effort.
3.2   The State Governmet ae also required by the Constiton to transfer 10% of their
int  revenue to the local goverments which are o  o        independnt In
administrative and fiscal matters.
B. Sruc  and C      ftLEdDnm of State Finnces
3.3 'Me fiscal system of States distinguishes two sets of accounts:
(a) the Consolidated Revenue Fund Account for all remurent revenue and
expenditure flows; and
(b) the Capital Development Fund Account for all capital receipts and
expenditure flows.
C. Recuffent
3.4   Ihe recurrent revenue of State Govments is derived larguly from the States' shre
of the statutory Federation Account allocations and revenues from inbenal sources. State
Govenment's share of the Federation Account has declined from 35% in 1982 to 24.5% in
June 1992 while tiat of Local Govements has eased from 10% to 20% during the same
period.
3.5   Ihe constituional provision on fiscal stucture gives State Governments the
jmisdiction over the following revenue sources:
(a) Persoral income and profit taxes;
(b) Licenses, rents, and fees; and
(c) Other taxes and levies
3.6   The Federal transfers to Lagos State Goverment, at 1986 constant prices, Incrased
from Pl152.0 million in 1986 to N492.8 million in 1991. The inten  revenue declineJ from
N444.4 milion in 1986 to N347.9 milion in 1991. Details are given at Annex 3.1 in both
constat and current prices.
3.7   In 1986 Lagos State Govrnent (LASG) raised 75% of its revenue localy,
proporonately four times more than other states. Ihis bas enabled LASG to wittand
flucuaton in revenue from the Federation Account which is largely oil based and
consequenty subject to internatonal oil price changes. However, there has been a steady
declie in intay generated revenue as a proporin of total revenue over fte past five
years. In 19"1 the revenue from the Federation Account amounted to almost 60% of LASG
total revenue. Thi makes LASG more vulnerable to chnge In oil prices compared to its
earlier statu. LASO has been able to cover most of its recurrent expendhre except full debt
servicing. Pesonal inome tax, sales and witholding tu have consisteny acounted for
over 50% of interal revenm. Proceeds mainly from land development charges and

3.8   Ihe major sources of cpital receipts of LASO Include recrnt budget surpluses,

(d)   streamline revenue colection to ensure that coUecdon resource are focused
on those revenue sources with most poten.
3.10  Ite projected revenes and epntur  for LASO are detiled in Anex 3.2 in
current pices. They Indicate tha LASO shoWd have fands to cover its recwurent
expenditus, including debt servicing, and its most important capital projees over fte next
seven years, however ther i ltle swplus above that needed for this present project in the
early years, and any additioa project shoud deay unil about a 1995 startup. Ihe modest
projected surplus in 1992 and 1993 of N222 mMion and N392 million, respectively, is
expected to grow to about N2.9 billion In 1999 at cut prices.
F. R
3.11   The expendiures of LASG ministries ard parasttals have reun and capital
components. Recurrent  pendite is classified into personnel, overhead and public debt
service. Capital expenditure is allocated among the variou sectors according to the
availability of funds and the priorities of LASG.
3.12  LASG was able to meet it's salaries and overhead costs out of intenul revenue for the
period 1986 to 1991. Recurrent expendiue inuding partial debt sevnicing was responsible
for 50% to 60% of total recunt revenue, Iludusive of Federaion Account transfer. The
resltant surplus, which primay arose as a resut of LASG not meetig Is full debt
servicing cost, financed 40% to 80% of LASO capital exped    durint the same period.

3.13   Over the past five years recurreat      have tended to grow in line with the
growth in recwrent revenue inluding Federa Account tra. Provided increase in

abligation the andcipaed growth In rcurrn reveue should provide LASG adequate
resourc  to meet the projected expediu.
3.14  As at December 31, 1991 the outtanding debt of LASG amed to N10.2 billion
(US$600 million) ncuditg d d princpa and lterest payme. Approximately N6.8
billion (JS$400 milin) of tiis mt  rel   to commercial loans to the Water Corporation
made udr the Lags Water Supply Project for the main treatment plant and primary trunk
water mais. Util the Wae CorXn  I able to raisn sufficient revenue to meet its
opational and debt sevie costs, which could take five years or more, LASO will have to
contnue to subsidie the Water Corporation at the epen  of the other sectors. The Water
Corporation with the asistance of a Bank supported project is committed to improving its
financial pe mce through Wif Iincreases and improved billing and collecion. The
prjected Income stment (1992-1998) indicates that 100% of cash operating expenses will
be met by the Corporation in 1995. However the full cost of debt service and cash operating
expenses is not likdy to be met undl 1998.
3.1S  The proposed Drainage and Saniation Project to be funded by a US$63.0 million
loa to LASG is estimated to requie a total LASG contribution of approximately N508
milion (excluding the routine mainance component), at current prices, between 1994 and
1997. The projected recut surpluses are adequate to finance the counpart funding and
the additional debt servicing cost.
IV. PROJECT B NUMr AND RIP@ACrS
A. PoEaftaBenefi
4.1   The major beft of the project will be the reduction in flooding of dwellings,
busi es, and transport cofridors, reduced deterioradon of roads, elimination of unsightly
accmulations of garbage in drains, and reduction in health hazards due to flooding by
sewage. Approximately 1,300,000 people, many of them poor, live in the cacbment areas
uer consideraon, inluding some 225,000 who reside in the areas subject to flooding. Still
more people are affected by disruption to travel and to commerce in the city during the wet
seson, and it is emated that some 1,400,000 dafly petsonal movements are disrupted
during periods of fiooding. Areas affected are indicated on the map. Project benefits are
furthe detailed at Annex 4.1.
D. Emirmnenta hact
4.2   The project would nt have significant adverse impact on the enviroment, but rather
improve wel-being, health and saniary conditions in the project area. Some temporary
negative impacts and a few longer team ones have been identified as outlined in Annex 4.1,
which also descres migati  measures. The major temporary impacts relate to disruption
during co3struction, and these will be minimized by appropriate reqm irements in constuction
specifications. Agr emetas reached at nog&,tiatiQa that appropriate clauses will be
incotporated into these documents. Of the more permanent impacs, some are related to the
general Impact of a major urb  agglomeraion, the only project specific impact being the
need for rmoval of a number of structores which intrude into the drainage right of way.



- 19-
4.3    A resetmt plan has ben p . ?ared. It Indicates that a total of 405 resides lving
in 32 structures, only one of which has a certificate of occupancy, are affected by the project.
Of thee totals, for Apapa Drne, sixteen temporary wooden shelters housing 183 residents
will need to be removed. In addition for Apapa, ome sctdon of channel needs to be realigned
from its current desig to avold two furte strucwres. For the Surelere Channel attention to
detaled desig wil miimize the  tfnt of relocaion required. However, the one permanent
residence bousing 12 residents and fifteen temporary shelters housing 210 residents and
traders will requir removal. For the Mainland Drains, attention to detailed alignment of the
drains will be able to sawe any need for relocation of buildings. For Lagos Island Drainage,
no resettleme  or removal of buildings is necessay. Lagos State, thtough its Department of
Lands, normaly pays ownets of those properties having certificate of occupancy
compensation based on market prices (estimated to be five years rental value) and pays
esidents assisa   with relocation based on at least two months incme. Those without a
cerdficate of occupacy can be paid in a simiar but usually more ad hoc basis. Project cost
estmates include allowance for resetement costs for both. The resettlement plan indicates
that co    aion and assistance will be paid, and that areas available for resettlement are of
higher quaity tham prenty occupied due to being located clear of natural drainage channels.
k indicates that social or economic support is unlikely to be necessay since the relocation will
not affect the popuadon's proximity to its largely informal sources of income, and this will
be verified as part of the detaied implementaion plan. Agreemeat was reached at
that Lagos State will employ by August 31, 1993 a consultant familiar with local
conditions to provide further analysis of the rights and procedure for all residents to seek
compensation and prepare a detailed  lementation plan satisfactory to the Association to
facilita  the resetdement, and monitor the socio-economic conditions of the affected people
before, during and after relocation, including involvement of the people and relevant local
orgaizions in this process. Agr     w  reacbed that the State will compensate and
assist owners and resdents with relocation so as to improve or restore their living standards,
and that relocaton acdons will take place according to an agreed schedule, including
ntfication of occupants at least six months priur to the required date for removal, valuation
at least three month prior to removal, and raymant at least one month prior to the need for
removal; furither there will be no relocation ntil compensation in accordce with the plan
has been paid. Dbusemet of fimds for Apapa drinage and the Surelere channel wil be
nonal on the consultant having been employed, an implementation plan satisfactory to
the Association having been prepared and satisfactory progress having been achieved with its
Implementation. In addon, designs for Apapa drains will be realigned, and final design of
Manland and Surelere Drains will be carried out so as to minimize the need for relocation.
Duing project imple on the process of relocation will be closely monitored by Bank
staff to ensure compliance with the plan.
C. Le  Cost
4.4   Ihe proposed project has been designed as part of a long term plan to improve the
drainage of Lagos. Appropriate design standards have been adopted, including the use of
open or unlined drains where feasible. Only the highest priority works have been included in
the project Alftrnatves incorporating pumping statons or tidal gates, or large intercepting
cut-off drains were considered, but were detemined to be technologically inappropriate or
socialy too disruptive.

D. 9g=QWWkJat of
4.5    Quantiflable benefits used In calcldating ecnomic rat of turn are Increased rent
values (about 20% of tot benefits), reduced vehicle operating cos (60%) and tie saving,
and reduced road mantace cos. Benefit to health, and to Industry and commerce have
not be  quantifled athough a ndotn  value has been included. Costs included in the
analysis are capital costs, drain mainteace cost, and the costs of disruption during
construction. A detailed economic analysis of the ptoject is given at Annex 4.2, showing
Economic Rlte of Return (R) based on these quansfiable benefits varying between 13.6%
and 32.6% for different components of the project, with an overall figure of 22%. A cost
incrae of 10%, combined with elimination of the benefit from increased rental value,
health, and to industry and commerce, and 10% reduction in other benef  would yield an
ERR of about 12% as indicated in the Annex. Similarly, a reduction solely in the benefit
from vehicle operating costs of 70%, or in all beft of 40% would yield an ERR of about
12%.
E. P isks
4.6 The project does not pose any umnsual rLsks. The major risks identified are: (i) that
eounterpart funds may not become available as required; (ii) that the necessary drain
maintance financing and actions will not conue beyond the life of the project; and (iii)
that studies in sewerage/sanitation and urban upgrading will not lead to sustainable
investments. The first of these has been addressed by requiring deduction at source from the
Federation Account; the second by establishing procedures which can be easily repeated and
by involvement of fie private sector; and the third, to the etent possible, by the participatory
approach adopted.

Highways are the responsibility of the Federal Myiistry of Works and Housing.
3.    Although constitutionally LGAs are responsible for maintining teray drais they
informally gave the Lagos WasteI Disposal Board (now LPWMA) this task some years ago.
Ihis situation remained unti renty when t 3spousibility was reuned to the LOAs.
4.    The imporance of coordination of agencies involved in drainage activities has been
recopized by the LAS¢; which bas entrusted the coordination responsibility to Drainage and
Flood Control Co ordinatig Committee, chaired by the Director General of The Environment
and Physical Planning Office (TEPO) of the Governor's Office.

5.    At preset the Drainage Department of TEPPO endeavors to maintain dains both
through is dire laWbor organizatio and by use of local contractor. The Drainage
Departmen employs some 51 persons of which 18 are qualified engineers. The Depaent
is divided into four sections namely the Constuction Section, the Design and Study Section,
the Paning and Monitoring Section, and the Operation and Maintece Section. Each Is
headed by a qualiied engineer.
6.    Ihe Operation and Maintenac section is divided into four zones (a total of S are
planned) and the chief engineer of each is either of Executive Engine  or Senior Exeuive
Engineer status. These zones have the prmary responsibility for cying out drainage
maintenance work. In addition to pumps (27 no. mostly of 6 inch size) ihe Departme has
24 item of plant, vehicles and equipment including 3 dredgers and 6 tipping trucks. Of his
total inventory some 17 items are not opeaional and are awaiing repair.
7.    Apart fiom proviig salaries, wages and fleet running coss, LASG also provides an
anual budget for drain maienance to be carried out by contract. However the sums vary
considerably from year to year and fall far short of the estmaed basic need for maintece
of primary and secondary chamels of some M60 million per amnm (1993 costs). In 1990 a
sum of NS milion was budgeted, in 1991 N2 million and in 1992 N1O million. N20 million
has been budgeted for 1993. Apart from mance of primary and secondary drains it is
estimated that a fiuher N42 million is required annaly to properly mainain Local
Governm t terary drains.
Proposed Matenance
.    Ihe Project will assist the Drainage Department of TEPPO of the State Government
in establishing cost effective maineance programs for primary and secondary drains In a
number of ways. Most importantly, to ensure required annual maitenance budgets are
fthlcoming, to keep drains in a reasonable state of repair and operational condition, it will
provide a proportion of the annal maintenan  budget. However the provision of such
budget will be contingent on the State Government providing the remaining share of the
required annua budget each year.
9.    A Drainage Maintenance Account will be established into which the LASG
contributions will be paid amually by March 31. The Bank's contribution will not be
disbursed unless the State Government's contribution has been paid. Ithe account would be
used for paying contractors carrying out annual or periodic m tence contracts. This will
enable the Drainage Department to effectively pla and manage its annual maitenance
progam.
10.   The arrangement wiU be phased over a four year period. The Bank's contribution to
the Drainage Maintenance Acomunt in the first year and second (1994 and 1995) will be 60%
of the esmated anmual ma ence budget, supplementing the State's contribution. In the
third year the Bank's contribution will reduce to 50% and in the fourth year to 40% of the
estimated annual cost as shown in current costs in the following table. The State

11.   It is expected that tis titional arrangement will provide the Drainage Deparment
with the neesary experience and confidenc for increased use of the private sector in drain
maintence which will lead to a generaly improved coMdition of drains.

LAGOS DRAINAGE AND SANITATION' PROJECT
Plan flor Sanitation and Seywerae Services
Objeci"e
1.    'oe primary objective of the sanitation component is to enhance the quality of the
environment of the meo ls of Lagos State through planning for the improvement of excreta and
wastewater disposal services.
2.    Ihe main elements of this component are summarized below. Detailed TORs will be required
for all th   elements:
(a)    Preparation of a sanitation plan which recommends solutions for the teatment and
disposa of excreta and wastewater in all areas of the metropolis taking into account
the findings of a sanitation and sewerage survey. The plan will also consider
institonal, technical, financial, policy, social and legal requirements for different
services for domestic, instional and commercial areas of the metropolitan LOAs.
Proposals for improving services on a demand driven basis will be made, a stat
for marketing and promotion and implementation of improved services (with a view to
increasing cost recovery since to date these services have by and large been free) will
be elaborated. These activities will build on the findings of a Water Pollution Control
Sttey  Study (WPCSS) currently being supervised by the Environmental and
Physieal Planing Office (TEPPO).
(b)    Provision of basic equipment for the establishment a water pollution laboratory which
will monitor the pollution in the Lagos lagoon as well as Industrial pollution.
Establishment of a basic library which will enable the State to keep up to date on sub-
sector developments.
(c)    Preparation of feasibility studies and detailed design for completion of Victoria Island
sewer network and treatment plant Including review of disposal options, and
environmental assessment.
(d)    Detaled review of the effluent from major industries and proposals on the
needs/requirements for treatment of the different types of industrial effluent.
Sanitation as used in the project title refers both to on-site excreta disposal and to
sewerage. In the rest of the Annex, the term is used to describe on-site excreta disposal
only.

Preparation of preliminary designs for primary and secondary treatment facilities and
a strategy for reduction/control of industrial pollution in Lagos State.
(e)    Detailed feasibility/design for an area recommended under WPCSS for improved
sanitation services.
(M)    Detailed feasibility/design for an area recommended under WPCSS for
conventional/simplified sewerage services.
Background
3.    Ihe provisional results of the last census (1991) indicated that Lagos State has a population of
about 5.7 million, located in 15 Local Government Areas of which eleven are considered as urban.
The Lagos Drainage and Sanitation Project as well as the previous Solid Waste Management Project
have aimed at addressing some of the priority needs for improvement of the urban environment.
There is great interest at Federal, State and Local Government levels to continue imprwving the
quality of the urban environment. An important component of this current project will therefore be
planning activities to prepare for a Lagos State Sanitation and Sewerage Project. The key
Goverment agencies at State and Local Government for this component will be: The Environment
and Physical Planning Office (MIPO) (Department of Environment, Sewage and Water,
Environmental Control, Physical Planning and Urban Renewal and Development Matters); the Local
Government Medical Officer of Health Departments in which are located the Environmental Health
Groups which deal with hygiene, epidemiology, environmental sanitation, waste management).
4.    Lagos State is in a unique position in that its Local Government Areas (LGAs) generally have
high population (several have over 500,000 inhabitants) and in some cases high housing density with
basic infrastucture services which are unforuaely either insufficient or inefficient and for which
there is little or no cost recovery. Improvements to the water supply services are being addressed
through the currn Lagos Water Supply Project. Excreta disposal services to date have been provided
by a mix of systems such as the abolished pai latrine, the traditional latrine, the aqua privy, the vault
system the septic tank, communal septic tanks, and sewerage. There are over 100 sewered septic
tank systems and package treatment plant systems which are used in housing developments and
apartment buildings and eight sewage treatment plants which are operated and maitined by the State
Govement's Office of Enviromnent and Physical Planning. Septage is currenty dumped in
waterways or the lagoon.
5.    In addition, for historical reasons, there are many industries (over 500 reasonably sized ones
and numerous cottage and small industries) of different types in Lagos (textiles, pharmaceutical,
beverages, steel, food etc.). The large ones are currently trying to address the issue of the quality of
effluent they produce as a result of an initiative of the State Govenment whereby they are subject to a
diminsi  tax based on the extent of their pollution abatement activities. They are currently being
ecouraged to Instal treatment facilities for effluent prior to discharge to receiving waters or domestic
sewage treaument plas.

Other Studies
6.    The Lagos lagoon will be the subject of a study conducted by the Overseas Development
Administration of United Kingdom (ODA) as part of the Enviromnental Management Project (IDA).
Tbe results of this study will be incorporated into a strategy for reducing the pollution of the lagoon.
Several edicts addressing environmental pollution control issues have been issued and are being
enforced. Stringent effluent discharge guidelines which are based on the Federal ones have been
issues and an edict on the abolition of the pail latrine system has resulted in a program for the
replacement of this system with alternative excreta disposal facilities. In addition to the pollution
from the industrial and domestic effluent which find their way into the lagoon, there is all the septage
pumped from septic tanks and vaults which is dumped into it as well as point source pollution from
individual community members/groups.
7.    The WPCSS has as its primary objective, a description of the existing situation with regard to
excreta and wastewater disposal and recommendations of options for improvement taking bIto account
the present physical conditions and affordability. lhe detailed findings of the study are yet to be
obtained but preliminary results indicate that additional work (including planning) will be needed
before deaed feasibility and preparation of a project can begin.
8.    Another component of the Drainage and Sanitation Project, is the community infrastucture
upgrading program. This project will address a range of waste management issues (solid waste,
drainage, excreta disposal) as well as other infrastructure requirement in selected communities in the
metropolis. Elements of the sanitation component, especially the results of the sanitation and
sewerage survey will be useful in helping to improve services in the selected community.
Implemention of the two components will require close coordination and an appropriate mechanism
will be elaborated during a project launch workshop.
Strategy for Preparation of the Plan
9.    The planning methodology and approach will result in a the proposal of a mix of technical
solutions for implementation. As already stated, the plan will propose solutions taking into account
the need to increase and respond to user demand for improved services. Another important element of
the strategy is to establish the roles of State and LGAs as planners, supporters and promoters and
managers of improved services and the roles of the private sector/NGOs as providers of the services.
10.   Instihttional arrangements for implementation of the project's sanitation component would
include several elements. There will be a need for centralized and decentralized involvement in the
provision, promotion and marketing of improved services once the plan is complete. Both Local
Government and State bodies will be involved to varying degrees in the planning process and
subsequently in implementadon. It is proposed that responsibility for the preparation of the plan be
maintained at State level within TEPPO. Ihis State Unit/Group will supervise consultants preparing
the plan and wUI subsequently be responsible for technical assistance to Local Governments wishing
to respond to demand for improvements in services in the communities they serve. It would also be
responsible for statewide planning of upgrading/continuing improvements in service and support and
eventual establishment of capacity in LGAs for management of services/private contractos, local

Demonstrtion Proiect. and Review of the Urba Renewal Board Edict. 1991
Backumd
1.1    Metropolitan Lagos has witnessed a dramatic growth in its population, economic
activity and service sectors since independence. A fairly compact, well managed city of some
350,000 in 1952, it has been a magnet for migrants especially in the post-independence
period. Population surged upwards from an estimat 950,000 in 1963 to some 5.7 million
today. It has been edmated that over 3 mllion dominanty low income resident in Lagos
live in deficient areas covering more than 3000 hectares at densities ranging from about 500
to 1,200 persons per hectare.
1.2    All residents of the city are affected by the strained infrasce services with the
predominantly low income residents living in the densely populated areas suffeieng more from
the service deficits. These deficits include a lack of dinage causing firequent and severe
flooding; insanitary human waste disposal facilities; poor access with few footpatfs and many
unpaved local roads; a secondary and tertiary road system generally inadequate for the traffic
volumes and suffering a high level of pavement distress; intermittent or non-existent water
supply with residents often buying water from vendors, collectng from tankers or carrying it
great distances in cans from standpipes or from their places of employment; inadequate solid
waste collection facilities resulting in drainage channels choked with refuse; poor tele-
commxunications; inadequate streetlighting for security and safety, and; few parks, open spaces
and social infrastructure facilities. Conditions are bad during the relatively dry periods of the
year and become significady worse during the rainy season.
1.3    Ifastructure and service investments, although substial in some subseos such aS
primary highways, have lagged far behind effective demand in most others. Poor or non-
existent mantenance has deteriorated those facilities that do exist. These factors have
together led to severely strained infrastructure and services, a deteriorating living environment
and a very low level of city efficiency. Integraed sector improvements are considered
neceary to make any significant impact in living conditions, environmental conditions,
efficiency and productivity; to achieve a perceivable improvement across the board in
municipal services in a reasonable time frame; to achieve coordinated and thus cost-efficient
solutions; and to avoid conmial disruption in the future by piecemeal provisions of the
vaious services required. Of paramount importance however, if such an intervention is to be
sucesf over the longer term, is the involvement of communities in the identificaon of
basic meds and demands, planning, design, implew4ntation and subsequent maintenac of
Infastructure and services in their respective areas.

Progm and Demonstration Project Paration
2.1   It Is proposed that an initial four year infaucture upgrading program aimed at
improving communiies, covering a gross area of about 200 hectares per year and thus
benefitting over 150,000 persons annually, be developed to the level of detailed engineering
and costing. It Is anticipated that the main components of the program would include, but not
be limited to, roads, drainage, water reticulation, solid waste facilities and sanitation facilities.
Social and educational facilities needs would also be identified. However key considerations In
program design will be cost recovery, affordability and willingness to pay for improvements.
The latter Is of fundamental importance and therefore detailed proposals developed in
respective communities would be predominantly 'demand driven'. To plan, design,
coordinate and implement such a program, the Lagos State Governmen (LASO) proposes to
establish a riulti-disciplinary team within the newly created Lagos Urban Renewal Board.
Furthermore, to assist such a team to prepare the four year program and to develop an initial
upgrading demonstration project, it is proposed that consultants be appointed.
2.2 In addition to identifying, planning and costing a four year program for future funding
considerations as well as the preliminary engineering of the proposed first year program, from
the foregoing work a demonstration project will be idenified which would be implemeted
under the Lagos lrainage and Sanitation Project at the earliest possible time and which would
have as its primary objective the testing of proposals made for the four year program.
2.3 The consultants would also review the Edict establishing tbe Urban Renewal Board
(URB) and make recommendations, as necessary, to enable the Board to efectively plan and
implement the program (and fuire programs) to be prepared. Cost recovery from program
beneficiaries, funding of the Board, coordination with other infastructure and municipal
services delivery agencies, land tenure, community pardicpation are, ilnte alla, areas which
would require particular focus. 'he program would be implemented in collaboration wih the
saitation planning work which focuses on improving excreta and sullage disposd services.
Coordination is reqWred with sectoral agencies regarding primary and secondary
infrastructure studies, plans and programs to ensure that the upgrading program is not only
compatible with sectr programs but complements the efforts of sectoral agencies to provide
improved infscture and sernices. Programs of the Lagos State Water Corporaton, the
Lagos State Waste  gement Authority, the Drainage Deparment of the Lagos State
Environment and Physical Planing Office (IEPPO) and the sewerage and sanitation studies
being carried out under the direction of the Environment Polluon Control, Water and
Sewerage Department of TEPPO are partcular areas where close coordination by the
consultants (and URB) is of critical importance. With regard to the latter studies it would be
importmt for the consultants to utilize or at least be cognizant of the proposals and, when
available, the results of wilingness to pay studies for saiation being carried out for TEPPO.

3.2    By use of all available aerial photogaphs, base maps supplemented by field visits,
exisig information and general reconnaissance, and takdng into account the findings of the
sanitton survey (Annex 2.2) priority areas deficient in basic municipal sevices will be
identified. The following kinds of information will also be reviewed:
(i)    size, degree of consolidation, population density;
(ii)   topography, flood hazrds, difficulty of access, locational
advantages/disadvantages and potetial for eentual provision of
services;
(ui)   proximity to tunk infstrcture, either existing or planned (e.g. trunk
water mains, surface drainage outfalls, major roads);
Civ)   transportation services;
(v)    existing level of provision of public utilities and facilities,.roads,
footpaths, water supply, sanitation, solid waste disposal, electricity,
security lighting, health clinics, schools, etc. and residents' priorities
among poteniial improvements;
(vi)  the nate and extent of small scale employment acvities, including
externl linkages;
(vii) existing community organizations developed through the spontaneous
activities of community residents.
Components Seleion
3.3    The basic inhastructure needs would likely include the following: (i) dry road access;
(11) efficient surface water drainage; (ii) potable water supply; (iv) adequate washing and
toilet facilities; and (v) simple solid waste disposal (waste collection) facilities. Other needs
might be: (vi) primary schools; (vii) health clinics; (viii) street lighting; Cix) markets; (x)
telephone communication facilities; (xi) open space and recreation facilities; and (xii) sub-
division of vacat land within defined areas.

range of 10000 to 20000. It would be an area deficient in basic in*fastructure and services,
where little assistance in the past had been given but where the community expressed a
willingness to assist in, and pay for basic infrastructure and service improvements.
3.5   The demonstration project would be prepared to a level of detailed engineering and
detailed costs would be prepared. Details of how the various proposals would be implemented
would be determined in conjunction with the community and a design report prepared
including an implementation plan and a detailed environmental assessment. For those
proposals to be carried out by contract, bid documentation would be prepared to a standard
acceptable by the World Bank. For any proposals to be carried out by the community the
modalities of such implementation would be clearly articulated. The bid documents would
include drawings to appropriate scales (e.g layout at 1:1000), bills of quantities,
specifications, conditions of contract and other necessary documentation to secure bids
through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the World Bank. The use of the
appropriate sample bidding documents prepared by the Bank is strongly encouraged.
Orgaizational Arrangements
3.6   Organizational arrangements including necessary improvements to the URB to
undertake future planning, detailed engineering design, implementation, community
participation, coordination, construction supervision, cost recovery, and continual monitoring
and updating of the program as well as arrangements necessary for adequate operation and
maintenace by local authorities andlor parastatals on completion of the infrastructre and

LAGOS DRAIN^GE AND SANITATION PROJECT
Billing and Collection System Study
Terms of Reference
Lagos State government's (LASG) internally focally) generated revenue has declined
from 75% to 40% of it's total revenue including Federal Government Transfers. As a part of the
LASG's efforts to improve internal revenue generation, LASG in 1992 established a Revenue
Generation Bureau. The functions of the Bureau include analyzing existing and potental sources
of Internal revenue and billing and collection procedures, and advising LASG revenue collection
agencies on methods to improve internal revenue generation. In order to assist the Revenue
Generation Bureau, LASG is seeking consultancy services to carry out a billing and collection
study of LASG. The consultants are required to study and document the existing billing and
collection system and, based on their findings, make recommendations on methods of improving
billing and collection. The study would include but not be limited to:
(i)   the identification of major sources of internal revenue with particular
focus on income and sales tax potential,
CH)   the adequacy and effectiveness of use of existing manpower, transport and
other resources for billing and collection, particularly in relation to the
number of revenue sources and their yields,
(iii)  the method, timing and frequency of bills production, and distribution,
(wv)  the method of revenue collection, recording and accounting thereof,
(v)   the method and frequency of follow up action taken to recover arrears,
(vi)  the size and age of the arrears,
(vii)  the sanctions available and used to recover arrears,
(viii)  the effectiveness of intenal checks in the billing and collection system,
(ix)  the frequency and extent of billing and collection information available to
management and the effectiveness of actions taken by management,
(x)   the extent of private sector involver.ient in billing and collection,
(xi)  the methods used to sensitize the public on the importance of prompt
payment,

AM .4
(xli) the adequacy of staffing position of revenue collection personnel. training
and Incentive structure,
(xiii) an assessment of the costs of collection relating to each major soure of
revenue.
Based on the findings of the above and the volume of the transactions involved, the
consultants wil recommend appropriate and more efficient billing and revenue collection syms
which will address the weaknesses identified in each of the areas above and Including but not
limited to:
(I    computeization of the billing and collection system;
(1)   development of procedures that will ensure that defaults in collection are
eliminated or minimized;
Oll)  development of appropriate credit contol procedures with a view to
minimizing incidence of bad debts;
(iv) development of procedures that will facilitate monitoring of daily
collections and allow for longer term planning;
(v)    making recommendations on dealing with short and long term issues
relating to staffing of revenue collection department;
(vi)  the potental and extent of private sector involvement In billing and
collection;
(vii)  an assessment of the interal revenue potentud from the existing sources
of revenue and revenue forecss over next five years based on
introduction of proposed revised billng and collection system;
(viii)  Identification of additional potental sources of revenue and their potentW
yield.
Ihe consultants in making their recommendaions should look into various alternate
scerios and give justification in support of the recommended option.
It is estimated that the study will take 6 months to complete with estimated input of 12
man months. The following reports will be submitted by the consultants:

Avalable Mapping
1.    Ibe mapping available in Lagos varies In quat and quality. The following is available:
(a)    1:1000 semi-controlled air photo mosaics prepared around 1984 and based on 1982
photography.
(b) , Unpublished analogue mapping prepared in 1982 at a scale of 1:2500 based on the
:Ift:late 1970's photography. The mapping is generally unpublished and not released.
(c)    Air photographs flown in 1987 and 1988 at low levels with fuil ground control in
place. This photography formed the basis of the mapping prepaed for te Lagos
State Water Corporadon (LSWC).
(dj  'the mapping availale through the LSWC which consists of digital format mapping
suitable for the preparation of 1:500 scale maps. This was the first digital format
mapping produced, all other mapping being of an anaiogue format. The digital
mapping Is significantly more versatile in its end use, however this mapping covers
only the roads and strets and not infill areas.
Current Needs
2.    The preference of the Surveyor General (SG) would be that all mapping responsibilities rest
within his office. Given the skUls of some mapping technicians currendy employed in the SG's
office, this would be the most appropriate course of action While these technicians have expertise in
using older style analogue mapping equipment, however, they have very little expertise in using
computer systems. It would be appropriate to significandy upgrade these computer skills to
encompass not only the mapping matters but also to develop a solid computer background. The SG
should have access to the LSWC mapping and establish the method by which this digital mapping
could be updated in a more cost-effective manner than has been available in the past. The SG also
requirs system whereby the cadastral fabric could be overlaid on the planometric and topographical
details of any maps which are produced.
3.    For drainage project in Lagos mapping which provides qyality spot heights and accurate
conturs wi intervas of at least I metre and preferably 0.5 metres are needed. Ihis would
considerably cut down on the level of effort needed for expansions of the drainage system. In
geneal, the mapping available through the LSWC would meet some of these needs but it would be
preferable if mapping areas could be expanded to encompass all of the drainage facilities within the

Aix1.5
Page 2 of S
State. 'Me mapping for the Drainage Department should be of a relatively large scale, e.g. 1:1,000,
1:500, to facilitate overall designs.
4.    The Physical Planning Department requir  smaller-scale mapping. Types of mapping would
range In scale from 1:2,500 to 1:25,000. This would enable the Physical Planning Depatment to
cary out overal planning studies of large arwe using the smt'lar scale mapping and it would enable
them to provide tie necessary planning services on larger scale mapping to neighbourhoods or areas
withi Lagos. The Physical Planning Department also has need for opographic maps with 10 or 20
metre contour inevals. Their main need is In cadastral inormaon and planometic inormation.
5.    The LSWC also needs to Improve the ete  of its mapping to cover the entire city so ta all
the MI area are completed. The LSWCs needs would include record keeping and billing methods.
The mapping presently available to them does not enable them to properly idendfy propdres and
consumers. The mapping is adequate for their management of the water supply system, but infil
mapping would be of great benefit in improving the fiscal efficiey of the LSWC. LSWC needs will
vary with specific requirements; mapping available at 1:500 scale for design and records would be
best while overall fiscal information could be handled on mapping with a scale of 1:2,500 or 1:5,000.
6.    It can be seen from the foregoing that the needs of the various organiations with an interes
in mapping in Lagos are diverse. For this reason, digital mapping available on a computer system
located In Lagos would be most appropriate. A Land Informaion Systems (LIS) is also an interest
It is recognized, however, until a good mapping base, and mpaerized databses to tie into that
mapping base, are available, that the graphical/textur  iaces associated with a LIS would be a
long-term objective. TMe near-term objective would be simply to upgrade the mapping so that it is
usable and useful to all Departments of the State Government. However, since the implementation of
a state-wide LIS has great benefits in terms of facilities management and fisal control, an LIS is an
appropriate long-term objective.
Objectives
7.    Objecdves of a mapping program would be:
(a)    Develop a mapping system which would be readily available and usable for all
interested governmeal or private agencies.
(b)    Develop a mapping system which is readily amenable to updating in Lagos using a
minimum of foreign finance and a maximum of local finance.
(c)    Develop a mapping system which does not need to be complety re-mapped when
updating Is needed, i.e. it is not necessary to abandon the existing mapping datibase.
(d)    Have mapping available in a variety of scales on multiple media, including hard copy.
or digital format.
(e) Develop mapping which has expandability In the future and will accept independently
developed databases to interface with the graphical program.

AM 2.3
Pape3 of S
(t)    Mapping could be expanded to cover additional areas in Lagos Stat withot the uso
of extensive overseas resources.
(g) Mapping system should be easily extendable to an LIS.
Recommended Strategy
8.    Proposed strategy for mapping In Nigeria would be the preparaton of expanded mapping
based on the 1987/88 air photographs. The basis for this mapping woud be the digit mping
presendy avaiable from the LSWC. With one of the presny avaiable PC-based dit maping
systems, this could be expanded to cover the full area flown In the 1987/88 ak photography program.
Significant advantages to Nigeria would occur in tams of technology transfer and relaively low cost.
9.    The proposed approach would be to create a mapping task team by drawng staff from varous
agencies hat have an interest in the mapping. This would enable the transfer of knowledge beween
the various Miistries in the Lagos State Government. Ultimately, these idvidual could be retand
as an ongoing mapping task force under the Surveyor General's or other appropiate ageny's
direction. A variety of imaging technologies is available.
Schedule for Jmplementon
10.   The mapping task force could be assembled and operational within a ix-month time fame.
Support for that team could be provided through the supplier of the digia mapping system and also
through the personnel who developed the LSWC mapping systm  This would enuwre    the
necessary training was appropriately provided and in addition tha ongoing maintenance of the
computer systems and some computer expertise were also available.
11. As a long-term objective it would be worthwhile to implement a LIS. However, before that
was implemented it would be important for all of the users of ht system to fully identify their needs
from that system. That system could begin with, pehaps, tho needs of the LSWC In terms of their
billing procedures and perhaps also the needs of the Planning Departm   in terms of urban planning.
Slowly the system would be built up to encompass the needs of other users as they are Idetfied.
However a primary objective should be simply to develop a good quality mapping base in a digital
format so that planning and engieeing needs are properly met. Once that mapping is in place it is
likely that the expertise will have been developed within the mapping task force to implement an LIS
using local resources. To be effective, a good understanding of computer technologies and the use of
computers is required at the tehnician level in the State Government.
Training
t2.   Key areas requiring attention are the provision of basic computer training skldls to ose
members appointed to the mapping task team where they do not have txose basic pkills. Ibo tpe of
trainngwould be simflar to that provided for the LSWC staff at the beginln  of the dktribution
system design project. ITis involved extensive work ensuring an understanding of the basic conets
of computen and klowledge of the Disk Opradtng System used on the PC-bed computer systm.
At the dme the dstbution system  project was being undertethis type of training was not

Page 4 of 5
available in Lgs. Since then a number of agencies that provide this tWpe of trang have
developed and training could be carried out in Nigeria. The training in computer famliarizaton and
basic DOS skills would be undertaken over a three-month ptriod In Lagos.
13.   Subsequently additional more advanced training on MS-DOS and also basic taining in
AutoCAD would be required. Advanced MS-DOS and AuoCAD training as well as the training for
th- PC-based mapping system would best be provided by expatriate staff in Lagos. in tiS way
offshore costs of accommotion and travel for the likely five membes of the mapping team could be
minmized. This second phase of the computer trawning would take place over the second throe-
month period close to the beginning of the poject. As this training progressed, work could begin on
some of the early aspect of the infHl mapping. Finally, traiing In use of the PC-bad stereo
mapping system would also be required. Ihis latter item would be provided by the vendor of the
software package selected for use in Lagos.
14.   The trainer of the associa ad softwar packages should revisit Lagos on an annual bases for a
two-week refresher courses thrr Shout the enire mapping project. This refresher tWaining would
provide an opporunt for the iaapping team to deal with issues on which they are unclear and, in
addition, the trainer would also update the team on the latest advances in the computer field which
advances very quicldy.
15.   Ths second aspect of the training would be training for the surveyors involved in the ground
control placement for the mapping of the outlying areas. This should be carried out by an expert who
would visit Lagos to provide thining to the second survey team. Tnis tr ingwould be in the use of
the geodometer equipment siilar to the equipment prenty aviable at LSWC. I would not be th
mntent to provide basic survey traing to the surveyor. Ihe objective would be to have the secod
survey team led by a surveyor already familiar with basic survey approaches.
16. The entire training and mapping program would require an overall coordinator or project
manager who would ensure that facilities are made available to tne project as required. He would be
a project manager and support person. He would be in overall charge of the training progm.
Terms of Reerence
17.   Proposed duties of the project manager would be to organize, coordinate and manage
individuals and resources to achieve the following tasks and objectves:
(a)    Meet with ilteested Government Agencies In Lagos and identify 15-20 individuals
for evaluation as candidates for a mapping project using computeized equipment
(b)   Arrenge for the necessary testng procedures to select the five most intellecftally-
suited individuals to become involved in a long-term mapping program.
(c)    Provid  reo     dons to the client orgizations as to the individual who should
be selected for the mapping team.

ugly and hazardous re dsttmnt works often required.
7.    Reduction in Erosion and Pollution
- Evidence of erosion of inadequately desigped unlined canels and possible coapse
of parts of lined channels will be reduced by the consction of property designed
drainge chmnels.
- Poteial poUution of groundwater sources such as shallow wells which are
etensively used in parts of the project area will be reduced.
C. Temporary Negatve Impacts
8.    The negative impacts of a temporary nature are those that will occur during
constuction of the works and fall under seven broad headings as follows:
- Disruption to the primary road network.
- Disrption including severance of neighborhoods.
- Commercial loss due to resticted access.
- Flood control works.
- Nuisance during construction.
- Generation and disposal of excavated materidal.
- Hazardous opeatons.
D. Mdgation of Temporary Negative Impacts
9.    Measures to mitigate the effects of each of the above temporary negative impacts are
as flows:
- The number of primary road crossings will be minimized and where possible located
so as to mimze disrupn; traffic control programs will be pr ed, approved and
publicly advertised well in advance of the works being card out; close liaison with
the traffic auttes wil be maintained; night and weekend work for road CsinS
will be encouraged where this would not cause nuisance; temporay meaes to
proct trenches and keep roads open wi  be employed (ie., heavy steel plates);
penty clauses for delays in completing such wok wUI be included in bid
do _em.
- Extensive consultation with communis affected by the wodrs and the relevant
Local Governments and Utility Agencies wil take place before and during the works;

alternative access outes and tunig spaces will be provided where through routes are
temporarily dirupted; where eisting weak footbridges liking com_mnties have to
be removed altenative drain cressing facilities will be provided.
- Formal industrial and commercial establishments where access will be temporarily
disrupted will be identified prior to constrwuon and altenatve wcc  arngemens
made wherever possible with full and timely consultation with the enterprises affected.
- To contol flooding of the works during construction where possible work will be
carried out in the dry season; dicharge from dewatering operations will be confined
to exitng channels vwaich will be cleared and desilted prior to dewatering if necessary
to ensure adequate capacity; temorary bunds will be formed to impound waters and
would be designed to include a spillway to allow for conrolled dicharge in periods of
peak flow,
- In constructing temporay access roads for the works the bid document will require
ihat conractors design such roads to an adequate standard with correct drainge,
using suitable road construction materials and generally ensuring that the construction
and .use of such roads wil not cause mnisance to users and nearby residents.
- Potenti ly toxic material to be dredged from Surelere chanel will be tested as part
of the detailed desigL exercise, the tested mater  analyzed and the results reviewed
before incrpoing detah of disposal a gements into the bid documens. In
Wdidon ongoing sampling of such materia wm take place throughout the dredging
oWperatios and the conract doc_u  will enable the client to amend the disposal
arrangements should test results prove this to be neceary.
- Present proposs for drainage through the petrol strage depot will be reviewed and
arragements adopted in close liaison with the Petol Company on safety measures
and working pratices prior to co       of the works. In addition members of
the constuction workforce wil be given basic training i operag in a hazardous
envionment and be instructed on safety procedures. Throughout the work the Petrol
Company will have a supervisor on site to ensure strict compliance with the basic
safety measures proposed.
E. Lnger Term Negive Impacts
10.   Tbe longer term negatve impacts are both direct and indirect and may be summarized
under five man headirgs as follows:
- Pollution of the receiving waers
- Property reallocation
- Development of reclaimed land
- Possible change in land use and effect on design capacities
- Maitenc of rights of way

LAGOS DRAINAGE AND SANRIATION PROJECr
Economic Analyis
itroduceon
1.    This analysis assesse the direct and indirect costs assocat  with the projects wihin the
context of their envIron    impact, and including the cost of implementing midgating measures.
Where possible, these cost have been quai ed and simated in monetary terms. However, several
of the Impacts felt withinh the catchm_t areas cannot be quanified due to the lack of data, as well as
diffultdes in aUtibuting their costs to flooding. In other cases, it is clearly impossible to assign any
values on qualitative factors. In addion to local impacts, drainage improvements will have city-wide
impact, partculaly where the eliminaon of flooding results in the removal of constraints to traffic
between and within other areas of the city.
2.    To overcome the lack of reliable and up-to-date data, surveys have been carried out at the
local level, and subjective judgments have been made based on an analysis of documents collected and
discussions with relevant authoritis and local inhabitants. The basis for the evaluation is to assess the
direct and indirect costs of the project, with a particular emphasis on the costs of mitigation entailed
by the conuction and improvement works of the drains, and to measure these against the project
beneft resulting from the eiminaon of the damage and inconvenience caused by the present
flooding sitwation. The construction costs of the drainage systems have been estimated from the
vari  studies and up-dated to June 1992 and expenditure has been phased over period until 1995.
An esdmated is also made of m _aiece costs necessary.
3.    The analysis is carried out on a definition of a 'with n and 'without" project case for each of
the storm water drainage systems. An initil assessment of the extent of the flooding was made
hrough site visits and surveys carried out in conjunction with the enginering departments of the
various local governments covering the catchment areas, i.e., Mushin, Surulere, Lagos Mainland, Eti-
Osa, Oshodi/isolo and Lagos Island.
4.    The approach adopted in the estimation of benefits in the "with" against the "without" project
situation is a combination of direct osing of damage and related costs, and the use of hedonic
pricing as an indication of the likely impact of the project through a comparison of property values in
flooded and non-flooded areas. Estimates have been made of probable rental values of a sample of
buildi   and the assmdon make that these values reflect the costs of flooding to these buildings.
Estmaions have also been made of "indirect" costs which result from flooding in such areas as
inconvenience and time delays, which result in loss of incomes and reduction in productivity.
5.    Flooding also causes a deterioration of road surfaces, with consequent increases in vehicle
operig costs (VOC). These can be measured in the direct increases in operation as well as damage
to vehicles. An Indirect impact of higher VOCs will be felt in increased transport costs which will be
reflected In higher market prices for goods and commodities. Another ana of dis-benefits of flooding
is the impact on health. TheoreticWily, this impact could be measured by establishing a corrlation in

the different flooded areas between the prevace of water-bor  and insect-bo   disease, and the
incidenc, of flooding. The  v    t  mpact migative measures have bee quantified and taken
into account in the cost-benefit any.
6.    Costs are based on the figures in the man teport with an allowance of 20 percent to cover
engineeig, management, ight-of-way, etc. Maintenance costs are based on the proposed length of
the drage dhannels, and on the foowing assumptions: () routne mantena    Is based on the
clearance of 50 linear meters per person per day and a salary of N70.00; (II) annual maintenace
costs are based on N25.00 per linear meter; Qii) to cover for specil matnance, an allocation of
1 percent of capital co  is made. Iho mainta    fbr System 5   rulern   Camnel) is based on
dredgig costs; assuming a cost of removal of N63 per m?, and the removal of 10 percent of the
volume of the channels involved, i.e., 100,000 mn every four year, the raual cost is estimated at
N 1.6 milion per year.
7.    Costs of migation measures have been esimated for two majr Items - traffic delays during
consruction and demolition of strucres in the Rights of Way.
a.    Traffic Disruption
In order to cost this impact it is assumed that in a wors case sceno, delays on the main
roads wil be exeienced over a period of four months, during which one lane at a time will
be closed. Based on the asuumptions of the value of time, and passenger breakdown as
discssed below, the costs over a three-week period ae estimated as fol -ws:
Lagos Maiand                            N53.7 million
system 5                                 N5.0 miion

lagos Isand                              N5.0 million
b.     Estimates of Stctures located in the igts of Way
The other major -cost associated with the projects is the demolition of structures within the
rights of way, and the compensation payable for the relocation of people. Site visits and
surveys of typical stetches of the various drais have been carried out, and the results used as
indicators of the likely costs.
c.    Summary of Costs of Migating Measur
These factors are estimated in the following Table and are included in the cost/benefit
evuations below. The cost of access roads is included in the overall cost estimates for the
project.

8.    A key bftor in the   maon of bfit is, therefre, tie duration and frequency of flooding
in the areas und             F  the purposes of the esmatin of benefits, i s proposed to us
an average of five flooding per yea. lbe survey among loca government officials indicates t  the
duration of flooding shows a laW  vaiadon fom a few hous to a few week. le estimadons are
used in the waluation of the differe  catm     area in order to caluat the disnefts for each

9.    Mm damag caumse by each flooding will be reflected prcipally in structural damage to

Data collected on the roads flooded in the various catimt areas is presented in the
evaluations of the differet dreai   systems. Estimates are made of the extent to which these are
primary, secodr and negborhood roads.
b.    Tlme Savinp
13.   The deteoration of road urces by flooding results in reduction of speeds, and consewent
dme delays.  provement of drainage will eliminate road blockages and delays. The level of
benefits will be linked to the number of paUsengers on the routes affected, and their relevant incme

eaning. The survey arred out on specfic roads, icated delays at certain points subject to
flooding of between 2 and 20 minue. For the purposes of the analysis, a delay fctor of 10 mimntes
per kilomer travded is used. Since It is not possible to calcolate tho diversion for each flooded
road, it is  sumed hat dditional coso are included in the vehidle operating cos.
Bedits to Industry and Commerce
14.   In view of the disocton caused to commerce nd industry, a survey has also bee cied
out to ldentlfy the industries located in te flooded areas. While no at     has been made to
quantify the benefts of Improved access to raw materials and finsed products, these are benefits
which should be taken into account.
Benets to Health
15.   In addition, mention must be made of ufacble  ctors such as improvements in health.
Such     me  have been ampted in the Lagos Island and Apapa Storm-watr Drainage Studies,
witout arriving at any  aifiable resut. The link between flooding and the iidden  of
watorne diseases has been clearly esblished on Lagos Island. In other areas in Apapa and the
Mainland, it has beea more difficult to assign a direct link beteen dieae and specific drainage
networks in view of the mobility of the population and the possbility of beig infected in other areas.
In the evaluation, no values have been assigned to these benefits.
Improvanents In Land Use
16. One mportataspect to consder i the impact of eooding on the land use of the property.
In gene  discussion with the Urban Planig Dpatment, it appears that tee will be little vaiation
In existg land use patterns; for example, the urban development policy is to maintain the tradional
aspects of exin residential nd commerial patrs in the northern part of Lagos IUland; better soil
conditions through de-flooding of the areas could lead to the construction of high rise commercial
office blocks, which could increase the value of the properties by between two to five times,
depending on the locaion.
Partiy Quaifed Benefits
17. A major proportion of the Port Traffic from Apapa and Tin Can Island is affected by the
flooded areas, resulting in botneck and added cost. In addition, many industries have had to
resort to exenditure on protetive measures runming to millions of Naira.  he benefits to improved
health are not costed but should be bome In mind. Over 20,000 cases of malaria were reported in the
out-paients D       of the Health Center, but it is difficult to assign the exact causes or location
where the disease was contced. Another benefit would be the improvement of hygiene in the catte
market at Malu Road. A notional amount of P40 million per annum is allocated as *other benefits
above to account for these im. his figure is likely to be a conservative esfimate.
