MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TDHE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THIE              DIRECTORS
ON A ]PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FrDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR THE LAGO DRAINAGE AND SANITATION PRO.ECl
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for SDR 44.5 million, the equivalent of
US$63.0 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years to help finance the
Lagos Drainage and Sanitation Project. The credit would be onlent to the Lagos State
Government (LASG) at standard IBRD variable interest rate for twenty years including five
years of grace, with LASG bearing the foreign exchange risk. The Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) is expected to provide a further US$2.0 million equivalent as
grant.
2.    Background. Under the Lagos Storm Drainage and Solid Waste Project (LSSWP)
which will close in mid 1993, financing was provided for refuse collection equipment and
depots for essentially all of Lagos city and for stormwater drainage for part of the city.
Technica assistance was provided for establishing the Lagos State Waste Management
Authority (LAWMA), designing sanitary landfills, establishing revenue generation systems
and for preparing detailed designs for further stormwater drainage in Lagos Mainland, Apapa
and Lagos Island, parts of the city which were not covered by the LSSWP drainage
component. LAWMA is now firriy established and is establishing new sources of revenue.
The Environment and Physical Planning Office (TEPPO) of Lagos State has also been
strengthened by its involvement in LSSWP and it is strongly promoting expansion of the
Lagos drainage system as the benefits of the first project become recognized. Other key
issues needing attention in the urban sector include environment and sanitation, transport and
traffic management, and the inadequacy of funding and procedures for maintenance.
3.    All of Lagos is subject to periodic flooding and needs dependable storm drainage.
This is especially so because in many areas storm drainage systems are also the only means of
saniary drainage. Extension of the drainage system is important as is its maintenance.
TEPPO (Drainage Division) is trying to improve its capacity to clear and maintain its
drainage system. Especially as water becomes more available under the Lagos Water Supply
Project, sewerage and other types of sanitation will be essential. It is doubtful, however, that
a large-scale sewerage system would be affordable in the near term and it would be difficult
for the State to maintain. A more incremental approach to the improvement of sanitation
would be preferable, and the State is interested in developing an appropriate program to
improve sanitation and general living conditions.
4.    hoect Objectv. The primary objective of the proposed project would be to
improve the long term ability of the Lagos metropolis to sustain and improve its function as
an urban center. It would also be to ;mprove living conditions in parts of Lagos which suffer
from regular immdation by improving stormwater drainage in accordance with long term
plans and as a follow-up to the previous project. The project would support initial steps in
upgrading other urban services by prepaing plans, feasibility studies and designs for urban
upgrading, and improving human waste and wastewater disposal, and would continue to
improve solid waste management by providing fiuther support to LAWMA for organization
and system development.

5.    Prject Description. Major physical components of the project include (i)
reconstruction, dredging, regrading and aligning existing drainage on Lagos Mainland
(US$28.5 million or 33.2% of project cost); Lagos Island (US$8.0 million or 9.3%); and
Apapa (US$14.6 million or 17.0%); and (ii) support for a program of maintenance of xisting
drains (US$11.7 million or 13.6%). In addition, the project will include: (i) technica.
assistance and training to upgrade drainage maintenance capability (including assistance with
maintenance contracting), for design of future drainage investment projects, and for
construction supervision (US$4.1 million or 4.8%); (ii) preparation of plans, feasibility
studies and designs for future developments in sanitation including conventional sewerage
where appropriate, training and supply of laboratory equipment for pollution monitoring
(US$6.0 million or 7.0%); (iii) technical assistance and training for the newly created Urban
Renewal Board to review its charter and plan its development strategy, to prepare an urban
renewal project and undertake a demonstration project (US$3.7 million or 4.3%); (iv)
assistance to further develop the city's resource mobilization capacity (US$2.1 million or
2.5%); (v) assistance with development of a mapping ability for Lagos (US$2.0 million or
2.3%); and (vi) further assistance to the LAWMA for development of a transfer station and
waste disposal site, provision of additional equipment and spare parts, and organizational
development (US$5.1 million or 6.0%). Technical assistance primarily focussed around
improvement in sanitation and living conditions for the people of Lagos and strengthening
associated institutions is included in these figures at a total of US$14.1 million, of which
US$ 0.8 million would be for policy support, US$8.7 million for project preparation and
assistance with implementation, and US$4.6 million for institutional development. A
summary of estimated project costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule A,
procurement and disbursement methods at Schedule B, a timetable of key processing events at
schedule C, and the status of Bank group operations in Nigeria at Schedule D. Maps are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11307-UNI, dated May 10, 1993, is being
distributed separately.
6.    IDA would finance US$63.0 million, or 76.3% of total projects costs excluding duties
and taxes. This would all be onlent by the Federal Government to Lagos State under IBRD
conditions, the State bearing the foreign exchange risk. The Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA) is expected to cofinance US$2 million equivalent worth of planning and design
work for sewerage. Local costs of US$20.8 million equivalent would be financed by the
LASG, which will provide binding instructions to the Federal Ministry of Finance to desduct
these funds from its Federation Account in monthly installments each of N9 million,
(US$0.36 million equivalent) fior 18 months and then increasing to N12 million (US$0.48
million equivalent) and deposit them into a project account. LASG would adjust this amount
as appropriate to meet project needs.
7.    Project npementation. The project would be implemented by TEPPO assisted by
consultants who would also be responsible for construction supervision. The Director of
Drainage would be responsible for the physical investment cc'.onents and project
coordination. This arangement is considered to be an impro ement over that for the previous
project where a separate office managed the project. There is now considerable experience in
the State in implementing Bank assisted projects.
8.      I l. A major component of the pioject would address the problems
of maintenance of drains, and developing the ability to keep them clear. The success of the
LAWMA under the first project in clearing garbage from city streets has had a significant



-3 -
impact on the State's abUity to minimize drain blockage, and justifies continued support to
that authority. The project will help to establish a maintenance culture' within LASG by
financing maintenance by contract, with the portion to be financed by the credit reducing over
time. The initial LASG contribution will require to be deposited into a maintenance account
prior to disbursement from the credit for maintenance.
9.    Lessons Learned from Previous Prolects. The Bank has helped fmance two previous
infrastructre projects in Lagos, the Lagos Sol d Waste and Stormdrainage Project (Ln 2620-
UNI, approved September 1985), and the Lagos Water Supply Project (Ln 2985-UNI,
approved July 1988). Both are ongoing and no Project Completion Report has yet been
produced. The first helped finance the upgrading of stormwater drainage in parts of Lagos
mainland, and solid waste collection and disposal for essentially the entire Lagos metr.-politan
area, including support for the establishment of an autonomous authority (the LAWMA) and
for introduction of revenue collection arrangements including the enumeration of all
beneficiaries in Lagos and the development of a billing and collection system. The project
also developed and introduced a property tax system which now helps to finance the Local
Government Authorities. The project suffered serious procurement delays during the early
stages of its implementation but is now close to completion. It has had a huge impact on
cleaning up the previously ubiquitous piles of garbage which blocked streets and drainage
channels in Lagos, and has significantly reduced flooding in the areas served by its drainage
component The Lagos Water Supply Project has also had significart procurement delays in
construction of the secondary and tertiary distribution system; however the water production
and transmission works are now complete and progress is now being achieved with finishing
construction and institutional development components of the project. The most significant
lessons learned from these projects concern the need to give detailed attention to procurement
planning and implemenmtion, and to ensure that institutional development components are
given adequate early attention. The LASG and its implementing agency now have
considerable experience with Bank procurement requirements and serious delays are not
anticipated with the proposed project.
10. Procurement delays have been caused by several factors, including poor or non-
existent procurement planning, preparation of detailed designs not being commenced until
after project initiation, poor project management, interference within the government in tender
evaluation and recommendation, and lack of understanding of the Bank's procurement
procedures. For the proposed project, detailed designs and bidding documents are available
for Lagos Island and Apapa drainage, prepared under the previous project, and tenders have
already been invited. Documents for Lagos Mainland and Surelere are expected to be
available by September. Procurement packaging has been clearly identified and scheduled.
Consultant proposals for construction supervision have been invited. Proposed contracts are
smaler and simpler than several of the problematical contracts under the previous loans.
With the election of a new State Government, a more conscientious and accountable approach
to development is apparen
11.   Previous Nigerian infrastructure projects have also suffered from lack of counterpart
finds. It is now standard practice to require that these fnds be deducted by the Federal
Ministy of Finance (FMF) from the state's Federation Account in monthly installments and
deposited into a project account, and that states give binding authority to the FMF to do this
throughout the project to cover local cost requiremen  (para. 6). Such a procedure has been
agreed under the new project. Financial control has at times been poor under the previous



-4 -
projects. More recently TEPPO has retained the services of a consultant project accountant,
and this will continue under the new project with strengthened duties of financial control.
12.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project has been designed in the light of the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which was discussed at the Board on April 13,
1993. The Bank's basic objective in Nigeria is to promote sustainable poverty reduction.
This objective is supported by policies and approaches that promote efficient growth,
generating employment and providing basic social services. At the same time, the Bank's
assistance strategy is tailored to meet the present realities of a large, slow moving portfolio,
the uncertainties created by the political transition and slippages in economic management,
and Nigeria's limited creditworthiness. Improving implementation and maintaining a modest
and tightly focussed lending program is a fundamental part of the overall strategy of the Bank.
Within this context, the Lagos Drainage and Sanitation Project, forms part of the Bank's
program of assistance to develop Nigeria's infrastructure as an essential element in its overall
economic development. The project is designed to improve basic living standards for people
living and working in flood prone areas. Health hazards due to flooding by sewage and
accumulated garbage would be reduced; employment would be generated through 4n annual
program of drainage maintenance by contract; and improvements in public sector management
would be pursued through technical assistance for organization and system development for
key agencies. The project also includes implementation of a demonstration urban renewal
project which could be replicated throughout Lagos to improve living conditions for the urban
poor. The project will permit the Bank to continue its involvement with the development of
urban infrastructure in Lagos, the largest city in Sub-Saharan Africa. The project is expected
to be disbursed in five years, which is shorter man the standard profile for similar projects in
Nigeria. The shorter timeframe is feasible because of the simplicity of project design and the
advanced state of preparation of major components. In addition, detailed attention was given
to procurement planning and implementation early in project preparation to help alleviate the
types of procurement difficulties and subsequent disbursement lags encountered under
previous projects.
13.   Actions Agreed. Bidding documents for Lagos island and Apapa have already been
finalized and consultant proposals for supervision have been invited. LASG has allocated
sufficient funds for drain maintenance in the 1993 budget. At negotiations agreement was
reached that LASG will: (i) put in place a mechanism for financing and carrying out drain
maintenance, by contract (para. 8); (ii) continue to employ a capable project accountant and
financial controller; (iii) incorporate appropriate clauses into specifications to minimize
negative environmental impacts during construction (para. 14); (iv) employ a consultant
familiar with local conditions to ensure that IDA requirements are met with regard to
relocation of affected residens, and properly compensae affected residents before relocation
is required; and (v) undertake a mid term review focussed on project management, project
implementation progress, maintennce, and counterpart funds availability. Conditions of
effectiveness would be: (i) submission of bidding documents for contracting of drain
mainteance; (ii) appointment of consultants for supervision; (iii) signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Federa Government and Lagos State; (iv) establishment of the project
account with regular deposits from the Federation Account (para. 6); and (v) deposit of the
initial installment into the project account. Conditions of disbursement will be: (i) for two
drainage components involving resettlement, approval by the Bank of relocation and
compensation plans for people affected by the drainage investment components amd



-  -
satisfactory progress in the execution of the ressettlements; and (ii) for maintenance, adequate
provision by LASO of counterpart funds.
14.   Environmental Asfects. The project has been classified as environmental category B.
It consists largely of realigning, regrading and clearing existing roadside and other urban
drains and no significant permanent detrimental environmental impac. has been identified.
The impacts identified include disruption during construction, particularly where major
highway crossings are involved, disposal of material dredged from existing channels which
might possibly contain hazardous waste material previously discharged to the channels, and
reloc-ation of a small number of buildings, most of which are temporary structures. The first
two of these matters will be minimized by appropriate restrictions in the works specifications.
Relocation has been minimized by attention to detailed design. One permanent and 31
temporary structures will need to be removed, however residents are expected to be able to
resettle in the same area. Compensation and relocation costs will be paid. Major beneficial
environmental impacts are indicated below in para. 16.
15.   Pro&r  Objective Categories. Many of the beneficiaries of the project are poor
urban-dwellers of Lagos. Otner relevant objective categories are: Infrastructure and Urban
Development; Health; Public Sector Management; Environment.
16.   McotBenc. Major project benefits will accrue due to reduction in flooding of
dwellings, businesses, and transport corridors, reduced deterioration of roads, elimination of
unsightly asumulations of garbage in drains, and reduction in health hazards caused by
flooding by sewage. In the economic analysis, about 60% of the benefits derive from savings
in vehicle operating costs, 20% from increased rental values of properties, anid the remainder
from reduced road damage, time savings and other factors. It was not possible to place a
realistic value on health benefits. The average economic rate of return is estimated at 22%,
and varies between 13.6% and 32.6% for different components of the project. A reduction of
about 70% in the benefit from vehicle operating costs, or a 40% reduction in all benefits
would yield an ERR of 12%. About 1,300,000 people, many of them poor, live within the
catchment areas of the drainage works to be constructed, including about 225,000 in areas
directly subject to regular flooding. A further 1,400,000 people will benefit from reduced
disruption to travel and commerce in the city during the wet season.
17.   Risks. The project does not pose any unusual risks. The major risks identified are:
(i) that counterpart funds may not become available as required (para. 6); (ii) that the
necessary drain maintenance fimancing and actions will not continue beyond the life of the
project (para.8); and (iii) that studies in the sewerage/sanitation and urban upgrading fields
will not lead to sustainable investments. The first of these has been addressed by requiring
deduction at source from the Federation Account; the second by establishing procedures which
can be easily repeated and by involvement of the private sector; and the third, to the extent
possible, by the participatory approach adopted.

18.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

NIGERIA - EMPLEMENTATION ISS$
The Department has taken several actions to deal with generic implementation issues such as weak
institutions and project management, slow procurement, and inadequate counterpart funding. These actions
include: (a) appointment of a procurement specialist and a local accountant in the Resident Mission; (b)
appointment of Portfolio Managers in all sector divisions; (c) establishment of an implementation task force
to formulate actions to deal with cross-sectoral problems and to coordinate actions to clean-up the portfolio
through the redesign of projects, reallocation of funds to viable components and cancellation of loan
components which cannot be turned around; (d) a more pro-active role for the Resident Mission in
implementation by working even more closely with state-level officials; (e) increased emphasis on Sector
implementation Reviews (SIRs) to be followed by a redesigned Country Implementation Review (CIR). The
Resident Mission is also continuing efforts to meet with the new State Governors. In addition, a number of
new initiatives have been put in place to strengthen the implementation process. For example, a new
supervision strategy has been adopted for the agriculture sector; in order to engage state governments on
generic and sector issues in a more effective manner, task management for supervision is being allocated by
state rather than by project, as there are agricultural projects in all 30 states. Total disbursements in FY92
amounted to US$344.7 million compared with US$208.4 million in FY91.
A number of portfolio reviews have taken place since early 1992 to identify specific actions for slow
disbursing projects, including possible cancellation of funds unlikely to be used in the next three years, the
use of upcoming loan closing dates to agree on timebound specific project actions, as well as areas for project
restructuring in accordance with Bank guidelines. Total cancellations of $220 million have already been
processed. Cancellation of a further US$65 million is under discussion with the Government.
In addition, new initiatives are being launched by the Department. The Region has made additional
resources available to help accelerate implementation of Nigeria's portfolio. These resources are being used
to strengthen the staff and operations of the Resident Mission which is playing an increasing role in project
supervision. Furthermore, eight projects have been identified for special emphasis based on implementation
lags. Half of these projects support the social sectors, and the average level of commitment is over $100
million. Special action plans have been developed for all eight projects to reflect the primary sources of delay:
decision-making, procurement and counterpart funding. Two local procurement analyst are in the process of
being recruited to strengthen procurement review at RMN.
To address the wider concerns of adequate budgetary allocation for timely counterpart funding, the
task force on implementation has developed a comprehensive table of counterpart funding requirements for
each ongoing project over the next two years broken down by federal and state level contribution. This has
been shared with the government for their use in financial planning. It is also intended to serve as a useful
budgetary guideline for the Transition Council and new civilian government.
