AND      _      OB OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR AN ANAZON BASIN MALARIA CONTROL PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$99.0 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 15 years maturity and would help finance a malaria control project in
the Amazon Basin of the country.
2.       Bground. The Brazilian Amazon is undergoing intense frontier
development. In the last two decades, hundreds of thousands of pioneers
have journeyed northward and westward to Amazonia bringing little more than
their families, their poverty and a vision of new and better lives ahead.
Few have had any experience, physical or cultural, with one of its harshest
realities, malaria. Rapid and disorderly migration has resulted in an
explosion ir. malaria, the incidence of which has been doubling every 3 to 4
years. In 1987, malaria cases in Brazil surpassed half a million. In-
migration has also led to a worsening health situation for Amerindian
populations as they are increasingly exposed to malaria and other endemic
diseases against which they have no acquired immunity.
3.       Malaria control is carried out by the Superintendency for Pu;blic
Health Campaigns (SUCAM), a well-organized federal agency with more than
40,000 personnel. SUCAN is noted for its strong staff and line
organization, its excellent record in implementing endemic disease control
programs and its esprit de corps and ability to sustain programs in remote
areas under difficult conditions. Few public agencies approach SUCAlls
reputation for experience in the field. However, the rapid expansion of
farming, mining, and urban sites in Amazonia has created a new challenge for
SUCAM in the form of Tfrontier malaria" against which conventional malaria
control strategies are relatively ineffective. Conventional strategies rely
heavily on house spraying with DDT, but many new residents in Amazonia live
in dwellings without walls. Conventional strategies have included limited
attention to community involvement; but such involvement is necessary if new
settlements are not to create new habitats for the mosquitos, resulting in
increased incidence and growing resistance to conventional (curative)
chemotherapy. SUCAM, therefore, needs to adopt an adjusted malaria control
strategy.   This strategy, which SUCAM has already begun to develop and
implement, will employ a broad range of interventions including new methods
of vector control and more emphasis on public information and education.
The strategy requires strengthening of SUCAM's institutional capacity for
training and community education, innovative vector control, and operational
research.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's current strategy for
Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage growth and
social development in the context of macroeconomic stability with an
emphasis on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the
public sector, and appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to
the poor. In health, the Bsnk's strategy is to strengthen Government's



2
capacity to deliver such 'public good' services as endemic disease control,
particularly when such services directly benefit the poor. The Bank's
involvement is important to the success of the project in three ways:
first, in providing guidance in the development of a multi-faceted, low-
cost set of interventions; second, in supporting the institutional
development of SUCAM; and third, in broadening the institutional basis for
malaria control to involve institutions other than SUCAM including State
Secretariats of Health. In addition, the economic benefits of reducing the
incidence of malaria complement other Bank-financed projects which support
small-scale agriculture in the region.
5.         Proiect Obiectives.  The general project objective is to
develop and implement an adjusted malaria control strategy for the Amazon.
The specific project objectives are: (i) to reduce malaria to a level no
longer constituting a public health problem and to reduce the risk of its
re-introduction to areas where transmission has already been interrupted;
and (ii) to support the institutional development of SUCAM.
6.         Prolect Description.  The project is comprised of two
components: (i) a Malaria Control Program which will include
epidemiological and entomological surveillance, treatment of patients,
education and community mobilization activities, intradomiciliary spraying
and other vector control activities, endemic disease control activities for
Amerindian areas, and environmental sanitation works (78? of total project
cost); and (ii) an Institutional Development Program for SUCAM, to include
the acquisition of computerized information systems, development of in-
service training, and exp4nsion of operational research (22X). Within
SUCAM, the project will be located in the Coordination Unit of Projects
Management (COGEP) which also manages the Bank-financed Northeast Endemic
Disease Control Project. The total cost of the project is estimated at
$US198.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$61.5 million
(31.0?). Breakdowns of costs and financing are shown in Schedule A, and
amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. These
schedules, maps, and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7535, dated April 21,
1989, are attached. Retroactive financing in an amount not to exceed US$6
million is recommended to finance start-up costs of the project initiated
after appraisal, November 1, 1988.
7.         Actions Aareed.    Evidence has been provided by Government
that adequate counterpart funds for the project have been included in the
Government budget for 1989. The Government has also agreed on the
following actions: (i) to maintain a project manager with experience and
qualifications acceptable to the Bank; (ii) to maintain a Research Steering
Committee; (iii) to complete entomological studies by June 30, 1990
including an implementation schedule for source reduction projects; (iv) to
appoint a public health specialist with experience in malariology to each
of the Regional Directorates in Amazonia by July 31, 1990, and (v) if
necessary, to provide for acquisition of contract staff by states and
municipalities (allowing for payment of better wages and higher per diems
for field work).

8.         Prolect Benefits.  The project is urgently needed in view of
the deteriorating malaria situation vith its high costs in terms of human
health and reduced agricultural productivity. The project will benefit
over 16 million persons who are at high risk for malaria including
Amerindians. Morbidity and mortality from malaria will be greatly reduced
end the chances of reintroduction into areas where it has been under
control will decline. Reductions in agricultural productivity due to high
malaria morbidity will be reversed, complementing other Bank-financed
projects in the region that support small farm agriculture. The
strengthening of SUCAM as an institution will improve its capacity to
control other diseases as well.
9.         Proiect Usks.  Low salaries, in addition to harsh and
occasionally dangerous working conditions, may hamper SUCAM's efforts to
contract the required staff to carry out proj^t field operations in a
timely fashion. To minimize this risk, Government will, when necessary,
arrange for contract staff to be used by states and municipalities, which
offer better wages and higher per diems, with reimbursement by SUCAM from
loan proceeds.
10.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
