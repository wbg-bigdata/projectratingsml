INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO GUYANA FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recomaendation on a pro-
posed development credit for the equivalent of US$4.4 million to the
Cooperative Republic of Guyana for a highway project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank made a loan for agricultural credit in 1961 in the
amount of US$0.9 million (net of cancellations) to the former colony
of British Guiana, with the guarantee of the United Kingdom. This
loan has been repaid in full.
3.        Since Guyana became independent in 1966, the Bank Group has
lent US$18.4 million to Guyana, US$1 3.3 mi1li.on from the Bank and
US$5.1 million from IDA. The undisbursed balances under these loans
and credits amount to US$10.9 million and US$4.5 million respectively.
Almost 60 percent of this lending has been for sea defenses, about
30 porcent for education and the remainder for livestock. A summary
statexmnt of Bank loans and IDA crldits to Guyana as at Pebruary 29,
1972, is attached as Annex T.
4.        After some initial delays, progress on tha first sea defense
project has been satisfactory and over one-half of it is complete.
All preparation work on the second project has been completed and the
prequ.alification of contractors is underway; construction is scheduled
to begin in mid-year. The education project is about one year behind
schedule, but bidding has been completed and contracts are scheduled
to be let within the next two months, so that construction can start
by end-1972. Progress on the livestock project is satisfactory, and
the first loans to ranchers are about to be made.

5.        So far there have been no operations of the International
Finance Corporation in Guyana and no investments are under consider-
ation at present.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        Th3 last economic report (CA-4a) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on October 1, 1970. An economic memorandum
(CA-16a) is bAing ciru2ated( s3qparately.   A country data sheet
is attached as Annex II to this report.
7.        The 1970 economic report concluded that Guyanats economic
record in the past five years had been modest, but not unsatisfactory.
Since 1965, GDP in real terms had grown at an annual rate of just
over 4 percent, with mining, construction and government services as
the most dynamic sectors and agriculture increasing at about half
the rate of overall output0  This growth was achieved with the help
of heavy investment in mining and a steady growth of pulblic capital
formation, of which about one-third was financed out of public sav-
ings - reflecting a strong fiscal effort with an average ratio of
taxes to GDP of 19 percent. External assistance also rose sharply,
with a shift from grants to loans on concessionary terms.
8.        During the past fifteen months the political and economic
scene has been dominated by the Government's decision to nationalize
the Demerara Bauxite Co. Ltd. (DEYBA), the largest bauxite mining
company in Guyana, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Aluminum Company
of Canada, Ltd. (ALCAN). After five months of negotiations between the
Government and ALCAN on the terms of the take-over, the owmership
of DEMBA was transferred to the Government-owned Guyana Bauxite Company
(GUYBAU) on July 15., 1971. The terms of compensation are described in
paragraph 12 below.
9.        In my Report to the Executive Directors on a proposed loan
to Guyana for a second sea defense project, dated June 2, 1971, I
indicated (paragraph 13) that, before recommending any further Bank
lending, we would review the economic situation carefully in the light
of the developments in the bauxite sector, and that an economic mission
would visit Guyana when the outcome of the Government's negotiations
with ALCAN could be better evaluated. An economic mission visited
Guyana in September 1971 to review the effects of the DEMBA nationali-
zation and other far-reaching developments in the structure and organi-
zation of the economy which had taken place since the 1970 economic
mission; a further visit to update this information took place in
late February 1972.



10.       In 1970 the Government initiated a new set of policies
designed to alter Guyana's social and economic structu.re and organi-
zation. The new policies, which emphasize equity and self-reliance,
include a "meaningful local participation" in the exploitation of
natural resources, the adoption of the cooperative form of economic
organization and the intensification of efforts to develop and populate
the interior of the country. New tax measures have been introduced, a
national insurance scheme has been set up, a National Cooperative Bank,
in which the Government holds a majority share, has been established as
a commercial bank, and an External Trade Bureau has been set up and
assigned the exclusive right to import a list of products approaching
one-fifth of the value of total imports.
11.       The nationalization of DEMBA has been by far the most impor-
tant measure taken by the Government in implementing its new policies.
(Reynolds, the other bauxite mining company in Guyana, which is about
one-fifth the size of GUYBAU, still remains in private hands.) In
recent years, DEMBA had provided almost one-f-ifth of GDP and of gross
domestic investment, two-fifths of the value of commodity exports
and about 10 percent of govermnent reverAues. Since GUYBAU took over
DEMBA last July, it has had to contend with considerable production,
financing and marksting problems, some of them inherited from its
predecessor. On the whole, GUYBAU has started out reasonably well.
Production has been maintained roughly at ti'e level achieved by
DEMBA during the first half of 1971 - or less than 5 percent below
the 1970 average for calcined bauxite and alumina, but almost one-
quarter below 1970 for metal grade bauxite - despite the departure
of about 75 senior officers since mid-1971 and exceptionally heavy
rainfalls in fall 1971. Despite a 5 percent decline in bauxite and
alumina prices - when the world market in aluminum greatly weakened -
GUYBAU achieved sales proceeds comparable to DEDBA's 1970 results
by raising prices for calcined bauxite by 14 percent and by selling
top-grade bauxite suitable for calcining at a premium. (Calcined
bauxite, for which Guyana has a virtual monopoly, is used for lining
refractory ovens.)  After-tax profits for the first six months of
GUYBAU's operations were about US$3 million, compared with DEMBA's
12 months after-tax profits for 1970 estimated at about US$5 million.
By early 1972 GUYBAU had repaid commercial bank advances and govern
ment advances, initially needed for working capital and had built up
its cash balances.
12.      Under the agreement reached between Guyana and ALCAN, Guyana
will pay US$53.5 million over twenty years, at an interest rate of
6 percent per annum (interest payments being subject to a withholding
tax of up to 25 percent), with the first payment due at the end of
1972. Some defenrent of payments is possible within the debt service
schedule agreed for the twenty-year period 1972-1991. On the basis
of the 1971 results, GUYBAU should be able to meet, on the Govern-
ment's behalf, the debt service obligations to ALCAN. It is more



difficult to predict tax and profit payments which GUYBAU will generate
for the Government. The sales of GUYBAU's output for 1972 and 1973
are only assured in part. However, the market for calcined bauxite
appears reasonably buoyant, and over one-half of planned metal grade
bauxite production is already covered by sales contracts. On the other
hand problems could still be encountered in the sale of alumi-na, par-
ticularly if the weakness of the alurinum market contirnues for some time.
In view of the marketing uncertainties which GUYBAU still faces, its
objective of reaching in 1972 a level of net income equal to that achieved
prior to nationalization may well not be possible. The medium-run out-
look is brighter, especially if GUYBAU retains its virtual monopoly in
the supply of calcined bauxite and alters its mix in favor of this product.
13.       Guyana's other principal natural resources are rice, sugar,
forestry and shrimping. Rice production is already concentrated in
local hands, mainly small producers. Sugar is produced mainly by
British companies, and in 1971 Guyana became the most important sugar
exporter of the Commonwealth Caribbean countries. With an almost 30
percent boost in the preferential price in the U.K. market, the Govern-
ment expects that the sugar companies will make a markedly increased
contribution to tax revenues from 1972 ornards - even more so now that
sugar producers, along with other exporters, have benefited from the
Government's decision to devalue the Guyanese dollar (in line with the
U.S. dollar) against sterling. In the forestry sector, the Government
recently bought the ailing Guyana Timber Company, owned by the Common-
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), and plans to rehabilitate anld
expand it.  A government-owned compaiW has also been established in
the potentially very profitable shrimping business.
14.       The Government's policy to increase its participation in the
economy is evident in the fiscal accounts. Public expenditures in 1971
amounted to 29 percent of GDP, against 19 percent six years earlier.
The share of the public sector in overall investment rose from one-
fifth in 1965 to almost two-thirds in 1971 when private investment,
particularly in mining, dropped off sharply. Public investment is
now equivalent to almost 12 percent of GDP. Between 1965 and 1970,
public sector savings increased from 1.14 to 5 percent of GDP. In 1971,
however, fiscal difficulties became evident. Whereas current expendi-
tures kept on rising by about 8 percent or slightly below the rate of
increase experienced in recent years, current revenues in 1971 were
actually lower than in 1970 mainly because of a poor sugar crop in the
preceding year, delays in income tax payments pending the outcome of
litigation on new taxes introduced in 1970, the cessation of income
tax payments by DEMBA after the first quarter of 1971 and stagnant
imports. The Central Government budget thus showed a current deficit
for the first time since 1965, and total public sector savings declined
to about one-third of the amount obtained in the previous year. Never-
theless, a substantial improvement in fiscal performance is likely for



- 5 -
1972. There will be substantially increased corporate tax payments
from sugar, and GUYBAU could begin to make a significant tax con-
tribution. Moreover, income tax collecticn procedures are being
improved. The Government is maiking a determined effort to slow
down the growth of current expenditures: measures have been taken to
put public enterprises on a sound commercial footing, and expenditure
controls have been introduced.
15.       The deterioration in the fiscal sector has not spilled over
into the balance of payments despite Guyanats open economy. Treasury
bills placed with the principal sugar producing companies helped in
financing the fiscal deficit. The remainder of the deficit was covered
by increased disbursements on external loans and borrowing fron the
banking system, mainly from the commercial banks. Banking system
credit to the private sector expanded only slightly during 1971, re-
flecting a low level of private investment, while private savings
continued to increase. Thus, the fiscal deficit was in effect financed
in good part by a transfer of private savings. A number of other
factors, some of them non-recurring, also help to explain why the
balance of payments did not record a deficit in 1971. The combination
of a good sugar crop, stagnant imports, a high level of disbursements
on long-term official assistance, the repatriation of DEMBA's pension
funds and some short-term borrowing abroad by the sugar companies, led
to a gain in external reserves of the banking system during 1971 of
samewhat more than US$5 million. Some fur-ther small improvement in the
present modest reserves (US$24 million, the equivalent of about two
months of imports) is to be expected for the current year. A sharp
expansion of sugar exports and the success of the program of fiscal
discipline are the key assumptions in this respect.
16.       The flow of bilateral external assistance was not interrupted
by the 1971 developments. Assistance from bilateral sources was pro-
vided by the United States (at a level of authorization of close to
US$10 million a year), by the United Kingdom (about US$5 million) and
by Canada (about US$4 million). USAID assistance is concentrated on
agriculture (mainly for rice production), some roads and water supply,
the U.K. has helped in financing sea defenses and social services;
CIDA has concentrated its capital aid on air transportation and education.
Considerable technical assistance is provided by the three major donor
countries, as well as by the UNDP and Germany. Guyana organized meetings
of an Aid Coordination Group in 1967, 1968 and 1969 and is planning
another meeting in mid-1972 after completion of the new development plan.
Coordination between the Government, the bilateral aid donors, UNDP and
the Bank Group has been satisfactory. Past loans and grants of the
principal agencies are summarized below. Guyana is not a member of the
Inter-American Development Bank.

USAID assistance has been for 40 years including 10 years of grace with
interest at 2.5 to 3 percent, except for one loan for 20 years at 3.5
percent. U.K. assistance has been for 25 years including 5 years of grace
with interest averaging 6 percent. CIDA has provided interest free funds
for 50 years including 10 years of grace.
17.       The Bank has discussed with the Government of Guyana possible
future Bank/IDA operations in selected priority fields in which otler
lenders have not shown an interest. In line with the conclusions of
the 1970 economic report, wihich emphasized the sectors with the greatest
production or cost-saving potential (agriculture, forestry, and fishing,
including sea defenses; electric power; telecommunications; roads; education;
and health), preparation work is proceeding on a power project and a
third sea defense project; possibilities of a forestry and a fisheries
project are being investigated with the help of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program; and the feasibility of an irrigation and drainage rehabilitation
project is being studied with USAID financing.
18.       Guyana still receives substantial funds on concessionary terms
from its bilateral lenders, but of the Bank Group lending to date, 72
percent has been on conventional terms. The allocation of some IDA
funds to Guyana is justified on grounds of poverty, reasonably good
economic performance and limited creditworthiness. Per capita GNP is
about US$323, at which level the country is at the borderline of IDA
eligibility. However, Guyana's heavy dependence on external assistance,
its narrow resource base, and its uncertain balance of payments prospects
make its economy extremely vulnerable to changes in factors which are
beyond the country's control.

PART III - THE PROJECT
19.       The Guyana transport system is concentrated in and along
the sugar and rice growing areas of the coastal plain where 90 percent
of the population live. The 1,600 km road network carries most of
the traffic, and road transport is becoming increasingly important.
With the coast pierced by four major rivers, coastal and inland
shipping are also important, and many towns and settlements can be
reached only by this means. Two minor railways also operate along
the coastal strip, but they are unecornomical and the Government
plans to phase them out. The air service, although relatively in-
significant, is the only easy way of reaching the remote interior.
20.       Bank Group lending strategy for Guyana supports the Govern-
ment's aim to develop and expand agriculture, and the proposed pro-
ject will assist development of the agricultural area west of Georgetown,
enabling produce to be transported to market centers and the capital
at reduced costs. Further investments in transport will be identified
under a comprehensive transport plan to be prepared by a transport
planning unit which will be set up under the proposed project.
21.       In 1969 a general transport review was undertaken by con-
sultants financed by the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA). The same consultants made feasibility studies of improve-
ments to complete the coastal road system, and these studies formed
the basis for the Government's request for Bank Group assistance in
the proposed highway project. Detailed engineering for the project
was also financed by CIDA and prepared by consultants.
22,       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project, Guyana
PTR-110la" is being distributed separately. A Credit and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III, and two maps show the location of
the proposed road construction. The project consists of:
(a)   improvement of four road sections totalling about
34 miles located west of Georgetown between the
Demerara and Essequibo Rivers;
(b)   supervision and installation of weighbridges;
(c)   consulting services for (i) supervision of pro-
ject road improvement works; (ii) feasibility
studies of about 200 miles of roads; (iii) de-
tailed engineering of about 100 miles of roads;
(iv) a management study of the Ministry of Works,
Hydraulics and Supply (MWHS); and (v) technical
assistance to a transport planning unit in the
Ministry of Economic Development (MED).



- 8 -
The project would be implemented over a three-year period under the
supervision of the MWHS through its Roads iLvision and, for the
planning unit, under the 14ED.
23.        The project roads are in a densely cultivated and populated
coastal region west of Georgetown. Proposed iraprovements include
curve realignment, shoulder widening and pavement strengthening.
Shoulders will be paved to accommodate slow-moving traffic and
pedestrians. Two unpaved feeder roads will be raised and paved.
To assist the Government in enforcing vehicle and weight regulations,
the project also includes procurement and installation of weighbridges.
24.        A major objective of the project is to improve the organi-
zation and operations of the MNHS, which is charged, among other
functions, with the development and maintenance of Guyana's national
highway system. Consultancy services for a management study are
therefore included under the project. The management study will give
special emphasis to road maintenance through the development of a
maintenanca policy and the preparation of a five-year program to
include improvements of both maintenance organization and operations.
25.        Another objective of the project is the development of a
national transport strategy and the identification of future transport
investment priorities.   The technical and economic basis for such a
transport strategy would be doveloped by a newly established trans-
portation planning unit located in the Ministry of Economic Developmnent,
the ministry in charge of overall government planning.   This aspect
of the project takes particular importance in view of the difficult
choices facing the Government in the transport sector. Further road
development will have to be geared to a carefully staged opening up
of the interior, now that the first phase of ths highway system along
the coast is nearing completion. In order to translate such a national
transport strategy into future investments, the project includes con-
sulting services for feasibility studies of about 200 miles of roads
which will be selected by the Government, in agreement with the Assoc-
iation, after the identification work has been done by the transport
planning unit. As a next step final engineering will be undertaken
for about 100 miles of high priority roads chosen from those selected
by the Government, in agreement with the Pssociation, on the basis
of the above feasibility studies.
26.        The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated
at US$8.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.6 million
or 68 percent of the total cost. The foreign cost will be financed by
an IDA credit of US$4.4 million and a grant of US$1.2 million from the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The IDA credit will
finance the road improvement and supervision works, weighbridges and
detailed engineering. The Government has made a formal application to



- 9 -
the UNDP for a grant to finance the feasibility studies, consulting
services and technical assistance, with the Bank Group acting as
executing agency. A commitment by UNDP to provide the grant is a
condition of credit effectiveness. Local costs will be met by the
Government. Roadworks and weighbridge contracts will be awarded
after international competitive bidding following normal Bank
procedures. Tariffs are not levied on goods procu.r ed for govern-
ment projects financed by external loans or grants; there are
consequently no preferences in bid evaluation. Supervision of
roadworks and other expert services will be carried out by con-
sultants.
27.        Improvement of the road sections included in the proposed
project will yi-ld an internal economic rate of return of 15 percent.
This estimate is based on savings in vehicle operation and maintenance
costs alone. No account is taken of benefits accruing from time
savings to travellers and longer range benefits which are expected
to accrue from the institutional improvements related to the project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
28.        The draft Credit Agreement between Guyana and the Association,
the Recommendations of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1
(d) of the Articles of Agreerment of the Association, and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed separ-
ately. The draft agreement conforn±s to the normal pattern for credits
for highway projects.
29.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECO%BENDATION
30.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.
