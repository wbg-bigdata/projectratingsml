APPRAISAL OF
A HIGHWAY PROJECT
GUYANA
Summary and Conclusions
i.        Since Guyana achieved independence in 1966, the Government has
placed strong emphasis on improvement of the transport system. During the
first 4 years of the initial Development Program (1966-71), about one-third
of total public investment was devoted to transport. Most of the expendi-
ture, including substantial assistance from the United States Agency for In-
ternational Development, was for roadworks, but some also was for improved
air transport to the remote interior. Guyana's next Development Program
(1972-76) is still being formulated, but the Government has indicated that
it wishes transport investment to remain substantial and to be oriented
toward development of the agricultural sector. The proposed project will
be the first for highways in Guyana.
ii.       Guyana's transport system includes highway, shipping, railway, and
air services, but no formal organization currently undertakes transport plan-
ning and coordination. The Government realizes the importance of relating
transport development to national economic goals, and intends to set up a
central transport planning unit for this purpose. Under the proposed pro-
ject, technical assistance will be provided to the unit, whose major duties
will be to: (a) collect and interpret transport information, (b) formulate
and coordinate transport policy, and (c) identify and prepare priority trans-
port investments.
iii.      With transport shifting from primary reliance on rail and shipping
to roads, the Government has been improving and extending the highway network
in the narrow coastal plain where 90% of the population is living and 80% of
the Gross Domestic Product is produced. The Government wishes to provide
principal communities in the coastal plain with dependable low-cost transport,
and is relying primarily on better highways to achieve this objective.
iv.       Improvement under the project of the West Coast and West Bank Roads,
together witlh two adjoining feeder roads, will contribute substantially to
the coastal road improvement program and further agricultural development in
the area. The preparationi work for the four roads, including feasibility
stu(dies and subsequent detailed engineering, was financed by the Canadian
Interniational Development Agency. Under the proposed project, the roads
will be realigned where necessary and widened to relieve congestion, deteri-
orating pavements will be strengthened, and weighbridges will be provided to
help the Government enforce vehicle weight limitations. The road improvements
should yield a combined Internal Economic Return (IER) of 15%, with individual
IERs ranging from about 13% to 19%.



- ii -
v.        The project also includes feasibility studies and detailed en-
gineering of roads and consulting services for organizational and operational
improvements. Feasibility studies will be made of about 200 mi of roads,
followed by detailed engineering of about 100 mi of high priority roads
identified by the studies, which could provide the basis of a future highway
construction project. The consulting services will be provided to the Min-
istry of Works, Hlydraulics and Supply (MWHS) and its Roads Division.
vi.       The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at
US$8.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.6 million or 68%
of the total cost. The foreign cost will be financed by an IDA credit of
US$4.4 million and a grant of US$1.2 million from the United Nations De-
velopment Programme (UNDP).  The IDA credit will finance the road improve-
ment and supervision works, weighbridges, and detailed engineering. The
Government has asked the IDP for a grant to finance the feasibility studies,
consulting services, and technical assistance, with the Bank Group acting as
Executing Agency. A commitment by UNDP to provide the grant is a condition
of credit effectiveness. Local costs will be met by the Government. Road-
works contracts will be awarded after international competitive bidding fol-
lowing normal Bank Group procedures. Supervision of roadworks and other
expert services will be carried out by consultants. The MWHS Roads Division
will be responsible for project execution.
vii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.4 million to the
Government of Guyana on the usual terms.



APPRAISAL OF
A HIGHWAY PROJECT
GUYANA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed Highway Project would be the fifth Bank Group project
and the first for transportation in Guyana. It is based on feasibility studies
financed by the Canadian International Development Association (CIDA) and
carried out by the consulting firm De Leuw Cather (Canada). To help finance
the project, the Covernment of Guyana has requested a credit from the Asso-
ciation and a grant from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
1.02      The proposed project comprises:  (i) improvement of four road
sections totalling about 34 mi; (ii) supervision of improvement works; (iii)
purchase and installation of vehicle weighbridges; (iv) feasibility studies
of about 200 mi of national highways; (v) detailed engineering of about 100
mi of high priority roads resulting from the studies; (vi) consulting ser-
vices to improve the organization and operations of the Ministry of Works,
Hydraulics and Supply (MWHS); and (vii) technical assistance to a central
transport planning unit.
1.03      The project cost is estimated at US$8.2 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$5.6 million. Of the foreign exchange component,
the Association has been asked to provide a credit of US$4.4 million for
items (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) in para. 1.02 and the UNDP a grant of US$1.2
million for items (iv), (vi) and (vii). Agreement by the UNDP to provide
this grant is a condition of credit effectiveness. The Government has asked
the UNDP to arrange for the Bank Group to act as the Executing Agency.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. M. W. Dickerson (Engineer),
T. Neuner, and T. Horie (Economists), who appraised the project in October
1971. It was edited by Mrs. P. Valad.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   The Cotintry and its Economy
2.01      Guyana, on the northeast coast of South America, is bordered by
Venezuela, Brazil, and Surinam. The country is about as large as the United
Kinigdom, and is divided into three major topographic regions: the low coastal
plaini, the hilly belt with dense forests, and mountains interspersed by savan-
nalis in the west and south. The major rivers are navigable only a short
distance inland, and transport beyond the coastal plain is difficult.  The
only reliable transport to the interior is by air.



-2-
2.02      Economically, the most important region is the 270 mi long and 10-40
mi wide coastal plain. With only 5% of the land area, it contains 90% of the
population and produces about 80% of the Gross Domestic Product. Rich alluvial
soil has made the coastal plain the agricultural center where sugar and rice
are grown. Much of the region is below high-tide level and protected against
flooding by dikes. Canals for drainage and irrigation crisscross the region.
The alluvial soil and numerous waterways make road construction expensive.
2.03      Less than 100 mi inland, bauxite is mined at several deposits and
shipped to the coast by river. The interior is sparsely settled, with a few
cattle ranches in the savannahs near the Brazilian border and some scattered
gold and diamond mines. To relieve population pressure in the coastal plain,
the Government wants to open up the interior. Therefore, with "self-help"
(voluntary labor) and a minimum of machinery, it is constructing a road along
a north-south corridor toward the Brazilian border. So far, only a few set-
tlers have been attracted.
2.04      To keep the export economy functioning efficiently and to encourage
agricultural expansion, good roads are needed to transport commodities to the
ports. For the immediate future, it appears that the thrust of development
will remain concentrated in the coastal plain and the mining areas of the
nearby hinterland. 1/
B.   The Transport Sector
(a) General
2.05      Guyana's transport system is concentrated in and along the sugar
and rice-growing areas of the coastal plain, with very little traffic to or
in the interior. No estimates are available on total passenger or ton miles
moved, but roads carry most traffic and road transport is becoming more sig-
nificant. Next in importance are coastal and inland shipping, and many size-
able settlements can be reached only by this means. Two railways are now
operating, but they are uneconomical and will be phased out. Air service
is relatively insignificant, except to the remote interior.
2.06      Transport services are operated in the private and public sectors.
In the private sector, small operators of trucks and buses, hire cars 2/, and
vessels play a significant role. The Government, through its departments or
wholly-owned corporations, operates a variety of transport services, includ-
ing buses and trucks, ports and shipping, railways, and air services., Table 1
shows the transport operations of the Ministry of Communications (MC). Most
operations of the MC are in railways and shipping, and its role in highway
transport is small.
1/   IBRD/IDA, "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Guyana," Report
No. CA-4a, October 1, 1970.
2/   Unscheduled car transport of up to five passengers along established
routes.



- 3 -
2.07      Regulatory and pricing policies for transport services in the
private and public sectors appear to be inconsistent. Private operators
are free to make their own arrangements on rates and schedules on all ser-
vices except buses. In contrast, Government-operated transport is subject to
strict rules on fares, rates, and schedules. In most cases, it shows finan-
cial deficits. Detailed information on private sector operations is not
available, and it is impossible at this stage to assess the merits of these
apparently inconsistent policies. A review of transport policy will be un-
dertaken by the central transport planning unit (para. 2.20).
(b)  Road Transport and Highways
2.08      On present indications, Guyana's road transport industry serves
the demand adequately. The Government is expanding its bus transport by es-
tablishing a new corporation, Guyana Transport Services, and aims to extend
its services gradually on the coasts east and west of Georgetown (para. 2.14).
The Government also operates a few trucks and buses from Bartica into the
interior. Ilowever, most passenger and freight traffic is handled by private
operators of trucks, buses, and hire cars who are freely licensed to enter
into business. Hire cars probably handle many more passengers than buses.
Their rates exceed bus rates, but in the minds of many consumers the con-
venience and speed of tlleir services outweigh the added costs.
2.09      Details of the highway sector are given in Chapter III.
(c) Ports and Shipping
2.10      The capital, Georgetown, is the most important international port,
and handles over 3 million net registered tons of shipping annually. The Gov-
ernment provides pilotage and other harbor services, but nearly all wharves
are privately owned. A silt bar across the mouth of the Demerara River limits
shipping to vessels of 20 ft draught, and wharf depths are usually several
feet shallower. Despite these limitations, facilities are much better than
those at other ports in Guyana. The second port, New Amsterdam, handles about
20% of the traffic passing through Georgetown.
2.11      The Government operates ferries carrying about 6 million passengers
annually across the Demerara River at Georgetown and across the Berbice River
at New Amsterdam, as well as ships to islands, inland river points, and the
Essequibo Coast. While most passenger traffic has grown recently, cargo traf-
fic has declined. The overall deficit in Government shipping operations (about
C$1 million p.a.) is mainly attributed to losses on cargo business. Government
shipping operations would show better results if they were coordinated with
improved lhighlway services and if tugs and barges were used more effectively
instead of ships.
2.12      Private sector shipping includes a variety of ships, barges, and
punts plying the larger bodies of water and the canals in the agricultural
areas. No information is available on the size of these operations.



-4-
(d) Railways
2.13      Guyana's railways play a relatively unimportant role in the coun-
try's transport system. A few railways are used in mining operations. The
Government operates two common carrier railways along the coast: the East
Coast Railway, about 22 mi between Georgetown and Mahaica, and the West Coast
Railway, about 21 mi between Vreed-en Hoop (on the opposite bank of the
Denmerara River from Georgetown) and Parika. Freight represents a small part
of their business, and both units derive most of their revenues from passen-
gers. Tn 1970, revenues on the East Coast Railway failed to cover out-of-
pocket expenses by nearly G$1 million; on the West Coast Railway, the deficit
was about G$250,000. Passengers who continue to patronize the railways do so
because either the station happens to lie close to their homes or the contract
fares _/ are low.
2.14      The Government has decided, in principle, to close both railways
as soon as the existing parallel roads have been improved and adequate bus
services have been provided. A comparison of the costs of substituting buses
for rail services, undertaken by the consultants De Leuw Cather, confirmed
that buses could carry the present number of rail passengers at substantial-
ly lower cost and at the same level of service. The Government has already
closed part of the East Coast Railway, i.e., the track east of Mahaica to
Rosignol, and has brought a bus company into operation. The remainder of
the East Coast Railway is due to be closed during 1972. On the West Coast,
a 12 ml road section between Uitflugt and Parika is being reconstructed by
force account, hut progress has been slow. This section connects with one
of the project roads, and when both have been completed the Government will
be able to phase out the West Coast Railway. During credit negotiations,
an assurance was obtained from the Government that it will prepare by the
end of 1973 a plan to implement its decision to phase out the West Coast
railway.
(e) Aviation
2.15      A number of leading airlines service Guyana through the interna-
tional airport at Timheri, south of Georgetown. The Government wholly owns
the national carrier, Guyana Airways Corporation (GAC), which operates sched-
uled domestic services and some non-scheduled international services. It
also lhas rights to fly a scheduled service as far as New York. GAC operates
fronm Timheri into 30 short and mostly unsurfaced airfields located through-
out Guyana.
2.16      The GAC fleet consists of small aircraft, such as DC 3's and Twin
Otters, which can operate satisfactorily under existing conditions. The nav-
igational aids at Timheri and principal airfields are currently being im-
proved and extended under financing from CIDA. The Department of Civil
Aviation in the MC, which is responsible for Government airfields, has no
plans at present for major expansion of facilities.
1/ Low fares for multiple rides, especially for school children.



5-
2.17      Hours flown by the GAG increased from 1,550 in 1963 to 9,516 in
1969, and total revenues rose steeply. Nonetheless, operating results showed
losses (about G$1 million in 1970) because of the low charges to interior
development areas. GAC recently requested a subsidy on all services that,
for policy reasons, the Government wished to be offered at less than cost.
The Government has agreed in principle to begin this subsidy in 1972.
C.   Transport Planning and Coordination
2.18      Guyana is now completing its initial Development Program (1966-71),
which contained a list of high priority projects in the main economic sectors,
including transport. A new Program is being prepared for 1972-76, and prelim-
inary indications are that further transport projects (including the project
roads) will be on the list of high priority projects.
2.19      The Government currently does not carry out overall transport plan-
ning and no appropriate planning organization exists, either in the agency
responsible for overall economic planning, the Ministry of Economic Develop-
ment, or in the two Government agencies specifically charged with transport,
the Ministry of Communications (MC) or the Ministry of Works, Hydraulics and
Supply (M7iHS). The MC operates buses and trucks, ports and shipping, and
railways, and has jurisdiction over all aviation (including the GAC). The
tWliS is responsible for the public roads of the national highway network, as
well as for other public works (para. 3.05).
2.20      The Government has agreed to set up a central transport plan-
ning unit to: fill important gaps in transport information; review, form-
ulate, and coordinate transport policies; and properly plan transport in-
vestments. The unit will be the principal repository of transport expertise
and the main agency for identifying and evaluating transport projects. The
major duties of the unit are discussed in Annex A. A particular function
of the unit will be to review a tentative 5-year (1972-76) highway develop-
ment program, expected to cost about G$79 million (US$39.5 million). Al-
though the program is not based on a detailed economic analysis, it is ex-
pected to meet short-term needs.
2.21      The Unit will be located in the Ministry of Economic Development
and its staff will be Guyanese, assisted by two experienced transport econ-
oinists during the initial operating period. The Government has requested
finance under the project for the services of these two experts (para. 4.1n).
During credit negotiations, establishment of a transport planning unit, in-
cluding the arrangements, staffing, and proposed work program, was reviewed
and agreed.



- 6 -
III. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
k.  The Network
3.31      The existing highway network, shown in Map 1, totals about 1,600 mi;
[;-rails are given in Table 2. Only about 370 mi are paved, and many tracks
are passable only in fair weather. The system comprises national, provincial,
itid urban roads. National roads are roads and tracks maintained solely by
i-ii Government, provincial roads are maintained by local authorities, and
irban roads are the streets of Georgetown and New Amsterdam.
J.   Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.02      Statistics on motor vehicle registrations are shown in Table 3.
At the end of 1970, about 40,000 units (including motorcycles) were regis-
zered, or more than eight times the number in 1950. However, registration
iigures also include some scrapped vehicles, and the actual numbers in ser-
rice are considerably less.1/ Over the past 5 years, between 1,300 and 1,700
<.ars were imported annually, and the fleet grew at between 5% and 10% p.a.
iy comparison, gasoline and diesel oil imports together rose 8% p.a.
3.03      The MWIS conducts traffic counts on major roads twice each year
:or one week. Available data indicate considerable seasonal variations and
suggest the need for more frequent counts, additional counting stations, and
;upplementary surveys of traffic composition and origin and destination. Dur-
:,ng credit negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government that,
hased on recommendations to be made by consultants (paras. 4.08 and 4.09),
't will institute and operate an improved program of highway traffic count-
Ing and related data collection.
:;.04     The limits for permissible motor vehicle axle loads are over-
restrictive (11,200 lbs), but they are rarely enforced. Proposals to raise
the limit to a more realistic level to be enforced more strictly are under
Lonsideration by the Government.  During credit negotiations, these proposals
were reviewed and considered satisfactory as an interim measure. In addition,
assurances were obtained from the Government that, in conjunction with the
central transport planning unit, it will: (i) review and, if necessary,
amend legislation on vehicle loads and dimensions, in accordance with the
structural and geometric design of the highway network, and (ii) enforce
the legislation. To assist the Government in enforcement, weighbridges
w.ill be procured under the project (para. 4.05).
1/   In 1970, the actual number of cars, trucks, and buses was-estimated at
about two-thirds of the number shown as registered.



-7-
C.   Administration
3.05      The IWIIS is responsible for planning, constructing, and maintain-
ing public roads in the national highway network. It also is responsible
for other public works, such as sea defenses, buildings, and water supply
(Chart). The Roads Division is headed by a Chief Roads Engineer and is
staffed by 16 other qualified engineers at headquarters in Georgetown.
3.06      For construction supervision and road maintenance, the Roads Divi-
sion functions principally through nine MWHS District Offices. The District
Engineers in charge of these offices undertake not only highway duties but
also most other MWIIS functions. Conflicts of responsibilities inevitably
occur because of the many functions with which they are charged. Studies
to improve the operations of the Mechanical and Electrical Division and the
Supplies, Accounts and Audits Division are now underway by a technical assis-
tance team from the United Kingdom and a United Nations Advisor, respectively.
The Government wants to review the operations and organization of the entire
1191S, in particular to improve the functions of the District Offices and the
planning and operations of highway maintenance, and has requested consulting
services under the project for this purpose (para. 4.08).
3.07      Local authorities and town councils, which administer local and
urban roads, receive ad hoc technical assistance from both the Roads Division
and the District Engineers.  The proposed consulting services to the nWIIS for
organization and operations would review the possibility of creating a new
section witlhin the Roads Division to deal exclusively with local authority
assistance.
D.   Planning and Financing
3.08      Guyana does not have a fund earmarked to finance highway expendi-
tures; funds come from general revenues and foreign aid. The total amount
spent in 1970 on highways under the control of the MWIS was about G$12 mil-
lion (US$6 million). In addition, local authorities received Government
grants of about C$200,000 p.a., representing about 50% of the total capital
and recurrent expenditures for highways under their jurisdiction. Since 1966,
bilateral foreign aid for improvement and construction of highways has been
provided by the United States Agency for International Development (US A.I.D.)
(about US$20 million), the United Kingdom (about US$1 million), and CIDA
(ahout US$800,000). US A.I.D. has also agreed to contribute a further US$9
million between 1972 and 1975 for reconstruction of roads in and around
Georgetown.
3.09      Revenues from use and ownership of motor vehicles, shown in Table
4, accounted for 8% of total current budgetary receipts in 1970. The largest
part of these revenues was duties on imported motor vehicles, fuel, and re-
lated items, accounting for about a quarter of all import duties but only 6%
of the value of all goods entering Cuyana. At present, user charges meet
recurrent higlhway expenditures and provide about half the capital investments
on highways; they are adequate at the present level of expenditures, but will
bc reviewed on the basis of the investment recommendations of the proposed
transport planning unit (para. 2.20).



-8-
E.  Engineering
3.10      Highway engineering is the responsibility of the MWHS Roads Division
through an assistant chief engineer controlling four separate sections at head-
quarters: Soils, Materials, and Research; Survey; Geometric Design; and Struc-
tures. The sections are ably staffed and satisfactorily undertake detailed en-
gineering for locally-financed projects. Since early 1971, they assisted the
consultants, De Leuw Cather, in preparing the proposed project works. The
quality of the technical staff is high, but more are required to adequately
staff the Division. Foreign consultants are used to supplement engineering
capacity, but their work has been principally confined to major projects
financed by foreign aid. Highway and bridge standards are based on traffic
requirements and are satisfactory. However, construction specifications
for some recently completed roadworks appear to be excessive.
F.   Construction
3.11      Ilighway construction is administered by the Construction Section of
tlhe M.l1S Roads Division.  Of the G$32 million highway construction program be-
tween 1969 and 1971, about 60% was undertaken by contract and the remainder
by force account. Major contracts are currently confined to foreign aid pro-
jects, with force account undertaking locally financed works. Bridgeworks are
generally constructed by local contractors, and one local roadworks contractor
has developed by working as a subcontractor on a US A.I.D. project. The Gov-
ernment recognizes the need to build up the local contracting industry, and is
providing assistance to cooperatives for this purpose. Due to the low level
of work and isolated sites, work in the remote interior can best be under-
taken by force account or contract labor.
3.12      Construction contracts are awarded on a competitive basis and
participation by foreign bidders is not restricted. Currently, one major
United States contractor is undertaking roadworks and two major United
Klingdom contractors are participating in two sea defense works (one Bank-
financed) and building construction. All foreign contractors employ local
subcontractors.
C.   Maintenance
3.13      The Maintenance Section of the MIS Roads Division has overall re-
sporisibility for maintenance, but field operations are carried out by District
Engineers.  However, as stated in para. 3.06, District Engineers are in charge
of many otlher functions not related to maintenance and do not have sufficient
timc to devote to this activity. Inadequate attention to maintenance is par-
ticularly damaging in view of other conditions which make it difficult to keep
the highway network in proper repair:  equipment available is old and both
difficult and expensive to keep working, and high rainfall and shortage of
granular material inhibit regular operations. Lack of planning also dis-
sipates efforts and funds.



3.14      At US$1,100/mi (excluding administration and equipment depreci-
ation), budgeted funds for maintenance appear reasonable. However, diver-
sion of funds to improvement projects and redundant labor in the maintenance
force causes uneconomic application of resources and leave little for routine
maintenance. Although funds spent are audited, they are not subject to cost
accounting.
3.15      The Government is aware that planning and operation of road main-
tenance must be improved and has requested technical assistance under the
project for this purpose. The assistance will be undertaken as part of the
proposed consulting services to the MWIS (para. 4.08). During credit nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that, on the basis
of this study, it will, formulate by June 30, 1973 a highway maintenance
program satisfactory to the Association and take the necessary steps (in-
cluding provision of funds) to improve maintenance operations in accordance
with the program.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The proposed project includes:
(i) improvement of four road sections totalling about 34 mi;
(ii) supervision of improvement works by consultants;
(iii) purchase and installation of vehicle weighbridges;
(iv)  feasibility studies by consultants of about 200 mi of
national highways;
(v) detailed engineering by consultants of about 100 mi of
high priority roads resulting from the feasibility
studies;
(vi) consulting services to improve the organization and
operations of the MWHS; and
(vii) technical assistance by consultants to a central
transport planning unit.
The consulting services under the project will be provided by qualified and
experienced consultants primarily from outside Guyana.
(a) Improvement
4.02      The roads proposed for improvement, shown in Map 2, are the:



- 10 -
(i)  West Coast Road (10.5 mi) - This road runs parallel to the
coastline and is connected to Georgetown by a ferry service
across the Demerara River (para 2.12). With many sharp
curves, narrow bridges and shoulders, and a deteriorating
pavement, the road is not adequately serving current traffic
needs. Improvements include curve realignments, shoulder
widening, and a bituminous pavement overlay.
(ii)  West Bank Road (9 mi) - Running along the west bank of the
Demerara River, this road intersects the West Coast Road
near the ferry landing. Improvements are similar to those
for the West Coast Road.
(iii)  Canal Roads 1 and 2 (14 mi total) - These two roads feed
traffic to the West Bank Road. The roads are on a good
alignment, but are unpaved and impassable when wet. Under
the project, they will be raised and paved.
4.03      The design standards for the project, shown in Table 6, vary ac-
cording to traffic and the functions of individual sections of each road;
they are satisfactory. Pavement for all roads has been designed in accor-
dance with the stage construction principle.
(b) Supervision of Improvement Works
4.04      Under a grant from CIDA, the consulting firm De Leuw Cather
prepared satisfactory feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the
project roads. The Government intends to retain this firm to supervise im-
provement of the project roads.  However, MWHS staff will fill most posts
in the supervision team.  During credit negotiations, terms of reference
and staffing arrangements for supervision were agreed.
(c) Vehicle Weighbridges
4.05      The Government wishes to ensure that design axle loadings are not
exceeded on the main roads and the project includes purchase and installation
of permanent weighbridges. During credit negotiations, the number, locations,
and operations of weighbridges were discussed and generally agreed. The
Government will submit details of operational policy for approval by the
Association before purchasing the weighbridges.
(d)  Feasibility Studies
4.06      As part of an overall transport plan, the central transport plan-
ningunit (para. 4.10) is to prepare by mid-1973 the list of roads for which
feasibility studies will be made. Feasibility studies, to be undertaken by
consultants, will cover about 200 mi of roads. During credit negotiations,
an assurance was obtained from the Government that before the feasibility
studies begin it will discuss and agree with the Association the list of
roads to be studied, the terms of reference for the studies, and the selec-
tionI of consultants.



- 11 -
(e) Detailed Engineering
4.07       Detailed engineering by consultants of about 100 mi of high prior-
ity roads, identified under the feasibility studies (para. 4.06) and selected
in agreement with the Association, is included in the project. The engineer-
ing could provide the basis of a future highway construction project. During
credit negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government that it
will retain qualified and experienced consultants on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.
(f) Consulting Services to the MWHS
4.08      The Government wants to improve the organization and operations
of the WIHS, and has requested that consultants be engaged under the pro-
ject for this purpose. The consultants will undertake a management study which
will review the organization and operations of the entire  IHS, in particular
to improve the functions of the District Offices and the planning and opera-
tions of highway maintenance (paras. 3.06 and 3.15). The study will be un-
dertaken by a team of experts from a qualified consulting firm and carried
out in two phases. During the first phase (about 6 months), the functions
of the entire MINIIS and individual divisions and districts will be reviewed,
problem areas identified, and reconmendations for improvement made. During
the second phase (about 18 months), the recommendations will be implemented
and a training program established and operated, with participation by the
consultants.
4.09       During credit negotiations, the terms of reference for the consult-
ing services were agreed. Assurances were obtained from the Government that
it will, in consultation with the Association: (i) discuss and confirm,
after the first phase has been completed, the recommendations and implementa-
tion timetable for the second phase; (ii) review the progress of the proposed
improvements before the end of the 2-year assignment of the team and assess
the need for further consulting services; and (iii) make qualified counter-
parts available to work full-time with the consultants.
(g) Technical Assistance to a Central Transport Planning Unit
4.10      The Government has agreed to the formation of a central transport
planning unit within the Ministry of Economic Development. Technical assis-
tance for establishment and initial operation of the unit is included under
the project and will be provided by two transport economists. During credit
negotiations, thie terms of reference for the transport economists were agreed.
Also, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will, in consul-
tation with the Association: (i) review the progress of transport planning
before the end of the 2-year assignment of the economists and assess the need
for furtlier technical assistance; and (ii) make qualified counterparts avail-
able to work full-time with the consultants.

B.   Cost Estimates and Foreigr, Exchange Component
4.11      At October 1971 prices, the total project cost (including contin-
gencies) is estimated at US$8.2 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$5.6 million. Details are shown in the table on page 13.
4.12      The cost estimates for road improvement, prepared by the consul-
tants De Leuw Cather, are based on quantities derived from detailed engineer-
ing and local costs of labor, equipment operation, materials, and overhead;
they are satisfactory. The estimate of costs for supervision of the improve-
ment works is based on a schedule of staffing requirements and estimated
man-month rates. The cost estimates for weighbridges are based on manu-
facturers' quotations. Estimates of costs for the feasibility studies,
detailed engineering, consulting services, and technical assistance are
based on the cost of similar work in Guyana and on comparable work else-
where in the Caribbean area. A 10% contingency allowance for quantity over-
runs is adequate for all items under the project. A 15% price contingency
f or improvement is based on a 6% p.a. increase in foreign and local costs
from the date of cost estimates (October 1971) to completion of work (the
end of 1975). During credit negotiations, cost estimates were reviewed and
agreed.
4.13      De Leuw Cather calculated the foreign exchange component of road
improvement to be 68% of total costs net of taxes and duties and 64% of total
costs including taxes and duties. This assumed that works would be carried
out by foreign contractors, with some participation by local contractors and
subcontractors. The estimate is satisfactory. The foreign exchange com-
ponent for weighbridges was based on the CIP landed value of the units, to-
gether with 68% of the installation cost.  For the consulting services (in-
cluding technical assistance), the foreign exchange component was based on
the estimated costs of salaries for foreign experts and imported equipment.
C.   Execution
4.14      The western part of the West Coast Road is being improved under
force account. Improvement of the eastern section of this road under the
proposed project will be affected by progress of work on the western sec-
tlon, which is to serve as a haul road for improvement under the project.
During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that it will complete the western section by the end of 1972.
4.15      The M1S Roads Division, assisted by qualified and experienced
consultants, will be responsible for executing the IDA-financed portion of
the project. Procurement for road improvement works and for the supply of
weighbridges will be by international competitive bidding and in accordance
with the Bank Group "Guidelines on Procurement". Contractors for road im-
provement will be prequalified and contracts for all four roads will be ad-
vertised in two sections. One section will be the West Coast and West Bank

Roads combined because fill material for both roads has to be hauled along
the West Bank Road.  The other section will be the two Canal Roads.  Con-
tractors may hid for one or both sections. The Canal Roads might attract
bids from smaller contractors, including the local roadworks contractor
(para. 3.11). Small local contractors are also expected to participate as
subcontractors. Contracts will be awarded in about the fourth quarter of
1972 and should be completed toward mid-1975. The rather long time period
allows for inclement weather. The consultants for the organizational and
operational improvements to the MWH1S and for the central transport planning
unit will be retained during the second half of 1972 for a 2-year period.
Feasibility studies should begin in 1973, and be followed by detailed engi-
neering. Weighbridge procurement and installation is expected to be com-
pleted by mid-1974. During credit negotiations, the timing of project execu-
tion was reviewed and agreed.
4.16      Guyana applies a system of preferential tariffs to some imports.
It is the Government's policy, however, not to apply tariffs to imports in
connection with externally financed projects. Therefore, the procurement
of weighbridges under this project will be duty free.
4.17      The potential of the roadworks under the project for relieving
unemployment in Guyana has been considered. The principal operations (road
widening and pavement overlay) and the relatively long transport distance
for road construction materials do not lend themselves to labor-intensive
methods.  However, it is estimated that 100-300 laborers will be employed
on the project.
4.18      Existing procedures for right-of-way acquisition are satisfactory
and no problems are expected to arise. Right-of-way will be acquired before
improvement begins. During credit negotiations, the status of land acquisi-
tion was reviewed and is satisfactory.
D.   Financing
4.19      The proposed project will be jointly financed by the Association
and the UNDP. The IDA credit of US$4.4 million will finance the entire es-
timated foreign exchange component of the road improvement, supervision,
weighbridges, and further detailed engineering. The Government has request-
ed a UNDP grant of US$1.2 million to cover the feasibility studies, consult-
in3 services, and technical assistance. A condition of effectiveness of the
credit is agreement by the UNDP to finance these elements of the project.
Local cost financing will be made available from the general budget. During
credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the timely allocation of local
f un1ds.



- 15 -
E.   Disbursements
4.20      The proposed credit would finance 68% of the total cost of road
improvements, 100% of the CIF landed cost of the weighbridges, and 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of consulting services. Based on this and on the
schedule of project implementation given in para. 4.15, an Estimated Schedule
of Disbursements has been prepared. The Schedule is shown in Annex B and
was reviewed during credit negotiations. Surplus funds in the Credit
Account upon completion of the project should be cancelled.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Project Roads
(a) General
5.01      The project roads are in the heavily cultivated coastal region
west of Georgetown and pass through several urban areas. Proposed improve-
ments include paved shoulders for slow moving traffic (bicycles and tractors)
and pedestrians. The full benefits from these improvements can only be
realized if measures are adopted and enforced to keep the carriageway clear
from this traffic and to prevent strip development from encroaching on the
right-of-way. During credit negotiations, an assurance was obtained from
the Government that it will enforce existing regulations to this effect.
(b) Traffic (Table_7)
5.02      Average Daily Traffic (ADT) in 1971, on the West Coast Road varied
from about 1,000 to 2,700 and on the West Bank Road from about 350 to 1,900.
The weighted ADT on these roads was about 1,910 and 1,000, respectively. It
is estimated to grow at a rate of 3.6% p.a. over the next 24 years. This is
below the trend of about 5% during the last 8 years. On the Canal Roads, the
weighted ADT in 1971 was about 140. In their present condition, these roads
are frequently impassable in wet weather. Improvement should encourage fur-
ther traffic increases, therefore, the growth rate has been estimated at
5% p.a.
B.   Benefits from the Project
5.03      The quantified benefits from the project are reduced transport
costs on the 34 mi of highway to be improved. Benefits from the enforcement
of vehicle weight regulations, feasibility studies, detailed engineering,
organizational and operational improvements to the MiS, and transport plan-
ning unit were not quantified, but they are justified based on the discussion
in Chapter IV. The combined Internal Economic Return (IER) of the road im-
provements is about 15% and the individual IERs for the project roads range



- 16 -
from about 13% to 19%.  The first year benefits for individual roads range
from about 11% to 15%, indicating that timing is appropriate. Details are
shown in Table 8.
5.04      The benefit-cost analysis is based on reduced vehicle operating
costs and lower road maintenance costs. Reduced vehicle operating costs
accrue from improvement in the riding surface and fewer speed changes, which
are now caused by tight curves, narrow bridges, and interferences, such as
bicycles and pedestrians. Details of vehicle operating costs are shown in
Table 9.
5.05      Benefits due to time savings for passengers are substantial, espe-
cially in the urban areas near Georgetown, but they have not been quantified.
Nor has an allowance been made for reduction in the high rate of accidents
in the congested sections of the project roads. For purposes of the analysis,
financial costs were adjusted to exclude taxes; 5% was added to road improve-
ment costs to allow for the value of the limited amount of land taken in road
realignments and 10% was included for quantity contingencies. The analysis
measured the benefits and costs associated with different types of improve-
ment and only those which would yield the highest returns were incorporated
in the final design.
5.06      A sensitivity analysis was made for those factors which were con-
sidered to have a significant degree of uncertainty (Table 8). The most
important are the rate of traffic growth and the construction cost estimate.
A lowering of the traffic growth to about half the average growth assumed
for the benefit-cost analysis would lower the benefits by about 25%. As-
suming this reduction, the analysis would give an IER of about 10%. If the
cost of construction rose by 15% and completion was delayed by a quarter of
the original estimated construction time, the IER would be about 12%. The
above discussions confirm that the project is justified.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations, the Government gave principal assur-
ances that it will:
(i) review and, if necessary, amend legislation on
vehicle loads and dimensions, and enforce the
legislation (para. 3.04);
(ii) formulate by June 30, 1973 a highway maintenance
program satisfactory to the Association and take
the necessary steps (including provision of funds)
to improve maintenance (para. 3.15);



- 17 -
(iii)  discuss and confirm, with the Association, the
recommendations and timetable for the second
phase of the management study; review the progress
of the proposed improvements before the end of the
assignment of the experts and assess the need for
further consulting services; and make qualified
counterparts available (para. 4.09);
(iv)  review, in consultation with the Association, the
progress of transport planning before the end of
the assignment of the transport economists and
assess the need for further technical assistance;
and make qualified counterparts available (para.
4.10); and
(v)  enforce existing regulations to keep the carriage-
way of the project roads clear and to prevent strip
development from the right-of-way (para. 5.01).
6.02      A condition of effectiveness of the credit is agreement by the
UT,DP to provide a grant of US$1.2 million to finance the feasibility studies,
consulting services, and technical assistance (para. 4.19).
6.03      Subject to agreement on the foregoing, the project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$4.4 million to the Government of Guyana
on the usual terms.
