                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the policy, management and administrative capacity in MOLSA and MOF to develop, manage and monitor pension
                         and social safety net reforms. Since this is a small Technical Assistance project, which will be implemented over a short period of time, it will be difficult to measure final
                         outcomes. One intermediate measure of success will be that both MOLSA and MOF are able to use information generated by the new systems for social safety net and
                         pension decision making.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Social Safety Net Information System is now operational in Baghdad and Najaf, and data entered in Najaf is now being “replicated? to the central (national) database in Baghdad.
                         In addition, the system has now been deployed to all governorates, meeting the deadline previously set in January 2012. Data entry has been completed in all governorates, except
                         for Thi-Qar, Anbar, Mosul (which should be completed by end September 2012). The Project Management Office and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs are to be commended

                         Due to the success of the operationalization of the system in Baghdad, and recently in Najaf, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs suggested a formal launch event to be in October
                         2012 that will include Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs’ key partners. The World Bank looks forward to participating and contributing to this event.

                         The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is commended on undertaking a number of learning visits related to social safety nets, as part of the capacity building program under the
                         Project. So far, these learning visits have proved to be very beneficial since these expose staff from Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to good practices in implementation of social
                         safety nets, targeting, and implementation, which could inform policy development in Iraq. It is expected that a workshop will be held in October 2012 to disseminate the overall
                         lessons learned by Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from these learning visits, to draw out policy implications for Iraq, and to draw out potential areas for future World Bank support
                         to policy reforms in the Social Safety Net area.

                         Based on ongoing dialogue between the World Bank and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the learning experiences attained from the learning visits, the Ministry of Labor
                         and Social Affairs indicated the following areas for support from the World Bank for potential future support: (i) Targeting: development and implementation of targeting policies; (ii)
                         Financing: methods to diversity revenues to finance social protection programs; (iii) Conditional Cash Transfer: design and possible implementation of CCT programs; and (iv)
                         Activation: options for programs to increase employment and labor participation. Additional discussions will take place in October 2012 on the potential support within the forthcoming
                         World Bank Iraq Country Partnership Strategy.

                         Subsequent to the supervision mission that took place from May 30 to June 3, 2012, a three-day Learning Visit (June 4-6, 2012) was organized for the Iraqi delegation who visited
                         Lebanon and learned about its National Poverty Targeting Program.
