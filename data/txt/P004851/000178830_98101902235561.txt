REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF WESTERN SAMOA
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Western Samoa for the equivalent of US$4.4 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a highway project. Consultants' services
for project preparation and for the supervision of construction are being fi-
nanced by a grant of US$1.07 million equivalent from the Government of i'New
Zealand.
PART I
THE ECONOMY
2.        The first Economic Report - "Memorandum on the Economy of Western
Samoa" (No. 54a-WAO of April 26, 1973), based on a reconnaissance economic
mission in June 1972, was circulated to the Executive Directors on May 4,
1973 (R73-97). The section on the economy which follows is primarily based
on this report and discussions with the International Monetary Fund
mission which was in the field in July 1974. Annex I contains country data.
3.        Western Samoa consists of a group of nine islands in Central
Polynesia; two of these (Upolu and Sawaii), account for most of the land
and population of about 152,000. The natural rate of population growth
is about 3% per annum, although the growth of the resident population is
only about 2.2% a year because of emigration. Western Samoa became
an independent state in 1962 after half a century of New Zealand trusteeship
administration. Ties with New Zealand remain close. New Zealand provides
considerable financial and technical aid as well as access to its labor market.
Western Samoa is a parliamentary democracy built on the traditional Samoan
social structure. The present Government was formed following an election
in March 1973, the fourth since independence.
4.        The economy has a large subsistence sector based on traditional
agriculture and a monetized sector covering plantation agriculture, public
sector operations and services, mainly tourism. National accounts statistics
are not yet available; 1972 per capita income is estimated roughly at about
US$150. Partly as a result of two severe hurricanes, real GNP growth
since the mid-sixties has probably been negligible, so that real per capita
income has probably declined.
5.        Agriculture employs about 70% of the labor force and accounts for
about 90% of the value of total annual exports. Exports consist mainly
of copra, cocoa, and bananas. The economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuations
in the production and world market prices of these three commodities. Although
prices for both cocoa and copra rose sharply in 1973, the export volume of



-2-
these three crops decreased considerably and Western Samoa was unable to take
full advantage of the improved market situation. The decline in the export
volume is attributed to a combination of factors: rising production costs,
difficulties in implementing the replanting scheme for cocoa, rising domestic
demand for bananas, unfavorable weather conditions and inadequate shipping
services. In an attempt to diversify traditional agricultural exports, the
Government is encouraging the production of vegetable and fruit crops such
as taro and pineapple through subsidized sales of fertilizers and insecti-
cides.
6.        Manufacturing industry in Western Samoa is at a very early stage
of development and is largely confined to the processing of agricultural
products and small scale production of consumer goods. The Government is
providing incentives under the Enterprises Incentives Act of 1965 to
encourage manufacturing; these include income tax exemption and duty
exemptions on imported raw materials, machinery, and other equipment. By
the end of 1973, 32 enterprises with a total capital investment of US$11
million were using these incentives. The Government has given priority
to labor intensive and local raw material oriented industries and is
encouraging local participation in foreign owned enterprises. Tourism which
has been growing rapidly in recent years, has become a major foreign exchange
earner and has stimulated rapid expansion in the construction and services
sectors. Tourism receipts have grown at an annual rate of over 25% during
1969-73 and surpassed copra which was the main export as a source of foreign
exchange in 1972 and 1973.
7.        Western Samoa is totally dependent on imported oil products, which
represent a small proportion of total imports. The oil import bill in
1974 is expected to double compared to 1973 and reach about 7% of estimated
total imports. The long term Government program envisages increasing
dependence on hydro-electricity, which currently supplies about 40% of total
electric energy generated.
8.        Western Samoa enjoyed comparative price stability until 1972, but
inflation emerged as a major problem in 1973 when consumer prices rose by
24%. This was caused by domestic food shortages, increased import prices,
depreciation of the tala vis-a-vis the New Zealand and Australian dollars,
booming tourist expenditures, rapid domestic credit expansion and rising
government expenditures. Among the measures taken to curb inflationary
pressures are: price controls on imported essential commodities, quantitative
guidelines for domestic credit expansion since mid-1973 and an increase in
deposit and lending rates between one and two percentage points in April
1974.
9.        The Government's fiscal performance is satisfactory.   The ratio
of Central Government tax revenues to GNP is estimated at about 22% which
is higher than in most of the developing countries.    Prior to 1971, capital
and development expenditures were mainly financed by the budgetary current
account surplus. In 1972 and 1973, capital expenditures sharply increased.
The increased overall deficit in 1972 was financed mainly by foreign loans.
However, foreign loans declined in 1973 compared to the previous year, and



- 3 -
increasing recourse to domestic sources, mainly the banking sector, was
necessary. The emphasis of the public investment program has been primarily
on infrastructure development. Public investment in 1973 is estimated to
have been about US$6 million or 15% of GNP including subsistence. In view
of the changing balance of payments situation and revised priorities, the
Government, with technical assistance financed by the Asian Development Bank,
intends to introduce a Third Plan in 1975 with an emphasis on increasing
the productive capacity in the economy. About two-thirds of the total
financing of public capital expenditures in the Third Plan is expected from
foreign sources with the balance coming from budgetary savings and domestic
borrowings from non-bank sources such as the Post Office and Provident Fund.
10.       Western Samoa has had a continuous trade deficit which has been
more or less offset by a surplus on services and transfer accounts and by an
increasing inflow of capital up to 1971. Export earnings have fluctuated
widely from year to year due to variations in the output and world market
prices of the three major agricultural exports, but there has been hardly
any increase since 1960. The balance of payments showed an overall deficit
of US$3 million in 1972 mainly due to a record annual increase of imports of
63%. There was an improvement in 1973 with a reduction in the overall
deficit to US$1.4 million mainly due to an 18% increase in export earnings
due to higher export prices and a 17% decline in imports payments. Export
earnings in the first half of 1974 have almost doubled compared to the first
half of 1973, whereas import payments during the same period in 1974 declined
by 10 percent compared to those during the corresponding period in 1973.
Nevertheless, net foreign exchange reserves declined steadily from US$12.4
million in 1971 to US$8 million or the equivalent of about four months of
imports by the end of August 1974.
11.       The prospects in the next few years are for higher exports and
increased foreign exchange earnings, if the forecast for export commodity
prices materializes and the volume of production recovers to 1972 levels.
Balance of payments problems would be manageable during the next few years
with capital inflows continuing to supplement exports of goods, tourism
earnings and transfers. This assumes no adverse weather or market conditions
for Western Samoa's vulnerable exports.
12.       Western Samoa's external public debt, disbursed and outstanding
has increased steadily from US$5 million in 1971 to US$8.8 million in 1973
and is expected to reach US$9.6 million in 1974. In 1973, ADB's share
of the total foreign public debt was about 30%, most of which was on con-
cessionary terms. The remaining external public debt consisting of loans from
the New Zealand Government and raised in the New Zealand money market, is on
favorable terms. The IDA's share in public debt outstanding after full dis-
bursement of the proposed highway project credit, is not likely to exceed 25%.
13.       The ratio of public debt service payments to exports of goods and
services was less than 5% in 1973. In 1974 it is expected to reach about
13% because of the lump sum repayment of a major New Zealand Government loan.



- 4 -
Projections for the next five years suggest that the public debt service
ratio is likely to decline to levels more in line with previous years.
However, with the need to maintain adequate reserves to offset future
fluctuations in foreign exchange earnings, prudent debt management requires
that a high proportion of foreign financing is obtained on liberal terms.
The Government policy is to seek as much soft loan financing as possible from
overseas, mostly from New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom; such
financing is required because of the relatively low per capita income and
limited capacity to service debt on conventional terms.
PART II
BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN WESTERN SAMOA
14.       Western Samoa became a member of the Bank and Association on
June 28, 1974 and this road improvement project will be the first Bank Group
operation in the country. On the basis of the Government's development
program, the following areas of investment seem to deserve priority -
transport, power, telecommunications, agriculture and manpower training.
ADB is already involved in agriculture, transport, power and telecommunica-
tions. The UNDP and bilateral donors are providing technical assistance for
manpower training.
15.       There are no plans for additional IDA lending in Western Samoa
during the next few years. In response to a Government request, we have
just sent a mission to Western Samoa to help prepare agricultural programs
and to identify projects which would be suitable for other sources of
external financing.
PART III
TRANSPORTATION IN WESTERN SAMOA
Transportation - overview
16.       Because of Western Samoa's isolated location and its reliance on
foreign trade, access to neighboring countries and to overseas markets is
the country's most vital transport requirement. Good external communication
is also an essential prerequisite for the development of manufacturing and
tourism in the islands. Therefore, the Government, has given highest priority
to improvements in ports and aviation, and with external assistance since
1968 has been able to improve the two main ports and build a new airport



(Faleolo) with a connecting road to Apia, the capital of Western Samoa on
the main island of Upolu. In addition, works to widen and deepen the
entrance channel to the port of Asau, on the island of Savaii, are currently
under way.
17.       With the requirements of external traffic largely met, the Govern-
ment is giving increased attention to domestic transport needs in order to
promote agricultural development and exports, support tourism expansion and
reduce the costs of moving workers and consumer goods. The main demand for
domestic transport services is to bring goods and passengers to and from
Apia. This demand is presently being met by road transport which, despite
the poor state of most roads, is the most important mode of transport, by
coastal and inter-island shipping with shallow draft sailing boats, small
trading vessels, and a passenger-ferry between the two main islands and
by air services provided by a scheduled carrier and an air taxi company.
The Government's efforts to improve domestic transport are now concentrated
on having a more reliable and all-weather road network.
18.       Annual amounts spent on transport projects seem to have averaged
about WS$ 1.5 million (US$2.5 million) between 1971 and 1973. The Govern-
ment anticipates that future transport investments will remain at the
level of the last few years but this will depend to a large extent on
whether external financing for these projects can be arranged. In addition
to this proposed road project, other major transport projects which are
being discussed in the Government for the longer term are an additional
wharf in the port of Apia to accommodate container and passenger ships and
a runway extension to Faleolo airport to handle larger aircraft.
19.       Coordination between different modes of transport has been given
due attention. Road transport is by far the most important mode; the dis-
tribution of traffic between roads, coastal shipping and aviation is deter-
mined by relative service advantages and prices. Because of poor road
conditions and the inaccessibility of outlying areas, coastal shipping and
aviation presently carry some traffic which will be diverted to the roads
once they have been improved.
20.       The Economic Development Department (EDD) under the Minister of
Finance is the Government's planning agency. Together with the Treasury
Department and the operating departments and agencies concerned, it is res-
ponsible for preparation and implementation of development plans and annual
development budgets. Transport projects are prepared and executed through
the Public Works Department (PWD). The EDD is inadequately staffed to
carry out its assignment and this situation is likely to continue until
more Samoan staff with planning skills are available. In the last two
years, it relied mainly on a team of three UNDP economists who had local
counterparts assigned for training; one of the UNDP advisors took
responsibility for transport projects. The last of these advisors is about
to leave the country and the Government has requested the UNDP that one
of the replacements, expected to arrive by mid-1975, have some background



in transportation.  This would help the Government improve transporc ;:
planning in the PWD by enabling the EDD to guide effectively the pi(l:
work of the PWD, to coordinate transport projects with projects in oter
sectors and to cover transport policy issues which may require atte:Ln-L.
Highways
21.       The public highway network totals 584 km of which 156 kri ar--
classified as paved. In addition, there are 226 km of plantation arnd plntsi-
tion access roads, most of which are open for public use. The pny$~s.cal
condition of the network is generally poor, and many sections are ina,ie; u_e
for current traffic levels. The requirements for modest rehabilCtation r,o
bring roads into reasonable operating condition were identified in October,
1974 in an Australian--financed Road Maintenance Study.  On the bas1i 'i this
study the Australian Government agreed in December 1974 to grant A'4.Q4-million
in aid to Western Samoa for workshop facilities, road maintenance eq:l.pmenc
and advisor-trainers to help implement a five-year program to impLcV>e a4ighway
maintenance. No major extension of the current main road network is foreseen
for the near future but the Government intends to emphasize constru.;ZiOn and
improvement of village access and agricultural feeder roads in the proposed
Third Development Plan.
22.       Road planning has mainly consisted of the technical preparat4.:n of
projects which were selected on an apparent need basis, without an' economic
evaluation.  The first effort in planning was the Australian financt`
Preinvestment Study for Road Development completed in 1972.   This szu`y
established the relative priorities for main road improvements for the next
five to ten years and provides a sound basis for future planning rf roas1
improvements; the East Coast and Central Cross Island Roads receivee the
highest priority .or improvement and are included in the proposed proj_ict.
However, regular updating is required to coordinate road investmentF with
the Government's agricultural and tourism development schemes.   Also, at
present there is no basis for the selection and design of village access and
feeder roads which the Government intends to build during the next:p'an
The Government agreed that it will institute a regular system to collect and
analyze key data including traffic statistics to accomplish this. (Saction
4.03 of the Development Credit Agreement). The Government has also recently
added a transport planner-engineer to the PWD to improve planning.
23.       There is no local contracting industry capable of undertaking
road work in Western Samoa and all road improvements in the past hav"e ;Jeen
done by force account. In a small country like Western Samoa, this is a
practical and viable method of carrying out road works at acceprtble cost.
This view was borne out by recent experience under the airport ard road
project financed by ADB.
24.       The ADB and the Government agreed in 1969 to the establishmenr of
the Special ProJects Division (SPD) under the PWD to construct the airport



- 7 -
and the .Apia-Faleolc road. The results after construction showed that costs
were reasonable, lower than those obtained under less organized force account
methods and substantially lower than those experienced on similar Bank Group
financed works in the Pacific region and which are being carried out under
an international contract. It also showed that the efficiency of the SPD
improved continuously through monitoring and training and that the quality
of works performed was satisfactory. Impressed with these results, the
Government, in 1973, transformed SPD into the semi-autonomous Special Project
Development Corporation (SPDC). The Government intends that the SPDC will
carry out suitable public construction work and that the PWD will continue
to carry out routine maintenance of public facilities and minor improvements
works that cannot be readily defined for contract purposes.
PART IV
THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project was identified on the basis of the Preinvest-
ment Study for Road Development in 1972. Further detailed studies to
determine the improvements in the sections under consideration and to prepare
them for construction were financed by New Zealand and carried out by the
Engineering Export Association of New Zealand (ENEX). Bank missions appraised
the project in February/March and July/August, 1974. The credit was negotiated
in January, 1975 and The Hon. Laumea Matolu II, Minister of Works, Transport
and Marine led the Government's negotiating team. The Appraisal Report
(No. 589a-WSO) on the proposed project is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. Annex II provides a credit and project summary.
Description of the Project
26.       The project comprises the reconstruction of about 42 km of the two
main roads on Upolu, the East Coast Road and the Central Cross Island Road.
The East Coast Road is the main coastal route connecting the north-eastern
villages and plantations of Upolu with the Capital. It hugs the coast for
23.6 km from Apia east to Falefa Falls and has a bituminous pavement width
of 4 - 5 m. This 23.6 km section would be reconstructed under the project
to two-lane paved standards on the existing alignment, with some improve-
ments in curvature and shifts inland, and some stone foreshore protection
to prevent the road and village lands from being damaged by sea waves and
erosion. In addition, three bridges would be replaced, two of these to
replace bridges washed away by severe floods in November 1974 and repairs
effected to eight others damaged by the same floods. The Central Cross
Island Road, 21.3 km long, is the principal cross island link between the
north and south coasts of Upolu. Under the project, 17.7 km of this road
would be reconstructed to two-lane paved standards. Improvement of the
Central Cross Island Road would also protect adjacent lands from flood damage
and erosion.



-8-
Project Execution
27.       The Public Works Department (PWD), assisted by qualified consultants,
would be responsible for project execution. The reconstruction of the pro-
ject roads would be carried out by the Government's semi-autonomous Special
Projects Development Corporation (SPDC) (paras. 23-24 above). In order to
provide a continuous stream of work to the SPDC and to permit efficient
utilization of equipment and staff resources no longer needed for an
ADB-financed road project, the Government engaged the SPDC to start work
on the East Coast Road in September 1973. Part of this work, which is being
carried out according to satisfactory designs, is proposed for retroactive
financing under the credit (see paragraph 30, 33).
28.       SPDC is adequately staffed, but as the required skills are not
available in Western Samoa, most supervisory positions have been filled by
expatriates. However, it is expected that several local staff will be
trained bv these expatriates and can replace some of them near the conclusion
of the project. SPDC has recently arranged for equipment operators to
be trained in phase with additions to the plant required for the project.
At the conclusion of the project, SPDC would have a better trained work
force and equipment capable of constructing civil works valued at about
US$1.5 million annually. The Government can appropriately make use of
I:these resources in undertaking various public works in its development
program.
29.       The East Coast Road is being reconstructed by the SPDC.    This work is
supervised by ENEX under a contract reviewed by the Association; the quality
of supervision is satisfactory. A revised contract, to cover supervision
of both project roads is now being reviewed by the Government of New Zealand.
Conclusion of this contract would be a condition of effectiveness of the
credit (Section 5.01 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financing
30.       The total estimated cost of the project is $8.0 million.    The
foreign exchange cost of the project is estimated at $5.4 million. All
project costs have been updated to January 1, 1975. Physical contingencies
have been estimated at 10% and price contingencies at 34%. The price con-
tingency allowed on foreign and local costs of civil works takes into account
recent Bank Group experience as well as recent and expected price trends
in Western Samoa. The proposed development credit equivalent to $4.4 million
wotld finanicc 55% of the total cost or 81%, of the foreign exchange component.
This would cover the foreign exchange costs of reconstructing the East
Coast Road, including tip to $350,000 of retroactive financing for work done
from March 1, 1974, and the Central Cross Island Road.   The Government of
New Zealand has financed the full cost of project preparation and will
finance the full cost of construction supervision, totalling $1.07 million.



The Government would finance the balance of $2.48 million, which would
cover all expenditures on the East Coast Road for work performed before
March 1, 1974 as mentioned above and all local costs thereafter on the two
project roads, including land acquisition costs.
Procurement
31.       As mentioned earlier, the SPDC would undertake the reconstruction
of the roads financed by the credit. Because of the relatively small size
of the contract and Western Samoa's isolated location, the project would be
most unlikely to interest international contractors. Also, because there
is no private contracting industry (only artisans) in Western Samoa, use
of SPDC is the best means of executing the works and developing local skills.
Moreover, the SPDC, under a project financed by the ADB, has carried out
earlier road works successfully and at reasonable cost (paras. 23-24).
32.       The reconstruction works would be carried out under separate unit
price contracts negotiated with the SPDC. A satisfactory construction con-
tract now exists for the East Coast Road and a further one will be negotiated,
subject to the approval of the Association, for the Central Cross Island works
shortly before the works are scheduled to commence (October, 1975). The
additional contract will be based on the agreed unit prices of the East Coast
Road, adjusted for documented price increases up to October 1975, and will
take into account actual experience with construction of the East Coast Road.
Disbursement
33.       Credit funds will be disbursed on the basis of 70% of the total
cost of construction (the estimated foreign exchange component), including
costs incurred from March 1, 1974 up to a limit of $350,000 (paras 27 and 30).
Project Justification
34.       The proposed reconstruction of the two roads is expected to promote
the development of the relatively less advanced eastern and southern parts
of Upolu and to contribute to the objectives of the Government's new five-
year development plan. Additionally, the construction of the project by
SPDC will create new jobs for the economy's growing labour force including
on-site training. The quantifiable benefits of the proposed improvement
which have been considered in the economic evaluation are savings in vehicle
operating cost, reductions in maintenance costs and avoided costs for repairs
and property damage from storm damage and erosion. On this basis, the econo-
mic rates of return over the economic life of the project are 24% and 16%
for the East Coast and Central Cross Island Roads, respectively, and the
project is therefore economically justified.
