                       ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
                            HOPEWELL MESOPOTAMIA


1. RATIONALE

At approximately 12:00 noon on Saturday October 30, 2010, Hurricane Tomas, a Category 1
Hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, passed over the northern most part of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines and caused heavy damage. Landslides from the storm were
significant and, in some areas along roadways, slopes were destabilized.

The Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Project (HTERP) was assessed and approved by the
World Bank Board of Directors as a Category B project indicating that works proposed under the
project are largely rehabilitation and retrofitting of selected infrastructure and impacts would be
generally associated with the actual construction phase of the works activities. During the
evaluation at the preparatory phase, the project was assessed as not having triggered any social
safeguards but as a Category B project the necessary general EIA was undertaken. This included
a partial assessment of social impacts and recommendations where necessary. Based on the
foregoing and consequent upon engineering studies completed, construction works commenced at
the site in question, Hopewell, on August 15, 2012.




2. OBJECTIVE

In order to ensure that the appropriate instruments are in place to handle land acquisition issues
that have arisen under the HTERP, the Bank’s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
will need to be triggered, which in turn necessitates a Level One Restructuring of the project. The
triggering of the policy in turn requires the development of a Resettlement Policy Framework and
a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Given that land has already been acquired, what is being
developed here is a remedial abbreviated Plan. This Remedial Abbreviated RAP is accompanied




                                                4
by a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which is being simultaneously disclosed. Specifically
the objective of this Remedial Abbreviated RAP is to:

      Document the nature and extent of land acquisition
      Value affected assets
      Identify affected persons
      Document the entire process to date and how it meets the requirements of OP/BP 4.12
      Highlight gaps in the process and
      Identify Next Steps to fulfil the requirements of OP/BP 4.12 and to ensure
      Consultation with and
      Compensation of affected parties.

In addition, and as per the requirements of a RAP this document also identifies

    Institutional responsibility for implementation and procedures for grievance redress
    Arrangements for monitoring and implementation
    A timetable and budget

Once the next steps/gaps have been duly completed this Abbreviated Remedial RAP will be
updated and re-disclosed.

3. BACKGROUND: EVENTS LEADING TO UNPLANNED LAND ACQUISITION

Summary of Issues/Agreed Solutions related to the Hopewell-Teviot sub-project.

During construction at the Hopewell Road Rehabilitation construction site, due to soil erosion
from heavy rainfalls in October 2012, it became necessary to revisit the proposed engineering
options. In the process, construction associated with the new engineering designs led to
encroachment and land acquisition unforeseen at project appraisal. The project, not having
triggered the Bank’s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), did not have the
instruments (Resettlement Policy Framework and Resettlement Action Plan) in place to handle
land acquisition. The contractors as well as the Ministry of Transport and Works proceeded with
construction using National procedures, which did not require them to inform the Central
Planning Division. The Ministry of Transport and Works solicited the permission of relevant land
owners (2 separate land owners) to “cut Land? for the purpose of realigning a section of the
Hopewell Road unaware of the need to follow Bank land acquisition procedures since Policy
OP/BP 4.12 had not been triggered previous to this realignment. The Central Planning Division
officially communicated the nature and extent of land acquisition to the Bank on November 30,
2012 having established the magnitude of impacts.

Following the land encroachment notification, the Bank team organized a technical mission
during December 5-7, 2012. During the mission, the Bank Social Safeguards Specialist conducted
a visit to the sub-project site, consulted with the affected parties and confirmed the encroachment
as well as laid out the necessary steps to quantify the degree of the encroachment and Bank policy
(OP/BP 4.12) for consulting with and compensating the two affected land owners. During the
same mission, the Bank engineering team reviewed the physical works under construction at the
sub-project sites and assessed the quality of construction of the three activities being carried out –
namely: 1) road re-alignment of the Hopewell Road, 2) stabilization of the unstable slope adjacent
to the Hopewell Road, and 3) river defense works at the Zenga River. During this assessment, the
Bank engineering team identified significant issues related to the proposed revised slope
stabilization (retaining wall) measure at the Hopewell slope stabilization site. Following this
assessment, the Bank team sent an email addressed to the Director of Planning on December 22,


                                                  6
2012 indicating that the sub-project should be suspended until an adequate design for the
retaining wall is produced, and the necessary measures should be taken to stabilize all
construction activities in anticipation of the proposed suspension. In parallel, the Bank team
initiated a restructuring of the Project (Category 1 restructuring), in order to trigger OP/BP 4.12
and requested that the client prepare the necessary Bank instruments to handle land acquisition
(Remedial Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan and Resettlement Policy Framework) on all
subcomponents of the project.


During a subsequent mission held in January 2013, it was jointly agreed that the revised design
approved during construction would be replaced by the original retaining wall design (double
wall design) with minor modifications to account for the additional excavation that had taken
place. The original modified design was sent to the Bank on February 26, 2013 for information
purposes. Also during the same mission, a site visit confirmed that all civil works at the
Hopewell sub-project construction site had been stabilized in accordance with the Bank's request.
The variation order for the civil works for the road rehabilitation and retaining wall was received
by the Bank and the Bank gave its no objection. Civil works have re-commenced and
construction is estimated to be completed by the end of June 2013.


In parallel, the PSIPMU determined the final sq. ft. unit cost of the encroached land and
quantified the exact sq. ft. of encroachment, agricultural loss and land productivity loss of the two
affected landowners. The entire process and agreed compensatory payments for land acquisition
and land use compensation was and can be referenced within this document. This information will
be published on the government website.

4. SUMMARY OF IMPACTS, ACTIONS AND NEXT STEPS
A survey of the area affected by the re-alignment of the road was undertaken by the Lands and
Surveys Department in September 2012 in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport and
Works. The survey plan indicated necessary encroachment on two properties, one on either side
of the Hopewell Road. The quantity of land to be acquired is three thousand and sixty–four square
feet (3,064 sq.ft.) representing 40 per cent and two hundred and ninety-seven square feet (297
sq.ft.) representing 1 per cent of the landowners assets respectively. Both parcels of land are
owned by the affected parties.

The table below summarizes the nature and extent of impacts as well as mitigation measures (as
agreed to in consultation with the affected parties), next steps and a timeline for completion of
actions.


Indirect Impacts
In addition to the direct impacts outlined in the table below, there were a number of indirect
impacts caused by the anticipated closure of the Hopewell-Teviot road during construction as
alternative routes have been created.
   •   The Cotton Grove by-pass road at Richland Park for vehicular traffic.
   •   Additionally, permission was granted to pedestrians to use the half mile footpath at
       Hopewell Road to Richland Park main road

Methodology for Crops and lands
Step 1: Survey of lands or crops by relevant officials
Step 2: Valuation of land: Chief Surveyor: Valuation of Crops: Agricultural Extension Officer
Step 3: Meeting with PAPs to discuss the offer price of Land or crops
Step 4: Valuation determined and payment terms and conditions arranged

Methodology for Land Valuation:
Land and Surveys Department
Price Adjustments for Unique Features:
Actual market value for each site is dependent on a number of features and variables:
Location         access        utilities     transportation         river    traffic topography


The lots though on the main Hopewell road are still routed in agricultural background. Being
bounded with the road would hold a greater appeal but may have a diminished capacity because it
has the river to the east.
Land market value = Land Rental Value – Land Taxes

     *Project affected persons were offered options for compensation. For loss of land they were offered replacement land or cash. For lost crops they were
      offered cash compensation. For the inconvenience caused by increased pedestrian traffic incurred by PAP # 2 appropriate compensation was in the form
      of additional lighting, police surveillance and community consultation and sensitization. Cash compensation was chosen by the PAPs in the case of loss
      of land and crops.

5. CONSULTATION WITH THE PERSONS AFFECTED BY THE PROJECT

   •   Consultations have been undertaken with the Affected persons by means of interviews
       which were held on site. (See log of meetings) and Annex 7. The PSIPMU highlighted the
       need for proper consideration of the PAPs to minimize negative project impacts and
       maximize benefits.
   •   The PAPs indicated the need for full and fair compensation of property and crops in a
       timely manner. The PAPs welcomed the used of the gabion baskets to support property
       and agricultural crops as well as the benefits of a stabilized road for the community. They
       also indicated that properties were at risk given the unusual high rain falls experienced
       over the last 10 years and the vulnerability from the proximity to the river.


Follow-up consultations will be carried out during project execution to assess the effectiveness
and efficiency of the process and to address any unresolved issues and potential conflicts. The
PSIPMU will maintain a close and transparent relationship with the affected parties and broader
community.

6. INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Institutional Responsibility
The institutional responsibility for the HTERP rests with the HTERP Steering Committee (SC).
The SC is responsible for ensuring smooth execution of project activities and successful
accomplishment of project objectives. The SC meets monthly to review project implementation,
performance and is convened when necessary to attend to urgent matters, which may arise in the
course of project implementation.

Roles of the Committee:
   •         Assess project progress
   •         Provide advice and guidance on issues facing the project
   •         Assist with resolving strategic-level issues and risks
   •         Use influence and authority to assist the project in achieving its outcome

The SC consists of the following representatives:

       7. GRIEVANCES REDRESS.

PAPs were informed of the method of valuation used to assess their assets and provided with an
opportunity to negotiate the final compensation amount. To ensure transparency of procedures,
the project Social Development Specialist, a PIU representative, and the PAPs were present in all
meetings to discuss the value of compensation, negotiation of final amount and final payment.

It is not expected/anticipated that grievances would occur. However the PSIPMU will
continuously take stock of all possible expropriation / compensation reports and discuss their
outcomes in its technical meetings. The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and
Physical Planning, and the Ministry of Legal affairs will directly monitor compensation costs. The
PSIPMU will review project activities and provide guidance.


All grievances concerning non-fulfilment of contracts, levels of compensation, or seizure of assets
without compensation shall be made in writing, and addressed to the Project Steering Committee.
Copies of the complaint shall be sent to the Director of Planning, Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning, within 20 business days following communication to the Project Steering
Committee.

If an agreement cannot be reached the aggrieved party or parties shall raise their concerns to the
Project Steering Committee who shall refer them to the Director of Planning, within 20 business
days. Grievances that cannot be resolved with the Project Steering Committee shall be submitted
to the Director of Public Prosecution and to the executing agencies. Should grievances remain
unresolved at this level, they can be referred to the Court of Law. The grievance redress approach
has been discussed and shared with the PAPs; there is no grievance.

Annex4: INTERVIEW


The following is a summary of the interviews that were held with the affected persons as part of
the consultative process. January 2013
How were you made aware of the project?
   •   “I think there was not sufficient information circulated about the project before they broke
       ground. Mr. Bailey indicated that he would be installing gabion baskets along. They never
       told me that they were going to take away so much of my garden lands. Now I have no
       space for gardening.?
   •   “The Chief Engineer Mr. Brent Bailey and Minister Miguel came to visit, they
       informed me about the about the road realignment, we walked along the road and
       discussed issues related to the project, in terms of underground water, heavy rainfall, poor
       drainage, land slippage and accessibility?.


How are you affected by the project activities? Community?
   •   “They have taken all my agricultural land close to the river bed, I have nowhere to plant,
       have lost some crops but I was told I will be compensated. I would use the river for
       bathing and other things but now they are working, I have to bathe and wash at home, but
       I understand that the work is necessary especially the gabion baskets. My land was being
       undermined by the river flow, the walls will give me some security for my agriculture
       produce, but they haven’t paid me for the ones they had to remove for the construction of
       the road.?
   •   “Marriaqua is the hub for all these other surrounding villages; they now have to use the
       other access routes to get there because the road is no longer motorable. General public
       would have to pay more for transportation, school children would have to walk longer
       distances, and farmers would have to pay more for the transportation of produce. The
       noise and dust generated from the project activity would also affect the public. The by-
       pass road is long, questionable security because of bushes, and semi-good, it is poorly
       lighted, narrow and one areas is prone to landslides.?



                                                22
•   “I have given right away to persons (school children, nurses, general public) to walk to get
    to Richland Park to get transportation or to attend their economic activities. This however
    results in some “undesirables? who may want to take the opportunity and vandalize my
    property or steal. Additionally, I have to provide light in the night to provide safety
    especially for the nurses.?
•   “The project has also created some job opportunities for skilled and semi-skilled for local
    communities (both women and men).?


What impact do you believe that this would have on your establishment?
•   “I have no vegetables to sell because all had to be remove to stabilize the road.
    I have loss my property itself. The gabion baskets refilling would protect my property
    from breaking away.?
•   “Well I have some businesses with a steady flow of customers, especially if a tourist
    groups goes to Montreal Gardens they come back here and get a drink. But after the
    problem with the road things were decreasing.?
•   “I was able to rent two spaces to the contractors.?
•   “Along the road as well the wall would be protecting my property from soil erosion?.


After Hurricane Tomas, the road began to sink, how would you have felt if nothing was
done?
    •   “There are many underground springs around, the properties are water logged and there
        is poor drainage. In fact in 2002, there was a road slippage not too far from here. The
        road recovery work was undertaken by Mr. Edmund John, so this area is known for
        underground watering and clay like soil. It is important to be safe because you never
        know when it would have sunk. The steady traffic would have increased the danger. It
        is important to feel safe.?
    •   “I did not feel no particular how, I know they were going to do something but they
        could have said that they would need to take some my property to make road safe.?




                                              23
  Did you notice any further changes in the road structure or your environment?
       • “I never knew there were so many stones in the river, and then there were the additional
          landslides. The heavy machinery may have been too much because the road was already
          unstable.?
       • “The road was cracking and falling off.?


Did this change cause you any loss? How?
   •    “I have nowhere to cultivate.?
   •     “I have loss my privacy because people have to be entering my property throughout the
        day, they pick my fruits, and walk all over my property. Sometimes they use my pipes
        (water). Then I have to ensure that they are secured because I have big dogs I have to keep
        them secure and I have to use additional light. It’s a lot but I am corporate because I know
        that they work has to be done and I want it done.?

You have a right to be compensated for your loss? Would you prefer compensation in Cash,
or exchange of lands?

   •    “Cash, I have other lands elsewhere, I like my property here because it is cool, not noisy
        and I can do my backyard gardening and cool out next to the river in the afternoon. I feel
        safe here?
   •    “Cash, why would I need more land? We have like 13 acres This was all part of the
        Hopewell Estate and we sold some. I would like my compensation in cash.?
