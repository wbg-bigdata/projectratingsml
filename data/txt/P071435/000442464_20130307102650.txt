1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Context

1.      Bangladesh, with a population of about 150 million and a land area of 147,570
square kilometers is amongst the most densely-populated countries in the world. The
economy of Bangladesh grew steadily during last decade due to macroeconomic stability,
trade liberalization, improved private sector investment climate and financial sector
reform. Poverty reduction, however, remains a major challenge: at the time of project
appraisal 35 percent of Bangladesh's population lived in poverty, and large issues of
weak governance, urban congestion and under-investment in basic rural infrastructure
persisted. Improved rural transport infrastructure was considered key for rural
connectivity and poverty reduction, where most of the poorest populations (73%) lived.
The improvement of rural infrastructure in general, and of rural transport infrastructure in
particular, has been and still is an important element of the Government of Bangladesh's
(GOB) long term strategy to reduce the incidence of rural poverty by improving the
infrastructure endowment of the rural economy.

Sector Issues

2.     Despite the large investments made to develop the country's road network, its
condition remained far from satisfactory. The riding quality, geometric standards and
carrying capacity of part of the secondary and tertiary road networks were poor. By the
time of project appraisal, only 13,000 km of Upazila Roads (UZRs) were of all-weather
standard, and most of the URs remained unpaved, making large portions of secondary
and tertiary road networks impassable during the rainy season. Inadequate road
maintenance funding was a major issue in Bangladesh. Based on the findings of the
2001/2002 public expenditure review commissioned by International Development
Association (IDA), there was an annual maintenance funding shortfall of about US$9.0
million for the secondary road network. This represented a gap of about 28 percent of the
total maintenance funding requirements. Furthermore, on-the-ground effectiveness of
expenditures for both routine and periodic road maintenance was weak.

3.      Transport and trade are vital elements of the rural and national economy.
Development of transport and trade facilities including inland waterways and rural
markets would maximize the transport sector’s contribution to overall economic growth.
A more integrated transport and trade approach improving rural roads, markets, and river
jetty facilities would deliver significant impacts on agricultural growth and rural and non-
rural incomes.

4.    The road classification system in Bangladesh had in the past fostered duplication
of responsibility between Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and Local
Government Engineering department (LGED) in the management of the various parts of



                                             1
the road network. GOB finalized new guidelines for a more systematic secondary and
tertiary road network classification and responsibility framework. The full
implementation of these new guidelines was critical for progress towards sustainable
improvements in the management of the respective parts of the road network. The
capacity of Local Government Institutions (LGIs) to fund and manage the development
and maintenance of rural infrastructure was weak. Furthermore, local government and
communities had limited involvement in planning and management processes of
maintenance operations.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.     Project Development Objective was to provide rural communities with improved
access to social services and economic opportunities, and to enhance the capacity of
relevant government institutions to better manage rural transport infrastructure.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.     There was no formal revision of the PDO and key performance indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      The project impact area covered 21 districts with 44,900 square km and a total
population of 45 million, which constitutes about 35 percent of Bangladesh’s total
population and over 40 percent of its rural population. The main benefits included: (i)
improved mobility of rural population; (b) reduced operating costs for both motorized
and non-motorized modes of transport; (c) lower freight and passenger transport costs;
(d) improved access and quality of rural markets to support agricultural and off-farm
activities; (e) steady flow of labor intensive maintenance contracts; (f) improved access to
social services (like health clinics and schools); and (g) improved environment through
provision of drainage structures and roadside tree plantation.

8.      The direct beneficiaries of the project were the population living in project areas,
including road users, villagers, agricultural producers, agribusiness operators and
transport operators living or operating in project areas. The project-funded civil works
generated significant employment opportunities on its own. Furthermore, some of the
civil works funded under the project specifically targeted vulnerable groups such as
destitute women by providing them with employment opportunities. The LGED staff
also benefited because of capacity development and training. Also, the contracting
community benefited from the training and capacity building activities under the project

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

9.    The Rural Transport Improvement Project (RTIP) funded the following eight
components:




                                             2
Component 1 - US$110.50 million: Improvement of about 1,100 km of UZRs: This
component aimed to improve rural access and connectivity to markets and production
centers in the 21 project Districts by making key UZR passable all year around and by
improving their riding quality and carrying capacity.

Component 2 - US$23.50 million: Improvement of about 500 km of Union Roads
(URs): This component aimed to improve rural access and connectivity in the 21 project
Districts by making key URs passable all year round and by improving their riding
quality.

Component 3 - US$39.00 million: Periodic maintenance/rehabilitation of about 1,500
km of UZRs: This component aimed to reduce the periodic maintenance/rehabilitation
backlog on the LGED-managed portion of the road network by funding the overlaying,
resealing and minor rehabilitation of 1,500 km of key UZRs in the 21 project districts.

Component 4 – US$30.50 million: Construction of about 15,000 m of culverts/bridges
on URs: This component aimed to make approximately 5,000 km of URs passable year-
around in the 21 project districts, and provided appropriate drainage structures on these
roads.

Component 5 – US$17.50 million: Improvement/construction of about 150 rural
markets and 45 river jetties: This component, through the improving/constructing 150
Growth Center Markets (GCM) and 45 river jetties (RJ), aimed to help lower the cost of
goods and commodities in the 21 project Districts by facilitating their trade. Most of the
selected rural markets and river jetties for improvement/construction were linked to
UZRs/URs to be improved or maintained under the project.

Component 6 – US$14.00 million: Land acquisition, implementation of safeguards
documents: This component was designed to assess and mitigate the social and
environmental impacts of implementing the civil works components of the project and
finance implementation of Resettlement Framework (RF), Environmental Management
Framework (EMF), Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS), Environmental Management
Plans (EMPs), Indigenous People Development Plans (IPDPs), and utility relocation.

Component 7 - US$14.00 million: Design Supervision Management (DSM) consultant
services, quality, financial and procurement audit services, and other consultant
services: This component was designed to ensure the timely, quality, and cost effective
construction, maintenance/rehabilitation of the civil works components under the project.

Component 8 - US$6.00 million: Technical Assistance (TA), training, capacity
building of LGED and LGIs, equipment and pre-investment studies: This component
aimed to finance a wide variety of activities and investments including enhanced training
programs for LGED staff, LGED implementation of improved new business processes
and systems, local government capacity building initiatives and rural road transport
safety. More specifically, this component aimed to assist LGED in funding the
implementation of the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP) and the
corresponding planned TA services. The various ISAP targets were aimed at enhancing


                                            3
the key elements of LGED's policy framework, planning and operational capabilities, as
well as building LGI's capacities for infrastructure management and related revenue
mobilization, thus driving the substantive reform process in the sector with an integrated
approach.

1.6 Revised Components

10.     There was no formal revision of the components of the project. A component on
Flood Rehabilitation was added in 2008 following approval of the Additional Financing.
While this component was treated separately in the Aide-Memoires, no formal changes in
the system were made to add the component in the Project Portal.

1.7 Other significant changes

11.     In 2007, Bangladesh suffered major flooding directly affecting over 13 million
people in 46 districts, causing over 1,000 deaths, affected over 2 million acres of
agricultural land, and damaged infrastructure, social and educational facilities and private
assets. Responding to the Government’s request for assistance, the World Bank
established a cross-sectoral Emergency 2007 Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance.
As part of this effort, restoring secondary and rural road network affected by the floods,
including rehabilitation of Upazila roads, culverts and bridges, was implemented under
RTIP as part of Additional Financing (AF) (IDA Credit of US$20 million and reallocated
$7million from RTIP savings, which with GoB contribution made the total US$33.8
million). AF didn’t require a change to the RTIP project development objectives. The
closing date of the project was extended by two years to June 30, 2011. The same
implementing arrangements were used for the implementation of the Flood Component.

12.   Another extension of the closing date till June 30, 2012 was approved to allow
completion of flood rehabilitation contracts which experienced delays in implementation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
13.    The project was prepared following successful implementation of two previous
Bank-funded projects – First and Second Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and
Maintenance Projects (RRMIMP-I and RRMIMP –II) by LGED, and its design was in
large part informed by lessons learned during the implementation and the analytical and
technical assistance started under these projects.

14.     The following lessons learned were incorporated during project preparation: (a)
early and comprehensive preparation of engineering, social, environmental, participatory
planning and institutional aspects to ensure quality at entry; (b) up front procurement
actions to ensure high degree of implementation readiness (aiming for 20 percent of
project works to be ready for award by credit effectiveness; (c) integrated improvement
of UZRs, URs, markets and critical river jetties to maximize synergistic benefits; (d)
construction of missing minor structures to improve connectivity, and (e) targeted
capacity building initiatives to increase role of LGIs and communities.


                                             4
15.    To ensure readiness for implementation, the engineering of the first phase works
and the bidding process were completed before the Board approval of the project (about
one fourth of the total civil works contracts). The TORs for the major consultancies were
prepared and discussed at appraisal.

16.    The project team pushed for some early agreements during project preparation.
Thus, re-classification of roads and re-definition of responsibilities between RHD, LGED
and LGIs was made a condition for appraisal. The Planning Commission, LGED and
RHD formed a committee to work on the issue, and the decision was made in March
2003, an important milestone for the project.

17.    Maintenance needs were thoroughly analyzed during preparation and as a result
the decision was made to increase allocation of project funds for periodic maintenance
and rehabilitation, which doubled initially planned length of roads to be covered under
the component. To further strengthen the commitment of the government, a covenant was
agreed at negotiations which stipulated that the GoB should endeavor to increase by at
least 5% in real terms starting from FY2004/2005 and for duration of the project funds
needed to cover the estimated annual maintenance expenditures of the LGED managed
portion of the network.

18.    The design of the IS component was based on the recommendations of the
Management Capacity Strengthening Study (MANCAPS) funded under earlier projects,
and the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan was broken into short, medium and long-
term set of reform actions and was endorsed by the appraisal.

19.     The project team correctly identified many risks and designed the project in such
a way as to minimize many of them. However, the risk related to delays with land
acquisition and site readiness challenges, while correctly identified, proved very
challenging for mitigation and the project suffered from such delays. The problems with
procurement delays due to small contract packages in earlier projects, were suggested to
be addressed by piloting four ICB contracts (estimated value of about 10 percent of total
contracts value), however, this didn’t prove to be a feasible solution for rural roads due to
their geographic spread and relatively short sections of the roads.

20.     Participation of local communities in planning and prioritization of investments
and their implementation was deemed very important, and a separate Local Government
Improvement Program (LGIP) was designed as part of the IS component to improve
administrative, financial and management expertise of Local Government Institutions
(LGIs). Participatory selection of URs, markets and river jetties was incorporated in
project design, though the work of the Upazila and District level councils.

21.     Following the tested methodology of Socio-Economic Impact Evaluations under
the RRMMIP-II, the comprehensive baseline surveys were undertaken over a period of
10 months during project preparation and early in the implementation, which allowed for
collection of necessary data for end-of project evaluation.



                                             5
22.    Quality at Entry: No quality at entry assessment of the project was carried out.

2.2 Implementation
23.     The project was implemented over a course of 9 years. This is largely due to the
fact that the scope the project has been increased at the end of 2007 to implement
additional flood rehabilitation works. All works and technical assistance activities were
completed by the extended closing date of June 30, 2012.

24.    During implementation, improvement of UZ roads took longer to complete than
expected due to delays in land acquisition and poor contract management. The
maintenance component, however, progressed satisfactorily since it did not involve any
land acquisition. There was a severe price increase of construction materials (especially
cement and reinforcement steel) in international markets during the period of 2007 to
2008 which resulted in a major setback in the construction of UZ roads (many contractors
abandoned the site because of the high price of materials since price escalation was not
included as part of their contract).

25.     The Mid-Term Review of the project which took place in December 2005
identified the key issues related to delays in implementation, and after follow up
discussions, the LGED moved to start cancelling the contracts for non-performance. In
total 73 contracts had to be cancelled. Since the additional financing resulted in extended
closing date, most of the cancelled contracts were rebid and completed satisfactorily.
Although delayed, LGED’s prompt contractual decisions helped in the completion of
about 70 contracts.

26.     RTIP introduced four International Competitive Bidding (ICB) contract packages
on a pilot basis which were awarded in 2008 and each packages composed of four to five
roads. However, severe delays occurred during implementation mainly due to the large
geographic spread of the roads. Two contracts were completed with a one year extension
beyond the original contract period of thirty months. The other two contracts were
cancelled and re-awarded as National Competitive Bidding (NCBs).

27.      Supervision of the civil works was done jointly by LGED district and Upazila
engineers and by two appointed Design and Supervision Management consulting (DSM)
firms. However, it should be noted, that due to the limited capacity of the DSM in the
districts, a lot of supervision efforts had to be done by LGED.

28.     Quality control of the works was performed by the Quality Unit of the LGED.
District field laboratories were used for materials and soil testing. In addition, several
independent technical audits were commissioned, the last one in 2010 to review
implementation of the ICB contracts. The technical inspection of a sample of project
roads was also done during ICR preparation, which confirmed overall good quality of
construction.

29.  The main focus of the Institutional Strengthening Action Program (ISAP) of
LGED was related to (a) strategic development, (b) organizational development, (c)


                                            6
financial management and audit, (d) quality assurance and technical auditing, (e)
maintenance and asset management(f) rural transport safety, and (g) environmental and
social mitigation management. While implementation of ISAP was progressing
satisfactorily, the World Bank and LGED initiated an Operational Risk Assessment
(ORA) study in 2008 aiming to assess fiduciary and operational risks in LGED’s
management of projects, assets and other resources, to evaluate the efficacy of external
review of decision-making by LGED and the LGD, to identify options for future
monitoring of operational risks in LGED and the LGD, and to prioritize options which
are realistic and to effectively minimize the major operational risks identified. ISAP
steering group was monitoring ISAP activities, several working groups were formed to
focus on areas of organization and staffing, role and mission, training, rural transport
safety. In the last 2 years of project implementation ISAP steering Committee was
disassembled by the current Chief Engineer (CE), who formed instead the Inter-Unit
Coordination Committee, chaired by the CE.

30.      LGIP program included basic training for Union Parishads in preparation of
investment schemes, conducting public consultations, records maintenance, and was first
piloted in 5 districts, and after evaluation, rolled out to the rest of 21 districts. The second
phase of Intensive Strengthening was done on need basis, as a hands-on training for
Union Parishad management. It was planned to start it as pilot selecting one UP in a
districts and then rolling out to other interested UPs. However, in 2008-2009 another
project of the Bank (LGSP) started offering the training and grants, which unlike the
LGIP didn't require matching contribution of 20 percent from the UP. Thus the interest of
the UPs towards LGIP dried out. The UP elections at the end of 2010 diverted attention
and interest of UP heads. Initially the resource mobilization study was planned under this
component, however, it was dropped as it was understood it would be done under LGSP.

31.     About US$4.5 million of project credit remained undisbursed after the refund of
balances of DAs from all 21 districts and refund of ineligible expenses in December
20121. This balance resulted from a combination of factors (depreciation of Taka against
dollar- rate of 69 taka per 1 dollar at the moment of contract signing to about 82 Taka per
1 dollar in 2012, the decision not to rebid cancelled contracts after 2010, and changes in
the SDR/dollar). While there were discussions with LGED about using the money no
decision was made in this regard and the opportunity to utilize remaining money was
missed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.     Overall, the Results Framework for the project was designed to monitor
achievement of the project objectives and cover all key areas of the project, and an
appropriate set of outcome and intermediate indicators was identified. The outcome
indicators included reduction in travel time and transport costs, increased percentage of


1
  The refund took place with delays 6 months after project closure and by the time of ICR submission the
systems did not have updated information on the undisbursed amounts (still showing undisbursed amount
of US$0.9 million).



                                                    7
roads in good condition, percentage increase in maintenance funding, improved operating
efficiency of LGED, increase in revenue mobilization and employment creation. To
better assess the achievement of the first part of PDO the team should have considered a
separate indicator on measuring improved access to social services and economic
opportunities. While no indicator was formally entered, the socio-economic impact
assessment done in 2010 did look at the access to the health and educational facilities as
well as business opportunities and confirmed significant improvement in access
compared to control areas. By the time of introduction of Core Transport Indicators the
project was in the last stage of implementation and the decision was made not to add
them to the results framework.

33.     A number of deficiencies were identified by the ICR team: (i) the baselines for the
indicators were not provided in the PAD and were only introduced during first
Implementation Status Reports (ISR)2; (ii) the data for outcome indicator for revenue
mobilization for LGIs proved difficult to collect; (iii) the indicator for flood rehabilitation
component while listed in the Project Paper in Additional Financing was never formally
added to the results agreement of the project and was not part of monitoring of results in
the ISRs; (iv) the definition of the indicator on roads condition used the International
Roughness Index (IRI) proved inconsistent between the PAD and what was monitored
during the project. The PAD identified road in ‘good’ condition as a one with IRI below
4, however, the LGED used the definition of road condition as good with IRI<6. LGED
definition is appropriate for these types of roads; however the PAD used the definition set
too high making it impossible to achieve the target if interpreted by PAD definition. The
project was monitoring the percentage of roads in good condition, but somehow this
discrepancy in interpretation was never brought up.

34.     The project should be commended for developing further the methodology for
socio-economic monitoring and evaluation (SEME) piloted under previous RRMMIP
project and commissioning collection of comprehensive baseline and end result data. The
SEME was conducted in 2010 for a representative sample of investments and was able to
demonstrate significant benefits of the project. This methodology was developed as part
of the ISAP activities and introduced as a practice in LGED.

35.     A number of independent evaluations were also commissioned for specific
activities and areas of the project. This included independent evaluation of resettlement
done in 2011, assessment of implementation of Local Government Improvement Program
(LGIP) and ISAP implementation completed at the end of the project. Findings of these
assessments have informed preparation of the Second Rural Transport Improvement
project (RTIP-II).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



2
  The baselines for output indicators for infrastructure works were put as zero indicating that out of selected
roads and markets none have been yet improved/constructed.



                                                      8
Procurement
36.     Procurement of works, goods and consulting services was carried out in
accordance with the Bank guidelines. PIU had previous experience with WB procurement
rules which allowed processing of a very large amount of contracts. Project procurement
included 2065 contracts for civil works ( 70 for UZRs, 200 for URs, 900 for UR
structures, 150 for GCM, 45 for RJ, 100 for periodic maintenance and 600 for tree
plantation and off-pavement maintenance). There were 4 ICB contracts for UZRs
improvement, and the rest were procured under the NCB procedures, except for tree
plantation and maintenance. Tree plantation was done by soliciting three quotations, off-
pavement maintenance and tree- nursing were carried out through direct contracting
procedures by Labor Contracting Societies (LCSs). To allow for a proper distribution of
workload the project was designed to be implemented in three phases. Flood
rehabilitation works were added in the second half of the project when many of the
contracts were either completed or ongoing, thus, this didn’t create too much of a burden.

37.     Initial procurement capacity was low. During 2004-2007 as many as around 30%
contracts were awarded beyond the initial period of bid validity. There were instances of
weaknesses in procurement management and reporting quality, apparent political
influences in decisions, disinterest in investigating issues etc. These were overcome
gradually and since 2008, about 90% contracts used to be awarded within initial period of
bid validity. As the capacity grew rapidly, LGED tried to minimize delays in
procurement; in flood component even bid evaluation was done in a quick process. In
order to overcome bottlenecks and areas lacking understanding, LGED developed a core
group of procurement experts whose opinion was sought during difficult procurement
deliberations.

The components related to improvement and rehabilitation works experienced severe
delays with execution of some contracts and initially the LGED were slow with moving
on the non-performing contracts, however, after intensive urging of the Bank, the LGED
assumed a much more proactive role and started contract cancellations and rebidding.
Piloting of ICB contracts under the project proved their unsuitability for rural roads
works under the project. All ICB contracts experienced severe delays due to covering too
many roads, tight pricing, rising price of construction materials and contractor's inability
to mobilize multiple construction sites. Two ICBs had to be cancelled, divided into 4-6
lots, re-bid and awarded around 2009-2010 as NCBs.

38.     During the initial project implementation period, the post review on procurement
revealed some deficiencies and lapses by LGED. As a mitigation measure, after the Mid-
Term Review LGED started submitting quarterly Procurement Risk Mitigation Report
(PRMR) on an agreed format. Additionally, all RTIP engineers received procurement
training by LGED or the Government’s Central Procurement Training Unit, which helped
mitigate procurement risk. In October 2006, the Bank introduced this matrix of actions
aimed at reducing procurement-related risks in RTIP. It was further developed by
Government of Bangladesh under Public Procurement Reform Project (PPRP-II) and
developed as a set of procurement performance-related indicators named PROMIS. This
has elements regarding procurement performance on advertising, bidding, timeliness in



                                             9
evaluation and award, complaint resolution, F&C prevalence etc. During the first three
years of RTIP, there used to be frequent complaints by bidders. After implementing
PRMF, where LGED agreed to have complaint boxes in every district offices, the
occurrence of complaints diminished and Bank’s post-review also did not reveal any
issues related to contractors’/bidders’ representations.

39.     Independent procurement post-reviews were done annually between 2006 and
2012. The major deviations found, among others, were as follows: (a) bid evaluation not
done properly; (b) documents accepted for evaluation had inherent faults (i.e. bid
securities from unscheduled banks); (c) false/doctored experience certificates; (d)
apparent political influence in procurement decisions; (e) many occasions where
contracts were not completed on time; (f) collusion among bidders and inappropriate
bidding practices by LGED officials. Over the course of the project, the issues identified
in these reviews were eventually resolved, albeit with some delays. On the findings of
F&C or inappropriate bidding practices, LGED debarred firms and took disciplinary
actions against its officials in relevant cases. LGED during various stages of RTIP has
debarred about 20 firms, which is the highest among government agencies in Bangladesh
since such debarment started around June 2004. By the time of ICR submission one case
identified in the last post-review was under review of the Department of Institutional
Integrity (INT) of the World Bank.

40.    LGED is one of the target agencies of the Government’s PPRP-II. As part of it,
huge capacity building of LGED has taken place in last nine years, and currently 377 out
of 624 procuring entities (about 60 percent) of LGED have at least one person with
national three-week training on procurement. LGED is also a front-runner in
procurement monitoring and electronic government procurement.

Financial Management

41.     Financial management was quite weak and experienced a number of challenges at
different times during the project implementation.

42.     One of the issues was related to delays in settlement of audit issues between
LGED and Foreign Aided Project Audit Division and occasional inconsistencies in
accounting data. To increase the capacity of LGED’s accounting system, an accounting
firm with IT experience has been appointed to assess and customize the Unified Financial
Management System (UFMS) capability and accounting hierarchy in the system to
produce accurate and effective Financial Management Report (FMR). Submission of
FMRs was often delayed and sometimes with inaccurate information, and project
accounts of the RTIP have remained un-reconciled for a long time. These issues were
attributed to RTIP’s heavily decentralized structure, which created difficulties in
mobilizing adequate accounting resources across the field offices, transmitting financial
information from field offices to headquarters, and consolidating financial information at
headquarters. A financial expert appointed under a contract carried out reconciliation of
project accounts at the PD’s office and 21 district locations for the financial years 2004-
2010. A subsequent review of the consultant’s report by the Bank’s task team along with



                                            10
RTIP’s follow up action indicated that the issues identified in the PD’s office were
largely resolved. The reconciliation work for the remaining two years (FYs 2011 and
2012) has been undergoing during ICR preparation and with significant delays was
completed in December 2012.

43.     While LGED submitted the annual audited financial statements for RTIP on a
timely basis, it has shown some difficulties in resolving material pending issues identified
by the World Bank in the audit reports. Although LGED’s responses to audit issues were
previously slow, substantial progress was made to address these issues during appraisal
of the RTIP-II. All audit objections on the RTIP financial statements until 30 June 2011,
that were material to IDA have been satisfactorily resolved. LGED had developed a
UFMS, which was implemented in a few LGED projects but was not found adequate for
being used in RTIP. The system will be rolled out under the ongoing project.

44.     As detected in the course of financial management extended review of financial
position of the cancelled contracts, the outstanding amounts of mobilization advances on
three contracts became ineligible project expenditure. The mobilization advances would
have been recovered in full on completion of the contracts through deductions from the
contractors’ invoices over the contract periods. But as the contracts were cancelled half
way through, the outstanding amounts that were paid out of the Credit, became ineligible
and refundable to the Bank as the project did not get any value out of these. An amount
equivalent to US$ 236,408.70 has been recovered from the contractors and refunded to
the Bank in December 2012.

Environmental Safeguards

45.     The project has been classified as an Environment Category “A? due to
uncertainty of degree of environmental impacts against all possible activities under the
project and some subprojects that could have been located near ecologically sensitive
areas. The policy on environment assessment (OP/BP 4.01) was triggered during project
preparation. An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was prepared on March
2003 in compliance with the requirements of Government of Bangladesh and the World
Bank Safeguard Policy. The project activities included mainly improvement of the
existing rural roads and as such the environment impacts were mainly site specific,
temporary and not significant. Environmental issues identified in the project were mostly
construction-related; these included air quality, noise pollution, water logging, surface
water quality, drinking water quality, aquatic ecology, vegetation, top soil and borrow pit
area management etc.

46.    The environmental management of RTIP was carried out through the Project
Environmental Unit with the support of the Environment Specialists of the DSM
consultants and LGED field level offices. There were significant improvements
in terms of the quality of environmental screening/assessment report and monitoring
through the consultant. Environmental screening checklist was carried out for each
subproject to identify the impacts on the environment. The environmental assessment was
done for the subproject with moderate environmental impacts. EMP was prepared for



                                            11
each subproject and was included as specific line-items in the BOQ of the bidding
document. The project prepared the Environmental Code of Practice, which was also
used as guidelines for the contractors. The billboard introduced by the project on pilot
basis with environmental management plan with budget at the sub-project site created
significant awareness at community level on environmental management.

47.    Overall monitoring and quality control of environmental management required
much attention from LGED. The ICR found weaknesses in the documentation of EMP
progress reports and monitoring results as well as the establishment of Environmental
Management Information System (EMIS), which made it difficult for actual data
assessment.

Social safeguards

48.     Given the need for land acquisition and possible impacts on indigenous peoples,
the project prepared a Resettlement Framework (RF) and an Indigenous Peoples Planning
Framework (IPDPF) which were consistent with the Bank’s OP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement and OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples. The RF was prepared by using the
GOB’s present land acquisition ordinance and the Bank’s OP.12. The framework for
IPDPF was basically based on the Bank’s policy on indigenous peoples (IPs). The two
frameworks provided the bases to prepare and implement Resettlement Action Plans
(RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs).

49.     The project was implemented in three phases with three separate RAPs. The
design of the subprojects, which primarily consisted of improvement and expansion of
the existing Upazila roads, made all efforts to minimize acquisitions and hence their
adverse impacts. Still there were a large number of narrow strips to be acquired along the
existing road alignments. As a result, the affected landowners were large in number with
loss of relatively small amounts of land. The total amount of lands acquired was 427.91
acres (or 173.24 ha) which affected a total of 15,735 landowners or about a total of
14,304 households3. On average, the loss per landowner was 0.027 acre (or 0.011 ha).
Resumption of LGED’s own and other public lands from unauthorized private uses also
affected a total of 280 squatters, who mostly operated small businesses generally seen in
the rural areas. Reportedly, the project caused no adverse impacts on indigenous peoples
who are dispersed in small settlements in some of the project districts. LGED however
built two school houses and provided water supply and sanitation facilities at two
locations in the northern region of the country.

50.      Compensation Payment for the affected lands and other assets was paid in two
parts: (i) compensation-under-law (CUL) by the Deputy Commissioners (DCs – heads of
district ‘acquiring body’), and (ii) the top-up, which made up for shortfall in the
replacement/market prices of the affected properties and other stipulated entitlements to


3
 The number of landowners and households do not match, because acquired lands are sometimes legally
owned by more than one person of the same household.



                                                 12
both titleholders and others (mainly squatters) by LGED. The extremely time-consuming
and cumbersome acquisition process caused persistent delays in CUL payment by DCs.
By project end, the CUL payment amounted to about 92 percent of all affected
landowners under the three project phases. On its part, LGED cleared top-up and other
entitlements for 100 percent of the CUL recipients and squatters.

51.     Lack of legal ownership records was singled out as the main reason for the vast
majority of unpaid cases, followed by those where the land was acquired from co-sharers
who could not show up together to make the CUL claims. In many cases the landowners
were reluctant to claim compensation that were too small to commensurate the travel
time and costs to go to the DC offices at the district headquarters. In many other cases
affected landowners lived abroad and did never turn up to claim compensation from DCs.
The compensation fund would remain with the DCs in deposit accounts and the affected
persons could make the CUL claims whenever outstanding legal or other issues are
resolved.

52.     Low capacity in social safeguards contributed to the challenges. There appeared
to be a lack of clear system of information flow from Upazila to district and to the Project
Management Unit at the LGED headquarters. Most of the staff at district and Upazila
levels knew little about the social safeguard compliance requirements or had an
understanding of the mitigation policies, measures and application guidelines. The
situation was further worsened by the fact that acquisition was carried out by involving,
as the ordinance required, officials who belonged to different ministries and had no
accountability whatsoever to the project authority. Valuation of acquired lands and other
assets, which required participation of other GOB agencies like Public Works
Department, Forestry, Fisheries, etc., had been a challenge and contributed to the delays.

53.     An independent ex post review of the resettlement program was conducted and
found LGED generally adhering to the RF, however, it raised questions about the
practices in CUL determination by the acquisition officials and other participating GOB
agencies, and whether the compensation paid to the squatters was enough compared to
their losses.

54.     Despite all the delays and challenges with this safeguard, the achievement of
about 92% of payments to project affected people was one of the highest so far among
other projects in Bangladesh.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

55.     Although more than 1500 km of UZ roads were maintained under this project, this
falls far short of the country wide requirement. LGED has already prepared and
submitted a maintenance policy to the Ministerial Cabinet for approval which is expected
shortly. Development of three-year rolling maintenance plans is included as a covenant
under the RTIP-II.

56.    Number of initiatives started under the project will be continued and further
developed under the RTIP-II. This includes scaling up road safety pilot to be


                                            13
implemented in all 26 districts, and support for institutional strengthening and
implementation of recommendations of the ORA, focusing on improvements in the
following areas: maintenance management (policy, planning and operations); planning,
design and quality management; environmental and social (impact) management;
performance management including monitoring and evaluation; IT-ICT-MIS Technology,
facilities and capacity building; and training and human resource development capacity.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

57.      The project objectives remain highly relevant to the development priorities of
Bangladesh. The PDO “to provide rural communities with improved access to social
services and economic opportunities, and to enhance the capacity of relevant government
institutions to better manage rural transport infrastructure? remained relevant throughout
the life of the project and is as relevant now as it was at the time of project appraisal. The
project was in line with the Country Assistance strategies of the World Bank and
reflected development priorities of the government. The importance and relevance of the
objective is also reflected in the recently approved RTIP-II which aims to carry forward
the achievements of the current project by further rural connectivity in 26 districts and
strengthen institutional capacity for sustainable rural road maintenance and is fully
aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY11-14.

58.     The project design comprising components for improvement and maintenance and
rehabilitation of rural road infrastructure and institutional development rightly placed
emphasis not only on the improvement of roads but also on their maintenance as well as
capacity development activities to facilitate in efficient and effective management of the
rural road network by the LGED, and was thus consistent with the overall objectives of
improving access to markets and social services for the rural population.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

59.     Achievement of the PDO was measured through the key outcome indicators of the
project, which included: reduction in average travel time and cost, percentage increase of
roads in good and fair condition, increase in maintenance funding, improvement of
operating efficiency, increase in revenue mobilization and employment created.

60.    Most of the project targets were achieved and surpassed. The final report of the
third and final round of data collection for the Socio-Economic Monitoring and
Evaluation (SEME) study calculated reduction in travel times at 58% for motorized
vehicles during dry season and 65% during monsoon and for non-motorized vehicles
53% during dry season and 61% during monsoon, surpassing the target of 25 percent.
Civil works contracts already executed have resulted in the creation of 50, 275 person-
years of employment in the project area surpassing the end of project target of 24,000
person-years. It should be noted that project paid special attention to the employment of
women through Labor Contracting Societies in off pavement maintenance work and tree



                                             14
planting. Unfortunately, the target of roads in good condition cannot be considered
formally achieved, if using the PAD definition of roads in good condition4.

61.     All targets for intermediate indicators related to roads improvement, rehabilitation
and maintenance were achieved and surpassed – more than 1630 km of UZ and UP roads
were improved, 15,956 meters of bridges and culverts constructed to expand
continuously passable network and 2120 km of UZ and UP roads rehabilitated and
maintained. However, the target for construction of Growth Center Markets and River
Jetties was reached only at 82 and 71 percent accordingly, reflecting challenges with
raising co-financing by the communities.

62.     The major RTIP capacity building targets for the LGED and for the involved local
government institutions have been either fully or partially met. The main RTIP
mechanisms in this context, the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP) and the
Local Government Improvement Program (LGIP) have been substantially completed.
There were some substantial achievements in supporting institutional strengthening of
LGED. Institutional reforms at LGED transformed it into the agency with vision and
strategy and a focus on continued modernization. Maintenance policy developed under
the project and adopted by LGED is a significant milestone 5 . Environmental
strengthening facilitated by the project led to mainstreaming environmental management
into regular operations of LGED. The LGIP program provided training to more than
20,000 people from local government institutions thus building their capacity in
budgeting, planning and project management, enabling them to better participate with
LGED in prioritization of investments. Wider GOB issues and policy changes have
hampered the LGIP aim of assisting LG revenue mobilization and the total LGI revenue
mobilization remains static at Tk 200K, against the original target of Tk 260K. The
allocation of Tk 6.25 billion in the FY 2011-12 GOB budget for LGED road network
maintenance continues to exceed target of Tk 3.2 Billion. The target of 11.65 percent in
the agreed 'overall LGED operating efficiency' index has again been exceeded, now being
calculated at 4.9 percent.

63.     However, a number of challenges remain and would require consistent effort in
the short-to-medium term. Introduction of Unified Financial Management System in
LGED was not fully achieved as initially intended in large extent due to limited
commitment of LGED management to this area; internal audit strengthening initiative
didn’t result in establishment of the Audit Cell. While during project life there were a
number of confirmations by LGED of establishment of a separate Road Safety Cell,
currently its functions are embedded with the Maintenance Unit and the dedicate Road
Safety specialist has been appointed only after project closure following prodding by


4
  The PAD used definition of the road in good condition having roughness index (IRI) less than 4, while
the LGED used the definition of IRI less than 6. Using the LGED definition the target of 6,200 km of roads
in good condition in the project area by the end of the project was surpassed.

5
    expected to be approved by the Cabinet shortly



                                                     15
RTIP-II. Development of ICT strategy and action plan experienced significant delays and
was only completed by the end of the project period and its implementation will have to
be supported by the ongoing project.

3.3 Efficiency

64.    An economic analysis has been carried out at appraisal for three of the eight
components described in the PAD: (i) improvement of about 1,000 kms of UZ Roads; (ii)
first year periodic maintenance/rehabilitation of about 1,500 km UZ roads; (iii)
improvement/construction of about 150 rural markets. These components represent about
72 percent of the total estimated project cost. Their Economic Rate of Return (ERR) at
appraisal was 20.5 percent for the UZ improvement component; 52 percent for the Phase
I UZ road maintenance/rehabilitation component; and 28.9 percent for the rural market
improvement component.

65.     The ex-post economic analysis focuses on the improvement of UZ roads and
improvement of rural markets, considering actual investment costs. According to
information provided by LGED at ICR stage, (i) the actual economic investment cost of
the 72 UZ road links that were improved was on average 11% higher than planned and
the actual investment cost for the 116 markets that were improved was on average 21
percent lower than estimated at appraisal. The ex-post ERR is 19.2 percent for the UZ
improvement component and 35.2 percent for the rural market improvement program.
The ex-post economic evaluation also shows that the periodic maintenance/rehabilitation
component has a positive Net Present Value (NPV); thus all project components yield a
satisfactory economic return considering the actual investment costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

66.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The project remained very relevant to the
development priorities of Bangladesh and achieved significant results in improving rural
road infrastructure in 21 districts of Bangladesh and providing better connectivity.
However, some of the project targets could not be fully reached, and despite very good
record of implementation of key steps of institutional reform of LGED, a number of areas
of institutional strengthening proved to be challenging for implementation.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67.     The SEME conducted under the project indicated improved access to social
services in project areas compared to control areas. In Project villages the number of
healthcare service recipients per month went up by 32%, with a 35% growth in the
number of female recipients. On the contrary, in control villages the number of service
recipients per month decreased by 20%, with a 3% increase in the number of female
recipients. The number of new account holders in regular Bank branches rose by twice as
much in RTIP project villages as in control villages, the sign of increased savings and
access to a more modern economy. The studies confirm that households became


                                              16
wealthier in project areas and saw a general improvement of their livelihood. The average
monthly income rose by 73.6% in project areas and by 14.8% in control areas, while
average monthly expenditure increased by 55.8% in project areas and by 33.9% in
control areas.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68.     The project’s impact on institutional development has been mainly in areas of: (i)
definition of LGED role, core functions and resources for strategic planning; (ii) network
ownership and management; (iii) assistance to LGIs to improve services delivery and
governance; (iv) LGED organizational structure, staffing profile and skills mix; (v)
governance and performance accountability; (vi) enhancement of ICT assets, IT strategic
planning, GIS and MIS capabilities; (vii) Human Resources development and training to
support LGED functions and priorities; (viii) road network maintenance, and (ix)
Environmental Management. See Annex 2 for details.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69.    Development of Operational Risk Assessment (ORA) for the entire LGED in
2007-2009 was not initially envisioned in the PAD, however realization of the need to
address critical risks related to LGED operations and improve governance and
accountability led to the agreement to conduct the extensive and comprehensive ORA
exercise under the ISAP implementation. This was an LGED-driven process with
extensive consultations and discussions, with establishment of a high-level committee
which endorsed ORA recommendations and the Management Improvement Plan (MIP).

70.     Road Safety assessments and three pilots implemented under the project led to
greater road safety awareness among LGED and it was agreed to scale up this initiative to
26 districts under the new project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

71.    The SEME conducted under the project confirmed positive impacts of the project
on improved access to social services and economic opportunities. See Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

72.     The risk to development outcome of this operation is rated as Moderate. The
main sustainability risk relates to a lack of maintenance finance and its efficient use. The
commitment of GoB to increase maintenance funding was in part demonstrated by
increased amounts allocated during project life and will be further supported by approval
of the National Rural Roads Maintenance Policy and preparation of three-year rolling
maintenance plans.
73.     The quality of completed works was considered acceptable; however, the big
challenge for sustaining roads in good condition represents the increase of traffic on
rehabilitated roads, particular of the overloaded trucks. Overloading is recognized as one


                                            17
of the major maintenance and safety challenges for Bangladesh road network. The
National Road Safety Council is working on the proposed legislation to address
overloading. Under the ongoing RTIP-II it is planned to procure weigh bridges and
further support development of maintenance capacity of LGED. A number of institutional
strengthening initiatives started under the project will be further developed under
implementation of RTIP-II which became effective in November 2012.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
74.     Preparation of the project was thorough and built heavily on the analytical and TA
work done under the previous WB-funded projects - (RRMIMP-I and RRMIMP –II).
Some important steps were agreed during project preparation including the decision on
re-classification of roads and re-definition of responsibilities between RHD, LGED and
LGIs as a condition for appraisal and including legal covenant on increased annual
maintenance funding. The project was designed well to include key elements needed for
achieving PDO and piloting new concepts and approaches. The Bank team spent
considerable time discussing maintenance needs and moved to increase funding for the
maintenance-related component. The team was adequately composed with good mix of
technical skills. However, a number of weaknesses in the results framework were
overlooked, including errors in indicator definition and missing baselines. The team was
probably too optimistic in estimating the implementation period for such a complex
project. Thus, the overall Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.      This has been a difficult project for Bank staff to supervise and monitor
effectively just because of the sheer volume of sub-projects. Considerable efforts were
made to diligently monitor implementation of the contracts. When significant delays in
contract implementation became widely spread in 2005, the team spent considerable time
to address contract management issues and followed-up with LGED on proactive actions.
This eventually led to improvements in contract management and project implementation
picked up. The project had three Task Team Leaders during project implementation and
benefitted greatly from Dhaka-based co-TTL who remained the same from project
preparation through most of supervision, and remained engaged till project closure.
Initially no local environment specialist had been involved in the task team of the project.
Later, in 2007, the Environment Specialist joined Dhaka Office and participated in
mission on regular basis. The frequency of full supervision missions was twice a year and
these were supplemented by interim missions. Bank mission documents were clear in
admitting issues and problems early on and were well prepared.
76.      While the bulk of supervision efforts were done with high quality, the team
missed to address issues related to the indicators and their monitoring. The restructuring
at the time of Additional Financing should have been used to revise the results framework.



                                            18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77.    The project was well prepared and executed with significant supervision efforts
by the Bank team, however, some shortcomings during project preparation and
implementation should have been addressed, particularly relating to monitoring results.
The task team actively addressed client requests in a timely manner and adapted
accordingly as major issues emerged. Proactive engagement with the LGED on contract
management enabled implementation to improve and pick up.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
78.     The government had a strong commitment to the project and facilitated its timely
completion. The provisions of the legal covenant on increased maintenance funding were
complied with and there were no issues with counterpart funding. The government
supported the important steps of the institutional strengthening of LGED by approving re-

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.     LGED is one of the best performing agencies in Bangladesh and had considerable
experience with implementation of donor funded projects, including two Bank-funded
projects. The PMU’s capacity to implement the project improved over the life of the
project and contributed towards completion of the project with huge volume of contracts
and activities. There were 3 Project Directors for the Project and about 47 positions
involved in project implementation including staff in the districts. Three staff in LGED
HQ were engaged under the previous Bank-funded project (FM, social and environmental
specialist-the latter became Deputy PD during RTIP) which developed institutional
memory of PMU and ensured consistency with earlier initiatives. Overall the LGED
performed well in implementation of this large project and managed to achieve intended
results. However, the project suffered from procurement irregularities identified in post-
reviews, delayed contract management issues and weak financial management. Thus, the
implementing agency performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
80.    Given that Government performance on the project is rated as Satisfactory and
Implementing Agency performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, overall Borrower
performance on the project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
81.    The lessons learned during implementation of RTIP include:

  Land Acquisition and Resettlement aspects. The implementation of road works was
   often delayed due to the resolution of the LA&R actions but the road sections which
   did not involve any LA&R actions, were implemented as planned. The land
   acquisition should therefore be minimized to the extent possible; all actions


                                            19
      including compensation to the affected persons should be completed prior to
      awarding civil work contracts (with relevant legal covenants).
     Price Escalation Provision. RTIP civil works contracts did not include the price
      escalation clause (construction period was less than 18 months). However,
      construction material prices did rise during the implementation period. Many
      contractors were forced to abandon the works and about 70 contracts were cancelled
      and then re-awarded. The civil work contracts should include such a provision.
     Procurement of ICB vis-a-vis NCB Contracts. Four ICB contracts were awarded on
      a pilot basis each with four to five non-contiguous roads. Large geographic
      distribution of roads caused implementation delays and quality control issues. Two
      of the four contracts were cancelled and re-awarded. ICB method might not be
      appropriate for small scale rural roads with small sections and wide geographical
      spread.
     Inclusion of EMP in Bill of Quantities (BoQ). The contractors quoted lower price
      for the items of environmental management plan (EMP) in BOQs, mainly due to
      their lack of awareness and experience. As a result the contractor was unwilling to
      perform this obligation. To ensure contractors do not renege on their contractual
      obligations, the executing agency should put reasonable fixed amount against this
      BOQ item.
     Importance of time sequencing of procurement. On many occasions LGED
      awarded civil works contracts at the beginning of rainy season or late in the dry
      season, resulting in non-activity of contractors for half of the year and delays in
      contract implementation. All contracts which were awarded in this pattern took one
      year extra for completion. This did not impact maintenance contracts but only
      improvement works. On the other hand contracts awarded by the end of rainy
      season had two full dry seasons to be completed.
     Timely implementation of Institutional Strengthening Component. The
      procurement of key TA and consultancy services should be completed by project
      launch to avoid lengthy deferrals in implementation with gradually reduced
      counterparts concern and drive.
     Mainstreaming initiatives. Where piloting of important new concepts, processes and
      approaches is planned, there should be a provision for rapid transition from pilot to
      mainstreaming within the term of the same project rather than plan an up-take of the
      post-pilot activity in the new project with risk of loss of momentum.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

An economic analysis has been carried out at appraisal for three of the eight components
described in the PAD:
   1. Improvement of about 1,000 kms of UZ Roads:
   2. First year periodic maintenance/rehabilitation of about 1,500 km UZ roads.
   3. Improvement/construction of about 150 rural markets

These components represent about 72 percent of the total estimated project cost. Their
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) at appraisal was (a) 20.5 percent for the UZR
improvement component; (b) 52 percent for the Phase I UZR road
maintenance/rehabilitation component; and (c) 28.9 percent for the rural market
improvement component. The combined NPV for the project at appraisal was estimated
at USS 124.6 million (Tk. 7.10 billion).

Improvement of about 1,000 kms of UZ roads: These roads were selected through a
techno-economic prioritization study. The benefits were estimated using: (a) the savings
in VOC; (b) change in modal mix; and (c) increased traffic due to improved access as
well as natural traffic growth. The ERR for the selected 144 road links ranged from a
low of 13.8 percent to a high of 46 percent. The ERR for most of the roads ranged
between 18-22 percent. The overall ERR for this component was estimated to be 20.5
percent and the NPV, discounted at 12 percent, USS45.10 million.

During the life of the project, 72 of the roads identified at appraisal for the economic
analysis were dropped since they were not feasible and some of them failed to deposit the
local contribution timely. The revised EIRR for the remaining 72 links calculated at
appraisal stage is 21.2%.

According to information provided by LGED at ICR stage, the actual economic
investment cost of the 72 road links was on average 11% higher than planned. However,
it is important to mention that the variance within cost is significant, ranging from -92%
to +303%. The huge variance is due to the fact that the construction costs had varied
significantly due to the introduction of variations to the original specifications such as the
construction of culvers and in some cases bridges in geographical sensitivity areas
including wetlands and low-lying areas.

Switching value analysis at appraisal stage has shown that the project cost has to increase
up to 50 percent for the NPV to drop to zero. This implies that with an average cost
increase of 11 percent, it is expected that the NPV at ICR stage of the implementation of
the UZR improvement component has remained positive.

The average daily traffic of 72 roads that were improved under the project is 1,275
vehicles per day and the average actual improvement cost per km is US$ 65,450 per km.
An ex-post economic evaluation was done considering the actual improvement costs;
replicating first the appraisal ERR of the improvement works program and then
increasing the appraisal improvement costs by 11 percent. The ex-post economic ERR is



                                             24
19.2 percent, which indicates that this project component is economically justified even
with the 11 percent improvement cost increase.

Improvement/construction of about 150 rural markets (Growth Centre Markets,
GCM): The selection of rural markets was made using an integrated approach to rural
development with most markets located at the end of the improved UZRs or URs. The
economic benefit of improved markets has been estimated on the basis of: (a) reduction
in spoilage of perishable goods (defined as the loss in value of goods over time of the day
due to deterioration of goods in the market); and (b) increased market turnover. Of a total
of 187 markets, 151 of them had an ERR above 12 percent and were selected for
improvement. The ERR for this component was estimated to be about 28.9 percent
assuming a 2.5 percent spoilage rate and it ranged from a low of 16 percent to a high of
78 percent. The NPV, discounted at 12 percent, was US$12.6 million. The typical ERR
for 15 small market centers was 21.3 percent, for medium 43 market centers 23.5 percent,
and for the remaining 92 large market centers 32.7 percent.

During the life of the project, 35 of the selected markets were dropped (some of them
were dropped as they were not feasible and some of them failed to deposit local
contribution timely). The average revised ERR for the remaining 116 markets at appraisal
stage is 28.6 percent (compared to 28.9 percent for the 151 markets).

According to information provided by LGED at ICR stage, the actual investment cost for
the 116 markets was on average 21 percent lower than estimated at appraisal. This is
mainly due to reduction of the scope of work due to shortage of land. The average
reduction in spoilage estimated at ICR stage was 3 percent therefore higher than
estimated at appraisal (2.5 percent). Since benefits were higher and cost lower for the
implementation of the market improvement component, it is expected that the NPV has
remained positive. Considering the lower implementation costs, the ex-post ERR is
estimated to be 35.2 percent.

In the case of improvement/construction of about 45 river jetties/ghats, no economic
analysis was presented in the PAD, however some analysis was carried out immediately
after appraisal to facilitate the selection of the ghats to be improved under the project. A
cost effectiveness criteria (US$ invested per Ghat User), was used to prioritized them.
Unfortunately, information for only about 23 out of the 45 improved ghats was available
at ICR stage. The actual cost at ICR stage was 14% higher than the estimated at
Appraisal stage. However, since on average, the number of ghat users was 26% higher
than forecasted, the amount invested per ghat users was, on average, 14% lower that at
appraisal indicating that the implementation of the component was cost-effective.

Periodic maintenance/rehabilitation of about 1,500 km UZ roads: The NPV/Cost
ratio was used to prioritize the first year maintenance/rehabilitation program after
collecting data on 1,200 km of UZRs roads. The benefits have been estimated from
reduced VOC for different vehicle types. The ERR for the 57 roads selected in the first
year phase ranged from 13 percent to 111 percent with an average of about 52 percent.
The NPV for the first year program was estimated at US$66.68 million and the life time



                                            25
economic cost of US$13.24 million. The NPV for this component is extrapolated to
US230.0 million using the same ratio of NPV to cost as for the first year program.

With respect to the improvement of about 500 kms of UR roads, no economic analysis
was carried out at appraisal stage. The selection of URs was agreed to be done during
project implementation through a consultative process with the users and communities on
the rural roads to be improved. Unfortunately, since information is not available at
Appraisal Stage, no comparison can be carried out at ICR stage.

The Key Findings of the Socio-Economic Monitoring and Evaluation Report of
RTIP6:7

            The average number of passengers using motorized vehicles rose by around 500%
             in RTIP project areas, 40% more than on control roads. On the contrary, the
             increase in the use of non-motorized vehicles for passenger travel during hat
             (market) days on RTIP control roads was almost 100% more than on project roads.
             This difference can be explained by the fact that road improvement favors the use
             of motorized vehicles, thereby reducing the number of people traveling by non-
             motorized modes.
            After project completion, passenger fares were found to be 8 % lower on RTIP
             Project roads during hat days and 38% lower on RTIP Project roads during non-
             hat days. On the contrary, passenger fares have increased on RTIP control roads.
             However, the decrease in passenger fares is less than the decrease in vehicle
             operating costs reflecting less than perfect market conditions with a limited
             transport supply compared to the huge unsatisfied demand at least during the
             period of the studies
            The daily volume of goods carried on project roads increased by around twice as
             much as the volume of goods carried on the control roads by motorized vehicles
             and non-motorized vehicles on hat days and non-hat days. However, contrary to
             what was seen on RRMIMP Project roads, freight fares increased by 24% on hat
             days and by 182 % on non-hat days in project areas. In RTIP control areas this
             increase was a much higher 1300%. Owing that Bangladesh experienced a
             significant price hike during the RTIP inter-survey period, such figures could
             rather vindicate the idea that road improvement contributed to minimizing the
             effect of price hike in project areas
            As a direct consequence of traffic improvement, agricultural and non-agricultural
             productions appear to have been stimulated in project villages. In RTIP Project
             villages it was observed a 195% increase in average yield per hectare.
            The growth in the number of enterprises per road was higher in projects villages
             than in control villages, thus confirming the positive impact of the projects on the
             global economic growth of targeted villages.
            Rehabilitation and improvement of growth center markets seem to have
             stimulated the trade activities in all project areas, since at the end of the inter-
             survey period there were 265 new permanent shops during hat days in RTIP’s
             GCM. In RTIP control areas, the number of permanent shops increased by 134%.

 for RTIP, the study was conducted in three Phases (2003-04, 2006, 2008-09). The sample consisted of 22 UZRs, 8 GCM and 4 Ghats.
For both surveys data were collected during the rainy season and during the dry season




                                                               29
    In all the project areas overall turnover of shops increased dramatically in
    comparison to the control areas.
   Better income and enhanced transport conditions improved access to social
    services. In RTIP Project villages the number of healthcare service recipients per
    month went up by 32%, with a 35% growth in the number of female recipients.
    On the contrary, in control villages the number of service recipients per month
    decreased by 20%, with a 3% increase in the number of female recipients. As for
    education, the total student enrollment increased by around 12.2% in RTIP project
    villages, whereas it decreased by 60% in RTIP Control villages.
   Finally, the number of new account holders in regular Bank branches rose by
    twice as much in RTIP project villages as in control villages, the sign of increased
    savings and access to a more modern economy.
   The studies confirm that households became wealthier in project areas and saw a
    general improvement of their livelihood. The average monthly income rose by
    73.6% in project areas and by 14.8% in control areas, while average monthly
    expenditure increased by 55.8% in project areas and by 33.9% in control areas.

2.0     Objectives of the Project

The project development objectives are to: (i) remove physical bottlenecks, improve
quality and enhance sustainability of rural transport and market services; and (ii) improve
local institutional capacity for effective rural infrastructure investment and efficient rural
infrastructure management, including maintenance. To meet the above development
objectives, the project will produce the following main outputs:
(i) Improvement of about 1638 km of priority Upazila and Union Roads including
      critical bridges and cross drainage facilities;
(ii) Maintenance of approximately 2,123.64 km of UZRs and URs with appurtenant
      structures;
(iii) Improvement of about 123 growth center markets and 32 river jetties; and
(iv) Construction of 15,956 meters bridges/culverts on Union Roads
(v) Increased role of local government and communities in management and financing
      of local transport and trade facilities.

3.0     Scope of the Project

The main components of the project were:

      1. Improvement and upgrading of 1638 km of UZRs and URs in the 21 districts of
         the project area to full all-weather bitumen surfaced standard.
      2. The planning and implementation of a coordinated system of maintenance of the
         2,123.64 km of road network in the project area, comprising UZRs and URs.
      3. Construction of 15,956 linear meters drainage structures (culverts and small
         bridges) on existing union/village roads.
      4. Planning, improvement and maintenance of the market infrastructure (internal
         roads and footpaths, drainage, sales platforms and sheds, latrines and potable
         water supply) in 123 Growth Centre Markets (GCM) in the project area
      5. Planning rehabilitation/improvement and maintenance of 32 priority rural "ghats"
         in the project area to improve landing, loading and unloading, and other facilities
         for operation of country boats.




                                             32
      6. Institutional and human resource development to strengthen the management and
          technical capacity of LGED including the provision of training and
          implementation of Institutional Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP). Conducting
          Quality Assurance Audit at a periodic interval for sample sub-projects.
      7. Implementation of Local Government Improvement Plan (LGIP) to address the
          internal weakness of the Union Parishad (The lowest tire of local government of
          Bangladesh).
      8. Improvement of rural transport safety including safety assessment; awareness,
          advocacy and educational campaign and capacity building.
      9. Technical assistance support for the implementation of project activities including
          the design, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the annual work programs
          and support for institutional development.
      10. Implementation of social and environmental safeguards with regards to
          Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and Environmental Management
          Framework (EMF). Conducting Independent Review for Resettlement program
          and Environmental Auditing for environmental components

4.0      Floods of 2004 and 2007

After the devastating floods in 2004 and 2007, additional monies of an amount 41.64
USD were pooled, with an additional objective to facilitate rehabilitation of rural roads,
markets, bridges and small jetties which had been damaged by the floods. The 2004 and
2007 floods had caused major dislocations in people's lives, and the revival of the
economy in part depended on the rehabilitation of the rural infrastructure network.
Implementation Support was also provided for technical assistance for design,
supervision, monitoring of rehabilitation works of roads, bridges / culverts, markets and
ghats damaged by 2004 and 2007 floods in the project area.

5.0      Project Implementation Details

Design and Documentation: The consultants prepared the contract documents and
designs for the project. However, these were based on LGED standards and experience
gained on other rural development projects. During implementation the targets set forth
earlier in different components were, in reality increased, and based on primarily because
of devaluation of taka against SDR and actual requirement.

5.1 Improvement of UZRs and Union Roads (URs): Improvement and upgrading of
    1638 km of UZRs and URs in the 21 districts of the project area to full all-weather
    bitumen surfaced standard, including the construction of 10,977.79 linear meters of
    drainage structures on these roads; and tree planting along them.
5.2 The planning and implementation of a coordinated system of maintenance of the
    2,123.64 km of road network in the project area, comprising UZRs and URs. The
    project provided specialized support as well as procured equipment / accessories for
    LGED’s RIMU in order to strengthen the capacity of it further. It put the credible
    effort to mainstream the computerization of maintenance management using updating
    the data of Road and Structure Database Management System (RSDMS).



                                             33
5.3 Construction of Structures on Union Roads (SURs). The initial targets for
    construction of about 15,000 m culverts and small bridges were exceeded to about
    15,956 meters, and were carried out within the project timeframe. The drainage
    structures were built on existing rural roads in the project districts. These also
    corrected drainage problems created by the existing rural roads. This involved
    community participation in the selection of the structures and financial contribution
    by the local governments. Interest from local communities was very high, and an
    efficient implementation by the LGED allowed this component to be ahead of
    schedule. In view of the growing demand of the rural communities, local bodies and
    beneficiaries, and the benefits derived from the implementation of this component,
    the physical targets were increased.

   Construction of 15,956 linear meters drainage structures (culverts and small bridges)
   on existing union/village roads in the project area, with special emphasis on local
   participation in planning, financing, and implementation. The structures were selected
   through a participatory process involving local bodies and local communities, who
   contributed 5% ~10% of the cost (depending on the incidence of poverty), and use
   was made of labor intensive technologies requiring the employment of landless poor
   and disadvantaged women.

5.4 Improvement of Growth Centerl Markets. The Project improved 123 GCMs (versus
    PAD target of 150). The Project successfully finished the component within time and
    quality standards. The quality of the design and of the works were improved
    continuously (for example, systematic inclusion of latrines for men and women,
    inclusion of women's corners with shops reserved for women, testing of tube wells
    for arsenic, effective supervision of the local contractors, etc).

   While the construction phase was very successful, the operation and management of
   the markets still need improvement. The project trained and assisted the Market
   Management Committees (MMCs) that supervise the markets and leaseholders in
   charge of toll collection, cleaning and guarding. The lease value of the markets after
   improvement has shown a favorable impact registering a figure of about 17%
   although collusion among the potential leaseholders that depress the bid price for the
   rights to collect tolls from theusers had also been noticed in some cases. The
   concerted and pragmatic steps of the undertaken by the Ministry of Local
   Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MoLGRDC) had improved the
   market leasing procedures.

5.5 Rehabilitation / Construction of River Jetties (Ghats). Following consultations with
    the community and considering hydrological factors, the number of `ghats' was
    reduced to 32 from a target of 45 in the PA. The revised target has been achieved. It is
    however difficult to estimate the socioeconomic impact of this component, even
    though the benefits of improving river transport facilities are considered high.




                                            34
5.6 Training: The Project Management Unit (PMU) of the LGED, in coordination with
the Central Training Unit (CTU) of the LGED, provided inputs and resources for
conducting various types of training for the LGED staff, contractors and local authorities
within the project area. During the project period, a total of 23 training courses,
workshops and seminars were organized. A total of 12,859 participants received training
during this period, including 48 LGED engineers who received overseas training. The
results of IS impact assessment study show that the training program has contributed to
ensuring the quality of different project components as well as to build up the LGED's
capacity and update the skills of its staff. Meanwhile LGED has mobilized dedicated
resources both manpower as well as budget from revenue head. It is progressively
introducing a systematic training monitoring system within the LGED.

5.7 Quality Control : In addition to LGED and Consultant’s regular supervision, the
project carried out Quality Assurance Audit through the consultants. The audit
observations revealed many good things like improvement of compliance record,
adequacy and frequency of the tests performed while recommended some areas which
needed further attention. They emphasize the need for preparing Quality Assurance
manual

5.8 Tree planting : Tree plantation was carried out along 905km length of the roads and
this provided employment opportunity to a considerable number of destitute women.
These women employed under "Labor Contracting Societies (LCS)" were also
responsible for the maintenance of the plants. This was anexcellent program benefiting
both destitute women and it favorably contributed towards improvement of the
environment.

5.9 Participation : Participation by the local community in the selection, planning,
design, implementation and maintenance of improved infrastructure was an important
component of the project. The guideline of user’s participation prepared under last
project was duly followed. However, it appeared that more training will be required for
the management of ghats and markets and more transparency is required in financial
matters.

5.10 Land Acquisition : Land acquisition problems caused some delay towards physical
progress at the early stages of the project but the matter was improved and there was no
significant problem regarding disruption to the progress of the work after the initial stage.
The nature of work of the project did not require extensive land acquisition and only 302
hectares of land were acquired. LGED and the consultants staff worked together closely
to expedite payments of compensation and sort out related problems/issues.

5.11 Environmental & Social Issues : The project did not have a major environmental
impact due to the nature of the works. Roads were improved using the existing alignment
and little new land was required. Trees were planted on road slopes, embankments were
planted with grass, and drainage was improved through construction of bridges/culvert on
roads. In the markets and ghats drainage was improved, clean drinking water was
provided and garbage disposal and sanitation facilities were provided. The issue of



                                             35
arsenic in tube wells for drinking water was addressed by testing and only few tube wells
were found to have an arsenic content in excess of the tolerance limit and appropriate
measures were taken.

The total number of participants was 48 attending 9 no. of courses
5.13 Institutional Development Component: The Institutional Strengthening Action Plan
(ISAP) implementation status as the project approaches closure is rated satisfactory. The
Financial Management improvements, updating IT-ICT-MIS strategy and capacity, and
organizational and staffing enhancements, consistent with the 2009 Operational Risk
Assessment (ORA) recommendations have substantially been achieved. Basic Training
on road safety conducted by two former directors of Accident Research Institute, BUET
has also been completed.

5.14 Local Government (LG) Capacity Building: The LG Improvement Plan (LGIP) is
substantially and satisfactorily completed. Implementation progress in the two most
substantive elements Basic Training (BT); and the subsequent on-site Intensive
Strengthening (IS) ‘training and support services’ phase has mostly completed. However,
the third LGIP phase, involving take-up by participating LGIs of local Infrastructure
Maintenance Assistance, could not be implemented because the impact of the 2009 and
2010 LG elections. LGIs lacked incentive to participate in LGIP which required cost-
contribution from LGIs for an IMA compared to the country-wide Local Government
Support Program (LGSP) or similarly GOB-funded programs which provide for block-
allocation grants for similar purposes without any such LGI cost-contribution
requirement.

5.15 Rural Transport Safety Component: Achievement of this component is rated highly
satisfactory. The RTSC had three major areas (i) Safety Assessment and Mitigation: 5
roads (3 pilots and 2 controls) were chosen from 3 regions based on selected criteria.
Their safety deficiencies were identified and appropriate engineering measures were
undertaken accordingly. These included treatment of junctions, widening at bends,
providing super elevation ,cross-fall, signage, markings, passenger sheds, bus-stops,
street lights at the market places/built-up areas, pedestrian crossings, guard posts, retro-
reflective paints at rails and rail posts etc. Local people were involved in the design and
implementation of safety schemes through structured participatory approaches. (ii)
Awareness, Advocacy and Education: the community education included information
campaign, awareness rising etc by Community Road Safety Groups (CRSG). (iii)
Capacity Building: Basic training on road safety was imparted to local government
representatives, motorized or non-motorized drivers. Limited enforcement incorporated
in the management of traffic in market places by the village police.

Performance of different entities


                                            37
(a)      Contractors: Contracts for the implementation of the project activities were
largely small to medium which had attracted many local contractors to undertake the
work. In case of large contracts, their performance varied and many of these required
additional time to complete. Nevertheless, the performance of ICB contractors were
worst suggesting international bidding is not suitable for geographically dispersed sites.

(b)   Consultancy for the Project: The project had following consultancies

These consultants worked closely with LGED personnel in the preparation of design,
supervision and monitoring of construction works and certified the satisfactory
completion of all the works to the required quality standard. Favorable comments about
the generally good quality of work indicated the satisfactory performance of DSMC
under the project.

(c)     Project Management : An LGED Project Management Unit (PMU) was formed
at the Head Office in Dhaka to plan and implement the project. The 21 district offices
were responsible for implementation of project work in the respective districts including
supervision, measurement and payment. The consultants played a role in evaluating
tenders but PMU was responsible for awarding those. Supervision was done jointly for
implementing all components of the project. In general, the performance of PMU was
satisfactory in spite of the delays caused by extensive flooding in 2004 and 2007,
abnormal price hike and scarcity of the construction materials especially during 2008,
and political turmoil. That is why the PMU was compelled to cancel about 73 contracts
which were re-awarded and completed within the stipulated period of time.

(d)      World Bank, the financiers : The World bank monitored the progress of the
project by means of annual evaluations and regular liaison between the project
management unit and the World Bank officials. During the Annual Review Missions, all
aspects of the project were discussed and amendments to project requirements were made.
The local World Bank officials made site visits to inspect the progress of the works. The
Review Missions were very successful in identifying problems and proposing for their
solutions. The timing of the missions was appropriate and time spent in the field was
sufficient.

Overall performance of the World Bank was highly satisfactory. They happened to be
spontaneous in providing decisions/comments and all other matters related to the project
implementation.

6.0   Operation & Maintenance and sustainability:

In course of implementation of the project activities, operational plan of assets procured
and resources created has been prepared and it is being applied. The activities being
undertaken under this plan have facilitated proper use of the assets/resources and ensured
sustainability of those in future. The operational plan has included, inter-alia, the
following issues.



                                           38
     maintenance of roads routine maintenance, periodic maintenance and emergency
      maintenance.
     maintenance of bridges/culverts routine maintenance, periodic maintenance and
      emergency maintenance.
     operation and maintenance plan of growth centres/markets.
     operation and maintenance plan of ghats.
     operation and maintenance of construction and laboratory equipment.
     operation and maintenance of vehicles.

7.0     Manuals, Guidelines and Documents prepared:

A number of manuals, guidelines and documents have been prepared under this project
and these have been used. Further use of the documents will contribute to the institutional
development of LGED, Local Government Institutes (LGIs) and other stakeholders. The
documents cover the technical and other professional areas and the list is given below:

     Rural Road Maintenance Policy
     Environmental Assessment Guidelines for LGED Projects
     Environmental Codes of Practice (ECP)
     Manual for Environmental Supervision and Monitoring & Guidelines for
      Environmental Screening and Categorization of Sub-project
     Guidelines for Assessment of Rural Transport Safety
     Training Manual for UP Representatives

8.0     Lessons learnt, Proposals and Recommendations:

Some lessons learnt through implementation of the project and a few proposals and
recommendations based on the lessons learnt are indicated below:

Contracts : The performance of small to medium contracts were reasonably satisfactory
while the same for large contracts were mixed. Some of the large contracts did not
perform well primarily because the main contractors were absent i.e. they won the
contract and sold it to someone else. The overall performances of 2 out of 4 ICB
contracts were not also satisfactory. LGED had to cancel about 73 contracts due to poor
performance. “One road one contract? approach could be followed.

Roads: The consultants followed LGED’s Design Standards for Roads and Bridges.
These Standards do not keep adequate features for road safety. In addition to that in some
cases the protective work designed by the consultant was not cost-effective. In-depth
hydro-morphological studies were not undertaken in case of roads passing through low
lying/haor areas.

It was learnt that in cases where new pavement is to be constructed either by dismantling
the existing pavement or an altogether new construction as also in the case of
widening of embankment, one of the Sub-Base layer is recommended to be designed as


                                            39
drainage layer, extending upto the embankment slopes. This would enhance the life of the
pavement. All new structures should preferably be designed to the full formation width.
Also the existing structures are recommended to be extended to full formation width. It
was also learned that full width bituminous carpeting along with lined drain should be
provided in such places.

25mm/40mm Premix Carpet has been specified with 7mm Seal Coat. Mix design for
30mm Dense Carpeting has been done by QAA in the LGED Central Laboratory at
Dhaka, which meets the given design criteria. For 30mm Dense Carpeting, there is no
need to have seal coat. Hence, there is saving in material and one operation of seal coat.
Qualitatively 30mm Dense Carpeting would be better and cost effective and is therefore
recommended for adoption after trials and modifications, if necessary.

Contractors : There is a need to provide more training to the contractors and improve
their capacities to become more professional and efficient. “One road one contract?
approach and stricter enforcement of contract conditions will also help remove inefficient
contractors and allow better contractors to expand their activities.

Road Maintenance: This project has provided some equipment and vehicles for road
maintenance. However routine maintenance of roads and bridges needs further attention.
The approach of road maintenance assessment within LGED may be changed to HDM-4
gradually. Usually much time is elapsed in between preparation of the estimate and actual
commencement of work, when further deterioration occurs resulting in revision of the
contract too often. This can be avoided by putting a condition in the tender that the bidder
must put the rates envisaging probable additional damage by the time he would
commence the work. The results of the DANIDA assisted pilots could be scaled-up
gradually

Road shoulders: The maintenance of road shoulders is not up to the mark and "edge
break" of the surfaced pavement is the most common form of initial pavement failure.
The provision of "hard" shoulders has been beneficial but additional measures are
required at locations where traffic travels frequently on the shoulders. This happens on
sharp corners where vehicles tend to cut the corner by travelling on the un-surfaced
shoulder. It is recommended that various shoulder treatments should be included on the
next project to determine the most appropriate treatment on sharp corners.

Quality Control Testing: The arrangement for carrying out quality control testing of
construction is adequate. However, there is a room for improvement as far as the quality
of testing is concerned. It is suggested that the LGED central laboratory may play a
greater role in this regard by carrying out more regular correlation testing. In practice,
this can be achieved by joint collection of samples on site, splitting the samples and
testing separately. Test results can be compared and if there are any differences, the
central laboratory staff may investigate the reasons and correct incorrect testing
procedures.




                                            40
The current manpower employed in the field is too overburdened. The system could
further be improved by making UE responsible to conduct field tests and testing
equipment available to them. Alternatively the Contractor should conduct field tests with
his own equipment in the presence of Engineer’s Representative.

Markets : The improvement and construction of growth centre markets has been a
success. However, the management of the completed markets is not so satisfactory as
shown by the generally inadequate maintenance. Although Market Management
Committees have been legal status, they should receive more training to raise the
awareness regarding their responsibilities & capabilities.

Ghats : The Ghat Management Committees should also be activated by redefining their
roles and responsibilities. They also need training program regarding the safety, operation
and maintenance of ghats.

Training: The project has successfully implemented a lot of training. However, there is a
need to have follow up for monitoring effectiveness of training and the LGED training
unit is to provide adequate follow-up training. Some of the Engineers posted to the
training centers feel reluctant in discharging their duties due to lack of HRD knowledge
and absence of incentives available in the unit. It is suggested that a core set up of
dedicated engineers having HRD knowledge and committed to their jobs should be
established along with a resourceful unit having sufficient incentives made available.
