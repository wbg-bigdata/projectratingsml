MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for SDR 11.9 million (US$17.2 million equivalent) to
help finance a population project. The Credit would be extended on standard IDA terms with a maturity
of 35 years.
2.    Sector Background.1 Egypt, the most populous Arab nation, has an estimated population of 57
million (1993). Population growth was highest in the early 1980s at 2.6 percent but has since declined to
its current rate of 1.9 percent. The demographic transition in Egypt is underway as indicated by a drop in
the fertility rate from 5.0 children per woman in 1980 to 3.8 children in 1993. This has been due to a rise
in age of marriage (increased by two years over the last 25 years), and a fall in the demand for children
(four in 1980 to three in 1992) and resulted in contraceptive use increasing from 21 percent in 1980 to 47
percent in 1992. The private sector and NGOs, including religious organizations, have played an
important role in the population program in Egypt. They provide 63 percent of contraceptives and are an
important source of educational and advisory services as well. Donors, notably the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), have made
significant contributions to this progress.
3.    The overall reduction in fertility levels in Egypt masks significant disparities within the country
(6.0 children per woman in rural upper Egypt compared to 2.7 children in urban governorates). Higher
fertility levels in rural areas particularly in Upper Egypt are associated with lower educational levels and
contraceptive use. This is related in turn to the lower age of first marriage (four years earlier than urban
governorates) and the higher demand for children (one child greater than urban governorates). In
addition to the greater demand for children, rural women, particularly in upper Egypt, are less likely to
achieve desired fertility rates.
4.    Population pressures on the education and health systems, social services, the employment
market and labor migration, urban areas, and the natural resource base will intensify for the foreseeable
future as Egypt's population is projected to reach about 73 million in 2010 and 86 million in 2025. Thus
the Government has made its population program a national priority. In 1993 several targets were set for
the year 2007. These targets include reducing the annual population growth rate to 1.8 percent, the
fertility rate to 2.7, and raising the contraceptive use rate to 65 percent. These targets, although
ambitious, are achievable with sustained effort. In November,. 1993 the Government established a
Ministry of Population and Family Planning (MOPFP) and then merged this Ministry into the Ministry
of Health to create a new Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) in January, 1996 as part of a
streamlining reform. These changes have raised the visibility of population issues within Government
and it can now provide national leadership and coordination to enable the country to meet these targets.
5.    The demographic transition in Egypt has now entered a distinct new phase, and if fertility rates
are to fall further in the future, the Government must address several issues. The Government has stated
its commitment to do so in a Letter of Population Policy to IDA of October 9, 1995. These issues
include: (a) complementing family planning services with more programs to stimulate increased demand
for smaller family size - the provision of services alone meets only the needs of those willing to use
Sector developments were reviewed recently in "Egypt: Recent Changes in Population Growth", Cochrane and Massiah,
February, 1995, HRO Working Paper.



them; (b) addressing the continuing high fertility levels in rural Upper Egypt through the increased
involvement of local religious and civic leaders; (c) strengthening national planning and coordination in
the population sector to improve the management of population growth; (d) upgrading the quality of
existing health services to help improve reproductive and child health; (e) maintaining the role of the
private sector and expanding the role of NGOs; (f) taking into account regional diversity in values
regarding the family and the status of women by an increasingly decentralized approach to the
implementation of population activities; and (g) close monitoring of contraceptive acceptor rates and
prompt modifications to contraceptive subsidy policy to help ensure adequate supplies of affordable
contraceptives. The so called "demand creation" programs described in (a) above stimulate social and
economic developments that help achieve changes in the key determinants of fertility behavior, and also
span a wide range of information, education and communication (IEC) activities, which provide
information specific to family size preference and service availability
6.     Project Objectives.  The overall goals of the project are to help Egypt: (a) better manage
population growth and prevent avoidable future population growth by giving the MOHP the institutional
capacity to play the lead role in the population sector; and (b) improve the conditions and status of
women and children in areas where fertility remains high, mainly in rural areas of Upper Egypt, by
stimulating additional demand for smaller family size and for family planning services. These objectives
will reinforce and expand the goals of the national family planning program.
7.     Project Description. The proposed project would:
(a) help build capacity in the new MOHP for population and family planning operations including
policy and program development, business planning, sectoral manpower development and training,
research programming, resource mobilization, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and
public/NGO/local community program coordination, all based on a "functional matrix" agreed with
the Government. A Three Year Strategic Business Plan will provide the overall framework, a set of
organizing principles and objectives, indicators against which to monitor progress, and resource
requirements for capacity building. The project would finance mainly technical assistance, training
for MOHP staff, policy studies and project management costs; and
(b) support a Population Activities Program (PAP)2 designed to stimulate demand for family planning
and smaller family size where demand is low. This component (87 percent of project funds) would
support grants to NGOs, local community organizations and relevant public sector agencies for
small, decentralized proposals. These would include projects to increase awareness of population
issues, to strengthen motivation for couples to plan their families, to facilitate access to and use of
family planning services, and to educate and motivate people in such related areas as child nutrition,
safe motherhood, reproductive health, male awareness, and delayed age of marriage. It would also
include projects to extend and improve the quality of social change agents, development of capacity
to produce local informational material, rural internships for urban youth and professionals,
counseling and referral programs for youth, and youth-to-youth campaigns/programs. To ensure
that activities are well targeted, proposals would be evaluated using a strategic framework and a
typology of interventions with clear, simple criteria, transparently applied. The activities would be
monitored and evaluated against specified outcome indicators.
2 The Family Development Project is an ongoing example of the kind of project that would be financed under the PAP. It
encourages 30,000 newly married couples in three poor Governorates in Upper Egypt to lower their fertility rates through a
process of "family empowerment". Social Change Agents, who are well educated and trained members of their local
communities, provide peer counseling, motivational and family advisory services to 50-75 target families each. Participating
families must pay monthly dues of US$0.30. The project was launched in late 1994. It is too early to evaluate results.

8.    Project Cost and Financing. Total project costs are estimated at US$20.7 million (US$2.6
million for capacity building and US$18.1 million for population activities). The proposed IDA credit of
US$17.2 million equivalent would finance 83 percent of the project costs (foreign and local). The
Government would finance 7 percent of the project costs, and NGOs and local community organizations
would finance at least 10 percent of the PAP costs. Retroactive financing of up to US$140,000 has been
included for consultants services and office equipment under the capacity building component.
9.    Implementation.  The MOHP will be responsible for implementing the capacity building
component, and for general oversight of the population activities program through an Executive
Committee. The MOHP will contract with the Social Fund for Development (SFD) to administer the
population activities program. The SFD was established in 1991 as a semi-autonomous agency. It is
managing successfully US$650 million of funds, including an IDA credit of SDR105 million (Cr.2276-
EGT). The SFD's Community Development Department has a proven management and financial track
record, selection/targeting criteria and operating and monitoring procedures are in place, and it is
experienced in funding similar programs. A project implementation period of five years is required to
achieve results.
10.   Project Sustainability. The resources, both investment and recurrent, (US$0.3 million per year
during the life of the project and US$0.05 million thereafter) required from the Government are
affordable (less than I percent and one-sixth of 1 percent respectively of current expenditures in the
population sector). The population sector falls within the priority human resource sectors slated for
expanded resources under the current Five Year Plan. The project does not include any expansion of
family planning services, which donors are committed to supporting for the next 3-4 years at about
present levels. The project incorporates participatory tools and administrative costs will be kept lean.
By contributing to the efficiency of the MOHP through improved management and targeting of
activities, the project will help limit the incremental recurrent costs of the MOHP to a level compatible
with public sector budget constraints. Over the short term the population activities program will help
develop a financially sustainable supplement to public sector programs because communities will
develop their own proposals and contribute financially to their cost. Over the longer term it will help to
reduce future pressures on Government services and the natural resource base as a result of the births
averted by the program.
11.   Participation. The Bank has engaged the stakeholders in the capacity building component in an
ongoing dialogue over the past year. Stakeholders include the Minister, MOHP managers and staff, the
National Population Council, and the principal donors - USAID and UNFPA. There is a consensus on
the overall role and strategic direction of the MOHP in the population sector. There has been broad
consultation with the stakeholders in the population activities program (the implementing agencies,
interested public sector agencies, potential NGOs, local community organizations and local Governorate
offices of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Education with programs
requiring support, beneficiary communities and five donors, which support similar interventions). This
component will support an expansion of an approach that has proved successful in a pilot phase. The
basic approach is to work closely with local organizations, which help families feel "empowered" to
decide on family size and related family issues. This is consistent with the Government's policy of
-voluntary choice" with respect to contraceptive use. The Bank's Economic Development Institute will
support a Population Workshop on future population programs in Upper Egypt for a wide range of
stakeholders at the same time as the project launch.
1 2.    Lessons From Previous Bank Projects. This would be the first IDA operation in the sector for
at decade. Two earlier family planning projects failed because of an inadequate management structure in
the Ministry of Health, and low commitment to family planning by working level and local level
managers, staff and physicians in the Ministry of Health. Another lesson was that goals and objectives



- 4 -
for institutional development and strategic aspects of the project need to be developed in cooperation
with the borrower and to be realistic in scope. A final lesson was that future Bank interventions should
include support to private agencies and local welfare groups. More recent experience with social sector
projects in Egypt underlines the need for ownership for public sector management improvement efforts,
and validates well designed and administered "demand driven" projects.
13.   Rationale for IDA Involvement in the Population Sector. Because population growth rates
remain high in most Middle East countries, with consequent impact on economic and social
development, population issues are a central element of the Bank's agenda in the Region in general and
in Egypt in particular. The project is in conformity with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy
described in the Memorandum of the President for the Agricultural Modernization Project (Report No. P-
6203-EGT) dated March 3, 1994. This emphasizes that one of the three Bank Group priorities is human
resource development and poverty reduction, including consideration of a possible population project.
The project provides an opportunity to help the Government adjust its population programs to the
demographic transition now taking place by giving greater consideration to demand stimulation
activities, and to incorporate more thoroughly the impact of population related factors into development
planning. By supporting NGO and community organization activities, the Bank will expand their role
and open a dialogue with stakeholders, who have been ignored until very recently. Finally, if the project
is successful, it could have a demonstration effect for other countries in the Region.
14.   Agreed Actions. Agreements have been reached with the Government on: (a) implementing the
capacity building component in accordance with an agreed Strategic Business Plan and maintaining a
project implementation unit in the MOHP to do that; (b) the terms and conditions under which the SFD
would manage the Population Activities program for the MOHP; and (c) annual and mid-term reviews of
the project.
15.   Environmental Aspects.  The project falls within Category "C" in accordance with the
provisions of O.D. 4.01. It does not have any adverse environmental impact. It should have a major
long-term positive impact in reducing pressure on Egypt's environment by helping to reduce the rate of
population growth.
16.   Program Objective Categories. The project would address the Human Resources Development
and the Public Sector Reform POCs.
17.   Project Benefits. Population growth is a fundamental problem facing Egypt today. Further
reductions in the fertility rate and improvements in planning and managing population growth are basic
to achieving the overall sustainable growth and poverty reduction strategy adopted by the Government
following its successful stabilization program. Egypt must increase its contraceptive use rate by nearly
50 percent (from 50 to 74 percent) over the next 20 years to achieve the Government's long-term goal of
a net replacement rate of one (equivalent to a two-child family) by 2015. The project is expected to
contribute to fertility reduction, and to improve the planning and management of population growth. An
internal rate of return (IRR) for the project has been calculated on the basis of the number of births
averted as a result of the project. It is estimated that the project would help avert about 15 percent of all
births averted in rural Upper Egypt between 1996-2015 and that about $470 would be saved per birth
averted. On this basis the project has an estimated internal rate of return (IRR) of 19 percent. If the
number of births averted by the project declined to 10 percent of the total, the IRR would be 12 percent.
The project will be monitored against four performance indicators for the capacity building component
and fourteen for the population activities program (eleven process and three outcome indicators). A
community level evaluation system will measure the impact of the population activities program. It will
measure change in three fertility preference outcome indicators and three resulting behavioral indicators.
Cost effectiveness will be measured by relating changes in these indicators to the cost of particular



-5 -
interventions. The capacity building component is not susceptible to economic analysis but is necessary
to help achieve the goals of the national population program and cost efficiency is an explicit objective
of this component.
18.   By project completion, the MOHP would have capacities to: (a) conduct high level advocacy; (b)
undertake strategic planning and management for population growth; (c) monitor and evaluate the
overall progress of population programs; (d) mobilize and allocate resources for population programs in
an efficient way; and (e) support NGO and local community initiatives. By project completion a series
of population activities and interventions would have been carried out, which would contribute to
attitudinal and behavioral change in the population of targeted areas towards some of the key
determinants of fertility. Schedule B provides further details.
19    Risks.  The main risk in the capacity building component is the inherent difficulty of
establishing an efficient and effective public sector organization in Egypt. This risk has been addressed
in the following ways.  Following a year of discussion, there is a prior consensus among the
Government, IDA and other donors on the broad roles of the MOHP and of the other ministries and
agencies involved in the population sector. There is upfront agreement on the functions, management
and staffing structure of the new Population and Family Planning Department in the MOHP incorporated
in the Three Year Business Plan, which will provide the overall framework for implementation.
20.   The population activities program faces three short term risks: insufficient demand, lack of
selectivity when choosing projects, and ineffective project implementation (including poor targeting).
There are many organizations in Egypt operating population related programs, and the demand issue will
be more one of supporting the most effective and ensuring that they operate in areas of need. There is a
"pipeline" of projects with a cost of about $5 million, which are being prepared and will be ready by
about June, 1996. The project selectivity and implementation risks have been addressed by devising
clear criteria for project selection and by entrusting implementation to the SFD, which now has a proven
track record in working with private and public sector agencies at the community level. It is effective at
promotion, project evaluation, targeting and supervision. The sustainability of individual sub-projects
would be reviewed during appraisal, and the SFD would provide technical support to strengthen the
capacity of NGOs for fund raising, operations and administration.
21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

PROJECT BENEFITS AND COSTS
Economic Analysis of the Project
IRR 19 percent
Main Assumptions
Benefits based on number of births averted by the project in rural Upper Egypt,
146,065, or 15 percent of total births averted.
75 percent of project expenditures will be in rural Upper Egypt: US$16.4 million.
Public expenditure saving per birth averted: US$470.
Period of analysis: 20 years (1996-2015).
Sensitivity Analysis
A decline in the number of births averted by the project to 10 percent of the total would
reduce the IRR to 12 percent.
A 25 percent decline in the saving per birth averted would reduce the IRR to 14 percent.
Cost-effectiveness indicators
Item 1: Fertility decline in project versus non-project communities.
Item 2: Fertility decline resulting from different interventions within project
communities.
Cost effectiveness will be measured by relating changes in three fertility preference
indicators and three resulting behavioral indicators to the cost of particular
interventions.
Nature of benefits
Public expenditure savings per birth averted resulting from increased contraceptive use,
a lower contraceptive discontinuation rate, and a lower total fertility rate in communities
supported by the project. Exact change outcomes achieved will be measured by the
evaluation system included in the project.
Main Beneficiaries
Low-income couples of reproductive age in areas of Egypt where fertility remains high,
mainly in rural areas of Upper Egypt.
