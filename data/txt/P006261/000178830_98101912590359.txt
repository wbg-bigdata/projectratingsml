SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Power facilities in Brazil are owned and operated by Federal, State
and private companies under the control of the Ministry of Mines and Energy
through its Department of Water and Electric Energy which awards concessions
and approves tariffs, and Centrais Mletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ZLETROBRAS),
which is in charge of the technical coordination, financing and adidntstrmtion
of the electric power sector.
ii.       Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF), the prospective
borrower, is responsible for the generation and bulk transdission of electric
power in the Northeast, one of the five regions of the Brasilian electric power
sector.  The Northeast currently accounts for about 10% of the country's total
energy consumption. The demand for energy in the region is expected to grow at
about 13.7% per year in the period through 1982 as compared with about 10% for
the country as a whole. In that period, CHESF's investmnnt in electric plant
and working capital is expected to reach about VS$1,755 million equivalent.
Seventy-seven per cent of the required financing is expect-4i -1be  rwi4d by
internal generation and equity contributions and loans from ILETROBRAS; the
remaining 23% is expected to comB from sources outside of Brazil. In this
connection, CHESF has requested the Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) to participate in the financing of its next major proJect  the Paulo
Afonso IV hydroelectric project which is estimated to cost about USit93mil3ion
equivalent; it is expected that the participation of these two institutions
will help the company to obtain the maximum possible financing outside of Brazil.
iii.      This report appraises the Plaulo Afonso IV hydroelectric project whicha
consists of the Sobradinho reservoir and the Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric
station, both on the Sao Francisco river; about 390 km of 500 kV and 2,350 km of
230 kV circuit lines; a total of 22 substations with an aggregate transforming
capacity of 5,100 MVA; transportation and other project related equipment; and
training in construction, operation and mainteamce of EHV transxission systems.
iv.       The proposed Bank loan would be for US$81 million equivalent for a
term of 20 years including 4-1/2 years of grace and would bear interest at
7-1/4%. It would be the second loan to CHESF and the twenty-seventh to the
Brazilian power sector. It would be guaranteed by the Brazilian Government.
The proposed loan wcxld finance the transmission line equipment and part of the
230 kV substations and miscellaneous equipment purchased after internation L
competitive bidding, with a 15% margin of preference given to Brazilian manu-
facturers; and the foreign portion of the training cost. The proposed US$84.8



- ii -
million loan_/ from IDB would finance the equipment for the 500 kV aubetations,
part of the equipment for the 230 kV substations and the misoellaneous equip-
ment for the Paulo Afonso hydroelectric station after international coWtitive.
bidding in accordance with IDB's Guidelines for Procurement, with a 15%
margin of preference given to locally manufactured goods.  The
remainder of the equipment consisting of the generating units and step-up trans-
formers for the hydroelectric station would be financed under parallel:
financing arrangements in accordance with Brazilian international bidding
regulations. All civil works and the equipment for Sobradinho would be financed
by internal cash generation and loans from, and equity contributions by, ELETROBRAS.
v.        The project is technically sound. Its estimated cost and the proposed
construction schedule are reasonable. The facilities to be provided are needed
by CHESF to meet the expected demand in the Northeast region of Brasil. In the
area to be flooded by the Sobradinho reservoir about 70,000 pe4ple 3pl   have
to be relocated. The effects of river regulation on the area below the reservoir
are being studied. The Brazilian Government and CHESF have agreed to take all
the necessary measures to resolve adequately antd equitably the resettleimnt,
relocation, compensation and ecological aspects of the project.
vi.       The load forecast for the Northeast region is reasonable; the Paulo
Afonso IV hydroelectric project is the least-cost solution; and the raturn on
the project investment is 23.3%.
vii.      CHESF is an acceptable borrower. It is reasonably well nanaged,
enjoys the benefits of favorable tariff legislation and has access to the funds
of ELETROBRAS which administers a substantial proportion of the resources of
the power sector. The present and prospective fiancial perforamwe of ONS?
is good.
viii..    The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan.

PAULO AFONSO IV HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
COMPANHIA HIDRO ELETRICA DO SAO FRANCISCO
BRAZIL
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF), a corporation
owned by the Federal Government through Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A.
(ELETROBRA.S), has asked the Bank and the Inter-American Developxent Bank
(IDB) to help finance the Paulo Afonso IV hdyroelectric project. The project
consists of the Sobradinho regulating dam, a 1,500 MW hydroelectric power
plant below the Paulo Afonso falls on the Sao Francisco river, a total of
2,740 km of associated transmission lines, and 22 substations with an aggregate 1/
capacity of 5,100 MVA having a total estimated cost of US$693 million equivalent,.
1.02      The demand for energy in the Northeast is expected to grow at a rate
of 13.7% per year in the period 1973-82. As a result, CHESF will need consider-
able financial assistance from the Government through ELETROBRAS and from foreign
sources. The proposed Bank and IDB loans would cover about two-thirds of the
equipment, engineering services and training components of the Paulo Afonso IV
hydroelectric station and related transmission facilities. CHESF, with the
financial assistance of ELETROBRAS, would finance the local cost of the power
station and associated transmission facilities and the entire cost of Sobradinho. A
Bank loan of B$$8l million equivalent is proposed to finance the bulk of the
equipment contracts for the transmission system, including substations. The   2
remaining part of the external financing would be provided by a US$8h.8 million-/
equivalent loan from the IDB and US$72 million equivalent under parallel financing
arranged by CHESF.
1.03      The Bank loan would represent about 12% of the cost of the project and
about 5% of CAESF's total investment program of UJS$1,755 million equivalent for
l974-1982 -- the project construction period. It is expected that the Bank's and
IDB's participation in the financing of the project would allow CHESF to obtain
the maxim possible additional external financing, and would support the Govern-
ment's £fforts to develop thie Northeast, one of the less developed regions of
Brazil 'here about thirty willion people live.
1.04      The Bank has made one previous loan of US$15 million equivalent to CHESF
in 19'50, and twenty-six p.evious loans to the Brazilian power sector for a total
of US3$872.1 million equivalent. The first loatn to CHESF helped to finance the
initial Psulo Afonso two 60 MW generating unit power plant and associated trans-
mission system. As of fay 10, 1974, US$0.6 million equivalent of principal was
still outstanding, the last amortization payment being scheduled for March 15, 1975.
1.05      This report is based on feasibility reports prepared by CHESF and its
consultants and on the findings of a joint IBRD-IDB mission composed, on the part
of the Bhnk, of Neassrs. Renato E. Salazar and Guy Prenoveau who visited Brazil
in August/Septeiber 1973 and a supplemental visit by Mr. Guy Prenoveau in October/
November 1973.

Organization of the Powar Sector
2.01      The Ninistry of Mines and Energy controls the power sector through
itsr Department of Water and Electric Energy (NAZE) which performs regulatory
functions, including granting licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigning
concession areas, setting tariffs and approving expansion plans.
2.02      ELETROBRAS is tne Government agency under the MiniEtry of Mines and
Energy in charge of technical coordination, financing and administratimn of
the electric power sector.  Through its four regional companiss, Centrais
Eletricas do Sul do Brasil S.A. (ELETROSUL), Furnas-Centrais Eletricas S.A.
(FURNAS), Companhia Hictro Eletrica do Sao Franciaco                     an I)  d  B
ELETROBRAS is also responsible for the promotion of powr gne4ratjn sachemes
interesting more than one state, transmission systea s inl HV and ENV aimd at
the integration of state systems, and transmission systems related to bi-
national power projects (Annex 1).
2.03      For planning purposes, the power sector is divided into five regions,
namely: South, Southeast, Central-West, Northeast and North. iLT1IA   has
prepared generation and major transmission development plans for the South and
Southeast regions to meet their power requiirements up to 1981. 3uch plans have
been submitted to the Bank and are at present under review.  An extensin of
these plans, up to 1990, is under study by  LTROBRAS and will be submitted to
the Barnk by November 197)4. These plans have been conmeived oa a regicnally
integrated basis aiming at the best utilization of generating and major trans-
mission facilities of the concessionaires.
2.014      LETROBRAS, with the assistance of CHE:S, has carried out a market
survey, and with consultants, a comprehensive study of the power resources of
the Northeast. As a result of the 'latter, several low-cost hydroelectric sites -
all in the Sao Francisco River - have been identified and priorities for the
construction of generating stations have been assigned. Based on this, CH1S?
which is responsible for the generation and bulk transmission of electric power
in the Northeast, has formulated a power generating expansion program to cover the
power requirements of the region until 1982. This program includes the
installation of the Paulo Afonso III and Moxoto plants, new under construction,
and the Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric power project, the subject of this
appraisal. Other projects (Xingo, Boa Esperanga, etc.) have already been
identified to meet anticipated increasea demand beyond 1982. The role of CHSF
in the Northeast is treated in greater detail in Chapter 3 of this report.
2.05      As the only concessionaire of power generation and bulk transmission of
electric power in the Northeast, CFYSF supplies the distributim compai.es in
the region (Annex 2). These companies have been able to supply olectric power to'
ultimate consumers at levels consistent with the increasing dsuAnd and are expected
to continue to c- so in the future. Existing power sector legislation has been
adequate to provide the distribution companies with the financial resources
required for the continuing expansion of' their systems. lHowevers present coverage



-3-
of electric power supply to the region's lower income population appears
inadequate and should be improved, and adequate technical and financial
resources should be provided for this purpose. The Brazilian Government
and the Bank are holding discussions on possible Bank participation in the
financing of power distribution projects in the Northeast, with particular
emphasis on the lower income groups.
Electric Power Tariffs
2.06      The Brazilian power tariff policy is to provide electric utilities
with sufficient funds to cover th Ir operating expenses (excluding tinancial
charges), depreciation, reversion_.  and a reasonable return on inveistment.
Under current legislation, a rate of return of not less than 10% and not more
than 12% is mandatory (Annex 3). During negotiations CHESF agreed to maintain
its earnings at levels consistent with sound financial and public utility
practices and in accordance with Brazilian legislation, and to apply for
appropriate tariff adjustments no later than five months after the end of each
calendar year; and the Government agreed to continue to act promptly on thease
tariff applications. During negotiations the Government also agreed, as it
did for previous loans to Brazilian electric power companies, that any change
in its legislation, which in the Bank's opinion would adversely affect the
borrower's financial positicn, would be consicdred an event of default.
2.07      CHESF has a two-part (dermand and energy) tariff for sales to dis-
tribution companies and a similar tariff for sales to special consumers at high
voltage (Annex 4). The tariff structtures are in lirA with those generally used
by power utilities for bulk supplies.

3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The borrower would be CHESF, an autonomous Government company
established in 1948 and a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS. CHESF is responsible
for the generation and transmission of electric power which it sells to the
distribution companies operating in nine states of Northeast Brazil. Its
main sources of energy are its hydroelectric plants at Paulo Afonso on the
Sao Francisco river.
Organization
3.02      The Company is administered by a Board of Directors, an Executive
Committee and a Consultative Council. The Board of Directors consists of a
President, one Executive Vice President, sad eleven Directors elected by the
General Assembly for a term of four years, four of which are noxinated by
ELETROBRAS. The Executive Committee consists of the President, the Executive
Vice President and seven Directors. The Consultative Council consists of
the President and three members elected for one year by the Gmnrel Assembly.
In addition, the General Assembly appoints a three-member Audit Committee,
each with an alternate. The Board of Directors sets broad operating policies
and the Executive Committee, whose members hold the key executive positions,
effectively run the Company. The Consultative Council's prime function is to
advise the members of the Executive Comittee and to participate in the General
Assembly.
3.03      CHESF's share capital as of December 31, 1973, consisted of Cr$1,135
million of common stock and Cr$165 million of preferred stock. The preferred
stock has no voting right but is entitled to a minimum dividend of 10% before
any dividend may be paid on the common stock. The common stock is presently
neld 10% by ELETROBRAS; and the preferred stock, 72.3% by UETCNBRAS,
25.5% by the Superintendencia do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste (SUXEE) and the
remaining 2.2% by various State and Municipal Governments and others.
Personnel and Training
3.04      The Company's headquarters are located in Rio de Janeiro, and operating
offices are maintained principally in Paulo Afonso, Salvador and Recife. In
view of the fact that CHESF does an important part of its construetion work  2
with its own forces and that its concession covers an area of 1.45 million Ic
and a population of 30 million, its total staff of about 14,130 employees appears
reasonable.  It is distributed among major departments as follows:  General
Management 61; Planning 131; Technical 5,896; Operations 2,166; Administmtive 243;
Commercial 285; Finance 156; Sobradinho 399; and Regional Administrations 4,793.
CHESF's organization chart is annexed to this report.
3.05      CHESF's 1973 traibnig budget amounted to US$0.7 million equivalent.  It
covered attendance by 3,380 participants (several employees participated in sore
than one course) in 175 different courses, conferences, seminars and visits to
suppliers' premises and to major utilities in Brazil and abroad. CHES? baa a
well-conceived training program; it covers technical, legal, accounting, finance,
safety and general administrative areas, as well as supervision at all levels.
In connection with the 500 kV transmission expansion under way, the Bank would
finance the foreign exchange cost of traJning CHESF's personel outside of Brazil
(paragraph 4.07).



-5-
Operating Performance
3.06      CHESF has operated its generating system satisfactorily; records of
all the years since it started operation show that the quality of service has
been very good. Performance in the transmission system, however, has not been
as good. Unusually high transmission losses, about 13% in 1972, have been
experienced on the 230 kV lines due to delays in expanding the sytema and the
resulting overloading which stemmed from ELETROBRAS' decision to adopt 500 kV
for new EHV lines instead of the originally planned 400 kV. Energy losses
are expected to go down to about 4% once the 500 kV double circuits between
Paulo Afonso-Salvador and Paulo Afonso-Recife have been installed. The operating
records also show a high frequency of faults attributed mostly to fires in the
sugarcane fields because of low clearance of the 230 kV lines. The improved
design of the new transmission lines should correct this situation.
Market
3.07      CHESF is virtually the sole electricity generating company in the
Northeast region, with less than 3% of industries providing their own power.
The demand in its concession area is very unevenly distributed; the area near
the coast, the Eastern Sector, which represents about half of the Northeast,
uses about 97% of the total energy consumed in the region, while the Western
Sector uses about 3%.  CHESF estimates that in the period 1970-80, energy
consumption in the Western Sector will increase at a faster rate than in the
Eastern Sector, and that the population using electricity in the Northeast will
go from 18.7% to 28.7%.
3.08      Annex 2, already mentioned, presents the result of ELETROBRAS' 1972
market survey. It indicates the rate of actual/forecast growth of energy con-
sumption for the period 1968-1985, and the power requirenents of the distribution
companies as well as those of the large industries supplied directly by CHESF.
3.09      Annex 5 shows the breakdown of actual/forecast energy consumption by
load categories in the three mDst populous states of the Northeast: Bahia,
Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte. The substantial forecast increase in the
industrial category for the State of Bahia by 1980 reflects the large industrial
expansion under way at Aratu and other areas around Salvador.

4. THE PROJECT
Description
4.0l      The principal features of the project, essentially CHESFIs Fifth
Expansion Program, are:
(a)  The Sobradinho reservoir, comprising:
(i)  the main dam, 3.4 km long composed of a central concrete
spillway 64 m long with maximum height of 40 m involving
830,000 m3 of concrete work, earth-fill embankment sections
on both banks and lateral earth dikes on both sides of the
river slightly upstream from the main dam, involving
13.5 million m3 of fill; and
(ii) a navigation canal and locks on the right bank;
(b)  The Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric power station, comprisings
(i) a bypass canal about 5 km long and forebay;
(ii) an underground power station with space for six generating
units, to be equipped originally with four units rated at
375 MW each;
(c)  About 390 circuit-km of 500 kV and 2,350 circuit-km of 230 kYVlines;
(d) A total of 22 substations with an aggregate transforming capacity
of about 5,100 MVA;
(e) Transportation and other project related equipment; and
(f)  Training in construction, operation and maintenance of EWV trans-
mission systems.
4.02      Construction of the Sobradinho dam is already under way (paragraph
4.08).  It is located on the Sao Francisco river about 470 km upstream from
the existing Paulo Afonso hydroelectric stations. It will create a reservoir
with a usable storage capacity of about 29.4 billion m3 (29.4 x 109m3) which
will increase the minimum river flow from 1,150 m3/sec to 2,060 m3/seAi/ and
raise the firm annual energy generation by about 8,300 GWh at generating plants
currently in operation and under way, and by about 19,000 GWh  at -l fZuture
generating plants to be installed downstream of Sobradinho.   The reservoir
will have a gross capacity of about 36.2 billion m3 and will inundate an area
of about 4,150 km2. The spillway will have a capacity of about 23,400 m3/sec.
A navigation canal and lock structures will be built on the right bank.
1/ Net of evaporation and irrigation requirements.



-8-
4.03      The Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric plant will be located about 2 km
downstream from the existing Paulo Afonso plants and about 400 ka north *t
Salvador. This new plant together with the existing Paulo Afonso plants and
Moxoto will utilize the total regulated flow to be provided by the Sobredinho
dam. To this effect, a bypass canal and forebay will direct a portion of the
river flow from the existing Paulo Afonso plants and the Naosto plant under
construction to the Paulo Afonso IV plant. A 500 kV step-up substation will be
located on the left bank of the river, that is opposite the pwerhmWis.
4.04      The transmission system required for the power to be generated at
Paulo Afonso IV is covered partly by the Fourth Expansion Progra now under way
and partly by the proposed Project. The Fourth Expansion ProgrFa provides for
the construction of two 500 kV transmission circuits between Paulo Afo.m end
Salvador and one 500 kV circuit between Paulo Afonso and Reeift.  Thsoe l
initially to be operated at 230 kV, plus nine 230 kV circuits to the Forteaeaa,
Recife and Salvador areas provide the transmission cpacity to delivor the pXau'
generated at existing Paulo Afonso plants and Mozoto to the smain load ceters
of the Northeast (see Nap IBED 10807).
4.05      In order to transmit the increased power to be generated at Paulo
Afonso IV to the above-mentioned centers, it will be nooessary, as part of the
project to:
(a) operate the 500 kV lines (which will be initially operated at 230 IV) At
the design voltage; for this purpose a :!,230 WVA 2t3W5 kV auto-
transformer bank is contemplated at Paulo AfonJo IV swbstution;
(b) construct a second 500 kV circuit to Recife with an intermbditte
substation at Angwlia;
(c) add the following 230 kV lines:
(i) Paulo Afonso-Bom None
(ii) BOa Noae-Milagres-Bodabuiu-Fortalesa (double cir*at)
(iii) Campina Grande-Santa Cruz-Natal
(iv) Recife II-Mirueira
(v) Recife II-Goianinha
(vi) Camacari-5ent  Industaial de Aratu (double circuit)
(vii) Camacari-Governador Mangabeira-Funil
(viii)  Camacari-Jaguaripe
(ix) Itabaiana-Araoaju
(x) Paulo Afonso-Barro Vermelho (double circuit).
(xi) Barro Vermelho-Juazeiro
(xii) Barro Vernelho-Jaguarari



(d) expand the terminal substations of the above-mentioned lines and
the 138 kV substations of Barro Vermelho and Senhor do Bomfim.
4.06      The power carrying capacity of the transmission system covered by the
Fourth acid Fifth Expansion Programs is greater than the requirmmts of the ex-
panded generating system because, for reliability reasons, the 500 kV lines to
Salvador and Recife should be of double circuits. This extra capacity will reduce
the transmission require mts of the next transmission expawion when the Xingo
hydroelectric project is implemented.
4.07      Related transportation equipment, such as motor boats, helicopters and
vehicles which are to be used by CUESF for construction and maintenance purposes,
is included in the project. Finally, with the incorporation of about 1L,500 km
of 500 kV circuit and a substantial quantity of other 500 kV equipment, COES?
must rapidly train its staff in E8V construction, operation and caintenance.
CHESF has formulated a program which inoludes the training of some of its profes-
sionals abroad.
Ewineering and Construction
4.08      The Sobradinho dam and reservoir were first studied by Superintendencia
do Vale do Sao Francisco (SUVALE). The final engineering design, however, was
assigned to a consulting engineering firm, Eidroservice, of Sao PaIulo, which was
assisted in the areas of hydrolog, gQqlogy, foundation and embankment dams by
various organizations and consultantY . The mission is satisfied that these
aspects have been thoroughly investigated. The bedrook where the dam is to be
located is of excellent quality and occurs near the surface (from 0 to 8 a of
overburden). The consultants have concluded there is little possibility of the
reservoir leaking to other basins. There are ample usable materials nearby for
the earth dams, concrete aggregate and rock riprap. With adequate construction
methods and management, therefore, the Sobradinho dam should be constructed on
schedule and within the current coat estimates. SEtVIE was awarded the contract
for the civil works on a unit price basis. Construction of the coffer dams for
river diversion started in June 1973 and work on the fouvdationS of the sain dam
started at the end of 1973. The concrete dam and spillway are schoduled for com-
pletion in November 1975 and the earth dams in November 1976; the filling of the
reservoir is expected to start in January 1977.
4.09      The Paulo Afonso IV power station and the bypass canal and forebay were
designed by SOFRELEC of France with the participation of CHXSW. As in the case
of the existing Paulo Afonso plants, and after economic justification, the consu7:'-
ants recommnded an underground powerhouse. The design ofithe proposed Paulo-
Afonso IV facilities is sound. CHESF has wide experience in the construction of
underground powerhouses and has decided to construct the power statis3  oni it...
Preliminary work started in mid-1973 and excavations for the bypass cau&L a   4.
underground powerhouse in early 1974. The erection of the generating units '
scheduled to start at the beginning of 1976 and units are expected to 'e owL-
sioned between 1978 and 1982.

4.10      The transmission lines and substations have been designed by Por
Technology Inc. (PTI) of the USA with the participation of CEES. PTI was
mainly responsible for the electrical aspects, such as conductor size sad
configuration, insulation, radio interference, etc.j and CHEWE for the otber
aspects, such as general routing, right-of-ways, topography,, tc. In adation,
PTI will verify the results of earlier studies made by EL1tWBRA  on stability
and active and reactive power flow. The transmission lines vill be built by
contractors and the substations by CEESF under foroe account. The construction
of the 500 kV facilities will be supervised by consultants. Construction of
the 500 kV line from Paulo Afonso to the Recife II substation is expected to
start in mid-1975 and to be completed at the end of 1977. The construction of
the 230 kV lines and substations is expected to start at the beginning of 1975
and to be completed at the end of 1977.
Cost Estimates
4.11      The cost estimates were prepared by CHEFS in collaboration with its
consultants. The cost of the Sobradinho dam is based on the actual ocontract
price of the civil works which includes an escalation forula linked to official
Brazilian indexes plus 10% for physical contingencies; the cost of the land and
relocation from the flooded area reflects CHESF's estimate plus 15% for pbysica1
contingencies.
4.12      The cost estimate of the Paulo Afonso IV power station, transdision
facilities and miscellaneous components which reflect Deoember 1973 prices
include physical contingencies of 15% for civil works and 10% for equipment.
In addition, they contain price contingencies at the rate of 7% per year for
civil works and an average of 8.7% for equipment.
4b13      As Sobradinho will eventually benefit all hydroelectric sche aes
downstream, its cost should be assigned proportionately among thoes sabams.
On the basis of the expected additional energy to be generated at tke diw-
stream plants, Paulo Afonso IV should be charged with about 40% of Sobradisho@'
total cost (paragraph 7 of Annex 8). Thus the total cost of Paulo Afnmso IV,
including its share of Sobradinho, amounta to US$562.6 million equivalet, or
about US$375 per kW of installed capacity. Considering that the plant
factor of Paulo Afonso IV will be about 0.634 its unit cost appear t be
very reasonable. The project cost estimate (excluding interest dvrig co-
struction) is shown below:

Arnount of Proposed Bank, :3 a-i-.. ?arallel Financing
4.14      The sxternal financing to bt) provided by the Bank, the IDB and the
major supplying countries under parallel finrancing amounts to I$23 7         i_
equlivalent (Annex 9) and is3 well below the astimated totallolv-dg octoosts
of US$294.2 million equivalent (table, page 11).  The balance uill'be finazeed
locally.                                                           - -        ----- . . .
4.15      For the purposes of the parallel financing CHESF has selected turbines,
generators and step-up transformers and the 500 kV circuit breakers for the trans-
mission system, which it foals would be most attractive for this type of financing,
and which are either not made, or not made competitively, in Brazil. This equip-
,Pent has an estimated total cost of US$82.3 million.  GHSF ha9 a89d Lt ueud
have to provide US$10.4 million in down payints and that it would obtain reasonable
financing from supplier countries for the remainder, i.e. US$71.9 million (para 6.08).
4-16      The proposed Bank and 1DB loans would be available to CHIES to finance
-the acquisition of those items which under parallel financing would not receive
a wide response. Thus the Bank loan would finance the transmission line equip-
ment, some of the equipment for 230 kV substations and the miscellaneous equip-
ment and training. The IDB would finance the miscellaneous equipment for Paulo
,Lfonso IV station, the equipment for the 500 kV substations and part of the
equipment for the 230 kV substations.  Each Bani would finance the foreign
component of the engineering for the portion of the transmission system it plans
to finance (Annex 9). Neither Bank would finance civil works.
4.17      During negotiations, the borrower confirmed the above arrangements.
Procurement and Disbursements
4.18      Procurement of the equipment to be financed by the Bank would follow
the Bank's Guidelines; the manufacturers whose bids contain components manu-
factured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the bid being given a
15% margin of preference. 1Procurement of the equipment and services to be
financed by IDB would be subject to its procurement guidelines which call for
competitive bidding among eligible countries; a 15% margin of preference would
be given to Brazilian manufacturers where applicable, usually before dometic
taxes, in accordance with an existing agreement between the Govezment of Brazil
and IDB for this purpose   Procurement of the equipment to be purchased under
parallel financing arrangements would be subject to international oompetitive
bidding among suppliers from the countries offering financing, iluding Brazil.,
i.n accordance with Brazilian inter'national bidding regulations.-  In order to
assure the success of this operation, CHESF has visited ten of the major equip-
ment supplying countries to get a reasonable amount of commitments from their
export financing agencies (paragraph.6.08). The Bank would not supervise the
procurement of the equipment purchased under the IDB loan or parallel financing.
4.19      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made against appropriate
documentation for the CIF cost of imported goods or the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods and for the foreign exchange cost of training
(Annex 9, Column 1). No disbursements would be made in respect of expenditures

made prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement. Any loan funds remaining
undisbursed upon completion of the project would be cancelled unless disbursement
on other works associated with the project is found justified. The schedule of
estimated Bank disbursements is given in Annex 10.
Environmental Aspects
4.20      The creation of the Sobradinho reservoir will have two major impacts
on the environment: upstream of the dam, it will flood an area of about
4,150 km2; and downstream, it will alter the natural flow'of the river.
4.21      In the Sobradinho reservoir area the land to be flooded is of small
agricultural value, but it harbors about 70,000 people, about 25,000 of whom
live in the small villages of four municipal districts (Remanso, Sento Se,
Pilao Arcado and Casanova) and the remainder outside of these "urban" centers.
According to a survey made by CHESF and Hidroservice, about 10% of the higher
income group of the population will accept indemnities and move awuy, another
10% will stay in the area to work on the construction of the dam, 50% will join
colonization schemes to be organized by Instituto Nacional de Colonizaca .e
Reforma Agraria (INCRA) (see paragraph 4.22 below) and 30% will initially
elect to remain on the shores of the reservoir where farming conditions will
in general be worse than those of the present river shore, but will later no
doubt wish to resettle elsewhere.
4,.22     An agreement which was signed last October by INCRAs CH&S' and
ELETROBRAS, and has since been ratified by a decree of the Ministries of
Agriculture and of Mines and Energy stipulates: that INCRA will have the
responsibility for resettling the rural population, and CHEW', the responsibility
for resettling the "urban" population. CHESF will finance the cost of the
resettlement with funds provided by ELETROBRAS out of the reversion fund and
by the Programa Especial Para 0 Vale do Sao Francisco (PROVALE). CHSF' for its
part has already purchased land and prepared plans for the creation of four
new villages where the seat of the municipal districts will be moved with the
"urban" populations. INCRA plans on using the following approaQh.* -It-twill offer
a colonization scheme designed in accordance with its normal guidelines. It is
expected, however, that not all the population will meet the eligibility require-
ments for such program or that not all eligible individuals would want to migrate.
For this portion of the population, presumably the poorest and least educated,
INCRA will offer resettlement on the shores of the reservoi.r according_ to_ otn4ardB
to be decided on an ad hoc basis. The, poor quality of the land around the reservoir
and the fact that the operation of the reservoir will cause its shores to recede
periodically up to several kilormters will make resettlement difficult in its im.-
mediate vicinity.  The relocation task is therefore complex; it will require detal.3G
planning if the reservoir area is going to be evacuated on tize and the affected
population is to receive proper attention. Accordingly, during negotiations tIhe
Brazilian Government and CHESF agreeel to complete appropriate resettlenent nlane with
nine months after the signing of the loan for review and comment by the Barlk ana(c
to put such plans into effect in a =mnner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.23     CHESF has hired a consultant, Mr. R. Goodland, to study the ecological
impact of the creation of the Sobradinho reservoir on the region. He has already
made a reconnaissance trip to the field. His preliminary report recommencs that
certain measures be taken, including: those to prevent possible spread of oer.ain
diseases Rnd promote fish culture.



- 14 -
During negotiations, therefore, CHESF and the Brazilian Government agreed to
prepare and forward to the Bank for comment, within nine monzths of the sign-
ing of the loan, plans for:
(a)  minimizing future distribution and exacerbation of plague,
schistosomiasis and malaria in the area of the reservoir;
(b) minimizing undesirable effects of the decaying vegetation
on the biochemical,properties of the reservoir; and
(c) promoting fish conservation and production in the reservoir.
Moreover, the Brazilian Governannt agreed to assign such plans to the appropli-
ate Governmmnt authorities for action.
4 .24     The portion of the river downstream of Sobradinho my be divided in3bo
two segments:
(a)  the Middle Sao Francisco, which flows oyra at o3
about 560 km from Sobradinho to Pao de Aqucar; aid
(b)  tihe Lower Sao Francisco, vhich flows over a diatoee of
about 220 km from Pao de Agucar to thoe jouthi.
4 25      The expected inerease in the minimum river flow from about 1,150
mI/sec to 2,060 m3/sec may adversely affect agricultural production in thb
Middle Sao Francisco during the low water season by permssnatly inundating so_
arable land. However, the probable adverse effects of flow regulation on
agriculture and population in this segment of the river have met 7et beeu
aseev%alned. Although it may be anticipated that the adverse effects will ndt
be s*stnial because the arable areas are relatively small and the population
sparse, the Brazilian Governsmnt and CHESF agreed to undertake sn  sub"t ftot
reviAW and comment by the Bank, within twelve months from the date ot sipiag
of th  loan documents, n evaluation of said effects, and vithin six months
thereafter, a plan to provide reasonable compensation for the p        ion livig
in sach area including resettleint plans if necessary, and to pWt &uh plan
into effect in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.26      The Lower Sao Francisco comprises both a sp2ars4se  poqppled hilly
terrain and a relatively densely populated floodplaina area of abat 15,700 ha1
The floodplains located near the mouth of the river have been cvltivted by
sharecroppers and laborers under a regime of relatively few large laai&oldig,
and in a system based on the rise and fall of the river; as floods racede, ri6e
seedlings are planted to grow on residual moisture and rainfall.  Even btfore it
was known that the Sobradinho works would be undertaken, SUVALE, with the tech-
nical assistance of'the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), had adopted a scheme for the floodplains area ained towards establishing
economically viable farming units, and had undertaIken some specific projects,
including the introduction of new strains of rice and the building of dikua to
turn some of the area from traditional to polder cultivation. The schema also
called for significant changes in land tenure patterns.



- 15-
4.27      More recently, SUVALE and its French consultants - Consorcio Scet
Internationale Sirac - assisted by staff from the FAO/Bank Cooperative Program,
have been assessing the impact of the Sobradinho works on the Lower Sao Francisco
area as a part of a broader study aimed at establishing an intensive development
program for the floodplans. Preliminary estimates by SUVALE's consultants indi-
cate that instead of the 17,500 ha which at present are subject to seasonal
flooding for eight out of every ten years, about 3,100 ha would be permanently
flooded, 6,700 ha would continue to be subject to seasonal flooding and 5,900 ha
would cease to be flooded. Thus, some 9,000 ha of rice land would be lost.
Of these, about 1,800 ha will be protected by the polder project already under-
taken by SUVALE. Regarding the remaining 7,200 ha, SUVALE's consultants have
proposed the adoption of an emergency plan consisting of the constraction and
operation of a network of dikes and pumping stations. These works would enable
the maintenance of present flooding conditions, while providing a degree of
flood control. This emergency plan would be the first stage of the broader
intensive development program for the floodplains.
4 .28     The Bank was informed that FAO endorsed such emergency plan and that
the Brazilian Government was willing to implement it. Moreover, the Bank con-
sidered the emergency plan as an adequate means of compensating the adverse
effects of river regulation on agriculture in the Lower Sao Francisco area.
Accordingly, during negotiations the Brazilian Govern nt agreed to complete
and submit for review and commnt by the Bank, within nine months from the date
of signing of the proposed loan, the engineering study and cost estimates for
the Lower Sao Francisco emergency plan, and to implement it by year-end 1978.
Furthermore, to insure that the benefits of this plan are shared equitably by
landholders, sharecroppers and laborers, the Brazilian Government also agreed to
complete and submit for review and coment by the Bank, within fifteen months
from the date of signing of the proposed Bank loan, a comprehensive development
program for the Lower Sao Francisco.
14.29     The timing for the various undertakings by the Brazilian Government
and CHESF to compensate for the adverse effects of the Sobradinho works on the
population and the environment was determined in light of the expected physical
progress of the project.

'i: .ICAT@IN OF T:,E ?ROJEC-
Load Forecast
5.01      The results of the Power and Energy Balance Study of the Northeast
made by ELETROBRAS for the period 1973-82 are shown in Annexes 5 and 6. The
actual average annual rate of growth of the electric energy consumption for the
period 1969-72 was about 15.5i and the projected average annual growth for
the period 1973-82 is about 13.7%, starting at 21% in 1973, which is in line
with present experience, and decreasing gradually to about 10% by 1982.  This
seems reasonable  in view of past experience !nd anticipated ecornomic growth
of the region.  Since 1973 the power supply o:f the Northeast 3.gion has been
integrated and the proposed expansion of CHEE1"s generating and transmission
facilities appears adequate to meet the expected demand. As mentioned in
paragraph 3.07 of this report, the percentage of the population benefiting
from electricity in the Northeast is expected to increase from about 19%
to 29% in the 1970s.
Least Cost Solution
5.02      In order to supply the future electric power and energy requirements
of the region, several hydro alternatives on the Sao Frwctsco river, the only
river of interest in the Northeast at present, were considered. As explained in
Annex 8, ELETROBRAS and CHESF with the assistance of consultants.found that the
most attractive hydroelectric alternative consists of building the Sobradinho
reservoir to fully regulate the Sao Francisco river and to install at Paulo
Afonso a fourth powerhouse (Paulo Afonso IV) with a capacity of 1,500 MIW,
utilizing the head between the forebay of the Moxoto plant and the tailrace
of the existing Paulo Afonso plants.
5.03      The Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric project was compared withs
(a)  conventional thermal alternatives consisting of oil-fired
steam generating units to supply the system base lod
requirments combined with gas turbines and the eaditing
hydroelectric stations; and
(b) a nuclear alternative where the above-mentioned oil-fired
units were replaced by pressurized light-water nuclear
reactors.
Annex 8 gives details of the comparison of these alternatives.
5.04      Two aspects of the study are analyzed in detail in Annex 8, namely:
the share of the cost of the Sobradinho reservoir which should be allocated to
the Paulo Afonso IV project, and the likely fuel cost for the oil-fired alter-
natives. The former was determined on the basis of the disootmnted values of
the expected benefits of the Sao Francisco river regulation to the present and
future hydroelectric developments. The latter, in turn, was examined under two
assumptions. The first, which may be considered the most probable, assumes
t hat the price of crude oil will gradually decrease fromU*$&/barrel iin 1977 to



- 17 -
US$6/barrel by 1980 and stabilize at that price thereafter (in constant US dollars
of 19T7], due to the expected value of oil substitutes derived from coal or
shale._ The second assumes a fuel cost based on constant crude price of US$5/barrel,a
price which is considered extremely low at the present, and viewed as a lower
limit; it has been made for the purpose of determining the sensitivity of thie
electric power cost differential between Paulo Afonso IV and the oil-fired
alternative.
5.05      The graph of Annex 5 shows the present worth of the cost differential
between the proposed hydroelectric project and the thermal (oil or nuclear)
alternatives.  Under Case A, considered as the most probable, the equalix.7ing
discount rate for Paulo Afonso IV and the oil-fired alternative is 18%. For
Case D, which combines the most unfavorable conditions for Paulo Afcnsc IV,
the equalizing discount rate is 14i.  Based on these results, it can be con-
cluded that the proposed project provides the required power service for the
region at the minimum cost.
Return on project Investment
5.06      For the determination of the project return, it was assumed that
benefits obtained from Paulo Afonso IV are equal to the economic value of
the electricity supplied to the ultimate consumer, which in turn has been
assumed to be at least equal to the price paid for such consumption (tariff
plus sole tax). As shown in Annex 11, the return on the Paulo Afonso project
investment is 23.3%.
lJ  The prices of substitutes are based on data included in  Energy Research
and Developments Problems and Prospects,  US Government Printing Office,
No. 93/21, 1973.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Summary
6.01      CFESFW'  satisfactory present and future financial performance is
based on the existence and maintenance of a sector-wide reasonable tariff
policy (paragraph 2.06), and on its ability to obtain from ELETROBRAS debt
and equity financing in the proportions required to maintain a balanced
capital structure (paragraphs 6.10 and 6.11). The preservation of these two
aspects of CHESF's financial conditions are the object of specific loan
covenants (paragraphs 2.06, 6.12 and 6.15). Annexes 12 to 18 contain CHESFts
financial projections through 1982.
Past and Present Financial Performance
6.02      In the period 1972-73, CHE$F earned 11.3% on its investment and,
after debt service and net dividend payments,1! contributed about 5.8% of
its investment program from internal cash generation.   This low contribution
to investment was due to unusually heavy amortizations on ELETROBRAS' loans
for the Moxoto project which originally contained no grace period. ELETROBRA!S
has since changed its terms to include a grace peri?Rd which extends to 1976,
the expected completion date of the Moxoto project._ The remainder of CHIESF's
investment requirements was provided 78.4% by the Government as share capital,
grants and loans, and 15.8% by foreign borrowings. At the end of 19733/ CIESFIs
debt was the equivalent of 45.8% of its total fixed assets.
1974-82 Financing Plan
6.03      In the nine-year period 1974-82, CHESF plans to spend about US$1.7billion
equivalent on the construction of new generating and transmission facilities and
its total fixed assets are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 15%.
/ Almost all dividends have been automatically reinvested by ELET;1BRAS and
SUDENE, its major shareholders.
2/ Without the amortizations for the Moxoto related loans, the contribution to
investment would have been 13.1% in the years 1972-73.

provided about 22.2% by net intemnal cash generation, 23.4% by existing and
proposed foreign borrowings and 54.4% by existing and proposed borrowings from
ELETROBRAS.

~/Remunerable investments are defined on page 2 of Annex 3.



- 20 -
6.06      The proposed Bank loan of US$81 million would be made to CHESF at
7-1/4% interest for 20 years, including a 4-1/2 year grace period and would
be guaranteed by the Brazilian Government. The proposed Bank loan would not
become effective until all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
IDB loan have been met.
6.07      In December 1973 IDB approved a US$84.8 million loan to CHESF, sub-
ject to approval of the proposed Bank loan. The IDB loan, which would include
US$14.6 million for interest during construction, would be made to CHESF at
8% interest for 20 years, including a 4-1/2 year grace period. The IDB loan
would also be guaranteed by the Brazilian Government.
6.08      CHESF is arranging parallel financing to cover selected equipment imports
(paragraph 4.15) for the Paulo Afonso IV project amounting to about US$72
million. The countries CHESF visited have indicated terms of around 15 years
with appropriate grace perfiods., fixed interest rates varying between 7% and
7-1/2%, and variable rates based on th6 London inter-bank rate or New York
prime rate plus up to 7/8 of 1%. CHESF has used a rate of 8% in its projections.
CHESF has received letters of intent from 12 countries which assure that
adequate financing will be available within the desired competition.
6.09      For future projects, mainly the Xingo hydroelectric project and related
transmission facilities, CHESF plans to borrow from as-yet-unidentified foreign
sources about US$170 million at terms comparable to those of the parallel financing
described above. Drawdowns of these funds would be made mostly after 1975.
6.10      Local borrowings totalling US$954 million equivalent would be Qbtaine,
from ZL,ETROBRAS for periods of between 15 and 25 years with grace periods of
between 3 and 5 years at 10% interest plus a service charge; all would be subject
to monetary correction. (paragraph 4 of Annex 3). Of the total local borrowings&,
about US$361 million is covered by existing contracts and about US$593 million is
to be arranged as required in the future.
6 .11     ELETROBRAS would reinvest US$609 million of dividends received from
CHEF a3nd invest an additional US$28 million in CHESF's share capital in the
period 1974-82. It would also convert about US$164 million of its loans into
share capital. In the same period, CHESF would receive about US$143 million in
grants from the Governnment to build navigation locks at Boa Esperanca and Sobradinho
and to relocate the population affected by the creation of Sobradinho reservoir.
6.12      In line with recent loans for power in Brazil, CHESF has agreed not to
inc,ur debt if by such incurrence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of its total fixed
assets, less depreciation; it will also not incur debt with an original term of
less than 10 years if by so doing the total outstanding principal of such debt
would exceed 5% of its total net fixed assets.



- 21 -
6.13      CHESF's financing plan as detailed above is reasonable, particularly
with the support of the Federal Government through ELETRBRAS (paragraphs 6.10
and 6.11). During negotiations the Brazilian Goverrnment agreed that in the
event the.re should arise reasons to believe CHF  will not have sufficient funds
to assure the timely completion of the project, it will provide them, either
directly or through ELETROBRAS.:
6.14      In its projections, CHEOF has used an average annual depr¢ciation rate
of about 2%. In light of the Bank's experience with other similar large power
companies in Brazil, this rate seems low. Therefore, CHEP agreed during
negotiations to make a study of its depreciation practices and to disouss with
the Bank the result of such study within nine months of loan aigning.
Future Financial Situation
6.15      CHESFIs financial outlook is satisfactory even though its debt service
would be covered by operating income plus depreciation only about 1.0 times in
the period 1978 to 1980. This is largely explained by the fact ihat amortizations
on the debt incurred to build Paulo Afonso IV will commece in 1978 while full
benefits from the project will only be realized by 1982. CHE98's financial
strength comes not only from its own resources through adequate tariff legislation
(paragraph 2.06), but also from the fact that ELETRoBRAS has expressed willingness
to convert some of its loans into equity and/or contribute fresh equity as needed
to carry out CHESF's expansion program and meet its financial obligationa. The
Brazilian Government also agreed during negotiations that in the event CHES would
not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations, it will provide them
either directly or through ELETROBRAS.
6.16      The recent fuel crisis will have little effect on CHESF's costs because
fuel is not a significant factor in its total operating costs; in the period
under consideration, 1974-82, it would only represent about 1.9%.  Furthermore,
under existing Brazilian tariff legislation, CHESF would have no difficulty
recovering an increase in the cost of fuel.
6.17      Performance indicators showing the expected achievement during the
project period are shown in Annex 19.
6.18      As in the case of similar Bank loans to the Brazilian electric power
sector, CHESF agreed during negotiations not to carry out any major program of
expansion of its generation and transmission facilities without giving the Bank
evidence that such expansion is economically justified and that adequate financial
resources are available and conforms to the power expansion program for the
Northeast prepared by ELTROOBRAS. For this purpose, a major expansion is one
whose cost exceeds 2% of the gross fixed assets in operation plus work in progress.
Audit
6.19      CHESF's financial statements have been certified by Arthur Andersen
and Company. Their work appears satisfactory. During negotiations, CHESF agreed
to continue appointing independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and to submit
audited financial statements and the auditor's report within four months of the
fiscal year end, each year for the duration of the loan.

7  AGREEMENTS '1FGCHED ABD PWOltlDATIOIIS
7.01     I)uring negotiations,
(a)  CIESF agreed:
(i)  to take all necessary action to have its electricity tariffs
set at, levels which will produce revenues provided for by
the legislation of the Guarantor, and sufficient to ensure
CHESF#s continued operation in accordance with sound financial
and public utility practices. As permitted unde- the legisla-
tion, the tariffs should be based on assets revalued at least
once every calendar year (paragraph 2.06)3
(ii) not to carry out any major generation or transmission expansion
project without giving the Bank evidence that such expansion
is economically justified, that adequate financial resources
are available and that such pro,ect is in accordance with plans
for the Northeast power sector approved by ELETROBRAS. For this
purpose, a major expansion is one whose cost exceeds 2% of the
gross fixed asset in operation plus work in progress (paraaph
6.18);
(iii)  not to incur debt without the Bank's conourroew  if by sich
incurrence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of its total net
fixed assets; and not to incur debt with an origiml term of
less than 10 years if by so doing the total outstanding prin-
cipal of such lebt would exceed 5% of its total net fMd
assets (paragraph 6.12);
(iv) to prepare a study of its depreciation practices and to discuss
the reult of such study opportunely with the Bank (paragaph
6.14); and
(v)  to retain independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and
to submit audited financial statements and: the auditorts
report within four months of the year end, each year for the
duration of the loan (paragraph 6.16);
(b) CHESF and the Brazilian Government agreed:
(i)  that aty cbanges in the legislation of the Brasilian Governnt
which, in the opinion of the Bank, would materially and adversely
affect CHESF's financial position would be an event of default
(paragraph 2.06);
(ii) to complete appropriate resettlement plans for the population
living in the reservoir area to be flooded, for review and
coent by the Bank within nine months of the signing of the
proposed loan and to put such plan into effect in a manor
satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 4.22);



- 23 -
(iii)  to prepare for review and co nt by the Bank plaus for
minimising possible spreading and exacerbation of plague,
schistosomiasis and malaria in lb Sobradinho reservoir
area and plans for minimizing the undesirable effects of
the decaying vegetation on the biochemical properties of
the reservoir and plans for promoting fish conservation and
production in the reservoir (paragraph 4.23); mad
(iv)  to couplete for review and coment by the Bank a stud  to
determine the possible effects of the project on agriculture
and the population living in the Middle Sao Francisco, to
prepare a plan for reasonable compensation, if necessary,
and to put such plan into effect in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank (paragraph 4.25);
(c) the Brazilian Government agreed:
(i)  that the various resettlement, compensation and ecological
programs related to the project will be completed and assigned
for action to the proper specialised Government authorities
(paragraph 4.22, 4.23, 4.25, 4.27 and 4.28);
(ii) to prepare for review and comuent by the Bank the Lower Sao
Francisco emergency plan and to implement it by the end of
1978 (paragraph 4.28);
(iii)  to complete and submit for review and cment by the Bank a
comprehensive development program for the Lower Sao Francisco
(paragraph 4.28); and
(iv) that in the event there arises reason to believe that CHESF
will not have sufficient funds to assure the timely completion
of the project, and/or the timely service of its financial
obligations, the Government will provide them either directly
or through ELETROBRAS (paragraphs 6.13 and 6.15).
7.02      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$81
million equivalent, for a terma of 20 years, including a 4-1/2-year period of
grace. Effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan will be contingent upon CHES?
having fulfilled the conditions precedent for the effectiveness of the US$84.8
million IDB loan, subject only to the effectiveness of the Bank loan (paragraph

operate.
Article 6  -  Establishles that FURNAS and ELETR0SUL will build and operate the EHV
transmission system from ITAIPU to their respective systems, and
also the extensions in their existing transmission systems, as
required to deliver ITAIPU power to the Southeast and South marke-ts,
including the EHV terminals and rings to deliver the power to
metropolitan areas.  Part of the financial resources for this
construction will come from the Compulsory Loan (Law No. 5824,
Article 2). The State companies will build the required transmission
and distribution facilities from the delivery point mentioned in
this Article.
Article 7  - Sets up a period of 30 days after the signature of the contracts

BRAZIL
ELECTRICITY TARIFFS IN BRAZIL
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Water Co4e of
1934, subsequent amendments and decrees dated February 26, 1957, and
November 4, 196i, and Laws 5073 enacted on August 18, 1966 and 5655 of
May 20, 1971 (effective January 1, 1972).
2.        Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the historic
-value of investment, consequently not reflecting the substantial inflation
which occurred-in Brazil. The 1964 decree allowed utilities to rovalue
their investment in order to reflect changes in price levels; the 1966
legislation made annual revaluation of assets mandatory.
3.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are roviewed and approved
by the Department of Water and Power of the ]iznistry of I4nes and Energy
every three years or at shorter intervals at' the initiative of the utility.
Without advance approval of that Department, between tariff revisionsa, the
utilities may add surcharges to current tariffs to cover compulsory increases
in wages, social benefits, costs of fuel and purchased power, and increases
in foreign debt service due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts are actually obtained by CHESN as often as the Government calculates
and publishes economic correction factors (coefficients) which reflect
variations in the price level. The coefficients are issued annually about
one month after the end of each year for the use of industry in general as well
as the electric utilities. The coefficients are applied by the utilities to
update the values of plant in service and work in progress, depreciation and
amortization reserves, and local currency loans of ELETROBRAS and the National
Development Bank.
5.        Law 5655 of May 20, 1971 introduced various changes in the power sector
legislation which are having an impact on the finances at the individual utilities,
though not altering the legislatim Is basic philosophy. According to this law,
tariffs should be set at levels so as to cover:



Am=WE 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
(a) operation, maintenance and administration expenses1A'
(b) straight-line depreciation of up to 5% for thermal installation
and up to 3% for hydro installation;
(c)  reversion of up to 3% of total fixed assets in operation4  and
(d) a return of 10% to 12% on remunerable investments./
1/ Income Tax - Traditionally in Brazil, income tax had been ccmnidsred part
of the cost of service and was therefore taken into eonsideration in
adjusting electricity rates. Prior to January 1, 1972, the not income of
utilities was taxsd at 17% when their return was below 12%, and 30% ibim
their return was above 12%.  Law 5655 states that for the period 1972-75,
the income tax rate will be uniform at 6% and will not be canmidered part of
the cost of service. The law does not specify what will happen after 1975.
For its part'OES is specifically exempt, from income tax until the ead of 1980.
2/ Reversion - Reversion is a tax assessed by the Government at a rate of up to 3
on the fixed assets of the electric utilities. The procei6d from this tax is
deposited in the name of ELETROBRAS which is responsible for its administration.
This tax is expected to yield Cr$1.4 billion (US$232 million) in l97i.  sL3T2BEAS
pays the Government interest at the rate of 3% for the use of the funds and in
turn lends it to the electric utilities at rates of 10% to 12%. At its discretion,
BLITROBRAS can use up to 5% of the reversion fund to indemnify oaers of land
flooded by reservoirs. CHESF is assessed 3% on its total fixed asets in
operation.
Remunerable Investments - The remunerable investments, an which the rate of
return under Brsi:lian'legislation is calculated, condmit of the following:
Total fixed assets in operation at the end of the year
Allowances for working capital -
(a) Cash at the end of the yea- up to a maximum of the depreciation
reserve.
(b) Inventories as approved by the tax authorities (presently up to
a maximum of 3% of gross fixed assets in operation).
(c) Receivables up to a maximum of two months' billing.
Deduct:
(a) Depreciation reserve at the end of the year.
(b) Consumers or other contributions.
(c) Various small items specified by law.



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 3 pages
6.        In addition to the electricity ratei;, the consumer wast pay the
following:
(a)  Compulsory Loan (Emprestimo Compulsorio) - This is collected from
industrial consumers at rates which will gradually go down from
35% in 1973 to 10% by 1983, date beyond which it will no longer
be collected. Proceeds from the compulsory loan, for which consumers
receive 20-year bonds at 6% interest, are administered by KIJETROBRAS
which can invest them in the form of either share capital or loans
for the following purposes:
(i) 50% for the construction of hydroelectric power plants in the
Parana river basin;
(ii) 15% for the construction of hydroelectric power plants in the
Sao Francisco river basin;
(iii)  10% to be invested in the share capital of BLETRCtORTE; and
(iv) 25% for the construction of regional transmission systems
in extra high voltage and the execution of a national
pioneering program of nuclear power plants.
The Compulsory Loan is expected to yield Cr$1.1 billion (US$184 milion)
in 1974.
(b) Sole Tax (Imposto Unico) - The sole tax is calculated on the basis
of the "fiscal rate for consumers", a country-wide average electricity
,charge set every three months by :NAKE.  The rates applicabie since
January 1, 1972, are 50% for residential consumers (47% previously) ana
60% for commercial consumers (22% previously); industrial consumers are
exempt from this tax since January 1, 1972 (2% previously). The proceeds
from this tax are distributed 37% to ELETROBRAS, 2% to DNAZZ, 1% to the
Ministry of Mines and Energy and 60% to the States, this last alloecation
being divided among the Brazilian States on the basis of their area (20%),
their population (60%), their electric power generation (2%), their
electricity consumption (15%) and their total flooded areas on account
of reservoirs (3%). The Sole Tax is expected to yield Cr$571 million
(US$94 million) in 1974.
(c) Social Security Tax - Collected on the electricity bill at the rate
of 3% of the value of such bill.

BRAZIL
LEAST-COST SOLUTION
Hydro Alternatives
1.        After Moxoto hydroelectric station reaches full utilization, at the
end of 1977, several hydroelectric alternatives could be adopted to supply the
growing power demand of the Northeast. Studies were made by ELETROBRAS and
CHESF with the assistance of consultants to determine the best solution feasible
at the required time. Two courses of action could be followed to increase the
power generation of the Sao Francisco river: building regulating reservoirs
to firm up the flow of Sao Francisco river either before or after developing
new sites. The decision was made in favor of the first alternative as it pro-
vided an increase of energy generation in the existing sites at lower cost than
developing the lingo hydroelectric project with no flow regulation.
2.        Two possible sites were considered for the construction of such
reservoirs: Itaparica and Sobradinho, 36 km and 470 km, respectively upstream
from the Paulo Afonso falls. Both alternatives are of similar cost, provided
that the construction of both projects can be completed on schedule. However,
the area to be flooded at Itaparica is more densely populated and has a higher
degree of infrastructural development than the area of Sobradinho. It is
difficult to ascertain the actual cost of relocation at either of these sites
and it is doubtful if these costs have in fact been fully considered. However,
the Itaparica alternative presents an additional uncertainty in terms of timing.
Delay in completion could cause severe power shortages or necessitate the greater
use of thermal energy, all of which would add to the coat of Itaparica^. In view
of this, and because it is more politically acceptable, the decision has been
made in favor of Sobradinho.
3.        The adopted program consists of the construction of the Sobradinho
reservoir to be put into service at the end of 1977, the construction of Paulo
Afonso IV power station with four generating units totaling 1 ,500 MW, each unit
to be installed in accordance with the load requirements as shown in Table of page 8
and the transmission facilities to deliver the power of the distributing centers.
4.        As mentioned before, the Sobradinho regulating reservoir will increase
the energy output of all present and future power projects downstream. For
purposes of comparing the proposed generating program with other alternatives
such as thermal generation, the share of the cost of Sobradinho to be charged
to Paulo Afonso IV should be determined. As cost estimates and characteristics
of all future plants to be built downstream from Sobradinho are unknown with
the exception of Paulo Afonso IV, the economic studies with thermal or nuclear
alternatives could not be extended for a time horizon corresponding to the full
utilization of the river.



ANEXE 8
Page 2 of 9 pages
5.        In view of the above, a simaplified method has been ado;?ted based
on the assumption that each hydroelectric development downstream from
Sobradinho should share a proportion of the cost of this reservoir in the
same oroportion to the benefits derived from the operation of each project.
Such benefits are assumed to be directly proportional to the energy generation.
6.        For this purpose the incremental energy resulting from Sobradinho
in all present and future projects was established from the date of cormissioning
of suct projects and for a period corresponding to the life of the Sobradinho
works, The scheduling of starting the ope:'ation of each new hydro generating
unit was done in accordance with load requirements of the Region. The incre-
mental generation, properly discounted at an adequate opportunity cost of
money, provides the basis for the share of the benefits accrued by the operation
of each plant in relation to the total generation for the life of Sobradinho.
7.        The table below shows the incremntal energy generated by each
plant from 1977 to infinity and its discounted value at 12% annual rate. In
accordance with this table the existing Paulo Afonso plants and M?ooto should
share 22.6% of the Sobradinho costs and Paulo Afonso IV, 40.2% of such cost.

Adverse Effects of the Sobradinho Reservoir
8.        To compare the Paulo Afonso IV protlect with other power generating
power alternatives, the cost of the adverse effects of the construction of
Sobradinho reservoir and the river flow regulation should be evaluated.
9.        The cost of land, resettlement of population and relocation of the
infrastructure of the areas to be flooded by the reservoir have been included
in the project cost. The net value of the lost agricultural production has
been estimated at a lower value than the cost of the land, therefore, no
additional cost should be impated to the project by this concept.
10.       The agricultural development plans for the Lower Sao Francisco, as
explained in paragraphs 4.26 to 4.28, were initiated by SUVALE before the
decision to regulate the river for power generation was known. Under tbese
plans it was expected to improve irrigation in the area in order to increase
and stabilize the agricultural production. At present, the effects on such
plans of the river regulation are not known and they my prove to have positive
or negative effects.                  |
11.       As no evaluation has been done yet for the cost of relocation and
production losses at the river margins downstreams from Sobradinho due to the
river regulation, an amount of US$20 million charged to Paulo Afonso IV
project has been conservatively assumed for the purpose of comparison with other
power generating alternatives.
Thermal Alternative
12.       The above-mentioned hydroelectric generating program was compared
with thermal generating programs that would supply the saw araount of power and
energy required for the Northeast Region during the period 1977-1983, at which
Paulo Afonso IV generating capacity would be fully utilized.
13.       Several alternative thermal programs including nuclear were studied
by SOFRELEC. The optimum program was found to be the combination of steam oil-
fired generating units of 200 MW to be installed at Recife and Salvador to
provide the base load requirements, with 50 NW gas turbine generating units using
light oil destillate located at Fortaleza, Recife and Salvador and existing hydro
plants to provide the peaking requirements, as shown in table on page 8.
1i.       The determination of required thermal energy generation was based on
the average hydroelectric generation of the existing plants (instead of the f£r.X
generation) for 41 years of simulated operation of the regulating reservoirs
of the Sao Francisco river. Under this assumption, the thermal units would
provide the energy deficit during dry periods, at the least cost.
15.       The tabLe on page 7 shows the basic parameters adopted for the hydro
and thermal alternatives. It has been assumed that the installations will be
replaced by identical ones at the end of their useful lives, indefinitely.
Technological improvements and the effects of economies of scale resulting from
adopting bigger units in the future replacement programs were not considered
because it was assumed that this may be fully compensated by the tendency of in-
vestment and operational costs to increase, in real terms, as no escalation for
investient costs were considered and fuel cost was assumed to become stable as
from 1980, as will be explained below.

Economic Adjustments
16.       The ilternative programs (hydro, steam and nuclear) were compared
through the present worth of their re,3pective investment and operating expenaes
expressed in US dollars of 1973. With the exception of fuel cost, as ex-
plained below, it has been assumed that the relation betwsee other coat
components of all projects under consideration remains constant over time.
17.       To put this comparisirn in the national economic context, the following
adjustments to the market valucs were made.
(a) estimated local tax and import duties for direot and indirect
cost components were eliminated;
(b) estimated unskilled labor cost of Sobradinho dam was evaluated
at 50% of its market value. (No significant unskilled labor
is assumed to be employed in the otber parts of the project.);
(c) direct and indirect estimated foreign cost components "re
calculated at 20% over the exchange rate market value;> and,
(cd) crude oil and associated ocean freight was considered as an
imported commodity.
Fuel Prices
18.       Fuel oil price was assumed as 95% of crude oil price and light
destillate (gas, oil or similar) as twice the fuel oil price. Froight of fuel
o41 to Brazil was estimated at 0.85/US$ barrel; local hindling of fbel oil
;.20/ton and 1.80/ton for gas-oil.
z:*.   Two assumptions were made to determine the long-run crude price based
on the idea that such prices will be stablized at the cost of fuel derived
from coal or oil shales. The commercial price of such products has been con-
servatively assuxmd to be the equivalent of crude oil prices of US$6/barrel
at point of production. Under the first assumption, the equalizing value of
US$6/barrel is assumed to be reached in 1980 starting from a value of crude oil
of US$8/barrel in 1977, as ahown in the table below, and under the second assumption,
uhich can be considered as an extremely unfavorable condition for the justi-
'ication of Paulo Afonso IV project, a stable price of US$5/barrel for crude
oil has been taken.
1/ A conservative value which favors the thermal alternative. According to the
Instituto de Planejamento Economico e Social (Analise Governuental de Projetos
de Investimento no Brasil; Rio de Janeiro 1972) the reco_mended value is 25%.

1/ Imported component at US$ "economic" value.
200.      A base nuclear fuel cost of 1.8/US$ M(h has been adopted for the nuclear
alternatives, as estimated in the "Ma:rket Survey for Nuclear Power in Developing
Countries" of the IABA of September 1973 for 400 NW units. This value is net of
credits or cost involved in fuel repossessing. The original fuel inventory
has been considered as part of the investEent cost. The fuel cost at plant site
has been established as follows:
base cost                                1.80 US$/RIh
ocean freight                            0.21 US$/Mfh

Total at Generating Plant                2.60 US$/*&h
Variable Costs
21.       The total variable cost component of the thermal alternatives, steam
or nuclear, has been aBsumd to be 1.1 times the fuel cost oomponent.
Results
22.       The present worth of the power cost differential between the proposecL
Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric project and the thermal alternatives, oil-fired
and nuclear, under the above-mentioned basic assumptions, was determined for
several discount rates, the revulta are shown in graph of page 9.



ANIKK 8-
Page 6 of 9 -page
23.       For the oil-fired alternatives, three cases were studid (Curves
A, B and D). Curves A and B show the results of comparing tba PFlo Atono- IT
hydroelectric project, charging it with 40% of the Sobradinho ressrrdir in-
vestment cost which is the proportion of the benefits that can be assigned to
this project as explained above, for two assumptions for fuel cost as thown
in table of page 5. (Curve A for crude oil at US$8/barrel in 1977 9nt US$61
barrel in 1980, Curve B for crude oil at US$5/barrel.) Curve D may be con-
sidered as the extreme of unfavorable conditions for Paulo Afonso IV project,
in which this project is charged with 77% of the Sobradinho investwait costs
resulting from the assumption that the balance of such cost is charged to the
existing hydroelectric plants (consequently, no cost sharing is assigned to
future power developmnts of the Sao Francisco river), and fbel oil costs based
at the price of crude oil of US$5/barrel. F'oz the graph of p4g  9,
alternative A, which can be considered as the jost probable, has an equalising
annual discount rate of 17.5%. For alternative D, refloeting the most extroe
adverse conditions, the equalizing discount rate is 1.3%. The nuclur
alternative C has a higher cost than the oil-fired steam alternatives (exoept
for case A) for discount rates lower than 10.5%.

COST-BENEFITS EQUALIZIJG RATE
Energy Capability of the Plant
As explained below, the Project benefits have been evaluated on
the basis of the incremental energy generated-'as a result of the construction
of the Project; the return on investment iss therefore, largely affected by
the plant utilization. In this case, the incremental annual generation in
the Northeast system due to the construction of Sobradinho reservoir aad
Paulo Afonso IV plant is estimated at 8,300 GWh. The proposed installed
capacity at Paulo Afonso IV plant (first phase) is 1,500 MW; if 12% of such
capacity is assumed to represent the required reserve generating capacity of
the systems the amual generation can supply the energy requireuwnts with a
yearly load factor of 0.71 which exceeds the expected load factor of the
system of 0.62.
Benefits
Conservatively, the benefits of the Project have been estimated at
the value of the energy paid by the ultimate consumer of the Northeast Begion,
which consist of the tariff plus the sole tax, the latter being reinvested
in the power sector.
The average unit price of electric energy paid by the consumer in
the region is:
Cff$/kWh           UIS$/kWh
Tariff                  0.1797            0.0294
Sole tax                0.0296            o=04U8
Total                 0.2093            0.0342
The average annual incremental energy sold in the Regimn due to
Sobradinho-Paulo Afonso IV in estimated at 7,138 GWh at the full utilization
of the Project. The table on page 3 shows the estimated annual benefits of
the Project starting.in 1977.
Costs
The incremental cost of the distribution has been added to the generating
and transmission cost of the Project mentioned in Annex 8. For this purpose the
following assumptions have been made:

Required diversity distribution over capacity (2%   214 MV
Required distribution capacity                    1,282 MW
Estimated incremental unit investment cost for
distribution                                   US$1;30/k
Estimated incremental annual operating and
maintenance cost of distribution (4.5% of
investment cost)                               US$5.85/kW
As mentioned in Annex 8, the value of the lost agricultural production
of the area to be flooded by Sobradinho is included in the cost of the land
which forms part of the coot of the Project; and the value of the lost agricultural
production downstream frm Sobradinho has been capitalized at an estimted
amount of US$20 million.
The table mn page 3 shows the cost schedule.
Cost Benefit Equalizing Rate
Based on the information shown in the table on page 3, the cost-benefit
equalizing rate of return is 23.3%, which can be oonsidered higher than the
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil.

P/ Preliminary
CIIESF is exempt from Federal Taxes until 1980 and assumes its exemption will be prorogated after 1980.  I1 is als. cxempt Crom most State or Municipal Taxes.  The smount
of taxes paid is therefore relatively small and has been included with the corresponding expense or asset.
3/  Expenses were projected by operating function, i.e. generation, transmission and administration based on existing experience and  lsiog constast Crozeiros no of the end
of 1973.  Under the existing monetary correction system there is no need to take inflation into consideration (Annex  3  , para-raph 4). C--eraiI,- expensees were ent ixated
separately for hydroelectric and thermal power based on a per kW of installed capacity and taking into aceolit the fixed and variable compouents ,f' tie total expen,se.
Transmission expenses were estimated on the basis of kWh sold from hydroelectric sources. General Administration expenses have been iscreased between 27 a1d 5q. per near
From a 1973 basis.
HI Small amounts of power were purchased by CHESF in 1972 and 1973 from COHERE wiicl, -as acquired by CIESF durina 1973.
7/  Statistically, the year 1974 is expected to be an extremely dry year in the Northeast and CHESF has reflected this in the use of foel for that year.
,  Reversion was set at 3% of CISESF's fixed assets in operation (An-rx   3  , page 2, note 2).
7/ Depreciation has been calculated at the rate of about 2,%. Seecoonents isi paragroph 6.14 of this report.
8/ Other income includes principally interest income on temporary investments of excess casc, in Government treasury bo-ds.
