PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL:   PAULO AFONSO IV HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(LOAN 1008 - BR)
PREFACE
This report sets forth the results of a performance audit of the
Paulo Afon,so IV hydroelectric project in Central Brazil carried out by
Companhia Hidroeletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) with World Bank support
through Loan 1008-BR of US$81.0 million approved in June 1974. The Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB), through Loan 264/OC-BR of US$84.8 million
approved in December 1973, also helped finance this project. Loan 1008-BR was
the twenty seventh Bank operation in the Brazilian power sector and the second
one vLth CHESF as the Borrower. Signature of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
took place on June 17, 1"74. The loan became effective only on April 16, 1975,
because of delays in the fulfillement of the conditions of effectiveness of
the IDB loan. The Closing Date was originally set for December 31, 1978.
Delays mostly related to changes in the project led to its postponment,
ultimately to June 30, 1983. The last disbursement occurred on October 12,
1983.
The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) conslsts of a Project
Performance Audit MIemorandum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department and a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Latin America
and the Carribean Regional Office. The PCR used, in part, CHESF's final
project report. OED has reviewed the Appraisal and President's reports, the
legal documents, the transcripts of the meeting of the Executive Directors at
which the Loan was approved, and the project related documents in the Bank
files. The responsible staff of OED interviewed Bank and IDB staff familiar
with the project and its implementation. It further visited Brazil where it
extensively discussed the problems that have occurred with management and
specialists of CHESF and briefly with officers of ELETROBRAS. It also visited
Sobradinho and one of the towns that have grown from a nucleus created by the
resettlement of the population from the area now flooded by the lake.
The audit finds that in most respects the PCR acc rately describes
the salient features of the project and its execution. The 1,R also generally
supports in accurate detail the conlusions that emerge and the lessons to be
learned. Except for the discussion of costs, as well as some minor points
concerning economic justification, procurement, and disbursements, the PPAM
summarize.; and attempts not to repeat the details provided in the PCR. In
additiGn, it provides Supplementary Comments or. project preparation and
definition, technical operating efficiency, development of settlements along
lake Sobradinho, parallel financing, and collaboration with IDB.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were
sent  to  the  Government  and  CHESF  for comments. The comments received are
reproduced as Attachment 1.

PROJBZT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL:   PAULO AFONSO IV HYROELECTRIC PROJECT
(LOAN 1008 - BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
The project was the core of the 1974-82 development program of
Companhia Hidro-Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF), the utility responsible for
bulk power supply in the northeastern provinces of Brazil. Through its
implementation, CHESF succeeded (i) in regulating flow in the Rio Sao
Francisco by creating Lake Sobradinho, which benefi-s all the dcwnstream
powerplants, existing and future, and (ii) in substantially increasing its
capacity and energy output by commissioning the Paulo Afonso IV hydro
powerplant (2,460 MW, 6.2 TWh/y?-ar). The large increaoes in petroleum prices
in 1973 and faster demand growth than expected led CHESF to change radically
its development plan and with it the design of the project facilities. These
changes,  in  turn,  were  main  factors  in  the  cost and time overruns that
afflicted the project without, however, modifying its status as the least cost
addition to CHESF's facilities.
The most difficult problem CHESF had to resolve in connection with
the project was the resetLlement of some 70,000 people from the area to be
flooded by Lake Sobradinho. It completed this operation with a measure of
success, albeit at the cost of substantial human hardship. However, there are
signs that the further development of the area on the shore of the new lake is
quite satisfac~tory. Nevertheless, it is evident that, in future, such an
operation should be started only after much more in-depth planning and design
than were carried out in the case of Sobradinho. CHESF is making good use of
this  experience   in  connection   with  the  resettlement  required  by  the
construction of the Itaparica hydroelectric powerplant upstream from Paulo
Afonso.
During the period 1977-1982, the financial performance of the
Brazilian power sector, and with it that of CHESF, deteriorated from the very
satisfactory level of the early and middle seventies. The subsequent dialogue
between the Brazilian authorities responsible for the power sector and the
Bank, led in 1981 and 1983 to new tariff agreements. Though, in each case, the
Government complied with the terms of the agreements, the resulting revenues
were insufficient and the financial performance of the sector fell short of
the objectives of the agreements. In connection with its latest three
operations in the power sector (Loans 2564- and 2565-BR approved in June 1985,
and Loan 2720-BR approved in June 1986) the Brazilian authorities and the
Bank, on the basis of a sector rehabilitation plan prepared by the Brazilian
Government,  aim   at  re-establishing   by  1990   a  satisfactory  financial
performance of the sector, an with it, of CHESF.



vi
By holding down tariffs, the Governement weakened the sector which
was also affected by recession and the devaluation of the currency over recent
years. This also holds for CHESF, which went through further difficulties,
when it moved its headquarters from Rio do Janeiro to Recife and had,
therefore, to replace those of its employees who did not wish to transfex. A
considerable percentage of its higher level staff were among the latter.
CHESF, however, has recovered. As the rest of the power sector, the utility
continues to be reasonably well managed and to perform at a better than
average level in satisfying a demand that, in spite of the difficult economic
situation of the country, still grows at a fast pace.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
BRAZIL:  PAULO AFONSO IV HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(LOAN 1008-BR)
I. BACKGROUND
1.        The  Bank  project  essentially  was  the Fifth Expansion Program of
Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF), the autonomous corporation
established in  1948 as  a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS, 'he mixed economy holding
company of the Brazilian power sector, whose main shareholder is the Federal
Government. As its name suggests, CHESF was originally a company with a
concession for developing the hydropower resources of the Rio Sao Francisco,
the main river in nzrtheastern Brazil. In 1950, the Bank helped CHESF in its
initial development by contributing, through Loan 25-BR, US$ 15 million to the
financing of the first stage (120 MW) of the Paulo Afonso I hydroelectric
power plant, the first sizable utilization of the river's power potential.
CHESF was to sell the energy produced to the distributing utilities of the
regioni, in particular those in the cities of Recife and Salvador. In time, it
became responsible for all generation and bulk transmission of e' ctric power
for public consumption, i.e. it sold the production to the listribution
companies in nine states in the north-east of the country. However, it
continued to develop 'ts generating capacity mainly by  building hydroelectric
plants on the Rio Sao Francisco and in particular in the area of the Paulo
Afonso falls. Recently, Government assigned the supply of bulk power in the
states of  Maranhao and Ceara to ELETRONORTE. Therefore, today, CHESF's market
area is limited to seven states (Rio Grande do Norte, Piaui, Pernambuco,
Paraiba, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Bahia). However, its transmission system is
interconnected with that of ELETRONORTE.
2.        In the late sixties  and  the  early  seventies  CHESF,  assisted by
ELETROBRAS, carried out a market survey and, with the help of consultants, a
comprehensive study of the power resources in its concession area. This
analysis showed, that the least cost solution for expansion consisted in the
further development of the hydroelectric resources of the Rio Sao Francisco.
As over the period of CHESF's Fifth Expansion Plan (1974-1982), the company
expected demand for energy to grow at a high average rate of 13.7% per year,
the plan involved a large investment.
3.        The Interamerican  Development Bank  (IDB) had assisted CHESF during
the sixties and the early seventies. In particular, it had substantially
contributed to the financing of the Moxoto plant. Therefore, when the utility
was looking for finance for the above extension plan, it first approached IDB.
However, as in 1972 the estimated cost of the plan was already US$ 518
million, it became quickly evident that, in view of the limited resources
available to IDB, only the participation of another development institution
would allow coverage of a substantial part of the expected foreign exchange
cost of this plan by non-commercial financing. In June 1972, the first
documented approach of Brazilian authorities to IBRD in this mnatter occurred
in a brief presentation of the program by ELETROBRAS.



2
4.        During the  two decades since its first involvement with CHESF, IBRD
had concentrated on intensive participation in the development of the electri..
power sector in the more southern parts of Brazil, which, at that time,
represented some 90% of the market for electric energy in Brazil. However, as
the Northeast had not benefitted as much as other parts of the country from
the development efforts in the fifties and sixtiss, its development became a
high priority objective of Government, which the Bank had come to endorse.
Thus, at the above request of ELETROBRAS, the Bank agreed to consider partici-
pating in a joint operation with IDB to help finance CHESF's Fifth Extension
Program, always provided the project studiea CHESF was still to submit would
satisfy the Bank as to the justification of the development envisaged.
Oblectives
5.        One of  the weaknesses  of the Project Appraisal Report (AR) is that
it doesn't explicitely list the objectives   set  for the  project. However, a
statement in para 1.03 to the effect that the participation of the Bank in the
project "would allow CHESF to obtain the maximum possible additional external
financing and would support the Government's efforts to develop the Northeast,
one of the less developed regions of Brazil where about thirty million people
live", has to be perceived as an explicit statement of an objective. This goal
reflects the fact that, already at an early stage of project preparation, the
Bank had volunteered to help Brazilian authorities organize a parallel financ-
ing scheme similar to that used quite successfully in the case of the
Marinbondo operation (see OED-Report No. 2768, PCR for Loan 677-BR, Annex 8).
It is evident from the Appraisal Report that, beyond the above very general
goal and  that of  helping CHESF meet the expected demand, the Bank aimed at a
ser es of further targets. These were:
- to improve CHESF's capability in construction, operation, and
maintenance  of  extra-high  voltage  transmission  facilities (AR,
paras. 3.05 and 4.07),
- to reduce transrnission losses in CHESF's system from an unusually
high 13% in 1972 to about 4% in 1978, when the main 500 kV
facilities foreseen in the project were expected to operate (AR,
para. 3.06),
- to reduce the frequency of faults in high voltage transmission
(AR para. 3.06),
- to ensure that appropriate measures minimized the negative impact
of the project, in particular the creation of the Sobradinho
reser-oir, on  local population  and environment  (AR, paras 4.23 to
4.29), and
- to mairitain CHESF's financial performance, which, in the early
seventies was highly satisfactory.



3
6.        At first  sight, the above objectives were not particularly ambitio-
us. However, to try to reach them within the timetable set forth at project
appraisal, was probably unrealistic, in particular takirg into account that
(i) the project components to be financed by the Bank were at the time of the
appraisal only planned and designed at feasibility level and (ii) the
Borrower, not having had operations with the Bank for 20 years, was rather
unfamiliar with IBRD procedures.
Project Description
7.        The core  of  CHESF's  Fifth  Development  Program,  i.e., the Bank
project, consisted in a further, large step in utilizing the hydropower
resources of the Rio Sao Francisco. It inrcluded:
- the Sobradinho dam situated about 470 km upstream from the
Paulo  Afonso  falls  on  the  Rio Sao Francisco and cre.ting a
regulating reservoir with about 29 billion  m3 of  usabl. stor-
age, i.e., one of the largest in the world, to increase the
minimum monthly average flow from about 1150 m3/s  to some 2060
m3/s; this, in turn was to increase substantially the firm
power in the downstream plants existing (Moxoto and Paulo
Afonso 1,I1,  and III)  and future  (Paulo Afonso IV, Itaparica
etc.);
- the Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric power plant with an
installed  capacity  of  1500  MW  uorking in parallel with the
existing plants of Moxoto, and Paulo Afonso I, II, and JII, and
providing a large addition of instantly available capacity but
also,  as  a  consequence   of  the   discharge  regulation  at
Sobradinho,  an  important  amount  (6200  GWl)  of firm energy
output; and
- associated transmission facilities delivering the energy from
Paulo Aforiso to the load centers, including a second 390 km
long single circuit 500 kV linie from Paulo Afonso to Recife and
a series of 230 kV lines and connected transforming and
switching facilities designed in such a way that they would
also create sufficient reserves to permit reducing the trans-
mission losses to their most economic level.
8.        Both CHESF and the two banks were aware that creating the Sobradinho
reservoir would have a major environmental impact, of which the negative
aspects had to be limited as much is possible. This impact was expected in two
regions. First, in the area to be covered by the lake, where about 70,000
people had to be resettled. Second, in the Lower Sao Francisco Valley,
downstream of Pao do Azucar, where the increase of the minimum discharge in
the river due to river regulation at Sobradinho, was to cover perennially some
9,000 ha previously seasonnally flooded and therefore used for rice cropping.
In this area Government had already protected 1,800  ha and  proposed to carry
out an  emergency plan  to protect  the remainir.g  7,200 ha. In the Middle Sao
Francisco Valley extending somiie 560 km between Sobradinho and Pao de Azucar,



4
CHESF had to confirm that, as expected during project appraisal, the
inhabitants and their fields would be little affected by the new water regime.
9.        The Appraisal  Report estimated  the total cost of the above project
at US$ 693 million and the table below lists the main components of the
project as appraised, their costs, and how these were to be financed by the
Bank, IDB, parallel financing, and CHESF or Government (PCR, para.2.4).

* The IDB loan of US$ 84.8 million also covered
US$ 14.6 million of financing charges.
10.       At appraisal  time,  the  key  target  dates  for  the  main project
Components were:
- Sobradinho Dam, start of reservoir fill in January 1977;
- Paulo Afonso IV, commissioning of first unit in October 1978; and
- Transmissiotn lines and substations operational in December 1977.
Project Revisions and Implementation (Sobradinho Dam)
11.       Project implementation  had already  begun when,  between August and
October of 1973, the two banks appraised the project. Indeed, the Brazilian
construction contractor at Sobradinho had started work on the dam proper in
June 1973, after CHESF had carried out pEeparatory work since September 1972.
In accordance with a brochure published by CHESF, in July 1974, i.e., only one
month after the Bank's Board had approved the loan, CHESF decided to install
immediately the generating units at Sobradinho that were previously foreseen
to come on line in 1991/1992. However, only in March 1975, i.e., some eight
months later, did the first written mention of this change appear in Bank
files, and it was in June 1975, when CHESF submitted its formal request to the
Bank to agree under the "major project clause" (Section 5.05 of the Loan
Agreement) to this addition to the utility's investment program. This signals
that the contacts between Bank and Borrower were rather loose. However, this
also seems to be related to the fact that in 1974 the supervision of the



5
Sobradinho darn had been assigned primarily to IDB (PCR, para. 3.2.2) and that
only in April 1975 had the loan become effective.
12.       The reasons  for these fundamental modifications essentia'lly resided
(i) in adjustments in national policies aiming at a decrease in dependancy of
the country on imports of petroleum and its derivatives following the first
energy crisis in 1973 an.d (ii) in higher projected demand than envisaged at
appraisal time (PCR para. 3.5.7).
13.       As set  forth in  the PCR  (Chapter 3.5),  CHESF and its consultants
introduced two further su;'stantial changes to the Sobradinho project: the
addition of an intake structure for the Massangano irrigation project and a
50 m move of the axis of dam and lock complex because of poor geological
conditions. Whereas the first of these changes does not call for comment, the
second is somewhat surprising when taking into account that para. 4.38 of the
Appraisal Report states that the appraisal team was satisfied that hydrology,
geology, foundation, and embankment dams had been thoroughly investigated and
that the bedrock where the dam was to be built was of excellent quality and
occurr-d near the surface. It is not so much the fact t}.at the rock
encountered  was  different  froni  that  expected  as  the  magnitude  of  the
difference contrasted to the absoluteness of the statement in the Appraisal
Report that is surprising. It is obvious that a more cautious formulation in
the report would have been appropriate.
14.       The above  changes,  of  course,  substantially  modified  costs and
construction schedule. Para.21 below will discuss ccsts. As to the development
of construction, CHESF and its contractors should be commended for being able,
in spite of the many changes, to start filling the reservoir in February 1977,
i.e., only one month later than originally planned (para. 10). CHESF'
commissioned the  first unit  at Sobradinho  in October  1979. Since then, the
generating facilities, which were never considered part of the Bank project,
have worked satisfactorily, and the auditing mission was able to confirm that
they are in good condition.
15.       The 1980 OED Operational Policy Review entitled "The  Supervision of
Bank Proiects" (OEDSUP) included the Paulo Afonso IV (Loan 1008 - BR) project
as one of the specific cases studied. This analysis and Annex 2.1 of the PCR
provide a complete ov?rview of the execution of the measures aimed at limiting
the negative environmental inmpact of the Sobradinho project (para. 5 above):
- In April 1975, CHESF, in accordance with Section 3.06 of the Loan
Agreement, submittad a detailed plan for the resettlement operation
in the lake area. However, the Bank found this plan inadequate, and,
in view of the urgency o: starting the operation, intervened with
the responsible Brazilian authorities to accelerate the planning and
implementation process. After CHESF had prepared the required
complements to the original plans, the relocation went ahead with
CHESF responsible for the resettlement of the population in the
small towns of the area, Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma
Agraria (TNCRA) in charge of the move of the rural people, and botn
entities under elose Bank supervision. Ultimately, some 6,200



6
families, far more than originally expected (about 3,700 families),
chose to remain in the neighborhood of the lake. The operation was
completed at the same time as work on the dam had reached a stage
allowing the start of water accumulation in the lake (para. 14
above). However, this was achieved with substantial hardship to many
families concerned (PCR, Annex 2.1, chapter 9.,and para. 31 below).
Government and CHESF also submitted the reports on combatting
endemic disease, on minimizing the undesirable effects of decaying
vegetation, and on promoting fishery in the lake area required in
Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement. Until 1979, when the Bank
discontinued its supervision, the implementation of the fishery
program was not satisfactory (PCR, Annex 2.1, para.9.05), and this
fact contributed to the generally pessimistic view the Bank had at
that  time   of  the  future  on  the  shores  of  Lake  Sobradinho.
Fortunately, in the meantime, this has proven at least partly
unwarranted (para. 30 below).
- As expected, CHESF's report on the Middle Sao Francisco showed
that the impact of regulation on populated and cultivated areas in
this river section would be minimal (PCR, Annex 2.1, para.9.05).
- With respect to the Lower Sao.' Francisco area, Government complied
with Section 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement requiring within nine
months of loan signature the submission of an emergency plan for the
land to be perennially flooded. This led to the Lower  Sao Francisco
Polders Project, which the Bank supported with Loan 1153-BR. OED in
its PPAR No. 5669 concluded that the project had a positive impact
of substantial magnitude. However, its implementation had been
difficult and costly mainly because of unusually difficult physical
conditions and originally inadequate preparation. It had also caused
hardship in many cases.
Project Revisions and _mRlementation (Paulo Afonso IV)
16.       CHESF  started  constructing  the  Paulo  Afonso   IV  hydroelectric
powerplant in early 1974, after it had carried out preliminary work since mid
1973. At about the same time and for the same reasons as the utility decided
to install the generating units at Sobradinho, it also took the step to
increase the installed capacity of the Paulo Afonso plant from four units of
375 MW, i.e., a total of 1,500 MW, to six units of 410 MW, i.e., a total of
2,460 MW, a change that entailed both delays and cost increases. Again, the
Bank became aware of this change at a rather late stage, namely during the
first supervision mission of the LAC energy division in October 1975, when
CHESF had already ordered the new units (Files and PCR para 6.2.2). The first
unit went on line in November 1979, i.e., about one year later than foreseen
at appraisal time (para. 10). Taking into account the basic design changes
that CHESF introduced after it had started construction of the plant on force
account, the utility's performance is still notable.



7
Project Revisions and Implementation (Transmission Component)
17.       The installation  of the  generating facilities at Sobradinhc and of
additional and larger units at Paulo Afonso as well as economic studies
carried out when execution of the main project components were already under
way also affected the transmission program, i.e. that part against the cost of
which most of the Banik loan was to be disbursed. Whereas the 500 kV part of
the component remained substantially unchanged, CHESF, assisted by its new
consultants, whic.L it had hired aft-er it moved headquarters from Rio to Recife
in 1975, all but completely redrafted the 230 kV facilities reducing by half
the length of the lines to be built under the Bank project but increasing the
transforming capacity by some 15% (PCR para. 3.7.5). This, associated with
difficultics in procurement in part related to CHESF staff lacking experience
with World Bank procedures entailed substantial delays. Thus, the 500 kV
facilities, though executed as originally planned, went into operation in
Mar'Hh 1980, i.e., about 27 months later than expected. The 230 kV component
was only completed in March 1985, which is more than eight years after the
originally envisaged date. However, it is fair to note that by the end of 1981
about 85% of the transmission facilities under the project were in operation.
The delays did not substantially affect the trans-nission of the power
generated at the new plants, as (i) these were themselves comrnissioned late
and (ii) demand growth, though still at the level projected at appraisal, had,
in the early eighties, fallen below that level which CHESF had used to justify
the basic revisions of its Fifthi Development Program. Nevertheless, the delays
helped to postponie the achievement of one of the objectives of the Bank opera-
tion, the reduction of the trarnsmission iooses.
Procurement
18.       As suggested  by  the  al,ove  discussion ,  procurement  of  the Bank
financed  item.s  proceeded  wi!h.1' notab,le proble,ms. 'tle first IBRD supervision
mission visited CHESF f ifteen month aft:er loan signing, and only  then did the
Bank realize the fulll extent of the delays incurred because_ of the late hiring
of consultants for design  and  preparation  of  tender-  doc2uments  (PCR para.
6.2.2).  At  about  the  same  time, ELETROBRAS, obviously also w-ried by the
delays, had created withirn Its own ranks a  three-man comrmnittee  to assist and
supervise CHESF in its efforts to overcoma the difficulties it was facing,
inter alia in ptocurement, in connection with the personnel turnover related
to the move to Recife. From then on, however, the Latin America Energy
Division thoroughly followed up on procurement, and on two occasions  sent out
its procurement specialist. who, apparently was able to heip.
19.       In connection  withi this  operation, a case could have been made for
sending such a specialist at an  early  stage  t.O  p-ovide  the  Borrower with
advice  on  procurement.  Indeed,  for  any practical purpose, CHESF was a new
borrower and  the ioan  was orLe  of the  la:ger ones  made iri  those times. Of
course, as things turned eut, thIs measure could not have helped CHESF because
the dislocation related to tHe move to Recife  would still  have occurred. But

Disbursements
20.       Disbursements were  much behind  schedule, and this not only because
of the delays in implementation but also because CHESF staff were not
conversant   with   Bank   procedures.   Therefore,  thorough  advice  on  the
disbursement procedures, e.g. in parallel with that on procurement at an early
stage of implementation, might have helped under normal circumstances. In this
specific case, for the reasons set forth in the previous paragraph, the advice
wou d probably not have helped, as many of CHESF's employees responsible for
preparing applications for disbursements changed in the course of the project.
Costs
21.       CHESF has evaluated the  actual  cost  of  the  Bank  project, i.e.,
excluding that  of the  Sobradinho power house, at US$ 963 million at constant
1973 prices. The appraisal team estimated it to US$ 693 million (PCR para.
3.4.1). In view of the drastic changes that the project suffered during
implementatton, this comparison has little meaning. Though it shows only part
of the pictire, the comparison of individual cost items, in particular unit
costs, seems to provide a better basis for a judgment. Attachment 1 gives a
list of such items and the corresponding actual costs as well as apprt.isal
estimates. As the actual figures represent costs in cons¶ant 1973 prices based
on conversion factors fraught with uncertainty, they have to be used with
caution. Nevertheless, the following conclusions appear defendable:
- At Sobradi.aho, the appraisal underestimated the cost of the fill
and of the concrete by about one-fourth to one-third, and that of
the  resettlement  by  nearly   two-thirds.  The   last  discrepancy
originates in  the lack, at the time of appraisal, of a sufficiently
detailed project and of reliable data on the prices CHESF would have
to pc.y for the land used in the project; the differences in the
prices  of  fill  and  concrete,  however,  closely  relate  to  the
addition, during the execution of the dam, of the power plant to the
immediate  construction   program.  This   modification  forced  the
contractor to change his construction plant, ln particular, that for
concreee preparation (PCR paras. 3.5.9 and 3.5.10). Though part of
the difference may come from the fact that, according to .HESF, the
prices of some materials needed for construction (in particular
steel and petroleum products) increased at a rate higher than
average inflat:.on, the bulk of the increase represents part of the
price CHESF hid to pay for quickly but fundairientally adjusting its
short term development program.
- At Paulo Afonso IV, taking into account the above observation on
the effect of inflation on prices of construction materials, costs
evaluated at appraisal and actual costs adjusted to reflect constant
1973 prices are reasonably in line. Only the unit cost of power
house concrete may have been initially underrated, but no more than
some 15%. Attachment 1 also shows that CHESF was able to acquire the
electromechanical  equipment  at  prices   substantially  below  the
appraisal estimate. Ihis was because at the tiiiie procurement took



9
place, there was a buyer's market for large equipment.
- The alterations that affected the transmission program were such
as to limit strongly the possibilities of comparing appraisal and
actual costs. Nevertheless, the figures in Appendix 1 show that
CHESF built the 500 kV line from Paulo Afonso to Recife at about the
estimated cost. CHESF claims that, in general, the equipment cost
for the other items of the project's transmission component was
reasonably in line with the original estimates wherever such
comparisons were possible, but that the local costs, in particular,
land, civil works, and erection had been substantially underrated
(PCR Annex 3.4).
22.       The conclusion is, that the initial  cost estimates  were reasonably
accurate even in the case of Paulo Afonso IV where they had essentially relied
on a feasibility study. However, they proved clearly erroneous for the
resettlement, for which, at appraisal time, there was no satisfactory project
as well as for land and civ.l works associated wis-h the transmission
component.
Economic Justification
23.       The audit  agrees with  the PCR  that there  is no  doubt that Paulo
Afonso IV in combination with the Sobradinho reservoir is still the least cost
solution when compared to an all thermal alternative similar to that assumed
at appraisal (PCR para. 4.2.1). Qualitatively, it is obvious that Paulo Afonso
IV is a nearly ideal hydropower solution as it uses one of the few sites along
the river where a substantial head is naturally available. This can be
supported by a relatively rough computation using the method set forth in
Annex 8 of the Appraisal Report. This method apportions the cost of the
Sobradinho dam and reservoir to the plants downstream in proportion to the
discounted additional firm energy these plants are or will be able to produce
because of discharge regulation at Sobradinho. The PCR shows that the costs at
1973 constant prices are about equal at 160 US$/kW for the 1,500 MW plant
considered at appraisal and the actual 2,460 MW facility. If referred to the
firm output which is 6.2 TWh in both cases, the reference values are 39
million US$/TWh and 64 million US$/Twh respectively. The difference derives
from the fact that the plant as built has a lower utilization than the one
originally foreseen. The above values for Paulo Afonso IV also ,avorably comp-
are with the corresponding figures for Itumbiara, which was built at about the
same time, and which has rather similar size and production characteristics.
These figures are 232 US$/kW (PCR para. 4.2.2) and 71 million US$/TWh
respectively. For the Sobradinho power plant, which was not included in the
Bank project, a rough calculation similar to that carried out above for Paulo
Afonso IV, leads to values in excess of 300 US$/kW and 100 million US$/TWh
respectively. These figures illustrate why commissioning the Sobradinho power
plant was, in CHESF's original long term development plan foreseen only i!' the
early  nineties.  Still,  these   units   represented   the   most  economical
development, as, in 1974, they were the only addition beyond Paulo Afonso IV
that could be commissioned at about the same time as the latter and thus
avoided the shortages CHESF expected on the basis of updated projections



10
demand growth even larger than the 13.7% annually used for project appraisal.
Nevertheless, the high specific costs of the Sobradinho plant again show that
CHESF had to pay a price for having to adjust ad hoc its short term
development program.
Financial Performance
24.       CHESF's financial performance, as that of the entire Brazilian Power
sector is characterized by a very satisfactory period until 1977, followed by
a decline until 1980, because Government did not allow the utilities,
including CHESF, to charge tariffs at levels producing an adequate return on
the rate base as called for in Brazilian law. In 1981 and 1983, Government and
the Bank agreed that the former would allow the power companies to increase
their tariffs in order to improve in the short run their iinancial soundness,
and in the long run to return to the situation the law foresees. This audit
fully agrees with the presentation of the problem and of the attempts to its
solution as set forth in Chapter V of the PCR. Finding the best way out of the
dilemma posed by Government's general wage and price policy established in the
face of the difficult economic situation of the country on the one hand, and
tariffs bringing the power sector back to a sound financial position on the
other hand,  has been th. dominant issue of all recent power sector operations
of the Bank in Brazil. This also applies to loans 1939-, 2564-, 2565- and
2720-BR of which CHESF is a beneficiary.
Project Supervision
25.        In July  1974, a  few weeks after signing the loan, IDB and the Bank
agreed on a division of the supervision work which assigned the Bank the
responsibility of following up on the resettlement in the Sobradinho lake
area, on the transmission component, and on the training program. In view of
the lack of staff in the LAC division responsible for power projects, it was
problematic for the Bank to take the responsibility for the resettlement
component, which was bound to put the institution into a highly visible spot.
In March 1975, after becoming aware that preparation of the resettlement
operation by the Borower fell short of what it could endorse, the Bank, at the
request of the responsible power division, decided to mobilize agricul_ural
staff to  supervise the  rural component of the program and to ask TDB to make
available its resident architect in Brazil to carry out the supervision of the
"urban" component of the program, i.e the relocation of the four small towns
which the rising lake would flood. IDB was agreeable to provide its architect,
who ultimately carried out only two missions, as, at the time of the
agreement,  this  part  of  the  operation  was  already   far  advanced  and,
afterwards, proceeded with relaltively minor problems. The Bank sent out a
first mission to supervise the rural component in May 1975, i.e. as soon as it
became aware of the fact that planning up to that moment had been deficient in
several aspects. From then on, however, Bank sunervision of resettlement was
intensive (seven missions, one about every six months) and, es confirmed inter
alia by CHESF, highly effective (OEDSUP paras. 2.07 to 2.17).



11
26.       Due to lack of staff, supervision in Brazil  of the  power component
of the project started only in September 1975, i.e. fifteen months after loan
signature and two years after project appraisal, the preceding occasion Bank
projects staff had visited CHESF. The responsible division's staff constraint
persisted during the following years and permitted only about one mission per
year. The audit concurs with the conclusion of OED's previous analysis
(OEDSUP, paras. 2.19 to 2.30), supported by CHESF (OEDSUP, para. 2.20) and the
PCR (para. 3.10.4) that the missions were efficient, valuable, but too rare.
This holds in particular when considering that during project execution
several substantial personnel changes, in part associated with CHESF's move
from Rio do Janeiro to Recife, occurred. The intensive follow-vp by letter,
telex,and telephone could not make t'p for the lack of direct -ontact.
II. SUPPLEMENTARY COMMENTS
Project Preparation and Definition
27.       Project preparation  and early project implementation were dominated
by time pressure as the following brief chronology of the main events closely
related to CHESF's Fifth Development Program will show:
- In   1969,   ELETROBRAS   prepared   demand  projections  for  the
northeastern provinces, which the Bank incorporated in the 1973
Economic Report on Brazil. These foresaw growth rates of electricity
consumption of about 20% per year on average over the period 1971-
1985, which would have called for CHESF commissioning some 1000 MW
of capacity by 1976 and some 5000 MW by 1982.
- In 1971, consultants carried out an "Appraisal of the Moxoto and
Paulo Afonso IV Projects" on behalf of ELETROBRAS to establisih for
IDB that the Moxoto Hydroelectric Powerplant (440 MW) was the next
plant that CHESF should build. In the same year 1971, ELETROBRAS and
consultants completed the stady setting the stage for the long term
development of the hydroelectric power potential of the Rio Sao
Francisco  and  defining  that   river   regulation   at  Sobradinho
associated with a 1500 MW power plant at Paulo Afonso IV were the
next development steps CHESF should implement. Both studies used
demand growth rates provided by ELETROBRAS, which had revised the
1969 figures and obtained lower expected increases. They still
projected growth rates of about 16% per year for the period 1971-
1982.
- In 1972, i.e. the year when CHESF first sounded out the Bank to
define whether it might be willing to help finance the Fifth
Development Program, it just started, firnancially assisted by IDB,
to construct the Moxoto plant. Consultants worked on Sobradinho to
prepare the project in such a way that construction could begin in
1973. In September 1972, CHESF hired consultants to carry out a
feas½nility study for the Paulo Afonso IV hydropiant. These



12
submitted  their  technically  rather   scanty  report   within  the
extremely short time of four months.
- In 1973, i.e. the year when the Bank appraised the
project, other consultants began preparing the construc-
tion design for Paulo Afonso IV. In this same year, con-
struction of the Sobradinho dam and the preparatory work
on the site of Paulo Afonso IV started, and the first
energy crisis set in.
- In 1974, CHESF assisted by ELETROBRAS prepared the modified
development  plan  taking  into  account the new Government policies
aimed at coming to grasp with the consequences of the new situation
in the energy field. At the same time it was preparing the
relocation of its headquarters to Recife which took place in 1975.
28.        It is evident from the above set of facts that CHESF, faced  with an
extremely high projected load growth, accelerated project preparation and
implementation to the utmost, as it discarded the alternative, i.e. envisaging
from the start not to meet the demand. Such a procedure, however, introduces
additional costs (e.g., associated with accelerating design and execution and,
as in the case of the Sobradinho power plant, having to chose a solution that,
in the long term program, had low priority), uncertainties (e.g. in terms of
completion dates), and even a measure of risk (e.g. of selecting, on the basis
of a shortcut, a solution that may prove inadequate). It seems reasonable to
expect that the Appraisal Report would reflect some of these points, the more
so, as the project was submitted for Board consideration more than half a year
after the first energy crisis, i.e. at a time when it must have been clear
that this would affect, perhaps not necessarily the Bank project proper, but
certainly the Borrower's further development program. Of this reality that
must have had many and substantial grey areas, the report projects a picture
absolutely clear-cut, without a shadow of uncertainty. Furthermore, the Bank
may or may not have been aware of the impending move of CHESF's headquarters
to Recife, for which ELETROBRAS asked CHESF to prepare the final plans in June
1974, i.e., a few days before Board presentation of the project. If the Bank
knew about this inmminent development, the Appraisal Report should have
reflected this, as such a relocation could not take place without disruption,
and any disruption was bound to have negative consequences for CHESF's
exceedingly tight *rogram. If the Bank was not aware of the planned move, this
suggests unsatisfactory communication between the Bank and one of its largest
borrowers  precisely  at  the   time  this   borrower  was   supposed  to  get
implementation of the Bank project started.
29.        In retrospect,  the decision to define the complex consisting of the
Sobradinho dam, the Paulo Afonso IV power plant, and associated transmission
facilities as the Bank project, was undoubtedly correct. However, to achieve
the Bank's original, limited objective of assisting CHESF in mobilizing as
much additional foreign funds as possible in the form of parallel financing, a
less comprehensive project definition could also have been possible. At the
time, this might have been even desirable as the responsible projects division
lacked the substantial human resources required for the supervision  in



13
particular, that of the highly sensitive resettlement -peration. Also in
retrospect, it was fortunate that the Bank defined the project as globally,
and got involved to the extent, it actually did, as its contribution to the
resettlement became extremely valuable. But, the commitment was not really
planned and was therefore associated with high risks which the Bank seems to
have fully realized only several months after both, the lending operation and
the agreement with IDB on the division of supervision work, had been signed.
Technical Operating Efficiency
30.       As set forth in para.5 above,  three of  the implicit  objectives of
the loan were (i) to improve CHESF's capability in construction, operation,
and maintenance of extra-high voltage facilities, (ii) to  reduce transmission
losses, and (iii) to reduce the frequency of system faults. CHESF carried out
the planned training in operation and maintenance aimed at reaching the first
above objectKve. To finance the program, it used funds provided by ELETROBRAS
rather than those from the Bank earmarked to this effect. There is no way to
measure the success of this training. However,it may have, to a small extent,
contributed to reducing t,ansmission losses from over 13% of energy sent out
in 1972 to 6.3% in 1982 (PCR, Annex 3.9). In the following two years, the
losses fell further to 5.8% (Appraisal Report for Loan 2564-BR). This is still
substantially higher  than the 4.0% target set at appraisal, but compares with
the new goal of 5.5% set in connection with Loan 2564-BR. This goal that takes
into account that under the present difficult financial conditions CHESF had,
and will have, to defer some operationally highly desirable but non-essential
investments. This  is likely  to increase  rather than decrease the losses. In
the course of project implementation, the reduction of losses suffered a
substantial delay because construction of the lines and substations included
in the program was also late (para.17 above). The deferment of investments
referred to above has also stopped the improvements in the recurrence of
faults. However, it should be noted that, Lintil now, there are no signs of
deterioration, either.
Development of Settlements along Lake Sobradinho
31.       During the  audit, a member of OED travelled to Sooradinho, where he
also visited the shore of the lake to the northwest of the dam and Casa Nova,
some 40 km from Sobradinho, one of the new townships created in connection
with the resettlement  program.  According  to  CHESF  and  local  people this
township has, today, more than five times as many inhabitants as just after
resettlement. It appears at least modestly thriving, with a new building of
the Banco do Brasil, many shops ranging from a cabinet maker and a vendor of
agricultural tools and implements to a modest supermarket. Most people work on
the surrounding farms growing tomatoes, beans, grapes, etc. Indeed, though
several Bank reports state that the soils around the lake are of poor or
indifferent quality, several irrigation schemes have cropped up between
Sobradinho and Casa Nova and around the latter. For some of these, Government
provided the pumps to lift the water from the lake to the fields. Most,
however, seem to be private, installed and managed by enterpreneurs who came
to the area from as far as Sao Paulo. One such operation, visited during the



14
audit, includes some 50 ha of grape, yielding, according to the responsible
specialist, 2.5 t per ha. Allegedly, the situation and development is
similarly encouraging in and around two of the three other townships.
Representatives of CHESF also  reported  that  fishery  in  the  lake  area is
thriving. Therefore,  with all  due caution,  it would seem that the new towns
are at least a modest success and form the nucleus for a relatively strong
development. However,  this may  be little  consolation for those who suffered
the trauma of the original resettlement.  Consequently, as  CHESF hrs  to plan
for the aftermath of another resettlement, in the Jtaparica lake area, some 30
km upstream from Paulo Afonso, it should be of particular interest to the
utility to understand thoroughly what has happened in Sobradinho. It should
therefore mobilize t e socio-economists required (i) to analyze the reasons
for -  in CHESF's  own terms  - the  unexpected development, and (ii) to study
what happened to the originally resettled families and to what extent they
share  in  the  development.  This  seems  the more important as, according to
CHESF, the  utility  has  been  accused,  in  connection  with  the Sobradinho
project, of leaving the resettled population on its own too early. It seems
that the Bank should also be interested iii such a study.
Parallel Financing
32.        The main explicit objective of the loarn was  for the  Bank to assist
CHESF in securing the maximum amount possible of additiona1 external financing
in form of parallel loans from supplier countries.  Ar the  time of appraisal,
CHESF and the two baniks set aside the turbinres, the generators, the step-up
transformers, and  the  500  kV  circuit  breakers  for  the  Paulo  Afonso IV
powerplant as equipment mlost attractive for parallel financing dS these items
allegedly wete either not made, or riot made at a competitLve price  in Brazil.
They estimated the cost of such equipment two amount to USS 82.3 million, of
which  CHESF  would  have  to  finance  itself  abotut  US$  10.4   million  of
downipayments, leaving for parallel financing US$ 71.9 million (AR para. 4.15).
However, the biddings resulted in CHESF awarding a large part of the contracts
to Brazilian  companies, mostly  subsidiaries of well known foreign suppliers.
Therefore, only  the  pair  of  such  contracts  tbat  covered  imported items
qualified  for  parallel  financing,  whic h  finailly a!'iouLnted to only US$ 31.5
million. In complement to the PCR (para. 3.4.2), the audit concludes that, as
CHESF has  awarded the above contracts in accordance with the rules agreed for
the parallel financing, there is little  that  the  Bank  could  have  done to
mobilize more  external financing  of this type, as for any practical purpose,
there was no fturther equipment that would have  attracted interest  of foreign
suppliers under the above rules. It was unfortunate that the j,udgment on the
Brazilians'  ability  to  compete  for  the  contracts  on  the  equipment was
erroneous  and  led  to  an  estimate  of  additiona1 external funding for the
project that proved too optimistic.
Sustainability of Benefits
3.3.      As in most power prnjectt , the economic :.nalvsl-  of the Sobradinho-
Paulo A.fonso  IV 'roiect  uses r-venues frolml sales a; a v)pcxy foL the economic
beniefits of tre d"o0ecr ni t1'..r@  r. ,-i t,-,t        -. tV ', f1'll p-.cture. Further,



15
sustainability of power project benefits is largely that of the utility and of
the sector. Therefore, ir. the present context, this attribute has to be
ascertained in a rather qualitative way, through the factors that affect it.
The following sets forth such factors:
- The political and economic  envi onment, of  which the  former has
been rather stable and the latter has seriously deteriorated in the
course of project implementation but is improving again, seems to
return to helping sustain the sector and the benefits from its
proiects.
- In  the  past,  the   institutional  setup   of  the   sector  was
characterized    by    progressive   nationalization   and   growing
centralization  with  the  aim  to  combine  as  mnuch  as  possible,
regicnalization of  operations with  countrywide optimization of the
resources used. As the Federal Government takes most of the
important decisions affecting the power sector, these decisions
often reflect macroeconomic concerns  and  policies.  In  the recent
past, this has meant that, in order to limit inflation, Goverment
did not allow the power utilities to adjust their tariffs to a level
perml.tting them to earn the 10% on their rate base ("remunerable
invesvm(:nt`) called for by law. This situation, of course, was, and
is, also  detrimental to CHESF. If not corrected, it could seriously
endanger the utility's ability  to continue  generating the benefits
expected from  the  project. As an institution, the utilit), after a
serious deterioration in connection with the  move to  Recife, whlich
irnduced drastic personnel turnover, has regained stability at a good
standard, a further basis of sustalnab4lity.
- CHESF keeps the project facilities in good order.  Thus, only lack
of funds could represent a danger from this side.
- Financial viability, a further factor affecting sustainability of
benefits is closely  associated  to  the  tariff  issue  referred to
above. In the past seven years, all corrective measures taken on the
tariff side did not allow the utilities, and among them CHESF, to
earn the return set by law. In accordance with the appzaisal reports
for the latest Bank operations in the sector, the Government's and
the Bank's aim is to reach the legal level of earnings by 1990 and
in the meantime to compensate the shortfall of revenues in t.he
coverage of the trinmned down investment program mainly by Government
equity contributions.
Collaboration with IDB
34.       Ihe collaboration between IDB  and the  Bank was  based on  the fact
that I1DB as the traditional financier of CHESF, for whicl. it had helped
finance the Fourth  Development  Program  including  the  Moxoto hydroelectric
power plant, was not in a position to provide in conrnection with CHESF's Fifth
Program s.n input  sufficient  to  reduce  CHESF's  need  for  further external
financing to a reasonable level. This induced the Governmoint t.-o ask whether



16
the Bank, together with IDB, could participate in the financing of this latter
program.
35.       Whereas at the country program  level,  the  collaboration  seems to
have worked smoothly, at the project level rome difficulties occurred. Indeed,
the Joint appraisal led to neither side being entirely satisfied with the
results obtained, because, most of the time, the representatives of the two
banks had to go over the same ground with their Brazilian counterparts, but
each group with different emphasis on tne various aspects covered due to thc
different operational guidelines under which the groups were working. Only in
a few cases did the arrangement work as originally planned, making it possible
that one team did the work alone and the other took over the results.
36.       Dividing the supervision between the two banks was  a sound decision
and it worked properly (OEDSUP, para. 4.03). A closer collaboration in this
field could only have been possible at the cost of substantial Aeviations from
the respective procedures of the parties. However, this separation of
supervision activities had the effect that, ultimately, neither bank really
lookted anymore at the project in its entirety but concentrated on the part
which it supervised. This is natural because a reasonable interpretation of
the obligation to inform the other part automatically leads to a limited
interchange of documents and hence to an imbalance as to the overview over the
project. But then, what did the joint operation bring that two separate
operations associated with appropriate consultations between the banks would
not have brought? Apparently little under the rules used. Therefore, it seems
crucial for further joint operations in the power seLttr and  possibly also in
other fields, that first the rules of operation of the two banks in connection
with the specific project be set and analyzed. On the oasis oc this analysis,
the two entities should be able to decide what is more convenient to the
Borrower and the two banks, a joint operation or two individual operations,
that still can be closely coordinated between the two banks.
III. CONCLUSIONS
37.       Overall,  the   project  qualifies  as  a  success,  though  not  an
unmitigated one. CHESF satisfactorily completed it. However, some components
suiffered long delays. Drastic project changes most of them consequences of new
planning associated with the first energy crisis in 1973 and higher load
growths than projected at the time the construction was decided. Thus, the
early construction of the Sobradinho power plant, though it was not considered
an addition to the project, affected dam construction and cost. Then, in Paulo
Afonso IV, six uniits of 410 MW (2,460 MW) replaced four units of 375 MW (1,500
MW) implying substantial modification of design and cost increases due to
larger size of structures. Further, CHESF redesigned a large part of the
transmission system. This caused the longest delays in the project. Total
estimated and actual project costs are not comparable because of the many and
important changes that occrured, but most unit costs and some global
expenditures are comparable. Large differences appear in the resettlement
component that the appraisal u:iderevaluated mainly because of deficient



17
planning, and the fill and concrete cost at Sobradinho dam because of the
project modifications.
38.       Bank project appraisal had three  weaknesses.  Fl.rst,  it  failed to
state clearly the objectives of the Bank in the context of this project and
the way these objectives were to be achteved. Second, it was essentially based
on feasibilty level studies, of which, in particular that for Paulo Afonso IV
was rather sketchy on the technical side. Experiences like the one with this
project were at the root of the change in Bank practice which called for
projects to be appraised at a more advanced design stage. Third, the report
did not reflect the uncertainties and the risks which must have been
perceivable at the time. Therefore, it projected a picture of the project
that made it appear far more clear-cut and well prepared than it actually was.
In spite of the above, the project turned out to be well justified.
39.       The PCR (para. 7.2.)  concludes that  a major  lesson to  be learned
from the resettlement component of the project is that planning resettlement
is as important as planning the hydroelectric power plant and should be dealt
with accordingly, which, in the initial stage of the Sobradinho case, it was
not. To this, the audit wishes to add that planning for resettlement mostly
deals with people and calls for adjusted planning methods usually implying a
strong participation of the population to be affected by the project. Such
planning is likely to take more time than that of a physical facility like a
power plant. But even under the best circumstances, the uncertainty about the
outcome is likely to be much larger than that associated with an essentially
technical project. This audit also agrees with the PCR's conclusion (para.
7.2) that in the case of large scale resettlement, the possibility of carrying
it out as a separate -but not independent- project should be considered.
However, each case should be evaluated on its own merits, because it is not
necessarily so chat the status of a senarate project helps assure appropriate
levels of Government funding and interest (PCR, para. 7.2). If resettlement
becomes a separate project, there must be an authority closely coordinating
the resettlement with the project component that causes the latter. Further,
the entity whose project creates the need for the resettlement should not be
relieved from the ultimate responsibility for the operation, namely carrying
out its own part of the project as agreed when resettlen.2nt was separated, and
providing funds to meet the costs that can reasonably be associated with the
project component that calls for the operation.
40.       Bank supervision started too late. On the resettlement component, it
was able to catch up quickly with development and was to the end sufficient
and very effective. On the power component, due to the lack of resources, it
remained less than optimal. By this, the Bank possibly missed opportunities to
contribute to institution building, in particular, when CHESF moved its
headquarters to Recife and therefore had to refill many positions.
41.       The  declared  objective  of  the  project  of  mobilizing  as  much
additional external financing as possible, was achieved insofar as there would
not have been any more items suitable for parallel financing than those thy
IDB ard the Bank had set aside for the purpose. However, the parallel
financing operation yielded only US$ 31.5 million instead of US$ 71.9 million



18
estimated at appraisal because Brazilian firms won more of the contracts
foreseen for parallel financing than the appraisal had anticipated.
42.       CHESF's financial performance was very good  during the  first three
years of the project, but, afterwards, together with that of the other
entities of the sector, seriously deteriorated. It has not entirely recovered
since, mainly because Government did not permit the tariff adjustments
foreseen in the law. However, in connection with the latest operations in the
sector, the Bank expects the sector and its entities to
recover their financial soundness by 1990.
43.       There  appears  to  be  no  cause  for  doubt  that  the project was
essential to CHESF and to the northeastern provinces of Brazil. The PCR does
not recalculate the equalizing discount rate because of a lack of sufficiently
detailed information on the further steps of CHESF's development. However, all
the signs indicate that the Lake Sobradinho/Paulo Afonso IV complex still is
the least cost solution when compared  to an  all thermal  alternative for all
discount rates in the neghbourhood of the opportunity cost of capital. The
estimated rate of return of 13%, down from 23.3% at appraisal, reflects higher
costs than expected and lower tariffs used as a proxy for the benefits. But it
is still higher than the opportunity  cost of  capital in  Brazil estimated to
range between 10 and 12 % (PCR, para. 4.2.3).

BRAZIL
PAULO AFONSO IV (PA IV) HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT (1008-BR)
COMPANHIA HIDRO ELETRICA DO SAO FRANCISCO (CHESF)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1  Bank Participation in Sector Financing.
1.1.1     Since 19)49, the World Bank (IBRD) has made 40 loans to the power
sector of Brazil, amounting to US$3.06 billion equivalent.  During this time,
the focus of IBRD power loans has changed.  Prior to 1976, most power
borrowers were either the increasingly efficient federal companies (such as
Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco - CHESF) or 'ihe better organized
state and/or private power companies; and most Bank loains helped to finance
the construction of hydroelectric plants and associated transmission
facilities in the Southeastern and Southern regions. Since 1976, there has
been a reorientation of Bank lending to include lending to some of une less
well organized state companies and to support transmission and distributLon
(including rural electrificati.on) projects in all regions of Brazil.
1.1.2     CHESF har, benefited from four IBRD loans (Annex 1.1).  The first
loan (25-BR; 1950; US$15.0 millicn) helped to finance the Paulo Afcnso I
hydroelectric project.  The proceeds of the first loan have beern completely
repaid.  The second loan (1008-BR; 1974; US$81.0 million) helped to finance
the Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric project (PA IV), which is the subject of
this report.  05H53';,   is benefitng   from loan 1939-BR (made to Centrais
,letricas brasLiLeiras, S.A. - ELETROBRAS)), of which US$22 million is being
oeloaned to CHESF to finance the purchase of equipment for supervision,
control, and tele-comrmunicatioris. CHESF is also benefiting from a recently
approved loan to ELETROBAS (2564-BR; US$400 millicn), which will relend
TJS$1 15.2 mTllion  to CHESJF to help finan( e high-priority transmiissicn
facilities.
1.2  Sector Organization
1.2.1     As a result of progressive nationalization and growing
centralization over the forty years ending in 1974, the Brazilian power
sector evolved into a relatively compact structure cf federal and state
utilities. Decree No. 68,024 of June 7,1967 established the legal,
technical, and administrative structure of the power sector and defined the
structure as consisting of the National Departmrient of Water and Electric
Energy (DNAEE), ELETROBRAS, and the various federal, state, municipal and
private concess.onaivres, ali under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines
and Energy (MmE).
1 .2. 2    , DNAEE has been performing regulatory functions, includrig the
granting of licenses fo r hydr:electric sites, asslgn Lng co .cess.on areas,



23
setting tariffs, and approving sector expansion plans.  Since 19851, the
authority of DNAEE to set tariffs and to approve expansion plans has been
reduced by the effective transfer of final authority to the Secretariat of
Plannirng, (SEPLAN), whir.h has been reviewing and approving tariff increases
and investment plans wLthin a broader poli-cy context.
1.2.3       ELETROBRAS, a mixed economy corporation, whose principal
shareholder is the Government, has been operating as an executi-ng agency
under the jurisdiction of the  4MK and in coordination with DNAEE and SEPLAN.
ELETROBRAS has been performing the functions of: (a)  utility holding
company for those power u.tl;.ties where the Government has acquired financial
control; (b) i.nvestment banker by admi.nistertilg  pablic funds tar use by its
subsidiaries and by state  power compani.es; and (c) coordi.nator of the
external borrowing efforts of the individual power comQpani.es.  ELETROBRAS hlas

of major generation and transmission companies; and an operational
co-ordination fanction t'hirougs¢h the C'o-ordintintg IOroups for Interconnected

1 .3.3     The financial planning, budgeting. and reporting systemis of CHESF
are satisfactory.  Also satisfactory are the accounting and billing systems
and the internal audit group.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1        Origin of the Project
2.1.1      In 1969, a committee of the NlME undertook the coordination of
studies for the expansion of power generation capacity in the Northeast
region. On the basis of the preliminary results of these studies, which
showed a rapid, expected growth in the regional demand for electricity (about
13.7% annually for the period 1973-1982), CHESF and the committee concluded
that the only way to meet this demand through 1986, outside of a thenaal
(non-least-cost) solution, would be the progress-ive hydroelectric development
of the Sao Francisco River which runs through the Northeast. The proposed
development program would consist of construction of a large regulating dam
at Sobradinho, complemented by the progressive construction of hydroelectric
gernerating plants at Moxoto (400 MW), PA IV (1900 MW), and Xingo (4000 MW),
and followed by the installation at arn opportune tirme of generating capacity
at the foot of the Sobradinho dam.
2.2        IBRD Participation
2.2.1      During June--July 1972, ELETROBRAS, in behalf of CHESF,  initiated
discussions with the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) and the TERD
concerning their interest in providing financing for, respectively, PA IV and
associated transm-ission capacity.  The IDB was already furnishing financing
for the Moxoto plant.
2.2.2      In addition to the power plant and transmission lines, the project
would include construction of the Sobradinho darn (located about 470 km
upstream of the Paulo Afonso falls).  she project cost was expected to armount
to US$514 million. Concerning sources of financing, ELETROBRAS expected
that: (i) CHESF, with the help of ELETROBRAS. would finance the darn and the
local currency cost of the other project components; (il) IDB would finance
most of the foreign cost of the equipment for the powar station; (iii) IBRD
would finance maost of the foreign cost of the equipment for the transmission
lines; and (iv) bilateral agencies would finance the foreign cost of
equipment not covered by the IDB and IBRD loans. Both Banks expressed
interest in providing financing, provided that the completed feasibility
report justified the proposed project.
2.2.3      In February 1973, the IBRD explained to CHESF tnat a major IBRD
objective in financing power projects in Brazil was to assist borrowers in
their efforts to marshal parallel credits from the export-financing
institutions of equipment-supplying countries. With the agreement of the
IDB, the IBRD also explained that the two Banks would finance only the cost
of equipment not: (a)  nanufactured in Brazil at competitive prices; or (b)
financed wich parallel credits offered on reasonable terms.  given the
expectation that the IBRD and iDB loans would be of approximately equal size,



25
the IBRD indicated that it would consider R loan amount corresponding, more
or less, to the following formula:   the foreign cost of the proposed project
minus the estimated value of goods financed with parallel cred'ts and minus
the estimated value of goods financed by the IDB.
2.2.4      In March-April l973, CHESF provided the Banks with copies of the
completed feasibility study which Justified the project as the least-cost
solution to meeting regional power requirements. In May 1973, an IBRD
preappraisal mission visited Brazil to review the preparation of financial
projections and the proposed resettlement plans. These plans were required
because of the expected consequences resulting from the construction of the
Sobradinho dam. Upstream, a huge reservoir (about 30 billion cubic meters)
would flood the lands of s,ome 9,700 families.  Downstream, at the mouth of
the river, the regularization of the flow of the Sao Francisco would flood
the rice fields of about f1,000 families. There were other possible
consequences in the areas of health and ecology.  Substantial ecological,
resettlement and flood-control efforts would be required to minimize the
possible adverse consequences.  Annex 2.1 discusses these efforts and the
compliance of the Government and CHESF with relevant covenants.  Due to
delays and plannirg errors, the resettlement program at Sobradinho involved
hardship for the displaced populatilon.
2.3        Project Appraisal
2.5.1      In July-Autgust  975, tne Banks 'oi.ntly apprai sed the project.  A
second LBRD mission visited Brazi.l in October-November 1973 to review revised
project-cost esttmates aind finnarncial prrJections.  During and after
appraisal, the l3anks pa-d particular attention to the issues of project cost,
loan size, paralLel finan.clng, t! crc   i c( jtst f.cat; n, and resettlement
plans.
2.3.2      The IBR3   rationale for cons3deri r- the proposed loan, other than
broad country corislieratiorns, was sulpporting t e Oovernrient's developmen,
efforts for the Northeast and help ng CliE3F to sec.are the maximum possible
external (bilateral) financLng ccnsistent with i.ts requirements.  Accord in g
to the feasibility sttudy which the  .BRID accepted, the project was the
least-cost sol,tion to me. tng regional power requirements.

Based on more complete data, Bank staff re-estimated the project cost at
US$692.6 million (para. 2.2.2), with a foreign cost, direct and indirect,
of US$294.2 million.  These cost estimates were based on studies which had
not progressed beyond the feasibility stage. The above cost components for
a, b, and c include forecast costs for engineering and supervision.
2.4.2      The following were the expected financing arrangements:
(i)  Bilateral agencies and suppliers would provide financing amounting
to US$71.9 million 1/ to cover the cost of 500 kV circuit breakers
for the transmi.ssion systems, generators, turbines, and step-up
transformers at PA IV (para. 2.2.2).   CHESF and ELETROBRAS
successfuilly made arrangements for this financing.
(ii) The IDB loan (US$84.8 million) would finance the purchase of
miscellaneous equipment at the PA IV substation, equipment for the
500 kV substations, part of the equipment for the 230 kV
substations, and engineering for the IDB-financed portion of the
transmission works.
(iii) The IBRD loan (US$81.0 million) would finance the puirchase of 500
kV and 230 kV transmission line equipment, some of the equipment
for 230 kV substations, miscellaneous equipment, training, and
engineering for the IBRD-financed portion of the transmission
works.
(iv)  CHESF and ELETROBRAS would supply financing for the remaining
foreign-currency costs (US$56.5 million) and all Local-currency
(osts (US$398.4).
2.4.3      it was expected that procurement of IBRD-financed equipment would
follow IBRI( Guidelines, with local manufacturers being given a 15% margin of
preference.  It also was expected that procuiremetnt of IDB-financed equipment
and services would follow guidelines which called for competitive bidding
among eligible countries with a 15% margin of preference for local
manufacturers in accordance with a Government-IIDB agreement. Procurement of
equipment financed under parallel financing arrangements would be subject to
international competitive bidding among suppliers according to Brazilian
bidding regulations.
2.5        Negotiations and Loan Approval
2.5.1      No major problems delayed negotiations for the IBRD loan (April
29-May 7, 1984).  Board presentation occurred on June 4, 1974 followed by
loan signing on June 17, 1974. Loan 1008-3R amounted to US$D1.0 million; the
term was twenty years, including 4-1/2 years grace.  The interest rate was
7.257O; the commitment fee, 3/4%, of 1%.
2.D.2      The IDB approved its loan for the project on D)ecember 20, 1973.
Ll)B loan signing coincided with loan signing for the IBRI) loan.

financing at Us5>72'.u) miLlion.



Z7
2.6        Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
2.6.1      Aninex 2.2 sets forth the major financial covenants of the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements.  After 1977, Government tariff decis:ons resulted in
low revenue levels for CHESF and non-compliance with respect to the
covenanted rate of remuneration 2/. The IBRD and the Government reached
new, sector-wide tariff agreemenTs which superceded the covenants negotiated
in earlier loan agreements. Chapter 5 sets forth details on the tariff
policy of the Government and its impact on the finances of CHESF. Annex 2.1
discusses in detail the compliance of the Government and CHESF with respect
to covenants dealing with ecology and resettlement.
III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1        Effectiveness
3.1.1      Effectiveness of the IBRD Loan Agreement depended on CHESF's
fulfilling all of the conditions precedent to the initial disbursement inder
the IDB Loan Agreement, including the hirnrg of consultants for the execution
and supervision of cer,ain aspects of the Project.  Because CH.ESF delayed the
hiring of consultants, the IBRD Loan Agreement did not become effective unt-il
April 16, 1975, four months after the originally scheduled date of
effectiveness and ten moniths after the date of loan signing.
3.2        IBRD and IDB Sueision Responsibilities
3.2.1      The IDB and the IBRD signed a Memorandum of Agreement one month
after tne date for loan sigrilng (July 19f4).  Wi.thout iimi ting the right of
each Barnk to supervise, the Agreemrent completely di.vi.ded tne sup'vis.io
labor to allow each institution to (arry out its sapervi_siori work
independently.  It also retained references to  oi.rLt supervision mt-Sions  'to
the extent possible" an(d provid.ed for the exchanlge of information "which  iay
be common interest". It was reasonable to expect that the staff of both
Banks would observe this Agreement in the 1ight of their respecti.ve judgement
on events.
3.2.2      The agreemernt assigned supervisi.on responsibili.t lea between the twc
Banks, as follows:

of the rate of return by relating net income for the subject year to the
average of net fixed assets in operation at the beginni.ng and end of the
corresponding year.  The revenue covenants of IBRD loan agreements with
Brazilian power borrowers are cnnsi.stent with l3razil-an Iegi.slation,
which calls for a reminerable rate base i.ncl.uding elements eithrer

3.3        Actual and Forecast Data on Project Execution and Cost
3.3.1      Annex 3.1 compares the actual and forecast cost Of the project and
sources of financing.  Annexes 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 compare the actual and
revised costs on a detailed basis of major components of the project: the
Sobradinho (lam, PA IV, an(d transmission system.  Annex 3.5 compares actual
and forecast completion dates for the transrriission system.  Annex 3.6 sets
forth the deflation factors for converting current costs of the project into
constant costs.  Annexes 3.7 and 3.8 compare, respectively, actual and
forecast annual disbursements and actual and forecast allocation of the loan
proceeds.  Annex 3.9 sets forth key operating indicators.  The following
paragraphs disciuss the informatiojn contairce  in the above annexes.
7.4        Project Cost
3.4.1      According to CHESF, the firnal cost of the project in current prices
(excluding finance charges) was US$1,415.9 million with a d,irect foreign cost
component amounting to US$174.7 million, as compared with the appraisal
forecast of 'JS$692.6 million.  in constant 1973 prices, the actual cost of
the project amounted to US$962.6 million as compared with the appraisal
forecast of UJS$611.8 million, an increase of 57.3%.  The actual and appraisal
costs are not fully comparable.because: (i) appraisal cost forecasts were
preliminary -- that is, they were based on feasibility studies, not detailed
designs, as required by current IBRD practice; (ii) CHESF introduced major
conceptual changes into the project in response to new circumstances (see
Sections 3.5 to 3.7); and (iii) there were differences between the accounting
system of CHEOF and the IBRD appraisal cost estimating techniques
(see para. 3.4.3).  CHESF consulted fully with the Bank concerning tnese
changes, including obtaining IBRD approval as required under the loan
agreement (Section 5.05).
3.4.2      Including finance charges, the final cost of the project was
US$1,8j3.5 million with a foreign cost component of IJM$il28.1 milion as

parallel financi.ng amounted to only Ul$'51 .5 million, less than half of what
was expected aat; appraisal, US$71 .9 mi]llion.  As TBRD files and the final
project repcort of CHESF contain virtually no commentary or other evidence on
the low level of' actual. foreign parallel financing,  .t is not possible to

1973 pr?'es amounted .. US$285.8 million as compared wi.th the appraisal
forecast of 'JS$168.3 million, an inciease of 70.1%.   Major factors
contributing to the cost increase included:
(i)  the increased scope of the relocation program (Annex 2.1>)
(ii)  major design changes to the Sobradinho dam (para. 3.5.3 to 3.5.6);
(iii)  chaniges to construction methods used at Sobradinho due to supply
and time constraints resulti.ng from major design changes
(para. 3.5.9); and

30
Item (ii) above was responsible for additional excavation and additional
materials; and contributed to higher costs.  Item (iii) -as responsible for
the substitution of unrefrigerated concrete for refrigerated concrete. This
substitution also contributed to higher costs. Annex 3.2 sets forth details
on quantities of materials and costs of the Sobradinho dam and relocation
programs
3.5.2      Construction of the civil works for the Sobradinho dam began in
January 1973 and continued until March 1979.  Filling of the reservoir
started in February 1977 as compared with the date expected at appraisal of
January 1977.
3.5.3      CHESF introduced substantial changes into the design of the dam and
related structures which, as ronceived at appraisal, included only river-flow
regulation works and a lock system for navigation.  These changes did not
constitute a change in the description of the project.
5.5.4     The first change was to move (by 50 meters) the axis of the dawi and
the lock systerm because of poor geology at the original locatiorn. As
mentioned before (para. 2.4.1), the design and cost forecast at appraisal
were based on feasibility-stage studies, not studies at the detailed design
stage; and the feasitbility studies reflected geological investigations at the
dam site which proved tc be insuffi.cient.
3.5.5      The second major design change resulted from the decision to
advance the date for constructing and completing a power station (6 x 175 MW)
at Sobrandinho to coincide with tniat of the dam (para. 3.5.2). At appraisal,
it was expected that tne power holuse woull be commtssioned irn the early
1990's (para. 2.1.1).  The reasons for the decioilon to advance the date of
construction are set forth in paras. 3..7 1 tc 13.5.i?.. The power house was
never part of the defined project, but its constructio)n led to a complication
of supply and construction problems at the dam (para. 3.5.9 to 3.'.10).  The
first generating? unit at .,obradinho be^an ri elivering power to the ;HESF
system in December !1979.
3.5.6     The third rnajor change was to construct a water intake structure to
accomodate the Massangano irrigation proJect.  The Instituto Nacional de
Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria (INCRA) had responoibility for the irrigation
project.
3.5.7     The decisioln to advance the date for constructing the power house
at Sobradinho (and to increase the generating capacity at PA IV to 6 x 410
MW) reflected a combination of national strategic and market considerations.
The market considerations included higher-than-expected market demand (18.1%
p.a. instead of 13.7%, as anticipated for the period 1972-1982), plus the
need to ensure supply for ELETRONORTE until commissioning (in 1982 or 1985)
of the Tucurui hydroelectric power plant.  ELETRONORTE expected to receive
Dower and energy through an interconnecticn transmission line to serve the
load growth in the Belera area.  The higher-than-expected market growth was
set forth in a plannilng stusy prepared by >-"F and conrfirmed in a planning
study prepared by I.LHTIhOBRAS  n the supply conditions of the whole
interconnected system. IBRI)  3taff rev; ( we'd and found reasonable these
studies.



31
3.5.8      The national strategic consideration was meeting future  energy
requirements from local sources. This consideration resulted from tlle advent
of the oil crisis (1973). The additional hydroelectric generating capacity
at Sobradinho (and at PA IV) would elimir.ate thermal generation (gas
turbines) within the CHESF system.  CHESF consulted fully with the IBIED on
the above changes.
3.5.9      The need for changing construction methods resulted from the
decision to advance construction and ccinpletion of the powerhouse to coincide
with that of the dam (para. 3.5,5). This decision involved nearly doubling
the production of refrigerated concrete required for the dam and the
powerhouse over what had been expected at appraisal for the dam. Further,
the schedule for producing this increase had to be consistent with the
deadline for completing the dam (1979).
3.5.10     It proved impossible to reconcile production and scheduling
problems, as plant capacity at Sobradinho for producing refrigerated concrete
could not be increased.  However, there was no comparable restraint on the
production capacity for unrefrigerated concrete, which was manufactured with
expensive crushed aggregate.  The consul-.ants recommended that CHESF not
layer refrigerated and unrefrigerated concrete.  In these circumstances,
CHESF chose to substitute unrefrigerated conrcrete for refrigerated concrete,
a decision which led to a costly change in constructilon methodls but which
9ermitted CHESF to complete the dam and the powerhouse on schedule.

for common excavation, rock excavation, and concrete.
3.6        PA TV Powe. Staticn:  Cost, Timing, and Changes
;.6.1    F,xcludi.ng the cost for engineering, si_pervision, and
administration, the actual cost (in current prices) of the power station was
US$383.3 milliion as compared with the aporaisal forecast of US$202.5
million.  In constant 1973 prices, the cost of PA IV amounted to TJSS254.0
million as compared with the appraisal forecast of US$171 .8 million, an
increase of about 47.O'g.  Due to major changes at PA IV, actual and i> recast
costs are not fully comparable. Most of the cost increase in ccnstant prices
was due to the decision to increase the generating capacity cf the power
station.  Paragraph 3.5.5 sets forth the reasons for this decision, which
led to the use of additional quantities of equipment and materials, and
additional excavation.  Table 3.1 (page 11) compares actual and forecast
quantities and unit prices for common excavati.on, rock excavation, and
concrete.  Annex 3.3 sets forth further details onl the cost increase of the
power station.
3.6.2      Prelimi.nary work on the PA IV power stati.on began in 1)75.
Commissioning of the first generating unit occurred in November  Y979, about a
year behind schedule, and the last generating unit was commissionedL in 1982,
as scheduled.  The late comminssicning of the first iunit was no>t a
constraining suipply factor for the CHESF system.

3.7       Transmission Component: Cost, Timing, and Changes
3.7.1     Excluding costs for engineering, supervision, and construction, the
actual cost of the transmission component in current prices amounted to
US$350.1 million as compared with the appraisal forecast of US$202.6
million. In constant 1973 prices, the cost of the transmission component
amounted to US$214.2 million as compared with the appraisal forecast of
US$171.8 million, an increase of about 24.8%.  Given the substantial changes
in the planning and design of the system, the actual and appraisal cost data
are not comparable. According to CHESF, at appraisal there were substantial
underestimations of costs with respect to land.
3.7.2    At appraisal, CHESF expected to complete construction of the
transmission component by December 1977 in anticipation of commissioning of
the first generating unit at PA IV, expected in 1978.  The 500 kV line to
Recife entered into operations in March 1980, about three months after
commissioning or the first generating unit at PA IV (December 1979).
Giver, the (lelayed commissioning date of the first unit at PA IV, the later
operational date of the 500 kV line was of less significance than it would
have been if CHESF had adhered to its original generation commissioning
schedule.
3.7.3    The 230 kV lines became operational at various dates between 1977
and 1982, as did all but one of the substatlions.  About 85% of the
transmission component was completed by che end of 1981.  Late cormpletion of
the transmission component partly accounted for the delayed improvernent of
transmission losses (Annex 3.9).  According to CHESF, completion of the
transmission component did not occur intil March 1985.



33
3.7.4    The most important factors delaying completion of the transnission
component included:
(i)    substantial headquarter staff turnover (80%) during 1975 due
to the move of the executive offices from Rio de Janeiro to
Recife. CHESF recruited qualified new staff during 1976 but
not without suffering long delays in procurement, planning,
and design activities;
(ii)   substantial planning changes due to the decisions to advance
the construction date of the power station at Sobrandinho and
to increase the generating capacity of the PA IV power
station;
(iii)  design changes due to new economic studies and planning
changes; and
(iv)     procurement delays (after 1982) affecting heaving
transportation equipment and transmission line compensation
equipment.
3.7.5    The Bank agreed to planning changes (deletions and additions) to the
230 kV lines and substations, whiich had the effect of: (a) reducing the
length of the lines from 2,350 circuit-kilometers to 1,291 circuit-kilometers
(with corresponding reductions in the number of substations); and (b)
increasing aggregate transforming capacity from 5,100 MVA to 5,894 MVA. There
were five deleted lines: Barro Vermelho (BV) - Jaguarari; Recife
(R)-Goianinha; R-Mirneira; PA-BV; and BV-Juazeiro.  There were six deleted
substations:  BV, Jauarari, Mirneira, Goianinha, Serhor do Bonfim, and Santa
Cruz.  The added line was between Recife and Pau Ferro; the added substation
was located at Pau Ferro. There were also planning changes with respect to
the location of terminal substations of certain lines: Jardim, Jacaracanga,
and Pituacu.
3.7.6    CHESF introduce( a number of design changes in the 230 kV lines as a
result of the findings of an economic study and the substantial increase in
transformer capacity.  These design changes included, inter alia, the
replacement of concrete poles (single circuit) with steel structures (double
circuit) and the replacement of two conductors per phase for one conductor
per phase. Annexes 3.4 and 3.5 set forth details on actual and forecast
costs, planning and design changes of the various transmission works, and the
corresponding changes to the construction sched le. The above changes
resulted in substantial cost increases.
3.8       Pransportation Equit-ent and Training: Cost
3.6.1    At appraisal, CHESF expected to spend (in current prices) US$5.6
million for such miscellaneous items as line maintenance equipment,
transportation equipment, and tralning.  Tnhe PA IV Loan Agreement indicated
that US$4.0 million and US$0.6 million of the proceeds of Loan 1003-BR would
be available for financing, respectively, transportaticn equipment and
engineering services/training.  The staff appraisal report reccmr.ended that
ab,out US$0.4 million of loan 10(98-BB be spent for training "HESF staff *n the
operation and maintenance of extra high voltage (r}HJ) equipment.



34
3.8.2    CHESF purchased transportation equipment in connection with the
project, but no line maintenance equipment. The transportation equipment
cost US$2.4 million in current prices and US$1.1 million in constant 1973
prices.
3.8.3    With financing provided by ELETROBRAS, CHESF provided training for
its staff in the operation and maintenance of EHV equipment. In connection
with the project, CHESF spent US$0.1 million in current prices to provide
training for its newly recruited power engineers in systems operations.  This
course was built around a computer and associated software which would
simulate the operating conditions of the CHESF system.
3.9        Engineering, Supervision, and Administration Cost
3.9.1      In current prices, the actual cost of engineering, etc., for the
project amounted to US$307.0 million, or 21.7% of the total project cost as
compared wiUh the appraisal forecast of US$105.3 million, or 15.2% of the
total project cost. In constant 1973 prises, the cost of engineering amounted
to US$207.3 million as compared with the appraisal forecast of US$94.8
million. As a percentage of total project costs, the upper end of the range
of engineering and administrative costs is normally around 18%.
3.9.2      Apart from increases in the scope of the project and its
implementation period, the higher cost for engineering, etc., reflected the
impact of various budgeting restrictions imposed by the Government on CHESF.
In its effort to contain inflation, the Goverr'nert restricted  the CHESF
capital expenditure program but not the operattrig budget.  In thi-s situation,
the project had to absorb a larger share of CHESF   administrative costs than
would have been the case withou-t restrictions of CHEJF   capital
expenditures.
3.10      Project Supervision: Resettlement and Power Components
3.10.1    After loan signing (June 17, 1974), the T.AC Energy Division,
realizing that it lacked the resources to undertake an efficient supervision
of the resettlement component, requested support from the Agriculture
Projects Division responsible for Brazil.  In March 1975, the IBRD
decided to: (i) mobilize its agriculture staff tc supervise the resettlement
component (on the Energy Division's budget); and (ii) request the IDB
resident architect in Brazil to supervise the urban resettlement. IDB
agreed, but since this component was already on schedule, only two
supervision visits were paid by the IDB architect; one alone and the other
with the IBRD mission of December 1976 (para. 3.2.2).  The Memorandum of
Agreement was not amended, thus leaving fill responsibility for supervising
the resettlement component with the IBRD.
3.10.2    Energy and Agriculture divisions continuously interchanged
information, each of them discharging its respective respornsibi1ities
independently.  Annex 2.1 (paras. 9.(3 and 19.01) sets forth flrther detaL2s
on supervision of the resettlement effort.
15.10.3    The first two power superviior  m;n'ilns visited Brazi.l in
Septermber and October 11-:37?, iaru?t 1, mronths after '.an olgrLng and ;j m?nth;3



35
after effectiveness of the loan agreement. The unmonitored period was
critical for the transmission component, as serious delays began to develop
unnoticed with respect to procurement (para. 3.7.4.) The missions obtained
the agreement of CHESF management for possible remedial action (the hiring of
procurement consultants).  These delays were compounded by the decision of
CHESF to introduce substantial changes into the planning and design of the
system in response to the decision to advanice construction of the power house
at Sobradinhio and to increase the generating capacity at PA IV (para.
3.6.3). The delayed construction of the transmission system contributed to
the slower-than-expected improvement in CHESF's efforts to reduce its
transmission losse..
3.10.4    Because of manpower constraints, there were only five technical
power supervision missions (about 3.3 staff weeks) between December 1976 atid
June 1981.  The missions monitored implementation of the project, includiring
visits to the work sites at Sobradinho and PA IV.  The missionsfocuseed their
attention onl developing a reliable methodology for recordling the cost of the
project in US dollars.  There were no joint IDB/1PRD technical supervision

allocation of loan p)roceeds and timing of dlisbursements.  The final
disbursement of' the loan occurred on October 12, 1983; and the IJRI) cancel led

IV.   ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION

4.1.1      Annex 4.1 compares actuial and forecast annual electricity
consumption levels for the Northeast for the years 1976-1979.  Annex 4.2 sets
forth the retuirn on chiis project based on actuial cost data (invest"-ent ani

hydrostations, as reflected by their respective contributions to the total
benefits (generation) to be derived from the operation. To determine the
least-cost option for meeting the predicted load growth, the IBRD compared
the costs of construction and operation of PA IV and its associated
transmission facilities, plus its share (40%) of the co,t of the Sobradinho
dam, to that cf conventional thermal alternatives and a nuclear alternative.
'fhe project as defined was found to be least cost as compared with the above
alternatives and to have a return on investment of 23.3%.
4.2.2      On the basis of actual market developments and per kW capacity
costs, the project continues to be justified as least-cost as compared with
the above alternatives.  For the period 1973-1982, regional electricity
demand grew somewhat faster than anticipated, although there was a sharp drop
in the rate of growth during the years 1981 and 1982 (Annex 4.1); and actual
per-kW capacity costs (in constant 1973 prices) for 2,460 MW were ve-y close
to those expected at appraisal for 1,500 MW: US$160.20 vs. 'US$159.40. The
actual per-kW cost compares favorably with the actual per-kW cost (US$232) of
the Itumbiara plant (8x260 MW; Loan 923-BR), construction of which coincided
with that of PA IV.  Per-kW capacity costs for conventional thermal
alternatives would have been no less than that of PA IV and would have
involved additional operating costs for fuel.
4.2.3      The internal rate of return on investment based on actual
investment, operatinzg costs (Annex 4.2), and actual revenues as a proxy for
benefits was 13.2% compared to the appraisal forecast of 2'5.3%.  The
investment cost of Sobradinho was pro rated in consideration of the
generating capacity benefiting from the regulatioon of the Sao Franclsco
River.  The generating capacity of PA IV (2,460 MW) amounted to 49% of the
total capacity located at Sohradinho and Paulo Afonso.  This lower return
reflects the deteriorati(n of the real level of tariffs which occurred in
recent years since tariffs are used as a proxy measure of benefits. Despite
this, it is still higher than the opportunity cost of capital for Brazil,
10% - 12%.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1        Actual and Forecast Financial Data, 1974-1982
5.1.1      Annex 5.1 sets forth actual and forecast key financial ratios of
CHESF fcr the years 1974-1982.  Annex 5.1 also sets forth the corresponding
fi;_anclal ratios of the sector.  Comparison of the actual ratios of C"HESF and
the sector on a year-by year basis shows that the financial performance of
CHESF ana ,r,o sector exhibited decline after 19',7.  In addition to slowing
sales growth, the declining financial performances of CHESF and the sector
were primarily due to the reduction in the real level of tariffs, which
reflected what the ;overnment conside. ec to he a politi cally acceptable

5.2        Government Tariff and Financing Policies for the Sector 1964-1983;
Revenue Covenants; and Tariff Agreements of the Early 1 980s
5.2.1      Under the present sector organization (paras. 1.2.1. to 1.2.4), the
Government takes decisions on tariff levels with little participation by the
state governments or the power utilities.  Given this sector organization, a
brief review of Government policy since 1964 with respect to power-sector
tariffs and financing is fundamental to an understanding of the financial
performance of the sector, the financial performance of tVe individual power
utility, and the various revenue agreements of early 198C's which superceded
the revenue covenants originally negotiated by the Bank and Brazilian power
authorities.
5.2.2      In the early 1960's, by establishing ELETROBRAS, and later tn the
early 1970's, by delineating the responsibilities of the federal and state
operating companies, the Government created a new structure f,or sector
organization to make the power sector an important contributing factor to the
economic development of Brazil.  To provide adequate levels of funding for
the sector investment program, the Govermnent contributed high levels of
equity funding and set tarlffs at levels sufficient to earn the Lega. rate of
remuneration (10-12%) on annially revalued remunerable assets (see parna.
2.6.1, footnote 2".
5.2.3      As a result cf these tariff pclicies, the contributtion  sof :onnulner
based funding to the growing Investm*ent progran increased steadily ttir:lg'o1t
the mid 1970' s, at which time the sectsr reached a peak of financial
soundne3s.  In 1397, net 'after lebt serviceP  consu-mer-ba3ed f;inanci.aL

became increasingly dependent on bo rrowings, resulti ng in a heavy debt
service burden in the late 1'970's and early 19b0' s.  After mu ch nises son
with the Goverrinent and given the realities of the deteriorating economi.c
condition of Brazil, the Bank negotiated new revenue agreements for the power
sector. The new sector revenue agreements superceded the original revenue
covenents.
5.2.5      Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.02 of the
Guarantee Agreement for Toan 1008-BR requ-ired, respectively:  Ki) ('H',5P so
take all action necessary for tariffs to be set at levels to produce revenues
as provided by Brazilian law; and (ii) the Goverrinent to take all reasonable
action necessary to enable CHESF to comply with obligations contained  nr trhe
Loan Agreement.  Brazilian law called fcr a return of 1 0- 1 2 !n r-n        on*c  ¾

*Source: ELETROBRAS
5.2.6     As the compliance of CHESF  with the revenue covenant  was not
satisfactory in the period 1977-1980, the IBRD reached an understanding in
1980 whereby the Government would increase tariff levels to achieve a rate of
remuneration of 10% in 1981 and future years, plus the recovery of revenue
shortfalls of prior years over a three-year period. The table above shows a
substantial improvement in the rate of remuneration of the sector in 1981 , as
compared with the previous year, but short of the level agreed in 1980. In
1981, sales growth declined as compared with prior years because of
macroeconomic conditions, consideration of which further inhibited the
Government from raising power tariffs sufficiently to earn a return of 10%.
This unwillingness to raise tariff levels led to additional discussions
between the Government and the IBRD and the formulation of a new revenue
agreement.
5.2.7     In October 1981, the IBRD and the Government agreed that the latter
would implement quarterly tariff increases which would increase tariff levels
by 3% in real terms in 1982 and 5% annually thereafter, until the sector
achieved a 10% rate of return and past shortfalls were recovered.  The
financial performance of the sector declined in 1982 as compared with 1981,
leading the IBRD and the Government to amend the agreement in November 1983.
Under the amendment, the Government would raise tariffs sufficiently for the
sector to increase its rate of return by one percentage point annually until
1989, when the sector should earn a return of 10%. The 1981 agreement and
its amendment in 1983 did not lead to an amendment ot the revenue covenants
of CHESF under Loan 1008-BR. Rather, the IBRD committed itself not to seek
enforcement of these covenants as long as tariff levels were increased as
agreed.
5.2.8     During the period 1981-1984, the Government increased sector
tariffs as agreed; but the sector rate of return did not exhibit consistent
year-to-year improvement: 1981: 7.9%; 1982: 7.3%; 1983: 4.9%; and 1984:
5.8%. The IBRD acknowledged that the Government complied with the 1981
revenue agreement and its 1983 amendment -- that is, the government approved
the implementation of a quarterly basis of new tariffs which reflected
increases to compensate for past inflation. Some of these new quarterly
tariffs reflected increases which went beyond compensation for recent past
inflation. However, during the period 1981-1984, the rate of inflation was
so high that during intervals between tariff increases shortfalls developed
in he real levels of sector revenue. Also adversely affecting the real
level of sector revenue has been the heavy reliance in recent years on
promotional tariffs. In 1985, electricity sold uinder promotional tariffs
constituted about 7.6% of sector sales but only 3.5% of sector revenue.



39
5.2.9      In 1985, the sector earned a return of 4.3%.  To address the
problem of sector revenues, the IBRD conditioned effectiveness of Loans
2564-BR and 2565-BR to the preparation of an acceptable Govermnent-approved
sector financial rehabilitation plan.  The IBRD accepted a sector financial
rehabilitation plan which sets forth satisfactory financ'al targets.  If
implemented, the plan would lead tn the restoration of sector finaaces by the
end of the decade.
5.2.10    The following paragraphs discuss the financial performance of CHESF
during  the period covered by the financial forecasts (1974-1982).
5.3        Sales, Tarif'f Levels, and Finances, 1974-1982
5.3.1      Table 4.1 below summarizes on an aggregate basis the financial
performance of CHESF for the period 1974-1982.
5.3.2      This table shows that actual summary sales (110,429 GWh) were 5.1%
more than the level (105,098 GWh) expected at appraisal.  In other respects,
the actual and forecast operating results (such as revenues and expenses) of
CHESEF were not close.  Actual summary average revenue per kWh sold (Cr$0.0'75)
was 29.0% below the level expected at appraisal (Cr$0.106) while actual and
forecast operating expenses per k'Wh sold were close: Cr$0.()45 vs Cr$C).043.
Annex 5.2 shows the annual movement of revenues and expenses.  For example,
actual average revenue per kWh sold declined from Cr$0.079 in 1974 to
Cr$0.()'73 in 1982 whlle average operating expense per kWh sold rose from
Cr$0.018 to Cr$O.019 by 1982.  In contrast, the appraisal forecast reflected
the expectatoln that sverage revenue per kWh sold would increase from
Cr$0.078 in 1974 t, Cr$0.122 in 1Q82 while average operating costs per k'Wh
sold would decline from an expected level of Cr$0.02() in 19'74 to Cr$0.010 in
1982.
5.3.3      The actual level of summary investment expenditures (Cr$19,629.3
mlllon.) was substantially greater (92.4%) than that which was expected at
appraisal (Table 4.1).  CHESF financed this increase (Cr$9,432 million) plus
its shortfalls for ret internal cash generation and share capital
contributi.ons (Cr$3,624.6 millilon)       with lower-than-expected dividend
payments and negative net change in working capital (Cr$4,672.8 million)and
with greater-than-expected borrowings (Cr$8,383.8 million).

VI. INSTITIJTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6. 1       The Borrower
6.1.1      Subsequent to its move to Recife, CHFSF recruited competent new
staff; and developed into a strong company. Its organizational struicture is
sound and its management systems are satisfactory.
6.1.2      The move to Recife led to delays in procurement (para. 3.7.4).
The timely retention of consultants for the design and preparation of
specifications could have helped to offset these delays. The subsequent
changes to system planning and design led to further delays in the
implementation of the transrnission component.  These delays partly. accounted
for the slower-than-expected rediuctioTi in transmission losses (/viynfex 3.8).
6.2        The IBRD
6.2.1      At appraisal, the Bank, together with CEiESF and the Covernment,
uinderestimated the complexity of the resettlement problem; hut the Bank
subsequently carried otut (Annex 2.1) intensive supervision.  Tn its report on
project supervision 8/, the Operations Evaltiation Division ijudged the
supervision of the power component by the LAC Energv Division to have been
less thorough and effective than that of the resettlement component.  This
report shares this jtidgement.
6.2.2      The delayed dispatch of the initial power supervision missions had
adverse consequences.  For example, hecause of a fifteen-month lag between
loan signing (June 1974) andl the dispatch of the first two power supervision
missions (September-October 1975), CHFSF di.d not reci-ive timely advice on the
hiring of constiltants for design and preparation of specifications.  This
advi-ce could have helped to avoid a delay in procurement which was later
compounded hy changes to system planning and design.
6.2.3      The frequiency and extent of the technical power supervision effort
was not in proportion to the size of the project 9/. Bank- staff made five
field visits to the construction sites at Sobradinho an,d PA IV between 1976
and 1981; and they reviewed progress project reports as they were received.
The early shortfall of the supervision effort was dtue to manpower
constraints.  But these constraints do not explain why the TBRD did not seek
to exchange supervision reports with the TDB. Given that only eight
technical missions supervised the power component of a project duritng an
eight-year period (1974-1981),          oujr view is that the TBRD shouild have mnade
a greater power supervision effort, including a greater effort to exchange
information with the TDB (para. 3.10.4).
6.2.3        Faced with the non-compliance hv the Government with respect to
revenue covenants dtiring the late 1970's and early 1980's, the Bank took an
understanding attitude toward the changed conditions of the Brazilian
economy, and accordingly renegotiafted in 1981 and 19P3 new sfector reventue
agreements (paras. 5.2.6 - 5.2.7).  Given the deteriorated anTd changed
R/    Case Studies on Pro ject Supervision", (Octoher 30, 1979).
9/   A memher of the ITRI) scaff offered a contrast lng opinion--namely, that
the freqiuency and extent of stipervi0i on shon]d he related to the nature
of the problems faced; and he felt that increased frecuencv of

its technical problems.

condition of the Brazilian economy, this was a reasonable approach and
indicated flexibility on the part of Bank staff.
6.3         The GovernTment
6.3.1        By holding down tariff levels, the Government weakened the
autonomy of the sector which was also affected by recession and devaluation.
The Government honored the new financial agreements with the Bank, hut the
high rate of inflation overwhelmed efforts to maintain or to improve the real
level of tariffs. The Bank conditioned effectiveness of Loans 2564-BR and
2565-BR to the preparation of a satisfactory, Covernment-approved sector
financial rehabilitation plan. Despite its financial deterioration, the
Brazilian power sector continues to be well managed, with a better than
average performance in satisfying an extremely rapid market growth, and with
good investment planning.
VII. LESSONS TO BF LEARNED
7.1       A Sticcessful Projec.t
7.1.1     The project achieved sticcessftuL restults in developinlg the power
hydro resources of the region.  The valtue of those results as compared with
the hardships endured hy the poptlation displaced by the Sohradinho reservoir
(Annex 2.1) cannot, however, he reasonahly assessed in this report.
7.2       Resettlement Projects
7.2.1     In its report on project supervision (footnote 8, page 20), OED
concluded that a major lesson of this project related to the importance of
the resettlement component--that planning for resettlement was as important
as planning for the hydroelectric project; and that the inclusion of
covenants providing for resettlement did not ensure the effective preparation
and implemenitation of such plans. A companion lesson is that for
resettlement efforts on the scale of that experienced at Sobradnho explicit
consideration shouild he given to establishing a separate project 1(/.  The
stattis of a separate project would lhelp to ass1ure appropriate levels of
government funding and interest.
7.3       Appraisal and Supervision
7.3.1     Given the move of the axis of the dam at Sobradinho after appraisal
(para. 3.5.4), this project highlights the wisdom of current Bank policy of
appraising projects involving large civil works only after completion of
detailed engineering. The delays in the dispatch of the first technical
power supervision missions deprived CHESF of timely advice OTn the hiring of
constultants (para. f.2.2); and the freqtuency and extent of technical
supervisio)  of the power component were not in proportion to the size of the
project (parm. 6.2.3).  Sectoral developments during execution of PA IV
(para. 6.3.1) and the consequences of lagged power supervision (para. 6.2.1)
illustrate the need to pay continuing attention to basic policies and the
valtue of supervision, even for a well-managed sector and comnany, as is the
case for Brazil and CHFSF.  Given the problems which can resuilt from
inadeqiiate suipervision, the Bank shouild allocate resources for supervision,
taking into accounr1t thle size and complexity of projects.
1)/  A member of the IBRD staff offered a contrasting opinion--namely, that
resettlement of this magnitude needds to he well advanced bcefore work on
the reservoir is started.

Resettlement, Compensation, Economic and Ecological Problems and Measures
1.         The River and the Land
1.01       The Sao Francisco River (2,660 kin) flows northward for 1,750 km
from its source in the state of Minas Gerais; and then turns eastward toward
the Atlantic Ocean. To solve the resettlement, compensation, economic and
utner problems wnicfl might result from construction of the Sobradinho dam, IBRD and
Brazilian authorities, during project preparation, divided the river into
five sections. The five sections were: (i) the river source to Barra (1,545
kmn); (ii) Barra to Sobradinho (325 kmn), the site of the future reservoir;
(iii and iv) Sobrandinho to Itaparica to Pao de Acucar (620 kmn), known as the
middle Sao Francisco; and (v) Pao de Acucar to the river mouth (170 kin),
known as the lower Sao Francisc-
1.02       In the site of the future reservoir, the land was semi-arid and
generally unsuited for agriculture, except for a narrow alluvial strip
bordering the river. The level of annual precipitation was relatively low,
350 mm, and highly seasonal (November-April).
1.03       In section v, the river valley broadened into numerous flood plains
or varzeas, having a combined gross arable area of about 36,000 ha. The
climate of the area was semi-tropical humid with annual rainfall averaging
1,200 mm near the coast and decreasing gradually to about 600 mm at Pao de
Acucar. March-August was the period of greatest rain.
2.         Local Economies and the People
2.01       About 9,700 families (60,000 persons) lived in the site of the
future reservoir. About 1,600 families lived in or near four small towns
(Remanso, Sento Se, Casa Nova, and Pilao Arcado); the balance lived in the
countryside, mostly in very small rural v/illages. About 85% of the total
population, both urban and rural, earned their livelihood from agriculture,
livestock, and fishing.
2.02       About two-thirds of the rural population "owned" their land but
rarely could demonstrate legal title. Those who farmed the alluvial strip
(about 75% of the local population) practiced a primitive subsistence
agriculture (beans, corn, onions, and mandioc) made hazardous by the



45
ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 7
irregularity of seasonal flows which often inundated early plantings. During
the local rainy season, which was highly irregular, farmers attempted to make
a second crop by cultivating the countryside. Fishing played an important
role in the local economy but its full dimensions were not known. Those who
lived outside the alluvial strip were, for the most part, herders and
shepherds (goats and poultry). They rarely owned land.
2.03      About 540,000 people lived in the lower Sao Francisco, of which
about 123,000 were classified as rural. The cultivation of rice was their
major source of livelihood.  As land ownership was highly concentrated, the
bulk of the working population consisted of landless laborers or
sharecroppers. Overpopulation and the almost complete absence of alternative
sources of work in the area resulted in high unemployment or underemployment.
2.04      In thie area of the future reservoir and in the varzeas, poverty,
illiteracy, and ignorance were pervasive among the population. Few had ever
travelled outside their respective areas; and few possessed the skills
required to ad-just to the changes which would result from construction of the
Sobradinho dam.
3.        The Consequences of Construction of the Sobradinho Dam
3.01      IBRD and Brazilian authorities recognized that construction of the
Sobradinho dam would generate upstream and downstream physical and
socio-economic consequences. Upstream, the creation of a large fresh water
lake stretching from Sobradinho to Barra (more than 300 km) would displace
about 10,000 families living and farming on the banks of the river or in the
immediately adjacent countryside.  Downstream, it would alter (regularize)
the natural flow of the river, permanienitly flooding modest amounts of arable
land in the middle Sao Francisco but wi:h more serious impact on large areas
of the varzeas in the lower Sao Francisco. In this area, regularization of
the river flow woula flood permanerntly about 32,000 ha aTnd would cause 11,000
families to lose their rice fields and their livelihoods.
3.02      Another possible consequence was in the area of environment and
health. Schistosomiasis, malaria, and even plague might spread to regions
previously unaffected or become intensified in locatiotns where they were
already esta'l2ished.
4.        Protective Measures
4.01       From the information containee in various studies, the Government,
the IBRD, and CHESF became alert to the possible adverse consequkences
(ecological and socio-economic) which would result from construction of the
Sobradinho dam if compensatory and protective measures were not taken.
The Governmenit and CHESF, with IBRD encouragement, recognized that special
measures beyond the compensation reqttired by law would be necessary in order
to avoid the destitution of poor people.



46
ANNEX 2.1
Page 3 of 7
4.02       In the varzeas, the construction of protective works (dikes,
pumping stations, and drainage-irrigation systems) would protect rice
production and preserve community life. In the area of the future reservoir,
a well conceived and well executed resettlement program (including relocation
on new lands plus technical assistance and social investment) would enable
the displaced population to support itself through farming, livestock and
fishing.
4.03       In the area of environment and health, special measuires could be
taken to combat endemic disease.
4.04       Planning for the construction of protective structures to save the
varzeas began in the early 1970's and ultimately resulted in the lower Sao
Francisco Polders Project (Loan 1153-BR). This project is discussed in
Section 7 below.
4.05       Planning for the resettlement of the population living in the site
of the future reservoir began in 1982 and intensified in 1973 and 1974. As
the completion date for the Sobradinho dam was early 1977, CHESS and the
Government had only three years in which to execute a proper resettlement
program.  As conceived by CHESF, the program would offer the population to be
displaced two options: (a) transfer to new rural villa-es to be located on
relatively better soils near the town of Bom Jesus da Lapa, which was located
several hundred kilometers to the southwest of the western end of the
reservoir; and (b) relocation to new towns and vilages to be built in the
vicinity of the reservoir. The new rural villages (agrovillas) would
concentrate homes, schools, and social services.  As a rule, families would
receive compensation in cash for expropriated land (where title could be
demonstrated), improvements, lost possessions, etc.  They would also receive
a new house and new land, including title, except in the area of the
reservoir which was a CHESF reserve.
4.06       As the living standards of the population were low, the
resettlement program was expected to provide the majority of people with the
means to earn a living under conditions at least equal to those existing
prior to execution of the Paulo Afonso IV Hydro Electric Project.
5.         Administrative Responsibilities
5.01       To carry out its responsibilities, CHESF established a Resettlement
Unit in 1972; and in October 1973, CHESF and the National Institute for
Colonalization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) signed an agreement for sharing
responsibilities for settling the 9,700 families living in the reservoir
area.
5.02       CHESF would take responsibility for the resettlement operation in
the vicinity of the reservoir. From surveys of the preferances of the
population to be displaced, CHESF estimat2d that about 2,200 families would



47
ANNEX 2.1
Page 4 of 7
remain in the vicinity of the reservoir. The agricultural potential of this
area was poor due to the dry climate.
5.03       INCRA would be responsible for carrying out the resettlement
operation around Bom Jesus de Lapa. INCRA estimated that about 4,000 families
would choose to relocate near Bom Jesus da Lapa. The agricultural potential
of this area was considered to be superior to that of the reservoir area.
5.04      About 1,000 families were expected to leave the reservoir area on a
permanent basis or to receive assistance from other agencies of the Brazilian
Government.
6.         Bank Activities during Project Preparation
6.01      During its preappraisal (May 1973), appraisal (July 1973) and loan
negotiation (April-May 1974) activities, IBRD staff encouraged CHESF and the
Government to pay particular attention to the resettlement question,
especially with respect to the problems of responsibility. During
negotiations, CHESF and the Government agreed to the following covenants on
resettlement, health, environment, and fish production:
(a)  CHESF and the Government would submit to the  IBRDfor review and
comment, within nine months (March 17, 1975) of loan signing, plans
for resettling the population living in the reservoir area; and
implement, in a manner satisfactory to the IBRD, such plans which
woul(d enable the population to earn a living under conditions at
least equal to those existing (Loan Agreement: Section 3.06);
Guaranree Agreement: Section 3.03).
(b)  CHESF and the Government would submit for review and comment within
nine months (March 17, 1975) of loan signing plans for:
(i)  minimizing future distribution and exacerbation of plague,
schistosomiasis, and malaria in the project area (Loan
Agreement: Section 3.07a; Guarantee Agreement: Section 3.03);
(ii)  minimizing undesirable effects of decaying vegetation on the
biochemical properties of the reservoir (Loan Agreement:
Section 3.07b: Guarantee Agreement: Section 3.03);
(iii)  promoting fish conservation and production in the reservoir
(Loan Agreement: Section 3.07; Guarantee AXgreement: Section
3.03).
(c)  CHESF and the Government would submit to the IBRD for review and
comment, within 12 months (June 12, 1975) of loan signing, an
evaluation of the effects of dam construction and flow regulation
on the middle Sao Fr ncisco; six months thereafter (December 17,
1975), a plan to provide reasonable compensation for the population
living in such area.  Resettlement plans would he included if



48
ANNEX 2. 1
Page 5 of 7
necessary (Loan Agreement: Section 3.08a; Guarantee Agreement:
Section 3.03).
(d)  The Government wou d submit to theIBRD  for review and comment,
within nine months (March 17, 1975) of loan signing, the
engineering study and cost estimates for the lower Sao Francisco
Emergency Plan and would implement it by year-end 1978. The
Government further agreed to submit to the Bank for review and
comment, within fifteen months (September 1', 1975), a
comprehensive program for the lower Sao Francisco (Guarantee
Agreement: Section 3.04).
7.        Government Compliance: Lower Sao Francisco Emergency Plan
7.01       rhe Government complied with the covenant requiring implementation
of a plan based on engineering and cost studies eo protect the varzeas.  The
studies ultimately led to the lower Sao Francisco Polders Project, consisting
of the construction of protective structures and including agrarian reform,
technical assistance, and social infrastructure investment.  The  TBRL'
supported this project with Loan 1153-BR (1975; US$23.0 million).
7.02      The project resulted in higher-than-expected rice production and
major income and other benefits for nearly 1,400 small farmers.  However,
because of unusually difficult physical conditions (poor soils and
unfavorable hydrological conditions) and (incomplete information on key
physical, environmental, and socio-economic factors), i.e., inadequate
preparation and appraisal work, the project suffered major revisions, a cost
overrun (16Y), and a lengthy completion delay (five years).
7.03      In a project performance audit report (No. 5669, dated May 23,
1985), the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) rais?d serious questions
about the methodology for calculating the economic return of the project, the
sustainability of project-related benefits, and the performance of Bank staff
diuring preparation and implementation of the project.
8.        Government Compliance: Submission of Reports
8.01      CHESF and the Government complied with those covenants requiring
submission to the IBRD of reports on: (i) resettlement of the population
living in the reservoir area; (ii) combatting endemic disease; (iii)
minimizing the undesirable effect of decaying vegetation; (iv) promoting fish
conservation and production; and (v) evaluating the effect of construction of
the Sobradinho dam on the middle Sao Francisco.
8.02      The resettlement and fish conservation/production reports resulted
in programs which are described below. The report on combatting endemic
disease resulted in health programs which were satisfactory to the IBRD. The
IBRD accepted findings to the effect that decaying vegetation would have only
short-lived undesirable effects on the reservcir and that construction of the
Sobradinho dam would have only minor effects on the population living in the
middle Sao Francisco.

ANNEX 2.1
Page 6 of 7
9.        Resettlement and Fishery Programs
9.01      By the end of 1978, CHESF and the Government had complied with the
resettlement covenant, but with migration results far different from what had
been expected; and had failed to implement a satisfactory fishery development
program.
9.02      CHESF constructed new towns and villages in the vicinity of the
reservoir in an efficient and timely manner. The emigration from the
vicinity of the reservoir was far less than expected.  Around 6,200 families
choose to remain in the reservoir area, not 3,700 families as originally
expected. The higher number was surprising in light of the superior
agricultural potential of the Bom Jesus da Lapa area. Only about 1,000
families choose to resettle permanently in Bom Jesus de Lapa, not the 4,000
families originally expected.
9.03      These changes had their origin in the early difficulties
experienced by INCRA. In 1974, planning for colonization languished due to
problems of management, organization, staffing, and funding. The Bank did
not know of these difficulties until its first supervision mission (May 1975)
visited Brazil1/, almost a year after loan approval but only one month after
effectiveness of the loan agreement (April 15, 1975). After a second
supervision mission (August 1975) found that the delays to construction wou]d
cause INCRA to miss its first deadline for transporting 100 families to Bom
Jesus da Lapa, the IBRI)sent a stiffly worded letter (September 11, 1975) to
the Government and its responsible agencies and ministries. Shortly
thereafter, the Government took steps to correct the administrative and
financial shortcomings of INCRA.
9.04      In 1976, some 1,200 families moved to Bom Jesus da Lapa; but by
mid-1977, the stream of colonists had slowed to trickle. Some colonists even
returned to the reservoir area. In addition to the initially poor planning
on the part of INCRA, other factors influencing the decisions of the
Sobrandinho residents were   : (i) opposition of local political and church
leaders to transfer; (ii) artificial boom conditions in the reservoir area
due to construction of the dam; (iii) unexpectedly good crop and fish
production due to an extended rainy season and interrupted migratory
patterns; and (iv) a lack of sensitivity on the part of INCRA to the fears
and uncertainties of the colonists. Particularly painful was the decimiation
without compensation of the colonists' livestock due to inadequate water and
feeding during transportation and subsequently.
1/   The LAC Agriculture Division supervised the resettlement effort at the
request of the LAC Energy Division, which did not have the resources tc
undertake efficient supervision. The LAC Energy Division supervised
construction of the transmission lines (500 and 230 kv), substations
(230 kV), and the training programs.



50
ANNEX 2.1
Page 7 of 7
9.05       Fishery development did not receive adequate governmental support.
Only 1,000 ha were cleared before the reservoir filled, as compared with a
recommended clearance level of 8,000 ha. Fish stocks would be ample but the
large volume of uncleared brush would foul nets and reduce the catch. By the
time that supervision of the resettlement component was completed (1978) Bank
staff had recorded numerous instances of real hardship resulting from
mishandling; and there was little confidence concerning the economic future
of those who chose to stay in the reservoir area.
10.       Adequacy of Bank Supervision
10.01     Subsequent to 1975, seven additional supervision missions visited
Brazil to mDnitor compliance with respect to covenants protecting the welfare
of the populatio., living in the reservoir area. OED reviewed and found
adequate the supervision effort of the IBRn ("Case Studies of Project
Supervision", October 30, 1979) with respect to the resettlement effort.
11.       Lessons tc be Learned
11.01     OED concluded that a major lesson of tnis project related to the
importance of the resettlement component--that planning for resettlement was
as important as planning for the hydroelectric project; and that the
inclusion of covenants providing for resettlement did not ensure the
effective preparation and implementation of such plans. Careful and regular
supervision were required in connection with such undertakings.
