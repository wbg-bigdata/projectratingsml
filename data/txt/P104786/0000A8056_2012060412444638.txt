                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards achievement of the PDO is moderately satisfactory. This represents a downgrade from the last reporting after a validation and triangulation of results from the PIU
                         revealed errors (mainly double counting of beneficiaries and other indicators) in earlier reporting. The project has supported 80,989 direct beneficiaries to increase production and
                         productivity of staple food crops. Yields of major staples per feddan have increased from 200 kg for sorghum, 250 kg for maize and 350 kg for groundnuts per feddan in 2008 to a 3-
                         year average of 463 kg for sorghum, 346 kg for maize and 422 kg for ground nuts by 2011, increases of 132%, 38% and 21% respectively. Drafts and revised policy documents
                         covering a number of areas have been produced, a research management policy framework finalized and proposals on the institutional framework for research management

                         and the government together with the implementing NGOs is exploring possibilities of shifting the support to areas that are relatively stable. Delays in issuance tax exemption letter
