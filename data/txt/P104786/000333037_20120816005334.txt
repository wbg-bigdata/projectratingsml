                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      This is a Level 1 restructuring, encompassing a revision to the Project
Development Objective (PDO) to make it consistent with of the PDO of the additional
financing approved in March 2011 and the extension of the closing date of both the
original grant (P104786; TF-091282) and additional financing (P122095; TF099010) for
Sudan – Support to Agriculture and Forestry Development Project- MDTF from October
31, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The cumulative extension of the parent project would be 30
months from the original closing date of December 31, 2009.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Support to Agriculture and Forestry Development Project (SAFDP) was
designed as a five year project in 2007 to increase the productivity and production of
approximately 140,000 smallholder farmers in agriculture and forestry in five states of
Southern Sudan. Funding to the project was phased with Phase 1 of two years
(2007/2008) becoming effective on June 3, 2008. Delays in the effectiveness of the
project resulted from initial ambiguities in the implementation arrangements.

3.      The performance of the parent project (P104786) is rated satisfactory. Updated
results were reported in March, 2011, and confirmed in May, 2011 supporting the
decision to upgrade from the prior status of MS. As of May 30, 2011, thirty three months
after effectiveness, 100 percent of the original grant amount of US$16.17 million was
disbursed. An additional US$ 14 million was approved in March 2011 and US$ 6.50
million of this is already committed. The rating for the safeguards and pest management
is unsatisfactory due to delay in implementing the frameworks. The client has agreed to
roll out the ESMF by June 30, 2011 and the NGO implementing the project will submit
the management plans developed to address safeguards by June 20, 2011. Table 1 below
summarizes the status of the project, as of May 30, 2011.

4.    As part of additional financing and restructuring completed in March 2011, a
modest revision in the formulation of the PDO was made and approved by the Oversight
Committee of the MDTF (OC). The revised PDO was not reflected in the amended Grant
Agreement, and it is so reflected in the present one. Indicators and targets were revised to
simplify collection of data and introduce clarity in measurement. A new component was
introduced to enhance project implementation and performance and overcome
weaknesses in the project management. These changes have been reflected in a
comprehensive work plan after the approval by the OC and are expected to improve the
project performance.

Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as a sub-contractor. The audit report from
FAO has been received and is under review.

               Forestry Development Project (P104786), as of May 30, 2011

                                                  Unsatisfactory

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

6.      The proposed changes are twofold: (i) the revision to the PDO to make it
consistent with of the PDO of the additional financing approved in March 2011 and (ii)
the extension of the closing date of both the original grant (P104786, TF-091282) and
additional financing (P122095, TF099010) from October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.

7.      The original/current Project Development Objective is “The objective of the
Project is to increase agricultural productivity of smallholder households by facilitating
the adoption of improved technologies and strengthening capacities of the GoSS, State
and Local Governments as well as private sector to plan and respond to identified needs
in agriculture and forestry?. The new/revised Project Development Objective is “to
increase the productivity and production of participating smallholder farmers in
agriculture and forestry.?

8.    At approval of the additional financing it was clear that the completion of the
expanded scope of activities would necessitate an extension of the project closing date to
June 30, 2012. However, since the closing date of the parent MDTF-SS was set at
December 30, 2011 and the process to extend it was still underway, the extension of the
closing date of SAFDP to June 2012 could not be granted. The extension of the closing
date of the parent Trust Fund to December 31, 2012 has been completed and it is possible
now to extend closing dates of both the original SAFDP and the AF to June 30, 2012.
