                         Overall, progress towards achievement of the revised PDO is Satisfactory. With additional financing of USD 14 million and the restructuring of the affiliated original project , a total of
                         145,000 instead of 120,000 beneficiaries have been targeted for end of project. Already, 131,100 farmers (37 percent female) have received support under the original funding and
                         have produced staples, tree seedlings and value addition of some selected enterprises. Construction of some physical infrastructure, training of civil servants in specialized areas
                         have been equally been achieved. As part of restructuring, new indicators have been introduced while some old ones have been modified, to simplifying the results framework and
                         improve reporting and measurement.
