    AMENDMENT OF DISBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE FOR EXPENDITURES
                          CATEGORY

    BENIN — SECOND DECENTRALIZED CITY MANAGEMENT AND ADDITIONAL
                         FINANCING (P082725)

                         CREDITS NO. 4117-BEN AND 4490-BJ

     A- Introduction

1.    This Restructuring Paper is to request (i) a reallocation of funds under the
Second Decentralized City Management Project, Credit No. 4117-BEN; (ii) a
retroactive increase in the percentage of expenditures to be financed to 100% for
“works? under Category (1) under Credit No. 4117-BEN and all expenditure
categories under Credit No. 4490-BJ; and (iii) restructure the project activities in
Credit No. 4117-BEN to correspond with work activities under Credit No. 4490-BJ.
Since the increase includes retroactive increases in disbursement percentages, such
retroactive increases may be approved in exceptional circumstances by the Regional
Vice President and the Director of the Loan Department.1 This request does represent
a policy exception.

2.    The rationale for the retroactive increase in the disbursement percentage is to
allow the project to utilize the unused funds in the original financing to pay for
outstanding contractor invoices that were to be paid from the government's counterpart
funds. The government was unable to mobilize sufficient funds to pay for their 10%
share on the original financing (IDA 4117) and 15% share on the additional financing
(IDA 4490).

     B- Background and current status

3.     Objective of the Project and Components. This is a second phase of an APL in
the amount of US$35 million (original project) and US$40 million (Additional
Financing). The objective is to increase access to infrastructure and basic services for
residents of Benin's primary cities (Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Parakou) and selected
secondary cities (Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa, and Kandi). The project consists of four
components: Component A— Municipal Management Strengthening; Component B—
Urban Infrastructure Construction/Rehabilitation; Component C— Neighborhood
Initiatives; and Component D— Solid Waste Management in Porto-Novo of and Brief
Description.

4.    As of June 28, 2012, 100% of the Additional Financing credit and 91.73% of the
original project funds had been disbursed respectively. All works promised under the


1
  According to Paragraph 8 of BP 12.00, retroactive increases in disbursement percentages may be
approved in exceptional circumstances by the Regional Vice President and the Director, Loan
Department, provided such increases will not result in Bank financing of expenditures financed by any
other party.
                                                 6
original project (Credit 4117-BEN) have been completed and fees for implementing
agencies up to closing date of project have been taken care of.

5.   The achievement of the project is as follows: (i) the rehabilitation (paving and
drainage) of 33.9 kilometers of urban roads is completed (about 126% of original
project target) providing to 355,000 residents better access to the city centers (121% of
end of project target); and (ii) the construction of 17.4 km of primary drainage
network, protecting more than 981,000 residents from periodic flooding (end of
project target exceeded). The Implementation Progress rating is satisfactory and the
Project Development Objective rating is also satisfactory.

6.    Key Issues. Government of Benin, through a letter dated January 27, 2012, made
a request to the Bank to apply funds remaining in Credit 4117-BEN totaling SDR
1,985,579.36 (US$ 3,004,836.81 equivalent) that is currently available in the account
to pay for the government’s share of the project costs for works performed under the
project, as the government has not been able to mobilize sufficient counterpart funds
to meet all of its obligations to contractors under the project. Since all activities have
been completed, this remaining amount represents project cost savings which
emanates from the open procurement processes applied by the Government in line
with the Bank's procurement guidelines which elicited bids that were lower than some
of the estimated amounts for some of the works and equipment in the original project.
There were also some favorable exchange rate gains in the process of transferring
funds from SDR into CFA Francs. In line with Bank procedures, it was agreed with
Legal Department to restructure the project to make a change to the withdrawal
schedule of the Original (Credit 4117-BEN) and Additional Financing (Credit 4490-
BJ) project documents. The Team proposes that the disbursement tables in Schedule 1,
Section A.1 (Credit 4117-BEN) and Schedule 2, Section IV.A.2 (Credit 4490-BJ) of
the Financing Agreements be amended as shown below (Annex 1). This will enable
the Bank to disburse at 100% for Works in lieu of 90%, in the case of IDA Credit no.
4117-BEN and 85% in the case of Credit No. 4490-BJ, and to reallocate funds in
accordance with the disbursement table (in Annex 1) for Credit 4117-BEN below. The
Bank Financial Management team has confirmed the existence of the outstanding
amounts based on information provided by the government team in support of the
subject request.

7.   The summarized facts that led to Government’s request to the Bank to amend the
Credit as stated above are as follows:

           (i)     Government of Benin came under increased pressure from one
                   community whose land was acquired for the purposes of
                   constructing the Takon Landfill for the City of Porto Novo
                   (financed from proceeds of the Credit).
           (ii)    The funds set aside for counterpart funds were used for the social
                   measures related to the resettlement of the community near the
                   Takon Landfill, per the requirements and guidance of OP 4.12; the
                   costs of these measures were higher than was anticipated during
                   project preparation.


                                            7
Government’s funds set aside for payment of counterpart funding was all the funds the
Government had obtained authorization from Parliament to spend on the project.
Considering the time needed to go back to Parliament to seek further authorization and
risking the delay and possible cancellation of the landfill component of the project, the
Government resorted to the use of the available counterpart funds for social measures
related to the community resettlement near the Takon Landfill.

8.    The proposed increases in the percentage of expenditures to be financed under
the credits, which include increases in percentages for expenditures that the
Association has already disbursed against, and reallocation, are necessary to enable the
Government of Benin to smoothly complete the project and ensure that all contractors
have been fully paid up. This also includes payment for the contractors who worked
on the construction of the landfill that was completed and handed over to GoB on
April 19, 2012. The reallocation consists of moving SDR 63,335.17 from Category 3B
to Category 3A in the disbursement table for Credit 4117-BEN. In view of the need to
expedite the works of the Additional Financing (Credit No. 4490-BJ) which was under
preparation (Category 3B), a decision was made by the project Team to allow GoB to
fast track the studies for works in the Additional Financing (AF) by using funds in
Category 3A with the understanding that the said funds will be reallocated once the
AF was approved. The proposed reallocation from Category 3B to 3A is to enable the
payment of the initial expenditure on AF studies that led to the fast execution of works
in the AF to be fully covered. Secondly, the balance of unused funds in Credit 4117-
BEN after this reallocation specified above will be used to also pay contractors who
worked and completed works but who had not been paid from GoB counterpart funds
due to the shortfall outlined elsewhere in this restructuring paper.

9.    The Government of Benin has requested a reallocation of the credit funds to
reflect actual expenses to date and expected expenses in the amount of US$
2,833,306.14 (Credit 4117-BEN: US$ 370,135.42 and Credit 4490-BJ: US$
2,463,170.72) before the Credit Closing Date. The proposed reallocation consists of
small adjustments between categories. The reallocated funds will be used to finance
works activities under Credit 4117-BEN, which have been revised to be aligned with
works activities under Credit 4490-BJ. Minor clarifying revisions of the description of
the project activities under Credit 4117-BEN have been made.

10. The project closes on June 29, 2012 and the objective has now been achieved
and therefore the remaining funds are available and can be used for the Government’s
request without jeopardizing the project objectives. The project was extended for 3
months to allow the processing of this policy exception.
