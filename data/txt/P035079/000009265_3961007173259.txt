KOREA
WASTE DISPOSAL PROJECT
I. THE BACKGROUND
A. Waste generation
1.1       Korea's industrialization, improved living standards and rapid urban
population growth, has resulted in the generation of large quantities of various
waste.   Wastewater is projected to grow from 11 million m3/d in 1990 to 19
million m3/d in 2001, solid waste from 145,000 t/d to 250,000 t/d, and specified
waste' from 3,000 t/d to 12,500 t/d.   Construction of wastewater treatment
plants started only in the late 1970s but at a slow pace. Between 1985-90 the
volume of raw wastewater increased by 3 million m3/d while treatment capacity
increased only by 1.1 million m3/d causing further deterioration of the quality
of water in rivers, and adversely influencing the quality of some water supplies.
Solid waste treatment consists primarily of disposal into landfills with over
half of their capacity being filled up by 1994. They were established many years
ago and are simple dumps which are difficult to manage in a sanitary manner.
There are few treatment facilities for specified waste as attention to its
environmental impact started to cause concern only in the early 1980s.
B. Environmental initiatives
1.2       The Government recognized the environmental deficiencies some time ago
and created institutions, along with regulations, to control waste disposal. The
Pollution Control Division established in 1973 became the Environmental
Management Bureau in 1977 and, following increasing concern about the
environment, it was upgraded to the Ministry of Environment (MOE) in 1990. In
1991, the Basic Environmental Law, was passed to deal with specific problems
including water preservation, hazardous substance control and solid waste
management. Under the Law, the responsibility for management of the environment
has been delegated to newly created departments in local governments.
C. Waste disposal policies
1.3       The protection of the country's rivers as sources of drinking water
is an important Government concern and in 1990 it issued the National Wastewater
Treatment Plan aimed at preventing contamination of water sources, and preserving
the natural ecosystem.   The action oriented Plan addresses the task by (a)
relocating industries to eliminate pollution from upper catchment areas reserved
for water supply; (b) providing wastewater treatment plants (WTP) for industry
and livestock farms; and (c) substantially reducing residential pollution by
constructing wastewater treatment plants. The Plan, now under implementation,
1 Korea identifies residential and non-toxic work-site waste as general
waste. Specified waste includes 22 categories of toxic work-site waste such as
acids and alkalis, oils, organic solvents, asbestos, pesticides, polychlorinated
bi-phenyl (PCB), and sludge containing heavy metals. In many countries these are
called hazardous.



2
aims at reducing the pollution reaching the rivers expressed as the Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (BOD), from 960 t/d in 1990 to 450 t/d in 2001. Such an ambitious
goal will be achieved not only with new wastewater treatment plants but with
stricter regulation for the quality of their effluent and application of advanced
technologies, such as reuse of treated wastewater. This project would support
construction of a treatment plant using such technology.
1.4       The solid waste policy was set out in 1993 in the National Waste
Disposal Plan; it anticipates involvement of both private and public sectors,
with the latter responsible for (a) policy and management, (b) filling in areas
where the private sector faces difficulties which it cannot reasonably control,
such as resistance to disposal sites, and (c) disposal of dangerous categories
of specified waste. The goals for waste management are reducing the volume of
waste, increasing recycling, permitting only sanitary landfills, and increasing
incineration of waste to reduce the burden on landfill sites.
D. Waste management organization
1.5       The  management  of  sewerage  systems,  treatment  and  disposal  of
wastewater and disposal of general and specified waste is the responsibility of
local governments supported by MOE. MOE is the key agency for protecting the
environment, providing standards and guidelines for implementing environmental
laws, monitoring compliance, and reviewing environmental impacts of major
projects. Its policy, regulations, planning, and project review functions are
centralized while the administration of the environmental programs, and
monitoring and enforcing functions are decentralized to regional offices. It also
includes two institutes and two corporations, the Korea Resources Recovery and
Reutilization Corporation (KRC) and the Environmental Management Corporation
(EMC).
1.6       KRC,  established in 1980, has now over sixty collection stations
countrywide collecting and recycling plastics, paper, iron, glass, tires and oil.
EMC, established in 1987, manages a number of incinerators, sanitary landfills,
industrial wastewater plants and specified waste plants. It also provides
technical assistance and loans to small and medium enterprises to help them build
environmental facilities for on-site recycling, and on-site treatment of waste
using new clean technologies.
1.7       The collection and treatment of municipal wastewater is handled solely
by local governments; with regard to general waste they handle only about 35%,
the remainder is collected, treated and disposed of by the private sector, whose
share is expected to grow. Most specified waste is reused, treated at source,
or disposed of at privately operated plants. The Government provides plants for
treatment of the heaviest concentration of pollutants, which represent a very
small portion of the total volume of specified waste. To ensure satisfactory and
safe disposal of such highly polluted specified waste, MOE plans establishment
by 2001 of at least one specified waste disposal plant in each of its
environmental regions. Such plants will integrate intermediate treatment with
final disposal and their incineration capacity is expected to reach 1,800 t/d in
2001.   Construction of an integrated specified waste disposal plant would be
supported by this project.

E. Previous Bank lending
1.8       The Bank helped finance five water supply projects, of which four are
completed, and two sewerage projects; it also prepared a sewerage sector study.
Through its involvement, the Bank helped to expand water supply services in 73
municipalities, to establish national policies for water tariffs, to introduce
corporate planning, computerized accounting systems, leak detection technology,
and to improve leakage control programs and the organization of water supply and
sewerage services.   The last water supply project under implementation will
provide services to one city and four municipalities. The two sewerage projects
are also under implementation and will improve the environment in four cities,
reduce health hazards and continue Bank support for technological and
institutional advancement in the sector.
1.9       Bank evaluations indicate that the completed projects substantially
contributed to institutional development (PPAR Nos. 8174 and 11950) and that all
project goals were achieved or surpassed (Report No. 11062  Annual Review on
Evaluation Results -- OED, August 1992); they also state that well defined
objectives, with regard to project targets and commitment of responsible
agencies, contributed to the success. Based on these lessons, the proposed
project's objectives focus on key physical and institutional goals. Project
preparation is at a satisfactory stage and the implementing agencies firmly
support the project.
F. Rationale for Bank involvement
1.10      The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board on December 23, 1993. The CAS and the graduation plan for
Korea identified the need to improve the environment, which involves managing
wastewater and solid waste, as an area in which the country would benefit from
Bank participation. The Bank's past involvement in the water supply and
wastewater sector puts it in a advantageous position to support innovations in
management of environmental projects and focus greater attention to water
pollution issues.   The proposed project would help the Government expand and
upgrade a major wastewater treatment plant. In addition, the project would link
water conservation with pollution prevention by introducing the reuse of effluent
from a wastewater treatment plant. Although new to Korea, this practice has been
successfully applied in several developed countries.
1.11      The specified waste component would represent a new initiative by the
Bank in Korea. A lack of technological expertise and operational experience in
specified waste management is acknowledged and the Government welcomes Bank
support in introducing advanced waste treatment equipment. Under the project,
the Bank would support the Government long-term plans for managing specified
waste and assist in creating public facilities that would improve the treatment
of the most dangerous types of waste. The construction of these facilities would
be an important step in implementing MOE's national specified waste strategy.

II. MANAGEMENT OF WASTE IN THE PROJECT AREA
A. Project area
2.1       The project would be located in Pusan and Kunsan. Pusan is Korea's
second largest city and major seaport on the southeast corner of the Korean
peninsula 440 km from Seoul. Kunsan city lies on the west coast 220 km south of
Seoul. Pusan is an important cultural and commercial center and its government
attaches great importance to improving the local environment. In Kunsan a new
major industrial estate is being developed and attention is given to protecting
the environment. Selection of these localities for the project was influenced
by local commitment to progressive environmental policies:  Pusan is taking a
leading role in the reuse of treated wastewater effluent, and Kunsan would have
a model specified waste plant which would be replicated elsewhere.
B. Economic activity and generation of waste
2.2       Pusan's harbor and city center lie east of the Nakdong river and its
urban development extends along a narrow coastal plain into mountains to the
north.  Its population has tripled from about 1.3 million in 1963 when the then
municipality was upgraded to special city status, to about 4 million in 1993 and
is projected to reach nearly 5 million in 2001.  Its administrative area also
grew from 360 km2 in 1963 to 526 km2 in 1994.   Pusan has more than 40,000
factories employing about 600,000 people in light industries such as chemicals,
textiles and leather as well as heavy industries including metallurgy,
engineering and shipbuilding.
2.3       The Janglim catchment area which extends along the eastern bank of the
Nakdong river, is one of four main wastewater catchments in Pusan. At present
the area is fairly evenly divided between residential and industrial development.
The population was about 840,000 in 1991 and is projected to increase to 1.1
million by 2001.  There is nearly 20 km2 of mixed industry but this is expected
to decrease substantially by 2001 in response to Pusan's land use policy under
which industry is being moved out of Janglim across the Nakdong river and the
vacated land is used for residential development.
2.4       Kunsan city lies in the northwestern corner of Chunbuk province on the
south bank of the Kum river mouth.   Its population of 350,000 will grow to
450,000 in 2001 through both immigration and expansion of the city area from 355
km2 to 495 km2.   The area will be increased by incorporation of neighboring
districts and also through land reclamation. Kunsan city as well as the whole
Chunbuk province have relatively recently become the target for Government plans
for major industrial expansion. Just for that purpose, land has been reclaimed
on the south side of the Kum river and a phased development of 43 km2 is in
progress.  All of the 6 km2 first phase has been taken up by heavy and light
industry and development of the 16 km2 second phase has started.
2.5       In 1992, local governments of Chunbuk province collected and disposed
10,100 t/d of general solid waste from a population of 5.6 million and 5,200
industrial and commercial establishments. In the same year industries generated
150 t/d of specified waste of which 120 t/d were treated at source by three major
industrial establishments and 30 t/d were disposed of by the private sector. It



5
is estimated that the quantity of specified waste will increase to 170 t/d and
320 t/d in 1997 and 2001, respectively.
C. Waste management
2.6       Sewerage  services  in  Pusan  are  managed  by  the  Pusan  Sewerage
Management Office (PSM) of the Construction Bureau.   The sewerage system is
mainly of the combined type, carrying both rainfall runoff and wastewater. It
has been developed over many years and initially was for drainage purposes; it
therefore includes open channels along streets as well as buried conduits. Under
the sewerage master plan (SMP) there is an ongoing program of interceptor sewer
construction to convey wastewater to treatment plants and thus achieve a massive
reduction in surface water pollution with consequent benefits to public health.
Two major plants (Suyeong and Janglim) are already in operation and a third, at
Nambu (previously named Yongho), is being constructed under a Bank supported
project.   The Janglim plant has a treatment capacity of 330,000 m3/d and in
accordance with the SMP the project would increase Janglim's capacity to 615,000
m3/d by 2001. The third and final stage of Janglim development under the SMP
would increase the capacity to 711,000 m3/d in 2011.
2.7       Under  the  existing  system,  maintenance  of  combined  drainage  is
decentralized to the city districts.   Wastewater treatment, interceptors and
sewage pumping stations, are operated and maintained by the treatment plant units
headed by directors. Accordingly, Janglim is and will continue to be operated
and maintained by the Janglim director and staff under the overall supervision
of the PSM sewerage division (para 4.2).   The division provides technical
guidance and, as required by the budgets of the respective WTPs, allocates funds
from the sewerage special account, managed by PSM. The existing organization is
satisfactory (Chart 1).
2.8       Solid waste services in Pusan are provided by the Cleansing Department
of the Environmental and Green Bureau.   The department has three divisions
responsible for: collecting and transporting waste; collecting and disposing of
nightsoil and septage; and operating the sanitary landfills and incinerators.
Almost 35% of waste is collected and transported by private sector. Most of the
4,800 t collected daily is disposed of at sanitary landfill; about 4% is
incinerated or recycled. Nightsoil and septage are disposed of at sea.
2.9       Kunsan city is constructing a wastewater treatment plant for its
residential wastewater as well as that from the adjacent industrial estates. The
first phase with a capacity of 200,000 m3/d will be operational in 1995. Further
development during 2001-07 will increase capacity to 750,000 m3/d. General waste
is disposed of at a landfill operated by the city and located 8 km of the city.
EMC is constructing and upon completion will operate an integrated specified
waste treatment plant about 10 km west of the city to treat and dispose of
specified waste that will be generated in Chunbuk province, including the new
industrial estates in Kunsan. The waste disposal facility will include a secured
landfill and an incineration unit.

D. Waste recvcling and reuse
2.10      Demand for water in Korea has increased to the point where it now
equals the annual rainfall run-off.  As the amount available for consumption
cannot be increased to any significant degree, water resources have to be
conserved and reuse offers an opportunity to reduce demand on the nation's
primary water sources. Effluent from wastewater treatment plants can be polished
to a degree whereby, although not potable, it can be used by industry. Pusan
would be the first in Korea to offer substantial quantities of treated wastewater
for industrial use.
2.11       Under the 1993 Comprehensive National Plan for Waste Disposal the
roles of government, local government, businesses and individuals were placed in
the context of a policy aimed at environmental protection by reducing the volume,
recycling and the appropriate treatment of waste. Nationally, residential waste
disposal figures for 1992 showed 8% of the total being recycled.   In 1993,
Pusan's cleansing department recovered for recycling only 30,000 t/y, or 2% of
total collection.  In response to the National Plan, Pusan intends to increase
its recycled proportion.
E. Demand for the project
2.12      Wastewater entering the Janglim WTP is already nearing the 330,000
m3/d capacity and, as the interceptor sewer program progresses and connects up
more sections of the drainage area, flows are expected to increase to 615,000
m3/d. Extensions to the plant are essential if unacceptable overloading is to
be avoided. In addition, there is a growing demand for water from already scarce
resources and by introducing tertiary treatment, 615,000 m3/d can be made
available for industrial use. This would reduce the demand on the Nakdong source
and would also make a like amount available for residential use which would
otherwise be utilized by industrial consumers.
2.13      The Kunsan specified waste disposal plant would serve Chunbuk province
and, in particular, the three development stages of the Kunsan industrial
estates. The plant is a necessary facility to ensure satisfactory management of
most hazardous waste substances generated in industries which would have serious
adverse impact on the environment if disposed of in an uncontrolled manner.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.1       The key objectives are to support the Government in addressing in
Pusan city and Chunbuk province environmental, institutional and technological
concerns regarding wastewater and specified waste disposal; to reduce the health
hazards of surface and ground water contamination; and to promote the reuse of
treated effluent on a major scale.
B. Description
3.2       The project would have the following components:
(a) In Pusan, the second phase expansion of the Janglim wastewater treatment
plant (WTP) comprising the construction of: primary and secondary treatment units
to increase its capacity from 330,000 m3/d to 615,000 m3/d; tertiary treatment
units to treat the effluent for reuse as industrial water; 4.5 km of interceptor
sewers; and two pumping stations;
(b) In Kunsan, the supply and installation of a specified waste incineration
unit (SWI) with a capacity of 60 t/d to burn waste generated in Chunbuk province.
3.3       The expansion of Janglim WTP would use an activated sludge process
similar to the first phase; digested and dewatered sludge from both phases would
be disposed of at Senggok sanitary landfill. Tertiary treatment would entail
flocculation,  rapid upward flow filtration and disinfection.   The pumping
stations would lift wastewater along newly constructed interceptor sewers. The
Kunsan SWI would comprise of a rotary kiln incinerator and associated equipment;
it would become an integral component of a comprehensive treatment and disposal
plant including a secured landfill with leachate treatment, presently under
implementation. Consulting services to supervise construction of both components
and training in managing SWI are also included. A detailed description of the
project is given in Annex 2, and the location of the proposed works is shown on
maps IBRD Nos. 26341 and IBRD 26471.
C. Status of RreRaration
3.4       The designs  and bidding documents  for the WTP in Pusan and the
tertiary treatment would be completed in December 1994 and December 1995,
respectively, by PSM assisted by consultants.   The designs and draft bidding
documents for the Kunsan component were completed in September 1994 by EMC and
its consultants.
D. Cost estimate
3.5       The total cost, including physical and price contingencies, is W 218.6
billion (US$273.3 million).   Physical contingencies are estimated at W 8.6
billion (US$10.7 million) or 4.5% of base costs, and price contingencies at W
18.8 billion (US$23.6 million), or about 9% of base costs plus physical
contingencies, and assume annual rates of inflation of 5% for local costs and
2.2% for foreign costs for 1995 and thereafter. Cost estimates for WTP are based



8
on detailed designs and bids received for on-going civil works and equipment and
for SWI are based on recent bids in Korea and elsewhere, increased to include
technical assistance support by the supplier. Cost estimates are shown in Annex
3 and summarized in Table 3.1.

E.  Financing plan
3.6       The proposed Bank loan of US$75 million equivalent would finance 27%
of the total financing required or 79% of the foreign exchange. At the
Government's request, the Bank loan would finance only equipment and associated
materials. Civil works and project support would be financed locally through a
US$38.48 million loan from the Regional Development Fund, US$59.85 million loan
from the Environmental Fund, US$19.45 million from the Pusan city general
account, US$100.23 million from internal cash generation, and US$12.10 million
from the Government through MOE's budget (Table 3.2). The financing plan was
confirmed at negotiations.

3.7       The borrower would be the Republic of Korea.  The proposed Bank loan
would be for 15 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. A part of the loan (US$60 million) would be onlent to the
Pusan city government on the same terms as the Bank loan, including the foreign
exchange and interest risks, plus 0.05% administrative charge. The execution of
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and the Pusan city would be a
condition of disbursement for Pusan component.   A separate project agreement
would be executed between the Bank and Pusan city with covenants on operational,
financial and monitoring aspects.
3.8       The remainder of the loan (US$15 million) would be passed on to MOE.
The foreign exchange and interest risks would be borne by the Government. MOE
would enter into Kunsan plant contract with EMC to build and operate the plant
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. These would include EMC's
obligation to proceed in accordance with the Bank's requirements on operational,
financial and monitoring aspects. The execution of the contract between MOE and
EMC would be a condition of disbursement for the Kunsan component.
F. Implementation
3.9       PSM would implement the Pusan component from January 1995 through June
1999 and EMC's solid waste treatment plants department would implement the Kunsan
component from January 1996 through June 1999. Consultants to assist with
supervision would be appointed for Pusan in January 1995 and for Kunsan in
January 1996. Their duties would include ensuring compliance with specifications
for works  and goods,  adhering  to  the  construction  schedule,  testing  and
commissioning completed works and preparing progress and other reports.
3.10      The project works are expected to be operating by June 1998 in Kunsan
and about one year later in Pusan; however, the test operation of new facilities
and  some  minor  landscaping  works  would  extend  till  December  1999.    The
implementation schedule (Annex 4) is considered realistic since PSM, which would
implement the greater of the two components, has experience with projects of
similar size and composition, and the custom-made Kunsan component would be
carried out by a contractor with single responsibility for both civil works and
installation of equipment. In addition, as part of the contract, the contractor
would provide about one year technical assistance to train EMC staff in
management of incinerator operations.
3.11      During negotiations both implementing agencies confirmed adherence to
implementation action plans defining the scope and timing of actions needed to
carry out the project successfully. The plans are available in the project file
and summaries of the plans are shown in Annex 5.
G. Land acquisition
3.12      The expansion of the WTP in Pusan would be located on 8 ha of land
reclaimed from the Nakdong river by Korea Water Resources Corporation in 1988
allocated for this purpose by the city land-use plan. Pusan has purchased the
plot and would take possession in early 1995. The plot acquisition does not
involve involuntary resettlement or related compensation issues.



10
3.13      The specified waste treatment plant in Kunsan would be located on 10
ha of land reclaimed by the Korea Land Development Corporation from the Kum river
in 1988 and purchased by MOE in 1991. It has never been used and its acquisition
does not involve involuntary resettlement or related compensation issues.
H. Procurement
3.14      Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3:

aZ Civil works associated with Kunsan incinerator
Note: All amounts include contingencies and those in parentheses are to be
financed by the Bank. N.B.F. are items not-Bank-financed.
3.15      Civil works, (US$134.61 million), implementation support comprising
hiring of consultants for construction supervision (US$5.69 million), and land
(US$25.13 million), would be financed locally and procured through local
procedures.
3.16      Contracts for the supply, installation and commissioning of equipment,
estimated at about US$102.33 million, would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD).
Contracts for the procurement of the custom-made incinerator in Kunsan would be
procured through a two-stage bidding procedure among single responsibility pre-
qualified bidders. At Government request, locally manufactured goods would be
granted a preference of 15%, or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower.
3.17      Under  the  Pusan component,  materials  and equipment  packaged  in
individual contracts that do not exceed US$250,000 each, and in aggregate amounts
that do not exceed US$3.0 million, would be procured through LCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
3.18      Prequalification procedures and contracts for goods amounting US$1.0
million equivalent or more shall be subject to prior review by the Bank. The
General Procurement Notice was published in the Development Business on July 16,
1994.



11
I. Disbursement
3.19      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against either 100%
of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials, 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment and materials,
or 65% of local expenditures for other equipment and materials procured locally.
Disbursements for equipment contracts of US$1.0 million or less would be made on
the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE).   Supporting documentation for
these expenditures would be retained by implementing agencies, made available for
review by Bank supervision missions, and regularly audited (para 4.6). Two
special accounts of US$3.0 million (Pusan special account) and US$1.0 million
(EMC special account) would be established by Pusan city and EMC at commercial
banks to facilitate loan disbursement. The special accounts would be replenished
monthly or whenever the available balance in the accounts dropped below 50% of
the initial deposit, whichever occurred first.
3.20      Project implementation would extend over five years. Disbursement
would be completed and the loan closed on June 30, 2000. A schedule of estimated
disbursements as well as a profile of disbursement under previous Bank-assisted
water and sewerage projects are shown in Annex 6.
J. Environmental impact
3.21      The project has been designed with the key objective of improving the
environment and, consequently, would have a strong positive impact. Expansion of
the Janglim WTP would reduce contamination of water in the Nakdong river and
improve water quality near the discharge area. Construction of Kunsan SWI would
render harmless specified waste generated in Chunbuk province. The environmental
impact assessments (EIA) of both components were approved by MOE and summaries
made available to the Board in September 1994.   The EIAs, MOE approval and
mitigation actions, summarized in Annex 7, were reviewed during appraisal and
found satisfactory.
3.22      The Janglim interceptor sewers and WTP would collect and treat 615,000
m3/d of raw wastewater that would otherwise reach the Nakdong river upstream of
the salinity barrage via numerous small streams and ditches. It would reduce the
pollution by about 60 t/d BOD and 109 t/d SS of which 46% would be removed as a
result of the expansion of the Janglim plant under this project.  The Kunsan
component would provide treatment for 60 t/d of specified waste. This would
account for 23% of the amount generated in Chunbuk province in 1997 and 13% in
2001. (The balance would be treated at source or by private waste disposal
companies).
3.23      The proposed measures to mitigate the major negative impacts during
construction of both components include appropriate foundation of structures;
provision of adequate drainage with retention ponds; protection against dust,
noise, vibration and odor. These requirements would be included in the
construction contract. In respect of operations, for the Pusan component,
tertiary treatment facilities with a capacity of 615,000 m3/d would reduce
residual pollutants and a program would be designed to monitor water quality
around the discharge area.   Facilities generating odor would be roofed and



12
deodorized and a green belt around the plant established. For the Kunsan
component automatically monitored air pollution control equipment would be
installed with the incinerator; gases would be treated by a wet-alkali scrubber
and an electrostatic dust collector would remove particulate matter. These items
of equipment have been incorporated in the design and would form part of the
specification of the incinerator. The Janglim WTP and Kunsan SWI have been
designed to satisfy the stricter environmental standards effective from January
1999. The mitigating actions and standards for quality of effluent and emissions
are satisfactory.
3.24      Operational  monitoring  for  compliance  with  the  EIA,  including
treatment performance and environmental impacts would be conducted by the PSM and
the EMC for their components. Compliance with standards would be monitored by the
provincial and city governments and enforced by MOE's regional offices. To
confirm planning assumptions on performance and also to strengthen mitigating
plans, PSM and MOE (para 4.1) would prepare a one-year environmental monitoring
program which would begin six month prior to the start of operations. During
negotiations, an agreement was reached that by June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1998,
MOE and Pusan city, respectively, would implement an environmental monitoring
program, satisfactory to the Bank, to collect and evaluate data on performance
and the environmental impact of each plant and, upon evaluation of results, each
would prepare a plan to mitigate potential adverse impacts and submit the plan
to the Bank for review. A detailed description of environmental status and impact
is shown in Annex 7.
K. Supervision
3.25      The proposed project would be supervised in the field semi-annually
to review implementation progress, technical and financial matters, quality of
construction, compliance with loan covenants and environmental requirements, and
to discuss any relevant matters with the Government and implementing agencies.
Office supervision at headquarters would involve reviews of progress reports,
procurement actions and preparation of various project related correspondence.
Supervision by the Bank would require about 96 staff-weeks over the life of the
project, of which about 46 staff-weeks would be in Washington and 50 staff-weeks
in the field. Supervision would require expertise in sanitary engineering, water
and air pollution control, incineration, and financial analysis.
3.26      PSM and MOE would forward to the Bank semi-annual component status
reports, various annual financial and audit reports, and, within six months of
project completion, an evaluation report on project implementation. The proposed
supervision plan, and outlines for progress and for evaluation reports are shown
in Annex 8. During negotiations the implementing agencies confirmed concurrence
with proposed content of progress and evaluation reports.

IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Implementing agencies
4.1       The Pusan component would be implemented by the Pusan Sewerage Management
Office (PSM) of the city's Construction Bureau and the Kunsan component by the
Environmental Management Corporation on behalf of the Waste Management and Recycling
Bureau of MOE. The implementing agencies have carried out similar projects and are
experienced in project implementation.   Once construction is completed, PSM will
operate the WTP and EMC the specified waste treatment plant (para 3.8).
B. Organization and management
4.2       Pusan city government (PCG), led by the mayor, functions through a number
of bureaus each headed by a director-general who is responsible for control,
planning,  and budgeting.   Construction and operation of network facilities are
generally decentralized to the city's 12 districts and 231 sub-districts.   The
Construction Bureau consists of divisions and management offices, including the PSM.
PSM's two divisions are responsible for engineering, operation, planning,
administration and accounting.   Construction management  is centralized in the
construction center. PCG's and PSM's organizations are shown in Chart 1.
4.3       EMC's executive director for engineering heads three departments for
engineering, WTPs and solid waste treatment plants. The solid waste treatment plant
department, headed by a manager, supervises and controls design and construction of
specified waste treatment plants.   The Kunsan specified waste treatment (KTP),
scheduled to start in 1995, will be headed by a plant manager.   Operations of
treatment plants is the responsibility of the executive director for plant
management. MOE's and EMC's organizational structures are shown in Charts 2 and 3.
C. Accounting and auditing
4.4       PSM's and EMC's accounting and budgeting procedures are satisfactory.
Pusan city budgets are prepared according to Government's guidelines and approved
by the city council.   Districts prepare their own budgets, which,  after being
approved by the district councils, are forwarded to the city bureaus for budget
support. Budgets are divided into general and special accounts. General accounts
provide for the majority of city operations while revenue-earning activities
including water supply, sewerage, and housing are organized as financially
autonomous special accounts. All general and special accounts follow traditional
government cash flow accounting.   The PSM sewerage special account (SSA) keeps
separate accounts for WTPs and central office administration, consolidates its own
activities with those of the districts at the end of each year, and makes
adjustments to comply with accrual accounting principles. The SSA consolidated year
end accounts are independently audited. PSM will maintain the project accounts.
4.5       Under  EMC's  control  and  supervision,  each plant keeps  computerized
commercially-based accounts for its own activities. Within 15 days of the end of
each month, accounts are sent to EMC head office to be checked and consolidated. The
Kunsan specified waste treatment plant accounts (SWA) will be audited by auditors
acceptable to the Bank. Project accounts will be kept by EMC.



14
4.6       During  negotiations,  assurances  were  obtained  that  the  financial
statements of SSA and SWA would be audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank. Such
statements and audit reports would also include a separate opinion on Statement of
Expenditures and the Pusan and EMC special accounts for the Bank loan, and would be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
D. Billing and collection
4.7        In agreement with the operating agencies the Pusan water agency (PWA)
prepares monthly computerized combined bills for water supply, sewerage, and solid
waste.  In 1994 there are 321,000 sewerage customer accounts. Meter reading is done
by the PWA site offices, and the results forwarded to PWA headquarters for bill
preparation and updating the accounts receivable ledger. Bills are hand delivered
and are paid at banks, which transfer receipts into the individual agencies bank
accounts every two weeks. Payment is due within one month of delivery, and interest
penalties are charged on overdue accounts. If the combined bill is not paid within
two months, PWA takes appropriate action including disconnection of the water
supply.   Summaries of billings and collections, as well as overdue accounts, are
sent to the districts twice per month. Accounts receivable at the end of 1993 was
equal to 45 days sales, and the bad debt provision for 1993 was one percent of
revenues, both of which are acceptable.
4.8       Preparation of bills for the collection, and disposal of specified waste
is done at the individual plant, and this procedure will be adopted by SWA on the
commencement of its operation. The plant's or contractors' vehicles collect the
waste which is weighed and analyzed when it arrives at the plant. Tariffs are then
applied to the waste content and details are recorded for month-end billings, which
itemize deliveries or collections from each customer during the month. Bills should
be paid direct to EMC within 25 days of the date of issue. Existing plants each
have around 400 active customer accounts and have not experienced any bad debts.
Monthly reports on billing are sent to EMC's head office by the middle of each
month. Accounts receivable for the specified waste plants at the end of 1993 was
equal to 30 days' sales, which is satisfactory.
E. Staffing and training
4.9       Staffing levels at PSM head office,  WTPs,  and district offices are
satisfactory. The present 280 permanent staff working on wastewater collection and
treatment is expected to increase to around 450 in 1999 when Nambu WTP and the
second phase of Janglim WTP are in operation. MOE and MOHA hold training programs
for operational, technical, administrative, and accounting staff.  All permanent
employees attend courses every year for two to three weeks, and additional special
training is provided after every five years of service.
4.10       Around 130 staff work at the existing specified waste plants, with 83 in
the technical and 47 in the general offices. EMC head office staff of 185 consists
of engineers,  technicians and administrative employees.   On-the-job training is
provided at the two plants, and all technicians receive annual training for one week
at the Government environmental training center.  The Kunsan plant is expected to
have around 50 staff trained on the optimal operation of the facility, as well as
maintenance of the equipment.   Also about 30 person months of overseas training
would be included in the SWI construction contract (para 3.10).

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Rate structure
5.1       The Pusan sewerage tariff was introduced in 1985 based on an operational
cost estimate for six years, and remained unchanged until the end of 1993 when the
multiple-year average tariff policy was abolished. In January 1994, the city council
approved an increase of 9.9%, which raised the average sewerage rate to W 86.56/m3.
Residential and commercial customers are billed at increasing block rates, based on
metered water consumption. Industrial, government and institutional customers are
charged at a fixed rate per cubic meter.
5.2       PSM annually  reviews  the  levels  of  its  sewerage  charges  to ensure
sufficient revenues are generated to cover operating costs and depreciation, and
provide funds towards its capital expenditure program. To attain adequate levels of
cost recovery, PSM uses a cash generation target in its tariff calculation instead
of a rate of return on the value of fixed assets, due to the volatility of the value
of assets in Korea (for example, in the five year period to 1993 the value of land
in PSM's asset register increased by 325%).
5.3       Charges for treatment and disposal of specified waste at plants operated
by EMC were first introduced in 1987 and would be adopted by KTP on commencement of
the plant's operations. Tariffs are based on the method of treatment applied, which
include incineration, physical and chemical treatment, or landfill disposal. Tariffs
vary, depending on the type, chemical composition, and calorific value of the waste
to be treated, and are set to cover operating costs including depreciation, a
contribution to EMC head office costs, and, if required, compensation to adjacent
residents.   The rates currently used were introduced in 1992, and requests for
tariff adjustments proposed by EMC must be approved by MOE and EPB. Tariff policy
requires EMC to operate facilities without any Government subsidy.
B. Fixed assets and revaluation
5.4       SSA fixed asset register records details of all WTPs, pumping stations,
interceptors, network, equipment and other assets, the value of which is recorded
on the balance sheet. SSA fixed assets were revalued in 1993 and, to comply with
five year period between revaluation required for special accounts, should be
revalued in 1998. PCG is responsible for ensuring that these assets are adequately
insured.
5.5       Following the construction of KTP, MOE will retain ownership of the plant
and equipment, and the total cost of the plant construction will be recorded in its
asset register. EMC will operate the Kunsan facility on behalf of MOE, fully insure
the assets and maintain complete records of the assets it manages.   These assets
would be depreciated in the SWA accounts, as the depreciation would be part of the
costs to be recovered by tariffs.
C. PSM sewerage special account
5.6       Past  performance  and present  position.  Since  its  inception,  SSA's
financial performance has been satisfactory, as annual revenues have covered all
operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, and contributed to its investment



16
program.  Because SSA's sewerage tariffs remained unchanged from 1985 to the end of
1993, revenues only increased in line with increased sewage volumes which have grown
by 3% per annum since 1992. Depreciation increased in 1993 by over 50% following
the revaluation of assets (para 5.4), and the effect was a fall in operating income
in 1993 by 33%.   Internally generated funds financed around 45% of the 1992-93
capital spending, while the rest was financed largely from local loans and equity
contributions from Pusan city and land developers.
5.7       Financial plan.  SSA's capital spending requirements and financial plan
for the 1995-99 project implementation period are shown in Table 5.1. The financial
plan, including the Pusan city government contribution from its general account, the
Regional Development fund and the Environmental fund loans, and their terms, was
confirmed during negotiations.

5.8       Future finances.   SSA's financial performance  should continue to be
satisfactory throughout the projection period. The project would constitute about
28% of SSA's estimated capital spending of W 800 billion between 1995-99. From 1995
onwards,  SSA  will  need  to  generate  around  25%  of  its  capital  expenditure
requirements  from  internal  sources  to help  finance  its  immediate  and future



17
investment needs.   Financial projections for SSA to 2002 are shown in Annex 9.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SSA would produce, for each
fiscal year starting in 1996, funds from internal sources equivalent to not less
than 25% of the annual average of SSA's capital expenditure.
5.9       Between 1995 and 2002, SSA's revenues and operating income are expected
to increase by around 160%, and net income after interest expenses by 102%.
However, net internal cash generation is only expected to increase by 27% over the
same period due to a substantial increase in debt service payments, from W 7.5
billion in 1995 to W 35.6 billion by 2002. To adjust financing, the plan included
additional loans of W 281 billion (82% local and 18% IBRD). SSA's current ratio is
projected not to fall below 3.3 during the period which is satisfactory.
D. Kunsan specified waste treatment plant account
5.10      Present position. The first phase of the sanitary landfill at the Kunsan
specified waste treatment plant is scheduled to open in 1995 when the first
financial transactions of income and expenditures would occur and be recorded in the
SWA accounting system.
5.11      Financial plan.  SWA's capital spending requirements and financial plan
for the 1995-98 landfill and incineration project implementation period are shown
in Table 5.2. The financial plan was confirmed during negotiations.

5.12      Future finances.  SWA's financial performance during the 1995-2002 period
is set to produce sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses that include
depreciation, a contribution towards EMC headquarter costs, and adequate funds to
cover all compensation payments. To achieve this target, SWA tariffs will need to
be periodically adjusted. SWA's projected income statements, balance sheets,



18
statements of sources and application of funds for 1993-2002 are listed in Annex 10;
the underlying financial assumptions are given in Annex 11. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that SWA would produce, for each of its fiscal years
commencing 1996, total revenues equivalent to not less than the sum of SWA's total
operating expenses including operation and maintenance costs and depreciation, and
total indirect expenses paid to EMC not to exceed 25% of total revenues and would
take all necessary measures including adjusting the structure or levels of its
tariffs in order to meet such requirements.
E. Monitoring and evaluation
5.13      Performance would be monitored against the implementation schedule (Annex
4) and the project implementation plan (Annex 5) while the implementation agencies,
operational, financial and managerial performances will be assessed against the
monitoring indicators in Annex 12 and 13.  During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that PSM and MOE (para 4.1) would send the Bank no later than March 31 and
September 30 of each project year, commencing on March 31, 1996, semi-annual project
progress  reports,  including  revised  project  cost  estimates  and  implementing
schedules and no later than September 30 of each project year, commencing on
September 30, 1996, annual updated financial projections.



19
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Project benefits
6.1       The project would contribute to sustained environmental development,
provide consumers and industries with better services, and a general improvement
in the population health and welfare. In Janglim, the intercepter sewers and WTP
would collect and treat 615,000 m3/d of raw wastewater that would otherwise flow
via numerous small streams into the Nakdong river upstream, and into the estuary
downstream of the salinity barrage. The pollution reaching the river would be
reduced by about 28 t/d of BOD and 50 t/d of SS as a result of expansion of the
plant under this project (para 3.22).  This would reduce the health risk for
commercial fishing, water sports and recreation from contact with polluted water,
improve air quality by eliminating unpleasant odors, improve the city's overall
environment, and protect beaches which are important for extensive tourism in the
area.   The provision of tertiary treatment for up to 615,000 m3/d of water
suitable for industrial use would create additional benefits: first, it would
reduce residual pollution by 5 t/d BOD and 6 t/d SS, and second, for any quantity
of treated effluent used by industry, the Pusan fresh water sources would be
available for residential use to the same extent.
6.2       The major benefits of KTP are clearly environmental.  The plant would
provide intermediate and final disposal for the most hazardous wastes in a
situation where the generators find it increasingly difficult to find safe and
publicly acceptable methods of treatment and disposal.  The incinerator would
dispose of 60 t/d of specified waste which, in 1997, would represent 23% of the
quantity  generated throughout Chunbuk province.   The  immeasurable benefit
provided by the incinerator would be in the safe elimination of the waste instead
of it being scattered throughout the countryside, damaging the environment and
endangering the public.
B. Rate of return
6.3       The economic rate of return has not been evaluated for following
reasons.   The detailed information regarding various impacts of the present
pollution on water quality to current and potential users, including potential
damage caused by inappropriate disposal of specified waste is not readily
available and the generation of such data is considered impractical. Also, the
methodologies available for estimating the economic benefits which would result
from protecting or improving the quality of the environment have many
limitations.
6.4       The financial rate of return (FRR) of the Pusan component which in
constant prices relates the sewerage revenues to the capital and operating cost
of sewerage facilities, was computed to provide an indication of minimum economic
return.   The FRR, estimated at 5%, is considered adequate in light of the
beneficial nature of the project, and is considerably less than the economic
rate. Non-quantifiable benefits are significant. In addition to improved health
and cleaner environment, the project is also beneficial for the expansion of
tourism in the Pusan area. The sensitivity analysis assessing an increase in the
capital cost by 10%, and a one-year delay in project construction plus a 10X
increase in operating costs would bring the FRR down to 3% which is adequate.



20
Computation of the FRR, and assumptions used, are shown in Annex 14.
6.5       In case of the Kunsan component, the FRR assessment is to be applied
for the entire specified waste treatment plant.   Its financial viability and
satisfactory performance require that at a minimum, revenues should cover all
operating  and maintenance  expenses  including depreciation.    The  financial
discipline imposed is intended to encourage efficient management of the entity.
The break-even covenant (para 5.12) imposes a zero FRR, and, therefore its
calculation is meaningless and not presented.
C. Least-cost solution
6.6       The design of the Pusan component represents the least-cost solution
for expanding the capacity of Janglim WTP. The location of the plant, the phasing
of its expansion, the treatment technology, and the alignment and design of the
sewers were selected after evaluation of several alternatives during preparation
of Pusan's sewerage master plan. The second phase expansion of the plant would
be essentially the same in the scale and type of treatment units to those
constructed in the first phase (para 3.3). The method of treatment (activated
sludge) is quite appropriate for large communities and for areas with a high
population density where the cost of land is at a premium. The provision of a
filtration plant using flocculation, rapid upward flow filters and disinfection
(para 3.3) represents the least-cost solution for improving the WTP effluent to
a standard of quality suitable for industrial use.
6.7       Private waste disposal enterprises operating in the country have been
avoiding investment in plants handling most polluted specified waste essentially
because of fear that the public would prevent operation of the facility once the
investment has been made. These circumstances have lead the Government, through
the National Comprehensive Waste Disposal Plan (paragraph 1.6), to take the
initiative and establish integrated waste treatment plants in major industrial
estates. It also decided that the pricing for treatment and disposal should not
deter generators from using treatment facilities, and has set tariffs to achieve
a break-even position, however, without any form of operational subsidy. KTP,
as the first integrated specified waste treatment plant to be implemented under
the Plan, would use state-of-the-art technology to set standards for future
specified waste treatment plants and to serve as a training facility. Its design,
location and chosen technology represent the least-cost solution for the task.
D. Affordability
6.8       Charges for water supply and sewerage in Korea are reasonable, and do
not impose an undue burden on household incomes. The average water supply tariff
for residential use is W 229.8 per cubic meter (US$0.29), and for sewerage is W
86.5 (US$0.11). The total water supply and sewerage charge per capita equates
to less than one percent of average incomes. For the lowest income currently
around W 310,000 per month, and one wage earner per low- income household, the
water and sewerage charge at the new projected levels would represent less than
4% of gross household income throughout the projection period. A measure of the
willingness to pay for sewerage services is that bills are paid within 40 days
of delivery, and the amount written-off as uncollectible is less than one percent
of total billing.



21
E. Project risks
6.9       Non significant risks are expected during implementation; at Janglim
an almost identical treatment plant was constructed on an adjacent site where
ground conditions are similar and the interceptor sewers and pumping stations to
be built in the catchment area do not present any unusual difficulties. In Kunsan
the Government has regular consultations with the public in the project area and
intends to continue in this way during construction in order to maximize public
cooperation.  The decision to execute both components within the planned schedule
has been taken and financing is being secured.
6.10         The possibility that the facilities may not be operated properly
poses a potential risk to the environment. However, monitoring instruments to be
installed  as  part  of  the  project,  linked witn  local  vigilance  and  the
Government's capacity to take legal action in response to negligence, would limit
long-term risks to a minimum.



22
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government and the
Pusan city that:
(a) By June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1998 MOE and Pusan city, respectively, would
implement an environmental monitoring program, satisfactory to the Bank, to
collect and evaluate data on plants' performance and environmental impact and,
upon evaluation of results, each would prepare a plan to mitigate potential
adverse impacts and submit the plan to the Bank for review (para 3.24);
(b) The financial statements of SSA and SWA would be audited by auditors acceptable
to the Bank. Such statements and audit reports would also include a separate
opinion on Statement of Expenditures and the special account for the Bank loan,
and would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each
fiscal year (para 4.6);
(c) SSA would produce, for each fiscal year starting in 1996, funds from internal
sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual average of SSA's capital
expenditure (para 5.8);
(d)  SWA would produce, for each fiscal year starting in 1996, revenues equal to not
less than the sum of its total operating expenses, including operation and
maintenance costs and depreciation, and total indirect expenses not to exceed
25% of total revenues, and would take all necessary measures including
adjusting the structure and levels of its tariffs in order to meet such
requirements (para 5.12);
(e) Pusan city and MOE would send the Bank semi-annual project progress reports,
including revised project cost estimates and implementing schedules no later
than March 31 and September 30, of each project year, as well as their annual
updated financial projections no later than September 30 (paras 3.26 and 5.13).
7.2       During negotiations the following was confirmed:  (a) adherence to the
implementation plans defining the scope and timing of actions needed to carry out
the project; (b) the SSA financial plan, including the Pusan city contribution from
its general account, as well as the regional development and environmental fund
loans and their terms, and (c) the SWA financial plan (paras 3.11, 5.7 and 5.11).
7.3       The loan would be onlent in amount US$60 million equivalent to the Pusan
city on the same terms as the Bank loan, including the foreign exchange and interest
risks, plus 0.05% administrative charge.   Execution of subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and the Pusan city, and of Kunsan plant contract between MOE
and EMC would be the condition of disbursement for the respective component (paras
3.7 and 3.8)
7.4       Subject to the above assurances and conditions,  the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$75 million equivalent, for a
period of 15 years, including a grace period of five years, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The borrower would be the Republic of Korea.

KOREA
WASTE DISPOSAL PROJECT
MANAGEMENT OF LIOUID AND SOLID WASTE IN THE PROJECT AREA
Project area
1.    Pusan city lies in the south-east of the Korean peninsula; it is the second
largest city and principal sea-port. It's population has grown from 1.3 million in
1963 to about 3.9 million in 1990 and it is expected to grow to 4.8 million by 2001.
Due to boundary extensions and land reclamation, it's area has expanded from 350.3
km2 in 1963 to 529.4 km2 in 1989.   Pusan is divided into twelve administrative
districts (Gu) and 231 sub-districts (Dong).
2.    Kunsan city lies in the north-west of Chunbuk province on the south bank of
the Kum river 220 km southwest of Seoul. Its population of 350,000 will grow to
450,000 in 2001 through both immigration and expansion of boundaries. Its area of
355 km2 will be increased to 495 km2 by incorporation of neighboring districts and
by land reclamation. The integrated specified waste treatment plant (KTP), is being
constructed within the Kunsan city area in the second industrial estate which is
situated on reclaimed land on the south bank of the Kum river mouth, about 10 km
west of Kunsan city center.
Economic activity
3.    Pusan is Korea's gateway for international trade. It is also an important
manufacturing center with light industries such as chemicals, textiles and leather
as well as heavy industries including metallurgy, manufacturing and shipbuilding.
Many of the businesses are small and those with fewer than 300 employees make up 90%
of the 600,000 people employed by manufacturing companies; about 2% is employed in
heavy industry, 37% in light industry and 61% in services.
4.    Until recently Chunbuk province with two million population has had a minor
share in the country's growth but the Government is now implementing industrial
expansion in the region. In the Kum river mouth the Korea Land Development
Corporation is reclaiming land and providing serviced plots for a major complex of
three industrial estates located west and southwest of Kunsan, with total area of
about 43 km2. The first estate (6 km2) has been completed with almost all plots
taken by heavy and light industries.  The land for the second estate (16 km2) is
being reclaimed in phases; services for industrial sites on the first phase were
completed in 1993 and selling of plots is proceeding. Kunsan city has also commenced
construction of a wastewater treatment plant, and EMC has started secured landfill
for specified waste. The third estate (21 km2) is in the planning stage. The first
estate, when fully developed will employ about 6,000 and the second about 16,000.

municipal corporation. In 1990 water services were provided to 3.8 million people
or 97.6% of the population. The daily average production was 1.5 million m3/d, or
360 lcd (including about 38% of non-revenue water). There were 294,000 service
connections of which 78% were residential using 61% of the total supply; of the
remainder 30% were commercial/ industrial and 9% were for public use. The water
agency plans to expand production and distribution capacities and is already
constructing two river intakes and treatment plants for an additional 1.1 million
m3/d made up of 300,000 m3/d of industrial water and 800,000 m3/d of drinking water.
These plants are being developed in stages and are expected to be producing by 1995
and completed by 2001. Production and sales are shown in Table A 1.1.

Sewerage and drainage master plan
6.    The 1993 revised sewerage and drainage master plan (SMP) has a 2011 time
horizon and proposes 9 sewerage districts each with own sewers, interceptors,
pumping stations and WTPs. The plan defines the sewered area as being the built up
area provided or to be provided with a sewer. A summary of the plan's projection of
sewer planning areas and related populations is shown in Table A 1.2.

7.    The total plan area for 1996 is 176 km2, the districts served by WTP's at
Janglim, Suyeong and Nambu (formerly Yongho) accounting for 50, 40 and 42 km2, which
together is 132 km2 or 75% of the whole sewer plan area. Each of the three districts
has more than one million inhabitants and together make up more than 75% of Pusan's
population. Table A 1.3 shows the areas of these three districts and the other
districts combined, the projected population for 1996 and 2006 and the lengths of
interceptor sewers proposed in the plan.

9.    The  plan  evaluated  alternative  arrangements  for  collecting  storm  and
wastewater and recommended separate systems to be implemented by 2006. Initially
interceptor sewers would be provided with storm overflows which would be modified
later to become trunk mains in the sanitary sewerage system.
Sewerage and drainage system
10.   The development of the drainage and sewerage systems is lagging behind SMP
projections but the trend is improving. Sewer connections have increased from
287,000 in 1990 to 321,000 in 1994, now serving about 97% of the population. The
drainage system at present is about 30% piped, the rest being ditches alongside
roads and open channels. Until the systems function separately the city is concerned
to prevent raw sewage solids from entering open drains. The city regulations,
therefore, require all premises to be equipped for pre-treatment (mainly by septic
tanks) before discharging into public sewers.
Wastewater treatment
11.   The WTP expansion program has been in progress since 1984; the first plant,
completed in 1988, being the first phase of Suyeong (286,000 m3/d); the second phase
now under construction will be completed in 1997. At Janglim the first phase
(330,000 m3/d) was completed in 1991 and at Nambu the first phase (340,000 m3/d)
will be in operation by 1996. The construction program proposed in the SMP for
construction of treatment plants is shown in Table A 1.6

12.   The existing as well as proposed treatment plants use a conventional activated
sludge process whereby sludge is digested, dewatered and disposed of at the city's
sanitary landfill. (Some sludge is now temporarily disposed of at sea).
Operation and maintenance
13.   Sewerage services are provided by the Pusan Sewerage Management Office (PSM)
of the Construction Bureau. The drainage system is maintained by the district and
subdistrict construction divisions.   The WTPs, including interceptor sewers and
wastewater pumping stations are operated and maintained by the respective WTP staff
of about 100 at each plant. The WTP directors report to PSM. Financing the operation
and maintenance of the sewerage system is provided from the sewerage special account
administered by PSM, and the districts.
Solid waste
14.   Solid waste services are provided by the Cleansing Department (CD) of the
Environmental and Green Bureau. The CD has three divisions which deal with the
collection and transportation of waste, nightsoil and septage, and controls the
operation of the sanitary landfill sites and incinerators. Solid waste operation is
partly privatized and 27 companies under contract with the districts deal with about
a third of the work; the remainder is dealt with by the city employees. Most of the
1.75 million tons collected annually goes to sanitary landfill but some is
incinerated or recovered for recycling. CD has a program of incinerator installation
as shown on Table A 1.7.

15.   There is very strong local resistance to sanitary landfill sites throughout
Korea, and Pusan is no exception. The department has had difficulty in obtaining



27

Page   5
present sites at Ulsuk and Senggok both of which are located west of the city. Ulsuk
closed recently, but Senggok, with sufficient capacity to last until the year 2000,
will open in 1995. The department anticipates continued local resistance for the
foreseeable future and in its plans for development, recognizes that as an important
factor when identifying disposal methods and potential sites.
Nightsoil and septage disposal.
16.   Nightsoil and septage are collected and transported to a treatment plant at
Kamjong on the Nakdong river where, after passing through grit channels, the liquor
is pumped on to barges for disposal at sea. During 1993 about 2,600 m3/d of
nightsoil and 5,500 m3/d of septage were removed; the quantity of nightsoil is
expected to decrease substantially over the next ten years as properties are
connected to the sewerage system.
Water reuse
17.   For the past twenty years the Government has adopted a number of courses and
policies to delay and eventually reverse the serious deterioration of the
environment  resulting  from  rapid  urban  expansion  and  industrial  growth.  In
particular,  these policies have aimed at restoring the environment along the
nation's rivers and coastline. As a result of Government direction, communities
within a river basin are expected to treat their liquid waste to meet MOE standards.
Pusan is actively supporting central Government policies in this regard and since
1984 has been constructing interceptor sewers to minimize the discharge of
wastewater into rivers and coastal waters, and to convey intercepted wastewater to
treatment plants designed to produce effluent of high quality.
18.   Pusan is now advancing beyond the level of purification and discharge of
treated wastewater and proposes to further treat wastewater from Janglim plant to
a standard suitable for industrial use. This policy is expected to bring two
benefits. First, it would reduce the quantity of treated effluent discharged into
the Nakdong river; and second,it would enable the Pusan water agency reduce the
quantity of water which it would otherwise take from the Nakdong river.
Kunsan specified waste disposal
Waste policy and strategy
19.   Government waste policy anticipates involvement of both private and public
sectors with the latter responsible for (a) policy and management, (b) filling in
areas where the private sector faces difficulties which it cannot reasonably
control, such as resistance to disposal sites, and (c) disposal of dangerous
categories of specified waste. The strategy goals for waste management are reducing
the volume of waste, increasing recycling, permitting construction only of sanitary
landfills, and increasing incineration of waste to reduce the burden on landfill
sites which are difficult to acquire. The policy goals are shown in Table A 1.9.

20.   MOE identifies (a) general waste which includes residential waste and non-
toxic work-site waste and (b) specified waste, which includes toxic work-site waste.
There are currently 22 specified waste categories, such as acids and alkalis, oil,
organic solvents, asbestos, mining ash, pesticides, polychlorinated bi-phenyl (PCB),
sludge containing heavy metals and animal residues. In many countries these are
classified as hazardous.
21.   For various reasons, -one being the uncertainty in forecasting the generation
of specified waste and the other the concern that the public would not allow
operation after the facilities were built-, the private sector has little presence
in intermediate treatment (incinerators, high temperature crackers, etc.) and almost
none in the final treatment of specified waste. In order to eliminate unacceptable
or illegal disposal of specified waste the Government plans that by 2001 the public
sector will complete expanded intermediate treatment facilities in six MOE regions,
including Chunbuk.
Generation of specified waste in Chunbuk
22.   The generation of specified waste in Chunbuk province where the Kunsan plant
is located, is currently about 45,000 t/y and estimated to increase to about 50,000
t/y in 1997 and 95,000 t/y in 2001. The largest component is waste oil which will
reach approximately 25,000 t/y in 1997 and 57,000 t/y in 2001, of which 56% and 48%
respectively, will be recycled at source. Other waste constituents, such as organic
solvents, plastics and heavy metal sludge will have significantly lower rates of
recycling. The projections of specified waste quantities generated in Chunbuk are
shown in Table A 1.10.

23.   On the basis of these projections, it is estimated that approximately one
third to one fifth of generated specified waste would be incinerated by the new
plant at Kunsan with the remainder being treated by private operators. The estimate
of specified waste to be treated by the Kunsan incinerator is shown in Table A 1.11.

Specified waste management facilities, operation and maintenance
24.   EMC treatment and disposal plants for specified waste are located in Onsan and
Hwasung. The Onsan plant is located on a 4 ha site in a coastal industrial area,
about 20 km north of Pusan. It consists of a physical-chemical treatment plant, dual
rotary kiln incinerator, solid stabilization operations, and landfill cells. The
plant has a capacity of 127 t/d based on 22 t/d of incineration, 30 t/d of physical-
chemical treatment and 75 t/d of landfill disposal.
25.   The Hwasung plant is located in the rural area of Hwaseon district, some 80
km southwest of Seoul. The plant is designed to treat and dispose of specified waste
from the Seoul region and PCBs from the entire country and has a capacity of 60 t/d
based on 1 t/d of incineration of PCB and organic phosphates, 19 t/d of physical-
chemical treatment and 40 t/d of solidification and landfill disposal.
26.   The Kunsan specified waste treatment plant is being built in phases. The
specified waste landfill consists of three separate cells (capacity 3 x 71,000 m3),
each protected against leakage by 40 cm of clay mixed with bentonite and two layers
of high density polyethylene membrane between three layers of geotextile. Leachate
will be treated in the plant's own facility using activated sludge process followed
by sand filtration, activated carbon and ion-exchange filtration. The volume of
leachate will be minimized by covering the active cells by roofing and filled cells
by a polyethylene membrane between two geotextile layers and 1.0 m soil cover. The
impermeability of the protective lower shell will be monitored by eight wells
located around the landfill. The pressure of groundwater on the protective shell
will be controlled by drainage and wells. The incinerator is described in Annex 2.

Demand for the Pusan and Kunsan components
27.   In Pusan the rapid extension of the interceptor system discharging to Janglim
WTP will increase the load on the plant far beyond it's capacity of 330,000 m3/d.
The proposal to increase capacity by 285,000 m3/d to 615,000 m3/d is timely since
the maximum daily flow is expected to reach 607,000 m3/d by 2001. The proposal by
PSM to introduce tertiary treatment and thus provide a substantial supply of water
suitable for industrial use responds positively to Government policy in this regard.
The Pusan water agency supplies domestic, industrial and commercial consumers so
that the contribution that Janglim can make for industrial use would increase
potable water availability for other consumers and defer the need for increased
abstraction from the Nakdong river.
28.   There is at present no capacity in Chunbuk province for treatment and disposal
of the most hazardous specified waste. The projections for the province indicate
that out of total generation of 95,000 t/y in 2001, the generators would treat on
site about 35,000 t/y and private operators would treat and dispose of further about
30,000 t/y of the lesser contaminated specified waste, leaving about 30,000 t/y of
the most contaminated waste without a capacity for its treatment and final disposal.
Since the private sector has not sought and is not planning to establish facilities
for these waste there is a need for public sector to provide these services.

WASTE DISPOSAL PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.    The project includes Pusan and Kunsan components. The detailed description of
physical facilities is as follows:
2.    The Pusan component includes expansion of the wastewater treatment plant (WTP)
at Janglim comprising the construction of primary and secondary treatment units
(285,000 m3/d) to increase the current capacity from 330,000 m3/d to 615,000 m3/d;
tertiary treatment units to render the WTP effluent suitable for reuse as industrial
water; 4.7 km of interceptor sewers ranging from 0.35 m to 1.35 m in diameter; and
two pumping stations of 45,800 m3/d and 89,800 m3/d capacity.
Wastewater treatment
3.    Janglim WTP is located on the east bank near the mouth of the Nakdong river
and serves one of the city's principal wastewater catchment districts. The district
is about 27 km long and 4-5 km wide bounded along it's length by the river to the
west and a range of hills to the east. Wastewater generated in the district is
conveyed to the WTP by 35 km of interceptor sewers made of pipes varying in diameter
from 0.4 m-1.8 m and box sections up to 3 m x 2 m near the WTP. Construction of the
interceptor system is on-going and at present about half the district is served.
Three pumping stations are in operation and a further eight are being constructed
or planned with a completion target of 1997.
4.    The WTP is being developed in three phases. The first, with a capacity of
330,000 m3/d was commissioned in 1990. The second would increase capacity by 285,000
m3/d to 615,000 m3/d and the third, scheduled for 2005, would add 96,000 m3/d,
providing a final capacity of 711,000 m3/d.
5.    The treatment technology for each phase is a conventional activated sludge
process and the treatment units are similar, except for the final settling tanks
which are circular in the first phase and rectangular in the second phase. The
second phase of the treatment plant includes the following elements: (a) primary
treatment including screens, grit removal chambers and settling tanks; (b) secondary
treatment including aeration tanks with diffused air and settling tanks; (c) primary
sludge concentration in thickeners, surplus activated sludge concentration by
centrifuge and dewatering of the combined sludges on belt press filters; (d)
effluent disinfection; (e) pumping equipment for lifting wastewater and sludge
handling; and (f) buildings to house pumps, blowers, disinfection equipment, sludge
dewatering equipment and stores. The administration buildings built under the first
phase which includes control room, laboratory and social facilities, would be
extended. The sludge digesters built under the first phase have sufficient capacity
to deal with sludge from both phases. Dewatered sludge and solids collected at
screens and grit removal chambers from both first and second phases (160 t/d in
total) would be disposed of at Senggok sanitary landfill. The potential of heavy
metals presence in the sludge is lessening as a result of land use policy under
which factories are moving from the Janglim catchment to new specialized industrial

7.    The second phase would include provision to combat negative environmental
effects normally occurring during plant operation, such as odor from raw sludge
movement, and noise from air blowers and pumping equipment. All units, except for
secondary settling tanks, would be covered with a roof on which would be a park with
sport facilities. Deodorizing equipment would be installed and working areas would
be ventilated to ensure safe working conditions. Buildings housing noisy machinery
would have adequate sound insulation. Roofing would also be provided for the first
phase sludge thickeners.
Tertiary treatment
8. Tertiary treatment, located on the site of the first phase, has been designed
to accept final effluent from the WTP and produce water of a quality suitable for
non-potable use, and made available to the water agency to satisfy demand from

industrial estates in the area surrounding Janglim. The plant would have a
production capacity of 615,000 m3/d. Treatment would be by means of flocculation
uising alum and polymer coagulants, filtration and disinfection. The coagulants would
be injected near the outlets from the aeration tanks. There would be ancillary
pumping equipment and on-site reservoirs to store the treated water. The type and
size of the facilities to be constructed are shown on Table A 2.3.

Clear water reservoir         2           60,000 m3 (each)
Interceptor sewers and pumping stations
9. Wastewater is delivered to Janglim WTP through a system of interceptor sewers
and pumping stations. About 35 km of these interceptors and eight pumping stations
are already operational and work is planned in respect of a further 12 km of sewers
and three pumping stations. The interceptor program is planned for completion by
1998 and would have 47 km of sewers (42 km of circular sewers and 5 km of box
section sewers) and 8 pumping stations. Two of the pumping stations, Kamchon 1 & 2,
with capacities 45,800 m3/d and 89,800 m3/d, respectively, would be financed under
the project.
10. The Kunsan component includes the supply and installation of a specified waste
incinera on unit with capacity of 60 t/d.
Specified waste treatment plant
11.   The incinerator would be an integral component of a comprehensive treatment
and disposal facility (Kunsan integrated specified waste treatment plant - KTP)
which also includes a secured landfill and leachate treatment plant, already under
construction and scheduled completion in 1995. KTP is a part of the Kunsan Second
Industrial Estate located on land reclaimed on the southern bank of the Kum river
estuary, about 20 km west of Kunsan city and 230 km southwest of Seoul.
12.   The incineration unit would include storage for liquid and solid waste, a
shredder, a rotary kiln, a secondary combustion chamber, combustion air preheater,
a semi-dry scrubber, electrostatic precipitator and stack. The equipment would
include monitoring equipment for the safe operation of the various parts of the unit
and safety equipment to cope with any potential hazard within the plant and
automatic monitoring instrumentation for sensing emissions from the stack. Upon
completion of acceptance tests the supplier of the incinerator (contractor) would
provide for operational and maintenance training with the aim of establishing sound
financial management and technical practices, including commercial relationship with
the incinerator customers. The contractor would provide (i) an incinerator
superintendent; (ii) an operating engineer; and (iii) an environmental training
specialist, and would arrange for extensive overseas training of operational staff.

13.   The generation of specified waste in Chunbuk province is currently about
45,000 t/y estimated to increase to 70,000 t/y and 129,000 t/y in 1997 and 2001,
respectively. Approximately one third of the 1997 amount would be incinerated in KTP
with the rest being treated by private operators. A large amount of waste are oils,
primarily lubricating oils with unknown levels of heavy metals and a little sulfur,
waste paints and lacquers from a variety .:f manufacturing operations and dewatered
industrial sludge; these would be incinerated because of the potentially high heavy
metal content.
14.   Emissions from the incinerator would be controlled by special equipment.  Both
a semi-dry scrubber and electrostatic precipitator are to be installed in order to
remove 80% to 95% of the S02 and 95% of particulate matter.   The use of a dry
emission control system would eliminate a specialized wastewater treatment otherwise
needed for wet system.   The ash would be disposed of along with other solid
industrial wastes at the plant's secured landfill. The emission levels would meet
Korean standards for stationary combustion sources for 1999, which are satisfactory.
Stack monitoring would be carried out through the use of a continuous emission
monitoring system which would be monitored on-line by MOE's regional office in
Chonju, Chunbuk province.
Delivery of specified waste in Kunsan
15.         Transportation of specified waste is generally the responsibility of EMC,
currently carried out in conjunction with the two specified waste incinerators at
Onsan and Hwasung. Transport to the Kunsan site would be provided about equally by
EMC and private sector environmental companies. Handling of specified waste would
be carried out according to the guidelines and procedures specified by law.

WASTE DISPOSAL PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
General
1.  The Ministry of Environment (MOE) is the key agency for protection of the
environment in Korea through establishment of policies, standards, and guidelines
for the implementation of the environmental laws; evaluation of Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) prepared for various projects; and monitoring of ambient
environmental quality.
PUSAN COMPONENT
2.  The component comprises the second phase expansion of Janglim WTP increasing its
capacity from the existing 330,000 m3/d to 615,000 m3/d. The WTP effluent is
discharged through the Janglim stream into the Nakdong river downstream of the
salinity barrage. Detailed description of the component is given in Annex 2.
Assessment of environmental imDact
3.  The Pusan Sewerage Management Office (PSM), the implementing agency, submitted
the Janglim WTP EIA study to MOE in December 1986, prior to constructing the first
phase. The report assessed the impacts for a capacity of 580,000 m3/d (considered
to be final at the time) of which 330,000 m3/d was to be implemented during the
first phase.
4.  The EIA study considered alternatives of plant location and discharge point, of
separate and combined sewerage and treatment, and of sludge treatment. The proposed
site, discharge point, combined sewer, and landfill disposal for sludge were
selected, on an economic and technical basis. As required by law, the potential
negative impacts on the environment of the selected alternative were evaluated and
mitigation measures identified.
5.  During construction,  the main impacts would include possible subsidence of
reclaimed land, which would be minimized by using appropriate foundation for
structures. Operation of heavy equipment and transport of construction materials
would increase the level of air pollutants, noise and vibration, but the impact
would be small, temporary, and the noise and vibration within acceptable standards.
Mitigating actions are necessary for air pollutants since the existing level,
especially of TSP, were already high. It was proposed that these impacts would be
reduced using technology and equipment with low noise and vibration; carrying out
construction according to the guidelines for reduction of noise and vibration
generation; limiting working hours; and implementing measures reducing dust: water
spraying, car washing, speed limits,etc.
6.  The impacts and proposed mitigating actions during operation are summarized in
Table A 7.1.

ANNEX 7
Page   2
Table A 7.1: Janglim WTP environmental impact and mitigating actions
Assessed environmental impact             Proposed mitigating actions
* Increased level of noise and odor:   * Use technology, and design
noise from equipment would be 26-42    equipment with low noise and
dBA (standard 50): odor would be         vibration; operate facilities
about 0-1 degree which is within the   according to the guidelines to
standard (2 degree).                     prevent noise and odor; install
sound-proofing in buildings and
* Increased level of air pollutants,   individual equipment; cover odor
but modelling suggested that             generating facilities; and install
increase would be small.                 deodorizer.
* Increased level of chemical oxygen   * Ensure effective operation of the
demand (COD) in the Nakdong river        WTP and compliance with the effluent
mouth within 1 km distance from the    standards
discharge point of the Janglim
stream which receives the discharge
of the WTP effluent; the increase
would be small: by 0.4-1% after the
first phase WTP and 0.7-1.7% after
the second phase.
* Increased amount of solid waste        * deposit refuse, solids and
t/d            1st phase   2nd phase   dewatered sludge from the 1st phase
refuse               3.3          5.8   in the nearby municipal landfill
solids               6.6         11.0   site; carry out study for composting
dewatered sludge   67.0         118.0   and incineration for the dewatered
total              76.9        134.8   sludge from the 2nd phase
* Increased traffic volume.              * Construction of a new road
(Janglim-Kimhae) would alleviate
traffic congestion in the area.
Requirement for mitigating actions
7.  MOE approved the EIA report in June 1987 and directed the city to implement the
following measures:
(a) Strengthen soft ground and install temporary drainage channel during
construction to prevent land subsidence and soil loss into the river.
(b) Establish a 30 m greenbelt around the WTP; implement effective measures to
minimize dust generation during construction.
(c) Extend the outfall about 3 km downstream from the Janglim stream discharge
point; to protect water quality in Nakdong river, study the possible use of
separate sewer with respect to economy and operation of the WTP.
(d) Design the treatment plant to service factories which do not pretreat their
wastes prior to discharge.
(e) Install deodorizing facilities and cover the sludge thickeners.

ANNEX 7
Page   3
(f) Use composting for stabilization of sludge during the second phase; take
necessary measures to prevent vermin and other unhygienic conditions during
sludge transportation.
(g) Establish and implement the "environmental management plan", which would include
mitigating measures; compliance with MOE requirements; and a program for regular
research on water quality, ecology, and seabed.
Status of mitigating actions and operations
8.  The city constructed the first phase of the WTP during 1987-1990 and the
operation started in January 1991. Key EIA approval requirements were met during
construction and operation and monitoring was periodically carried out. Water
quality sampling in 1989 and 1992 suggested significant improvement of COD level in
the Nakdong river upstream of salinity barrage from 11 mg/l in 1989 to 3 mg/l in
1992 mainly due to construction of interceptors; the COD levels near the discharge
area (0.5-3 km) ranged from 2-6 mg/l. The impact on water quality in the Nakdong
river before and after the start of WTP operation was evaluated by the city during

Note: lst- primary treatment; 2nd -secondary treatment; the salinity barrage is 3
km upstream of the discharge point
9.  The improvement in readings upstream of the discharge point is considered due
to raw wastewater being collected by the new interceptor sewers and prevented from
entering the river. Surface salinity (S) in the area ranged from 11-18 parts per
thousand (ppt) near the discharge point and 25-33 ppt at 3 km downstream. The study
concluded that the first phase impact is limited to the discharge area, and
extension of the outfall 3 km downstream from the existing discharge point would
degrade the water quality near the Dadaepo beach and fisheries areas.
10. In 1992 MOE requested an explanation from the city regarding the agreements on
the installation of deodorizer and covering of thickeners; the disposal of sludge;
and the extension of the outfall. The city confirmed its intention to install
deodorizers and cover the thickeners, during construction of the second phase. With
regard to disposal of sludge, the city confirmed that composting of the sludge as
proposed in the EIA is considered inappropriate since lead (Pb) level may exceed the
standards for fertilizer to be used for agricultural purpose as proved in
experiments conducted in Seoul. Further, the city carried out a study in respect of
incineration (two, 150 t/d each) in 1994, including environmental impacts and
consultation with local residents; it concluded that due to its high cost this
method should be considered after 2001. Towards the end of 1995 the city will start



55
ANNEX 7
Page   4
operating a new sanitary landfill in Senggok and it was agreed that the dewatered
sludge will be digested and disposed of at that landfill until 2001.
11. Due to potential adverse impacts to the nearby fishing grounds and the high cost
of the outfall, the city carried out a study on tertiary treatment, including
possible non-potable reuse. It was found that the pollutant levels of the final
effluent would be further reduced to BOD 8 mg/l, COD 10 mg/l, and SS 8 mg/l. In view
of demand for water reuse the city proposed to construct tertiary treatment with a
capacity of 615,000 m3/d within the second phase of Janglim expansion.
12. Due to various changes in the project scope as compared to that approved by MOE
in June 1987 the city submitted an amendment report on the environmental impacts of
the proposed second phase WTP to MOE in early September 1994. The report specifies
that the major negative impacts would include (i) during construction: possible
ground subsidence, soil erosion, and increase in air pollution and noise levels; and
(ii) during operation: increase in air pollution, noise, and odor levels and water
pollution near the discharge area. It proposes that the impact during construction
would be minimized by using SEC foundation method; provision of temporary drainage
and storage ponds; and implementation of air/noise preventive measures. During
operation, measures would be taken to reduce noise and odor levels, establishment
of a green belt, selection of efficient equipment, and installation of noise
absorbing and deodorizing facilities. The thickeners and sludge storage shed of the
first phase would be covered with light roofing; the main units of the second phase
would have a concrete roof which would be developed as a recreational area.
13. Testing carried out in July 1994 during high and low tide showed that the water
quality near the discharge point was COD 1-2 mg/l, SS 8 mg/l, and S 16-22 ppt while
that at a distance of 3 km downstream was COD 2 mg/l, SS 10-11 mg/l, and S 23-24
ppt. A dispersion model indicated that the discharge of 615,000 m3/d with
concentration of 15 mg/l COD expected after secondary treatment would increase COD
near the discharge point by not more than 0.1-0.4 mg/l, and discharge with
concentration of 10 mg/l COD expected after tertiary treatment would increase COD
in this area by not more than 0.07-0.27 mg/l. It is estimated that the discharge
would reduce the salinity level by 3-20%, which is relatively small compared to the
salinity change (40-50%) during the opening of gates at salinity barrage to
discharge the river flow (average flow is 400 m3/sec).
14. The compliance would be monitored regularly by the city and periodically by MOE.
Monitoring of treatment efficiency and water quality near the discharge area will
be carried out at least six months before and six months after the completion of
this component. The monitoring program will be submitted to the Bank for review in
sufficient time prior to start of monitoring activities. Upon evaluation of results
the city would prepare a plan to mitigate potential adverse impacts and submit the
plan to the Bank for review.
Requirements for treatment performance
15. Beginning January 1996, MOE's standards for treatment plant effluent will be
higher. The BOD concentration will be changed from 30 mg/l to 20 mg/l and SS
concentration from 70 mg/l to 20 mg/l. The projected performance of the Janglim



56
ANNEX 7
Page   5
plant in 1999 would be 13 mg/l BOD and 16 mg/l SS, which complies with new
standards. Tertiary treatment would further reduce BOD and SS to 8 mg/l.
Impact on receiving waters
16. From about 280,000 m3/d of wastewater treated at present, a minimum of 26 t/d
BOD and 47 t/d SS (inflow BOD 106 mg/l, SS 185 mg/l; effluent BOD 13 mg/l, SS 17
mg/i) are removed by the WTP. Completion of the interceptor sewers in 1999 would
increase wastewater volume to 615,000 m3/d. Without this component, only 330,000
m3/d would be treated and the remaining 285,000 m3/d (30 t/d BOD, 52 t/d SS) would
be discharged into the river. At completion of this component, including tertiary
treatment, the treatment capacity would be increased to 615,000 m3/d, and about 60
t/d BOD and 109 t/d SS would be removed while the remaining 5 t/d BOD and 5 t/d SS
would be discharged into the river. The sludge would be digested and dewatered and
together with screenings and grit (160 t/d), would be disposed of at the Senggok
sanitary landfill.
Monitoring and institutional capacities
17. Monitoring of WTP performance and water quality near the discharge area is
conducted daily by the Janglim WTP. Monitoring of water quality in the Nakdong river
and the discharge into public sewers of industries located outside the industrial
estates is carried out by the city through the cooperative effort of the districts,
the environmental and green bureau, and the office of health and environmental
research (OHER). The OHER also monitors water and air pollution and is well equipped
with qualified staff and instruments for analysis of environmental samples. Pusan
MOE monitors industrial discharges from estates, the water quality in the Nakdong
river catchment area, and air quality in Pusan city.
KUNSAN COMPONENT
18. The component would include construction of a high temperature incinerator
(rotary kiln) with a capacity of 60 t/d. The flue gas will be directed into a series
of pollution control devices, comprising a semi-dry alkali scrubber and an
electrostatic dust collector, before being emitted to the atmosphere through a 30
m high stack. Ash will be collected and disposed of at the specified waste landfill.
The incinerator is part of the Kunsan Integrated Specified Waste Treatment Plant
(KTP). The nearest community (Naechondong) is about 5 km from the site. The detailed
description of the project is given in Annex 2.
Assessment of environmental impacts
19. The Environmental Management Corporation (EMC) would be the implementing and
operating agency. A site selection study was carried out in late 1988 and the Kunsan
site was selected based on technical, economic, legal, and environmental grounds.
An EIA study for KTP was carried out in 1992, and included public consultation. The
report was submitted for review in January 1993 and was approved in May 1993. It
presented the existing conditions, assessed the impacts on the natural, living, and
social environment, and proposed mitigating actions. The impact due to operation of
the incinerator was based on 100 t/d in year 2001 (two units). Potential impacts
during operation and the proposed mitigation measures are summarized in Table A 7.2.

Reguirement for mitigating actions
20. As part of the EIA approval, MOE's requirements for the KTP include (i)
continuous dialogues with the residents; (ii) measures to prevent adverse impacts
during construction: prevent soil erosion and ground subsidence, comply with MOE's
guidelines for dust control, pave the access road, install green area; (iii)
installation of the specified waste treatment plant, bring in and store various
types of specified wastes (liquid, semi-solid, solid); (iv) elimination of odors
from waste storage facility and ash pit; (v) prevention of traffic congestion and
establish transportation plans to prevent waste delivery vehicles from passing into
downtown and high-density population area; and (vi) implementation of the proposed



58
ANNEX 7
Page   7
"environmental management plan", including the investigation of noise and odor in
the nearby residential areas.
21. MOE's requirements related to operation of the incinerator include:
(a) Install an electrostatic dust collector, semi-dry alkaline scrubber, including
automatic monitoring equipment for TSP, S02, HC1; based on the monitoring
results, install additional pollution control facilities;
(b) Establish and implement measures to prevent dispersion of fly ash during
storage, transportation, and landfill, especially the plan for dust screens;
(c) Install sound-proof facilities to reduce noise generation from equipment and
traffic, and study the traffic impacts on the residents, including the possible
changes in routes;
(d) Provide adequate spare parts to prevent abnormal operation; establish and
implement checking of incinerator and pollution control facilities.
Status of mitigating actions
22. EMC has agreed to comply with MOE's requirements. To comply with the new
classification for specified waste issued in 1993, MOE reviewed the amount of
specified waste to be generated and waste feed and proposed construction of a 60 t/d
non-slagging type incinerator (650-1,200 C during operation). Prior to flue gas
treatment generation of air pollutants was estimated to be 800 ppm HC1, 200 ppm S02,
150 ppm N02, 400 ppm CO, and 1,000 mg/Sm3 TSP. With installation of an electrostatic
dust collector, semi-dry alkali scrubber and a selective catalytic reduction system
for NOX reduction, the levels of all air pollutants will be within the standards.
23. To ensure effective operation and maintenance of the facilities, adequate spare
parts and training of personnel will be provided, and an automatic stack monitoring
equipment for S02, HC1, TSP, CO, and N02 will be installed with on-line connection
to MOE regional office in Jeonju. Some specific toxic air pollutants from the stack
will be monitored more than once a month. At least two ambient air quality
monitoring stations will also be established in the nearby residential areas. The
specifications for emission performance, the on-line stack monitoring, and the
ambient air quality monitoring stations, including those required by Jeonju MOE, are
part of the bidding document and the supplier will provide supervisory and technical
advice for 1 year.
24. To evaluate the environmental impact of the incinerator EMC would implement a
monitoring program to measure various parameters six months before and six months
after the start of incinerator's operation. The monitoring program will be submitted
for Bank review prior to the start of the monitoring activities. Upon evaluating
results of such monitoring EMC would prepare a plan to mitigate potential adverse
impacts and submit the plan to the Bank.
Requirements for treatment performance
25.  From January 1999,  MOE standards  for emission of air pollutants will be
strengthened from the present 100 mg/Sm3 TSP and 80 ppm HC1 to 80 mg/Sm3 TSP and 50
ppm HC1; the standards for CO, S02, N02 will remain at 600 ppm, 300 ppm, and 200
ppm, respectively. The specification for the incinerator requires performance at 40



59
ANNEX 7
Page   8
mg/Sm3 TSP, 25 ppm for HC1, 300 ppm for CO, 150 ppm for S02, and 100 ppm for N02,
which would ensure the compliance of the new standards.
Impact on the environment
26. The component is a part of the Government effort to ensure safe disposal of
specified waste in the country. It would treat 60 t/d of the specified waste
generated in Chunbuk province, including waste oil, organic solvents, synthetic
polymers, and contaminated sludge. This will account for nearly 23% and 13% of the
total specified waste generation in 1997 and 2001. Remaining will be treated and
disposed of at source or by private waste disposal companies.
Monitoring and institutional capacities
27. EMC will carry out daily monitoring of treatment performance of the KTP and of
air pollutants from the incinerator. MOE will monitor the compliance of the EIA
requirements, pollution control of the industrial complex, air and noise quality,
and water quality in the rivers and coastal waters. Since MOE's regional office was
established in May 1994, its present capacity is inadequate to carry out these
tasks. It will be strengthened to ensure effective monitoring (on-line and periodic)
of performance of the incinerator and the levels of air pollutants in the nearby
residential areas.
Public consultation
28. Consultation with the public and affected groups was carried out during the
preparation of KTP, which complies with Bank policy and is considered to be
satisfactory. During the preparation of the EIA report, consultation with the public
and residents was carried out through the media and public announcement and written
comments were considered and recorded. The residents objected to the initial
proposal of developing the Kunsan specified waste treatment and disposal facilities
for the Honam Region and expressed their concerns about safety and transportation.
A series of consultations were held during 1992-93 to obtain agreement among various
groups. Based on the latest meeting in September 1993, it was agreed that (a) the
facilities would be used only for the specified wastes that are generated in Chunbuk
province; (b) MOE would provide several benefits to Kunsan city, including
construction of access roads to the treatment plant; and (c) If required, a
percentage of the revenues of KTP would be allocated to the Regional Development
Fund for use as a subsidy for welfare facilities. MOE intends to maintain close
consultation with the residents during the preparation, construction, and operation
stages.

Income Statement
2.    Operating revenues:  Revenues have been projected to increase in line with
estimated increased sewage volumes, and annual increases of sewerage tariffs.
Sewage volumes are based on the following: Household and commercial - assumed to
increase in line with water lcd and growth in population using 1993 as the base
figure; Industrial and others - assumed to increase in line with growth in
population and per capita income projections, using 1993 as the base figure.
Tariffs: Assumed to increase by 9.9% from January 1, 1995 and on each subsequent
year, to produce average cash generation equivalent to 25% of investment from
internal cash generation. Collection efficiency - based on past experience
estimated at 99%.
3.    Operating expenses:  1992 and 1993 expenses are actual, and 1994 expenses
are based on budget. Inflation has been added to expenses at 5% per annum for
1995 and thereafter. Personnel: The projections include wages and salaries for
SSA staff in WTPs and administration. Also included are additional staffing
requirements when new WTPs are placed in service, and a 3% annual increase in pay
levels. Electricity, chemicals: Projected expenses are increased in proportion
to additional WTP capacity. Maintenance: Projected to increase in line with
increased fixed assets in operation. Billing expenses: Projected expenses are
increased in proportion to the increase in operating revenues. District 0 & M:
Projected expenses are increased in proportion to the increase in wastewater
quantities. Depreciation: The calculation of 1.65% p.a. has been made on the
weighted average of all fixed assets in operation (including land) of the WTPs,
pumping stations, interceptors and network.
Balance Sheet
4.    Fixed assets: Include the WTPs, pumping stations, interceptors and network,
(including land) and are revalued at annual projected local inflation rates. The
last valuation was made in 1993, and the next valuation is scheduled for 1998.
