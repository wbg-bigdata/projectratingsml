Ervironment Impact Assessment
for
Pusan City Janglim Sewage Treatment Construction Plant Project
(Modification Plan of Discussion Contents)
Republic of Korea
1. Introduction
In the time of discussion of the environmental impact assessment for the sewage treat-
ment plant construction project from the Office of Environment in June 1987, the Janglim
Sewage Treatment Plant is 580,000n/d of 1st and 2nd stage capacities, however, sewage
volume is increased 35,000m/d than the original plan due to both addition of urban area
and city condition change.
Accordingly, the change of the discussion contents for environment impact assessment
with the Office of Environment have become to require according to plans that capacity
of 2nd stage of Sewage Treatment Plant (Target year is 2001) is planned to 615,000nm/d.
The existing law of the environment impact assessment is separately established with
the individual law from the basic law of environmental polocy in June 1993, and it is
carried out to present time since the enforcement ordinance has modified according to
restruction plant of office organization in May 1994. This Modification Plan of Discus-
sion Contents has made by (August 1994) the provision Section 22 of the Environment Im-
pact Assessment Law (Shall be provided the modification plan of discussion contents
including contents of project plan modification, analysis of environmental assessment,
reduction plan of environmental assessment while 30% increment of capacity in case of
sewage treatment plant), and this report is provided to Minister, the Office of Environ-
ment who is the head of the approval authorities and now is under review and conference.
2. Project Description
The Janglim Sewage Treatment Plant has treated sewage after intercepting of the sewage
inflowing To the Nakdong river from the Saha-ku and Puk-ku Districts and if it is the
environmental basic facility necessary to water protection of Nakdong river downstream,
protection of coastal water resources and establishment of pleasant urban environment.

4. Impacts
The result anticipated environmenal impacts along with increase of the Janglim Sewage
Treatment Plant are as follows:
1) Topographic and Geologic Features
The land of the sewage treatment plant consists of the poor subsoil distributed with
reclamation stratums and alluvium deposit and it is anticipated the land subsidence
along with structures of building in the plant.
2) Use of Land
o Effective land use (Establishment of Landscaping Plan)
o  Since the final settling tank and aeration tank in the increased plant are
covered and used to park, it will give the close friendships to the residents.
3) Air Quality
Impact Estimate comes to the air quality while working
o Generation of Contaminated Maiters
- TSP    71.86 kg/d
- N02     24.79 kg/d
o  Anticipated Model:  Long term spread model (TCM) and short term spread model(TEM)
o  Result of Anticipation
The impacts of air containated matters influenced to Karak APT, inner Janglim and
Shinpyong-dong residential areas apart 800 - 1,200 meter from the project area
are slight as shown on Table 4.1, however, the reduction plan is established due
to the over of environmental standard, in case of TSP in present time.

4)  Water Quality
In order to review the impacts influenced to sea water quality along with addition
of the 2nd stage sewage treatment plant, it was comparatively analyzed both existed
discharge point and discharge line installation of 2nd reclamation southern point
in Dade area which are proposed zo the discussion conditon of EIA in beginning of
1st stage project.

Note) X 1 : Existed Discharge Point
X .2 :Discharge Point of Dade 2nd Stage Reclamation Southern Area
o  Result of Calculation
As a result of the numerical value based on the above calculation criteria, in
case of COD, if it is discharged from discharged point 1 after secondary treat-
ment, the max impact limits in the time of low tide increase 0.1-o.4mg/j at
the discharge point, 0.005-'0.03mg/!  at Dade swinning beach. and the max impact
limits in the time of high tide are 0.02-'0.03mg/Q in the Nakdong river estuary
which is the upstream of discharge point and the aound of Dade swimming beach is
0.005- 0.0lmg/Q .  In case of discharge at the discharge point 2, it increases
0.03-0.05mg/!  at Dade swimming beach and 0.01-0. 02mg/!  at 4km area of seaarea
toward southern side in the time of low tide, and at the time of high tide, it
increases 0.0lmg/e at the Dade swimming beach.  In case of 3rd treatment, it is
less impact to the sea area rather than the secondary treatment. The contaminated
matters along with the discharge point will give not only less influence to the
adjacent area, but also to density degree increased to background density, and
also the sea water quality of before and after of plant operation is remarkably
improved in case of COD and SS.
Impacts give to the adjacent community fish markets and sea weed farm by the
change of salt degree are that the salt degree shows decrease of 2-- 5%O at the
time of discharge point 1 and 5-'100/0 at the time of discharge point 2.
Accordingly, it showed that the water gate operation of Nakdong river estuary
will give more influence to the change of salt contents than dischaged volumes
of sewage plant.
Accordingly, judjing from environmental sides, the treated water discharge at
the same point of present discharge point which is advantage not only economic
sides but also impact sides to reflect the sea water quality will be reasonable,
we consider.



5) Waste Matters
o Estimated Generation of 2nd Stage Sludge: 207m:/d (Daily Max)
o Moisture Contents of Dewatered Cake: 75%
6) Noise
o In the Time of Construction
As a result of total noise degree anticipated from each distance by the construc-
tion equipment, it is 71.6-~74.ldB(A) at 50m distances and it is under 75dB (A)
that is the noise standard of construction plant in the living noise regulation.
o In the Time of Use
As a result of noise anticipation by machineries in the time of plant operation,
it is 35.8-'48.1 dB(A) at 35 -  70m which is the most short distances to the land
boundaries and is is under 50 dB (A) which is the allowable value of the plant
noise discharge.
7) Bad Smell
o The origin of bad smell generation in the sewage treatment plant is the water
treatment and sludge treatment facilities.
o The main matters of bad smell are H2 S, NH3 , CH3 SH and as a result anticipated by
use of TEM for these matters, the degree of bad smell is 0-2 degree at the point
within 400m from the project area and is under 2 degree, environmental standard.
5. Analysis of Alternative
As a result we have reviewed for both existed discharge point and 2nd suggestion that is
Dade 2nd stage reclaramtion southern edge for the treated water discharge point which is
a altinative plan in the time of the existed 1st stage discussion, there are minor dif-
ferency in environmental sides and has econocical advantage, so that we select the same
suggestion which is the same point of the existed discharge point.
6. Mitigation Plans
The mitigation plans for EIA along with increase of the sewage treatment plant are as
follows:
o  SEC methods shall be carried out while foundation working of poor subsoil

Environmental Impact Assessment
1. General
The office of Environment is the important organization for environmental protection
in our country and will perform: 1) establishment of policy, standard and guideline
for carying out of the environmental laws, 2) exarnination of the environmental
impact assessment which established for many kInds of project performances, 3) monitoring
of the surrounded environmental quality.
Pusan City
2. Desaiption
In the city of Pusan, the domestic solid wastes generated from the district of juris-
diction are separated and collected by it's own collection power and refuse agent car
in each district office, remainder except recycling matters is filled in the sanitary
landfill plant one day average generation of the domestic solid wastes in Pusan are
about 9,300 torL In case we only depend upon it to landfill, it is very difficult to
have the land for landfill together with objection of nearby residents.
Accordingly, the Pusan City Government trys to separately collect to the framnnable and
inframmable matters with the waste reduction policy and try to have a safety treatment
of wastes together with prolong of time using the final disposal area after installa-
tion of incineration facility which is the midway treatsment facility. With the long
tern program not only for incineration facility of domestic soild wastes but also for
the sewage sludge, we are planned to have final disposal after reduction, non-hazard
and safety since we have destroyed by fire of sewage sludge generated from the sewage
treatment plant First, in order to destroy by fire on sewage sludge generated from
Janglim Sewage Treatment Plant, it is planned to install the facility capacity of
150 ton/day X 2 units.



3. Assessment of Environmental Impact
The assessment of environmental impact for the sludge incineration plant of Janglim
Sewage Treatnent Plant scheduled by Pusan City Government in present is under carrying
out depending on consultation of Hyundai Engineering Co., Ltd. in December 1993, and
the draft report for environment impact assessment was completed in April, 1994. In
this draft report, it is provided for the environmental impact to be generated in the
time of the incineration plant construction based on assessment item and environmental
standards designated by the Office of Environment and environmental impacts to be gen-
erated in the time of the plant operation.
The outline of the environmental assessment is as follows:
O Natural Environment
- Estimate the ground settlement while construction of structure due to work ground
foundation
o  Living Environment
- Discharge of air pollution, such as TSP and NO2 while land grading (Estimate discharge
volume TSP : 25.67kg/day, NO2 : 18.11kg/day
- Sand discharge by stormwater while the land grading (Estimate discharge volume
0.13kg/hr)
- Generation of noise and vibration by equipment operation (Estimated total noise: 73.1
dB(A)-300mn isolated point)
- Discharge air pollution, such as TSP, NO2, SO2 by operation of the incineration
facility (Estimated discharge TSP: 1,544kghr, N02 : 1.4kgAir, SO2: 34.8kg/hr)
- Generation of sewage water from administration bulding and air pollution pre vention
system
- Generation of mechanical noise and vibration by operation of incineration plant (Air
blower noise level from 1 meter sides : 88-103dB(A)
- Bad smell generabon from sludge storage room and sludge convoyor (Smell air
8,400n3M/r, NH: 10,772g/hr, H.S : 24,48cgWr



4. Requirernent for Mitigation Action
If we outline about the mitigating schedule estabished for the environmcental assessment
which estinated by the construction and o-ation of the ciuirxretion facility, it is as follows;
O Natural Environment
- Carry out SEC (Soil Earth Concretc) method and pile foundation due to weakncss of the
foundation and beaing capacity
O Living Environrmennt
- Periodical water springling, vehicle cleaning system, throwing of cash kind of effective
equipment, speed limit of working vehicle to prevent the air pollution while land grading
(Density TSP at max gathering point resulted from assessment estimate: 81g/m3, NO
0.0028ppm)
- Installation of the temporary drain-outlet in order to decrease sands and carth discharges
while land grading
- Controls of the night work, whorking vehicle's speed and alarm-whisle in order to
decrease the noise, vibration and throwing of every kind of effective equipment
- Waste gas which is generated from operation of the incineration facility is decrease its
density due to installation of syclon, electrostatic precipitation, wet scrubber (Density
TSP at max gathering pint rsulted by impact estimate aftor ruduction: 0.005pg/m3, SO
0.054ppm)
The generated waste water is influent in the Janglim Sewage Treatment Piant and
treated together with domestic water after primary treatment (by chemical) and
flocculation settlement (Waste water inflowing quality in Janglim STP: Blow BOD, COD,
SS: 150rrg/ )
-- Use to incineratior's combustion air after intaking the air in the sludge storage room
-- Shut tightly with cover in the sludge conveyor facility



5. Status of Mitigating Aciton
As of April, 1994. the consulting services for sludge incineration plant ot the Janglim Sewage
Treatment Plant is under carrying-out and hereafter, in the time of construction and facility
operation, we try to perform the reduction matters of environmental assessment along with
description that talk with the Office of Environment based on reduction schedule provided in
the environmental impact assessient
6. Requirement for Treatment Performance
The Operation for incineration facility will be operated with key point of following mattes
based on the matters proposed by the master plan and environmtral irnpact assessment after
completion of facility.
o Planning the minimun of efficiency of combustion with the effective management for
incinerator
O Plamning the minimum of auxiliary fuel with the effective management for objective sludge
O Establishment for the yearly management and repairing schedule
O Security of proper repairing article and management
o Prevention for human life and property damage with safety management of incineration
facility
O Provide the routine checks, such as rnanthly, weekly and daily
O Always confirm the normal operation status for prevention facility of environmental
pollution and maintain the exhauser gas temperature of the combustion chamber to proper
condition
O  Carry out monitoring along with plans for the evironmontal monitoring management after
construction



7. Impact on receiving water
The waste water which discharge to incineration plant has not directly enfluened to the river
because it is all inflowed to Jangimin STP after 1st treatment However, in relation to
increase of 2nd stage of janglim Sewage Treatment Plant, we try to have a exam-ination how
the discharged quantity and quality from sewage treatment plant will reach to the near river.
8. Effectiveness of Reuse
To have reuse of sewage sludge, there are roughly divided into the use of sludge itself and
the use of inceration prouducts. For example, the former is composting and the later is the
construction matenals from incineration ash and the power generation and heating from waste
heat, In this facility, it is not considered about the reuse and use of incineration products but
it is planned that all of the sludge willl be destroyed by fire and the ash will be filled in the
land.
9. Monitoring and Institutional Capacity
In order to prevent the environrnental pollution by operation of incineration plant, we estabish
ex post fact monitoring schedule and will ask to the relating study authority for ex post fact
environmnental impact examination which specified in the law of environmental impact
assessment and the have thiem try the routine inspection.
10. Land Acquistion
There are no problems for land acqusition because this incineration plant will be installed in
the land of the Janglin Sewage Treatrent Plant

CO   ;  1st Prs,ect : 0.14ppb, 2nd Project : 0.16ppb
Impact get to increase estimate and air guality will be tiny
3) Water Quality
The construction of the Janglim Sewage Treatment Plant is constructed not only for
prevention of water pollution in the Nakdong river estuarv, but also for conserva-
tion of water guality in the estuarial coast with the effective treatment of the
urban sewerage system.
o  Served Treatment Area:  Sasang, Janglim Treatment Subarea (1st Stage) and Hwa-
myuing, Kamchon, Dade Treatment Subarea (2nd Stage)
o  Discharge Methods of Rainwater & Sewage: It is improper separated system but
will change to the separated system
o Review of Sewage Treatment System
Co-treatment system cf the domestic and industrial sewage (plant to discharge
of the specially hazard materials shall be installed the anti-hazard facility)



o  IJac7 of Discharged water to reach NakXong River Estuary
-  Es.i-,ate for 330, O9:/d cf aDischarged Quality and 20=m  e of BOD
-  Applied Method:  QUAL2E WATER QUALITY MODEL
-  Result of Estimate:  It is esti-mated to increase 0.26mg/Q  at BOD 3.3mg/i
which is the present background density
o Review of Impact to reach to coastal water quality in the Xa.kdong river estuary
-  Anticipate for the effluent volume 330,000k1/d, 50,0&D3/d and rhe water
quality (COD) 20/g/Q
-  Applied Method:  Diffusing Formula of Joseph & Sender
- Result of Anticipation:
Effluent Quantity:  In The time of 330,00mnp/d
At the degree of dispersion 135, speed of disperson
25,920m/d, distance 1,OOOm, it is anticipated to in-
crease about O.Ollmg/j than COD 2.85mg/Q (Adjacent
coastal sea quality - Southern sea of Ulsukdo)
Effluent Quantity:  In the time of 500,000rnP/d
At the degree of dispersion 135, speed of disperson
25,920m/d, distance 1,000, it is anticipated to in-
crease about 0.019mg/Q
o  Impact to reach to estuary ecosystem due to effluent water
As a result we examine the impact by silty sludge having a materil with the
usage marine plants and animals in the underwater living animate, the marine
living animate filled into the great kernel of accumulated sludge is showed
to die in the short period, but small kernel of siltv sludge is not influenced
to damage at the low density and at 30-50ppm densitv, it is showed low damage
and such condition is proposioned to the exposure time of silty origin. The
impact by SS increase according to discharge of treatment water in the final



stage will be judged to disregard wi-. below  6mg/e at  the shcrtest p3int
from the present background density.
4) Wastes
o Wastes Generated on the Course of Treatment Process:
Screens, Sandy Soil, Sedimentable SS and Excess Sludge
o Moisture Contents of Dewatered Cake: 75 - 83R
o  Sludge Generation:  Approximately 1315rr/d (Year of 2001)
5)  Noise, Vibration and Bad Smell
o Noise and Vibration
- The noise and vibration while workings are mainly generated by the construc-
tion equipment and happened at the short :eriod, but since this treatment
plant is the reclaimed land and far from residential houses, it is judged
to have few influene for the momentalily noise and vibration while workings.
I It is anticipated noise generation by every kind of machineries while
working, but it is judged not to influence because the soundproof facilities
is installed in the building.
o Bad Smell
- The origin of bad smell generation in the sewage treatment plant comes from
the water treatment facilities (Influent sewage, grit chamber, aeration tank
and effluent water from sedimentation tank) and sludge treatment facilities
(Thickener, digesting tank and dewatering facility).
- The main materials of bad smell generation are H2 S and NH3 , and as a result
of measurement of the bad smell density used the Model which used at the
atmosphere quality, it is H2 S, 0.0101 -  0.0706ppb; NH3 , 24.72 -  89.91ppb
and the smell density is 0 - 1 and within degree 2 of the Environmental
Standard.



6) Relaxation and Scenery
o  The Sewage Treatment Plant wiJi  have       landscape architect and tree-planting
around the adjacent lands and inside of .he plant to decrease the dishonest
factors and also gives the sense of security to The adjacent residentials
Social and Economic Environment
The land usage before development were almost pertained to ocean surface or riversides.
However, they changed to the effective land usage, such as the road, houses, ever-
livirng facilities and green tract of land after the 2nd industrial periods having
development formation, and they also changed to the new city street and effectiveness
of expectation is estimated more bigger not only to industrial condition upturn, but
also to the betterment of living elevation at .he point of the social and economic
circumstances.
5. Analysis of Alternatives
The evaluation reports proposed in Alternatives are the details for selection of
the position of the sewage treatment plant and we divided the position of plant into
the first suggestion (Shinpung-Dong Reclamation area) and second suggestion (Southern
parts of Dade 2nd reclamation area) and then we have reviewed each other.
o In case of the second suggestion, we can mal-e minimum to the water degeneration
with seawater diffusion and diluted action, however, it is required to install the
seabed discharge pipeline due to adjacency of the Dade Swimming Beach
o In case of the first suggestion, it shows that There are few impact influenced to
the marine ecosystem by the discharged water
o  In case we will appoint the discharged point to second suggestion, we will require
not only for additional expeses but also for disadvantage due To delay of the 2nd
completion of the reclamation period and urgent condition of project.
a  The Dade area is difficuk to dter-ini thle earlier deci%ion of land3 due to urAde
purchasing of land at That time



's a resu_:. c' review -en-t-oned the above, :he second (2nd) suggestcon is some-,what
- vanzage  -?. view of diff'sion of dascharzed waer, however, it will give the hatred
senses to :ne Dade Swimming Beach and relazation facilities, disadvantage in economic
condition and existence of practical problems. Accordingly, we judge that the first
(1st) suggestion is reasonable while studing the decreasing method for the Environrmental
I-pact Assess=ent.
6.  Mitigation Plans
Lecreasing  .eThod for the E-nvironmental Itp2act Assessment along with the consrruction of
:,e Sewage Ireatment Plant is as folows:
Natural Env-ronment
o  While foundation works f'or poor subsoil, it shall be carried our with Pile Method
and SEC Method
O Shall Kant the strong trees to the environmental change after having green lands
o  Shall maintain the control function between both the adjacent natural ecosystem
and urban ecosystem forever.
Livinz Environment
o Frying dust in the time of construction shall be minimized to the adjacent impact
with a periodic water spray
o The oil to be used for boiler and extraordinary generation facility shall be of
the effective fuel and shall be minimized to the contaminated matters
o  The generated digestion gas shall be used for fuel of keeping warm and excessive
gas shall 'De used for generation
o  In order to prevent the water decrease of the fresh water lake in the estuary,
the sewaze and waste water in the Sasang sub-district shall be intercepted and
treated preferentially

o  Shall be prevented the noise generation by control of night works
o. While the facility operation, the soundproofing installation and ou:er-wall of the
building shall be built with the dual structure and make a noise decrease.
o  In order to decrease bad smell, we shall carry out control of sludge accumulation,
rapid disposal of sludge or scum, and the dewatered cake shall be covered with use
of masking chemical and shall have prevention of bad smell diffusion. The treatment
facilities shall be covered if possible.
7. Monitoring and Evaluation
In compliance with the effective performance under the decrease countermeasurement
proposed in each division for bad influence which will be generated bv the sewage
treatment plant operation, the contineous and periodic measurement and management
for environment to be occurred should be carried out and the environmental impact
shall be arranged and evaluated after establishmemt of countermeasure corresponding
to these matters.
o Management of Natural ecosystem
o Management for Effluent Water Quality and Quantity
o Management of Normal Operation for Important Facilities
o  Control for Effluent Water Area
o Mainagement for Proper Treatment & Disposal of Generated Screens and Dewatered Cakes

(2) During operation
The expected result for air quality in future by using TCM Model shows that the
side effect on the surrounding environment is pretty small because there is no the
residential area nearby the project site and it is located so far from the small
residential area scattered.

b. Water Quality
Rainwater became waste waters passing through many waste-beds having many kinds of
pollutants. Waste water generated will be flowed into the nearby waste water treatment
plant with living waste water, back-wash water, car washing water and other waste water
and properly treated.
Thus, we expect that the side effect on the neighboring coast will be minimized (no inflow
to the nearby river) and the expected sewage and waste water volume is as follows
- Expected volume of sewage. waste water

Total                 52.0
c. Noise, Vibration
The expected effect for noise under construction and during operation is as follows
and the effect of vibration is neglected since the vibration source does not exist.
(1) During construction
Vibration during construction is mainly generated by operating lots of equipment,
a friction and crashing noise, an explosion noise. The effect by construction equipments
will be negligible since noise level has been expected about 67dB(A) which is less than
the noise permission level of 75dB(A) in Osikdo village.
- 11 -



(2) During operation
Noise during the operation is mainly generated by pumps, fans, compressors and etc.
However, noise level for fan which has the biggest capacity is expected around 61dB(A)
and 4ldB(A) after the correction can meet the noise permission level of 5OdB(A).

4. 2 Mitigating plans for Environmental Impact
The mitigating plans for potential environmental impact is as follows and the details will be
shown in Annex-2 & Annex-3.
a. Air quality
The dust generation shall be controlled by paving main load preferentially, spraying water,
limiting vehicle speed and at the same time cleaning vehicles including vehicles wheels.
During operation, Wet E/P and semi-dry scrubber will be equipped to remove Dust,
S02, IICI and etc.
b. Water quality
It is planned that many kinds of sewage and waste water of about 52 m3/ day generated
for this project execution will be treated by its own physical-chemical-biological treatment
facility in the project site which will be constructed in future so that these sewage and
waste water are able to be treated to meet the permission level.
And, Waste water treated will be flowed to Kunsan sewage treatment facility and treated
once more to satisfy quality below the effluent permission level.
And, HDPE 1.5mm x two (2) fold in the land-filling area which can prevent pollutants
from being leaked to the outside will be placed to reduce the effect for the surrounding
water quality like the underground water, ocean and etc. by the leakage of the leached
water.
- 14 -



c. Noise
The following mitigating plans will be executed for preserving the pleasant living condition
even though the noise effect under construction and during operation of the project has
assumed as a minimal.
- Under Construction
. Control of night time work
. Speed control of equipments for construction (lower than 20km/Hr) and No horn
. Effectivc usage scheme for all equipments.
- During operation
. Site noise
Soundproofing facility will be equipped to meet noise permission level (Noise level:
below 5OdB(A)) in the boundary of project site.
- Traffic noise . Speed limit at each road will be kept severely.
. Abnormal driving of trucks shall be controlled
A Ads campaign will be performed to avoid horn unnecessary.
d. Odor
Storage space and intermediate treatment facility where odor will be generated shall be
isolated to the outside and cleaned periodically to maintain cleanliness and air in there
shall be utilized as the combustion air.
The odor generation shall be controlled by using trucks having cover in wastes
transportation and gas generated in the land-filling site shall be collected and incinerated
by the simplified incinerator.
5. Analysis of Alternatives
5. 1 Analysis of Alternatives Technology
Gas treatment facility to treat dust and flue gas discharged from incineration plant
of this project includes Wet E/P + Semi-dry Scrubber + SCR
a. Dust Collector
Wet E/P having the good performance and the great reliability is chosen
considering kinds of dust generated during incineration even though
- 15 -



there are many types of dust collectors operated by gravity, inertia, centrifugal
force, scrubbing, filtration and etc.
b. Flue gas treatment
The kinds of flue gas discharged from this incineration plant are
SOx, NOx, HCI, Heavy metal and etc.
The reason why semi-dry scrubber is selected is that Hcl and SOx can be
eliminated simultaneously through the contact reaction by injecting alkali
solution and slurry to the flue gas.
SCR is selected for resolving NOx as N, and 0, by adding ammonia
solution.
6. Monitoring Equipment for the Public Treatment Facility of the Specified Waste.
The monitoring equipments that will be placed in this plant are categorized as below and the
details are as follows: 1) the underground water testing facilities for monitoring the status
of underground water pollution after the completion of land-fill site construction and 2) the
gas collecting facilities for treating the gas generated by the land-fill 3) gas monitoring
facilities in stack to measure the flue gas generated by the installation of Incineration plant.
6. 1 Testing facilities of Underground Water
The underground water will be possibly contaminated by the leached water inflow
since the underground attitude of the land-filling site is higher
As a countermeasure on that, testing holes of SUS pipe more than four (4) having a
diameter of 200mm and a depth of 12m are placed and testing holes of the
underground water are located as per Fig. 6-1 to be operated for the long time.
The testing holes will be placed total eight (8) holes in the inside of Sheet pile and
two (2) holes in the outside of Sheet pile considering the step-by-step land-filling plan
and the underground water flow in the manner of Six (6) holes in the first stage
land-filling (two (2) holes in Sheet pile outside), adding tvo (2) holes in the 2nd. Stage
land-filling, adding two (2) holes in the final stage.
The sampling will be done in the upstream and the downstream, respectively to
monitor the contamination of the underground water.
- 16 -



6. 2 Gas collecting facilities
The gas generated by the land-filling will be varied according to the volume land-
filled and the duration.
From G. Tchobangoglons (Solid waste), the gas will be generated about 50% in two(2)
years, 70% in five (5) years and will be getting decreased after twenty five (25) years.
That is, the annual tventy five (25) % by two (2) years, the annual seven (7) %
by three (3) - five (5) years and the annual one point four five (1.45) % by sLx
(6) - tventy five (25) years are the guideline of the estimation of gas volume
generated in the land-filling site.
Thus, this land-filling plant (Ist. Stage) is probably utilized from 1994 to 2001
and total gas volume generated is estimated as 1,064.7Nm3 , which is CH4 of 1,064Nm3
CO, of 305.6Nm', NH3 of 105.5Nm3
The method of vertical discharging pipe as the gas collecting method is selected
as a result of comparing the method of vertical discharging pipe, upper side
collecting pipe and latcral sidc discharging pipe.
The gas collected will be treated by the diffusion-dilution method in the stage of
the land-filling and by the incineration and reuse in the final stage.

6. 3 Stack Monitoring Facility
The environmental pollutants affecting on the air quality during the operation are
SOx, NOx, HCI, Dust and etc. being contained in flue gas at the final stage.
These Pollutants will be managed with the proper mitigating plan (Flue gas - facilities
based on semi dry and scrubber, Dust - Wet E.P) and each facility for mitigating
pollution shall be periodically inspected.
And, The following post environmental management scheme shall be set up so that
the property of the gas emission level can be determined.
