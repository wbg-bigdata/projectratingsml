SECOND DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:           The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
Beneficiary:        Dairy Development Foundation.
Amount:             US$38.0 million (including loan interest during
construction).
Terms:              Repayment in 20 years, including 5 years' grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relendinu  Terms:    The Government would relend the loan proceeds to the
Dairy Development Foundation for 15 years, including 5
years' grace at a variable interest rate coinciding with
the Bank's lending rate, plus a fee of 2 percentage points
to cover foreign exchage risk.
Proiect
Description       The project seeks to provide support for the long-term
development of dairying in Sri Lanka by assisting in the
establishment of an organizational structure for the dairy
industry; increasing rural employment and incomes;
improving efficiency in production, collecting, chilling,
processing, and marketing milk; increasing the supplies
of domestically produced and hygienically processed fluid
milk; providing technical assistance and training; and
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of development
projects in the livestock sub-sector. About 180,000 farm
families are expected to benefit from increased on-farm
employment, and more evenly distributed incremental
income derived from increased milk production. Risks
arise from the substantial institutional changes to be
effected by the project, and farmer acceptance of the new
village milk companies.

SRI IANKA
DAIRY DEVELOPMENT II
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01    Although the major activities of the proposed project are oriented to
dairying-the production, collection, processing, and marketing of milk-the
project seeks a more far-reaching impact. Milk, although in short supply in
Sri Lanka, is a means of bringing to rural areas development in its broadest
sense. On one hand family based production and incomes would increase, and on
the other an organization and management structure would emerge as a consequence
of the formation under the project of autonomous rural based companies. In
addition, the project would incorporate those dairy cooperatives which meet
certain established criteria. The companies and cooperatives, besides being
responsible for milk procurement and provision of technical and advisory serv-
ices to livestock owners, would encourage the growth of leadership and manage-
ment as similar organizations have done elsewhere in South Asia. With dairying
being labor intensive and involving those with little opportunity for using
their labor elsewhere, this organizational structure would encourage the par-
ticipation of many of the poorest of rural households. Through the village
units and the concomitant organizational structure, rural producers would have
the opportunity to participate in the management, and share in the profits, of a
processing and marketing chain that extended far beyond its rural base. Fur-
thermore, through increased efficiency in the production, collection, processing
and marketing of milk, farmers would be offered incentive prices to produce more
milk and consumers would have increased access to high quality milk and milk
products at fair market prices.
B. Economic Setting
1.02    Sri Lanka is endowed with favorable resources and diverse agro-climatic
conditions that permit wide-ranging agricultural pursuits. It also possesses a
highly literate population and has achieved considerable success in curbing
population growth. Sri Lanka comprises an area of about 65,500 sq km, with a
population of about 15 million growing at about 1.7% p.a. GDP per capita is
about US$320. About 75% of the population live in rural areas and are directly
or indirectly dependent on agriculture. The climate is characterized by nearly
constant temperatures and large variations in rainfall. The island can be
divided into two major zones: the Wet Zone (average annual rainfall over 2,285
mm) and the Dry Zone (average annual rainfall belov 900 mm) which covers about
64% of the island. A narrow transition band between the Wet and Dry Zones is
referred to as the Intermediate Zone. About three quarters of the population
reside in the Wet Zone with an average population density of about 700 per sq
km, compared to only 80 per sq km in the Dry Zone. The combined Wet and Inter-
mediate Zones occur in the southwest quadrant and cover about 35% of Sri Lanks's
land area, including about 45Z of the cultivated land.
1.03    Until the late 1970s, economic growth in Sri Lanka was slovw  Real per
capita GDP grew only 2.6% during the period 1970-76 mainly due to a combination



-2-
of inadequate investment, ineffective and inappropriate government policies,
adverse weather, and a sharp rise in the cost of imported fuel. This disap-
pointing economic performance resulted in severe unemployment. In late 1977,
the newly elected Government i'iitiated a liberalization strategy with the objec-
tive of increasing the growth rate of production and employment, savings and
investment, and exports. To achieve these objectives, the Government introduced
policies which included exchange rate unification and depreciation, import trade
liberalization, interest rate increases to encourage savings, full cost pricing
for most imported commodities, and the establishment of a free trade zone to
attract export oriented foreign private investment. The economy reacted
vigorously to these changes with real GDP growth accelerating to an average of
7.3% p.a. during 1977-79, subsequently slowing to 5.0% between 1981-83. The
primary sectors of significant growth have been paddy production, services,
garment exports, and construction, all of which benefitted from liberalization
increases and the increased level of investment. Furthermore, employment growth
has been substantial in both the public and private sectors. Unemployment has
been reduced further by out-migration in response to job opportunities abroad.
As a result, the unemployment rate fell from 24% of the labor force in 1975, to
14.8Z in 1978, and 13.1% in 1982. Fixed investment likewise has risen from
14-15Z of GDP in the early 1970s to 30% in recent years.
1.04    However, underlying this improved performance were certain key struc-
tural issues which the Government needed to confront to maintain medium-term
growth prospects. Due to a marked jump in public capital expenditure and a
disappointing revenue effort, the budget deficit increased from 1l.lZ of GDP in
1977 to 19.8% in 1980, declining to an average 13.7% during 1981-83. The budget
deficit is expected to decline further to about 1OZ in 1984. Due partly to this
budgetary deficit, and partly to a combination of external developments, and an
incentive structure biased against exports, the current account deficit in the
balance of payments also increased to a record 19.8% of GDP in 1980, leveling
off at an average 13.7% during 1981-83. The Government has taken steps to
reduce the budget deficit and is actively considering policy measures designed
to stimulate exports and efficient import substitution activities. If progress
continues to be made along these lines, the current account deficit in the
balance of payments should decline to approximately ;Z towards the end of the
decade with the debt service ratio declining to below 15Z in 1990 after tem-
porarily rising to almost 17% due to existing debt repayment commitments.
C. The Role of Agriculture in the Economy
1.05    Agriculture plays a major role in the economy of Sri Lanka, accounting
for about 252 of GDP, about 50% of the labor force, and 60% of export earnings.
About 95Z of the rural population is -nvolved directly in agriculture related
activities. Sri Lanka's wide variations in precipitation, topography, and soils
permit cultivation of a wide range of crops. Out of some 2.24 million ha under
permanent cultivation (34% of land area), paddy accounts for 0.65 million ha,
coconuts 0.50 million ha, tea 0.24 million ha, rubber 0.19 million ha, and other
perennial crops 0.04 million ha; the remaining 0.62 million ha comprise mixed
rainfed farming, mostly as small gardens around homesteads. An additional
1 million ha are under shifting cultivation (chena). Investment and incentive
policy changes introduced by GOSL in the late 1970s for the agricultural sector
were a response to disappointing growth in the early and mid 1970s. Average
agricultural growth declined from 3.4% p.a. during the 1960s to 1.9% p.a. over



-3-
the period 1970-77. Agricultural performance during the period 1978-83 improved
substantially with growth averaging 3.8% p.a. This overall result was buoyed by
an impressive increase in paddy production averaging 5.0% p.a., and was
depressed by poor growth in the tree crops sector, averaging -0.96% p.a.
Climatic vagaries, however, continue to plague Sri Lankan agriculture. A mar-
ginal decline in paddy production in 1982 of 3.3% was attributable to an 1l1
drop in the 1981-82 maha crop due to severe drought, mitigated by a 1982 yala
crop some 12% better than the previous year. Similarly, drought conditions
during the 1983 yala crop were very serious, with normally planted areas either
uncultivated or damaged. The 1982-83 maha crop (1.79 million tons), in con-
trast, was a record, being about 30% above the previous year's depressed produc-
tion.
D. The Role of Livestock and Dairyinu  in the Economy
1.06    The Livestock and Dairy Sector.  The livestock population of Sri Lanka
comprises about 1.7 million cattle (of which about 17% are either exotic or
crossbreds), 0.9 million buffaloes, 0.5 million goats, 0.3 million sheep, and
0.75 million pigs. The contribution of livestock to the gross value of agricul-
tural production is estimated at 8%, which is considerably lower than the actual
contribution since this estimate does not take into consideration the value of
manure, hides and skins, and draft power. The sector contributes significantly
to employment generation and makes a major contribution to the economy by
utilizing much land which would have very little alternative use. The dairy
industry is comparatively small, representing only about 2% of GDP; however,
dairying is an important activity for many smallholders and landless estate
laborers.
1.07    Milk Production and Processing.  Domestic milk production is estimated
to range between 400,000 lpd (from national food consumption survey) and 700,000
lpd (from numbers of cows and buffaloes if milked). Of the total milk produced,
the Dry Zone accounts for about 40%, the Wet Zone Hill Country about 25%, the
Intermediate Zone, excluding the Coconut Triangle, about 15%, and the Wet Zone
Low Country aud the Coconut Triangle about 10% each. Some 70% of the milk
produced is consumed at home or marketed locally, either directly or through
middlemen, and only about one third of the total is procured by the organized
dairy sector. Collection is highly skewed towards the Wet Zone Hill Country
where about 65% of the milk produced is procured. Comparable figures for other
areas are 25% for the Dry Zone, 15% for the Coconut Triangle, 15% for the Inter-
mediate Zone, and 10% for the Wet Zone Low Country. Milk processing is carried
out in the four plants (total capacity of about 200,000 lpd) operated by the
National Milk Board (NMB), one plant (capacity about 100,000 lpd) operated as a
joint venture between NMB and a multinational company, and a dairy products
plant (products include milk powder and baby food) with a reported capacity of
300,000 lpd recently completed by the multinational firm. Thus, the country's
combined processing capacity is about 600,000 lpd. Current throughput (locally
produced milk plus imported commodities) is about 265,000 lpd.
1.08    Milk Imports.  In 1983, Sri Lanka imported about 27,000 tons of dairy
products, which provided the liquid milk equivalent of a further 400,000 -
500,000 lpd. The Netherlands, New Zealand, and the U. S. accounted for about
80% of the imports. The total value of milk imports has increased from SLRs 55
million in 1970, to SLRs 380 mill-on in 1978, and SLRs 870 million in 1983. The



-4-
Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) under the Ministry of Trade and Ship-
ping is responsible for the importation of most milk products; however, private
entities may also import. Sri Lanka presently receives little commodity aid in
the form of dairy products.
1.09    Consumation and Demand.  Average urban per capita consumption of milk
and milk products is estimated at about 76 grams per day (gpd) compared to an
average rural per capita consumption of 48 gpd. Consumption varies considerably
between income classes with the poorer urban classes consuming an average of
about 40 gpd and the upper income classes consuming up to 130 gpd. About 39% of
the milk and milk products is consumed as fresh and pasteurized fluid milk,
while the remaining is consumed as reconstituted milk powder (33Z), infant milk
(21%), and other milk products (7%). In general, the consumption of dairy
products in Sri Lanka is well below levels found in some other South Asian
countries. According to estimates made by the Bank's dairy sector review mis-
sion, jJ average per capita demand for milk and milk products in Sri Lanka is
expected to rise by an average 1.2% annually during the project period. This
increase, combined with a projected annual increase in population of 2.2%, vould
give an overall increase in demand of 3.4% annually. Judging from observed
increases in dairy imports (para 1.08), these projections appear conservative.
Demand for milk and milk products is projected to grow from an estimated present
level of about 840,000 lpd to approximately 1.2 million lpd by 1991, and 1.4 mil-
lion lpd by 1996. Rising import prices would somewhat temper this demand as
would a significant structural adjustment that reduces real per capita income
growth rates. However, the vigorous promotion of dairy products by domestic and
international companies would tend to expand demand beyond that predictable by
price and income alone. While milk prices in Sri Lanka have nearly doubled
since 1982 (para 1.10), the quantity and value of milk imports have increased
substantially in recent years (para 1.08). This indicates that whatever dampen-
ing effect price increases may have had on the demand for milk products, they
have been outweighted by other factors (increases in income and population)
leading to net increases in demand. These trends are expected to continue. The
income elasticity for the demand for milk and milk products is about 0.6 to 0.8
at mean consumption levels, indicating that a 10% growth in per capita income
would result in about a 6% to 8% growth in per capita milk consumption.
1.10    Milk Prices. Subsidies. and Tariffs.  The Government controls both
producer and consumer prices of milk bought and sold by NMB, which, in turn,
controls all sales of liquid milk, except small quantities traded in rural
markets. Up to March 1983, producer milk prices generally ranged from SLRs 2.00
to 2.80 per liter, depending mainly on fat content. In March 1983, the Govern-
ment increased the producer milk price to about SLRs 3.20 per liter and the
consumer price to SLRs 6.07 per liter. In September 1984, the producer milk
price was further increased to SLRs 3.70 per liter and the consumer price to
SLRs 8.00 per liter. While the consumer price remains at SLRs 8.00 per liter
for 3.2% fat milk, the current producer price is SLRs 4.30 per liter for 4% fat
milk as a result of a recent Government decision. Bulk imported whole milk
powder (the main substitute for processed fluid milk), repackaged in Sri Lanka,
currently retails on average at SLRs 8.90 per liter equivalent after payment of

II, April 18, 1983.



-5-
a 15Z import duty. The present retail price set by the largest processor of
domestically produced whole milk powder is SLRs 8.40 per liter equivalent. MM
operates at a financial loss and has a negative cash flow which is financed by
Government subsidies. These losses occur in large measure because of insuffi-
cient margins between the Government controlled prices of raw milk and finished
products, lov plant throughput combined with a high proportion of fixed costs,
and overstaffing. The size of the subsidy has been reduced in recent years as a
result of above-mentioned consumer price increases and increased efficiency in
lNHBs operations. In 1983-84, the average annual subsidy payment to NMB
amounted to SLRs 23 million, compared to SLRs 45.9 million in 1982. The Govern-
ment had expected that continued improvements in the efficiency of MBB opera-
tions would permit the elimination of the subsidy by the end of 1984. The
necessary improvements in MBB were not forthcoming and in the November 1984
budget the subsidy was raised from SLRs 0.375 to SLIs 0.50 per liter of raw milk
processed as fluid milk. The Government, however, remains committed to the
elimination of the subsidy. There is at present a need to ensure that some
domestic raw milk is incorporated into locally produced whole milk powder (which
also incorporates reconstituted imported skim milk powder). Without this out-
let, some rural producers would lack an effective market for their milk. Also,
markets distant from milk processing plants would be mainly dependent upon
imported milk products. To make local raw milk an attractive ingredient for
local milk powder processors, the Government presently pays a subsidy of
SLRs 1.00 per liter on milk absorbed by these processors. The subsidy appears
to be necessary in order for domestically produced whole milk powder to be
competitive. The total subsidy to NMB budgeted for 1985 is SLRs 33 million.
Until 1983, CWE also received a subsidy to cover its operating losses.  The
subsidy amounted to about SLRs 5 per kg of powdered milk; the annual cost to the
Government was about SLRs 100 million. In March 1983, the consumer price of
milk powder imported and repackaged by CWE was raised sufficiently to eliminate
the subsidy. The Government has, thus, initiated the process of economic
rationalization of the dairy industry and made substantial progress in diminish-
ing distortions in pricing which have mainly benefitted the higher income con-
sumers and had little effect on productivity at the farm level. Until
January 1985, import duties on whole milk powder, skim milk powder, and butter
oil were 5%, 7.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. Effective January 1, 1985, the
tariff on all these products was increased to 15%.
E. Institutional Support to Livestock
1.11    Responsibility for Development. Organizational and administrative
responsibility for livestock and dairy development rests with the Ministry of
Rural Industrial Development (MRID). Within the Ministry there are four
separate entities involved. These are:
(a)  the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) (provision of
veterinary and extension services to producers, operation of breeding
farms, training and research, organization of dairy cooperatives);
(b) the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) (development projects,
establishment and maintenance of livestock breeding stations and farms,
and organization of dairy cooperatives);
(c) the WMB (milk collection, processing, and marketing); and



-6-
(d) the National Oils and Fats Corporation (principal supplier of compound
feeds to the livestock industry).
The responsibilities of these bodies are not clearly delineated, and in some
areas, for example in dairy development and formation of dairy producer coopera-
tives, there is considerable overlapping of functions between the DAPH and the
!LDB. Still another agency, the CWE under the Ministry of Trade and Shipping,
is involved in dairy development, at least indirectly, since this body is
responsible for the import of most dairy products. Because the CWE has been
required in the past to cross-subsidize imported milk, it has indirectly
influenced the price paid to producers and the losses sustained by the private
and public dairy industry. The dairy plants and chilling centers controlled and
managed by the NMB have not operated satisfactorily. Trade union problems, over
staffing, low productivity, substantial losses, and inaccurate accounting sys-
tems have plagued the operation of these plants.
1.12    Livestock Research.  The principal institutions engaged in livestock
research are the Veterinary Research Institute, the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine and Anima. Science of the University of Peradeniya, and the Department
of Animal Husbandry of the Faculty of Agriculture of the same university.
However, the research output is not large in relation to the numbers of
qualified staff at these institutions. Moreover, there appears to be little or
no joint research by inter-disciplinary teams aimed at solving the development
problems of the livestock sector. The organization of livestock research is
highly centralized and there is no regional research conducted which could lead
to the formulation of more realistic regional development plans making maximum
use of local resources.
1.13    Livestock Extension.  The Department of Animal Production and Health
is the principal agency of Gover,nent entrusted with providing extension serv-
ices to the livestock sector. Unfortunately, as presently constituted and
organized, the Department is far more animal health than animal production
oriented and in consequence is trnable to make a major direct impact on national
animal production per se. Furthermore, the interaction which must exist between
extension and research if the production problems of the livestock owner are to
be adequately addressed is not apparent.
1.14    Credit.  Institutional rural credit in Sri Lanka is principally dis-
bursed by two nationalized commercial banks, the People's Bank (PB) and Bank of
Ceylon (BC). PB operates through its banking divisions, the Cooperative Rural
Banks. BC provides credit services through its main branches, with repre-
sentation maintained at Agrarian Service Centers (ASC). National rural credit
policy is established by a Rural Credit Advisory Board (RCAB) chaired by the
Governor of the Central Bank (CB). CB's Department of Rural Credit functions as
the Board's secretariat and executive. The total amount of institutional rural
credit disbursed nationwide declined in nominal terms from SLRs 156.8 million
(1981) to SLRs 153.9 million (1982). This decline was primarily the result of a
drop in lending under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (CRCS) by PB. High
default rates continue to be an unsatisfactory feature of rural lending. From
1967 to end-1982, initially under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme and sub-
sequently under the CRCS, only about 482 of amounts disbursed was recovered. A
rescheduling scheme with a view to improving recoveries is now underway. In



-7-
addition to institutional credit, there is evidence that a substantial share of
rural credit comes from non-institutional sources.
1.15    Dairy Cooperatives.  Dairy cooperatives in Sri Lanka date back to about
1930; however, the major force in the cooperative movement, the Cooperatiie
Union in Colombo, was organize4 during the 1940s and continued to work effi-
ciently until the inception in 1954 of the State-owned NMB. The NMB started
selling milk in Colombo at prices lower than those of the Cooperative Union,
which was run on sound financial principles, and eventually drove the Union out
of business in 1958. The dairv cooperative movement resurged in 1979 under the
IDA-assisted dairy project (Cr. 504-CE).
1.16    At present there are 100 milk cooperatives in Sri Lanka, 90 of which
are classified as small primary societies and 10 as large primary societies.
Cooperatives of the former type cover a relatively small area (generally one
village) and their by-laws do not provide for elected branches. Some 50 of
these societies, known as Dairy Producers Associations (DPA), were organized
by the NLD3 under the first dairy project and are members of the Coconut Tri-
angle Milk Producers' Cooperative Union. The large primary societies, organized
by both the NLDB and the DAPH, have adopted by-laws similar to the existing
multi-purpose cooperatives and consist of central units with varying numbers of
branches which are supervised by elected branch committees. The central units
of these societies are frequently located at the headquarters of the Assistant
Government Agent, and their executive comittees generally consist of four
government nominees and five members selected from among the producers by an
electoral college. Four of the ten large primary societies each cover an
administrative district. Because of its more centralized nature, distance of
the Central Unit from the villages, and the presence of government nominees on
its board, producer influence and cooperative autonomy are limited, and the
large primary society is often viewed as another agency of the Government. The
dairy cooperative societies to be formed under the ADB-assisted livestock
development project (para 1.29) would be of the large primary type.
1.17    The total membership of the primary milk societies is about 23,000 and,
since 1979, these societies have averaged about 31 million litres of milk col-
lected annually (about 54% of the total milk collected by NMB). Although many
of these societies have operated with considerable degree of autonomy and with
producer-based participatory management, they have had little or no involvement
beyond the village level, i.e., in milk processing and marketing. Furthermore,
while both types of cooperatives offer advantages in terms of economies of scale
in mill- collection and transport compared to the private collector, both place
the producer in a disadvantageous position in terms of bargaining for price
increases and for the provision of production inputs. As a consequence, producer
milk prices are only about 54% of retail prices (para 1.10) vith margins between
collection, chilling, transport, and processing being extensive. Likewise,
retail price increases have a significant likelihood of not being fully
reflected in producer prices but may result instead in increased margins and
losses between producer, cooperative, chilling center, processing plant, and
consumer. Thus, a reorganization of the existing cooperative system, which
would allow producers wider participation and greater control, is needed (paras
2.02 to 2.06).

F. Livestock Production Systems
1.18    The island is divided into seven major agro-ecological zones on the
basis of annual precipitation, rainfall distribution, and altitude, and these
are further subdivided into 24 agro-ecological regions, each with its unique
combination of rainfall pattern, elevation, land form, temperature range, and
types of soil. XI The combination of these factors determine the prevailing
land use, cropping pattern, crop calendar, production constraints and develon-
ment potential in different regions.
1.19    The total number of milk cattle and buffaloes in 8ri Lanka has been
recently estimated at 552,000. These are distributed among the three rainfall
areas of the country as follows:
Table 1.1: DISTRIBUTION OF CATTLE AND BUFFALOES
IN SRI LANIA
Cattle           Buffaloes
Number     Z      Number      Z
Wet Zone                 82,900    20      24,000    18
Intermediate Zone       65,800    15        7,700     6
Dry Zone                272.000    65      99.500    76
Total              420,700   100      131,200   100
The Dry Zone is the area of greatest potential for further expansion in milk
production and procurement.
1.20    There are six major and distinctive milk production systems in the
country. Each system has evolved in response to the natural resources, markets,
and alternative income opportunities available to the producers. Five of the
systems are based on cattle and the sixth on buffaloes.  To a large extent one
system tends to dominate in a particular agro-ecological zone, however, within
such zones other production systems are also found.
1.21    The "Estate" System.  The Mid and Hill Country of the Wet Zone and the
wetter parts of the Mid and Hill Country of the Intermediate Zone are largely
planted to tea and rubber.  Most of the land is held by large estates now
operated by state plantation agencies but which was privately owned prior to
land reform. A few small (maximum 20 ha) private estates remain. Dairying is
carried out by estate laborers (perhaps 10-20X of the total) to supplement their
income. Because of a land shortage, all cattle are entirely stall fed with
jj Mean air temperature ranges from 160C to 280C. The 75% expectancy value of
annual rainfall from 508 to 3,175 mm. Land form varies from mountainous,
steeply dissected hills to rolling, undulating and flat. There are 17 major
soil groups and associations.



-9-
concentrates (mostly poonac, with some rice bran) and forage cut from roadsides
and non-arable land on the estates. Estate laborers are generally limited to a
maximum of two COws per family.
1.22    The Mid Country Smallholder Systen.  Within the Mid and Hill Country
of the Wet and Intermediate Zones there are numerous smallholdings generally
comprising very small areas (0.1 to 1 ha) of paddy land located in the valleys
and associated with larger areas (1 to 3 ha) of upland, part of which is planted
as a home garden. The steeper uplands are planted to fruit trees (jackfruit,
durian, mango), beverages (tea, coffee, cocoa), and spices (pepper, cloves,
cardamon, and nutmeg). A proportion of the upland areas comprises areas of
natural grassland and tea land abandoned because of low yields. Such land is
generally badly eroded, low in nutrients, quite acid, and suited only to pasture
and forestry. Dairying is still very much a secondary activity with crop cul-
tivation taking priority. A typical smallholder with access to pasture has
about four purebred or European crossbred cows vhich are fed cut green fodder
and concentrates. Animals are stall fed throughout the year. Management prac-
tices are generally similar to those followed by cattle oNners under the
'Estate" System, although slightly lower management standards result in somewhat
lower milk yields.
1.23    The Coconut Triangle System.  The Coconut Triangle covers an area of
some 0.5 million ha with annual rainfall ranging from 1,000 mm in the north to
1,800 mm in the southwest. It receives rain from both the northeast and south-
west monsoons. Virtually all the lowest lying land is used for paddy cultiva-
tion and the higher land for coconuts and home gardens. The coconut growing
area comprises about 0.35 million ha and, prior to land reform, most of this
area was held by large estates. There are two distinct production systems. The
first is based on small herds of indigenous cattle which are grazed under
coconuts on partly improved pasture and fed small quantities of coconut poonac.
The second, and more common, is found on the larger private estates (up to 20
ha) and involves the grazing of crossbred cattle on improved pastures planted
under coconuts.
1.24    The Dry Zone System.  The Dry Zone extends over about 4 million ha or
about 62Z of the total area of the country and accounts for about 25% of
agricultural holdings with 0.6 million ha being distributed among some 0.6 million-
smallholdings. The remaining 3.4 million ha is mostly state land which is used
by the smallholders for extensive grazing. The grazing areas consist mainly of
vast extents of secondary forest and scrub resulting from centuries of shifting
cultivation. However, there are limited areas of reasonably productive natural
grasslands adjacent to the major rivers and tanks. These areas, known as vil-
las, are generally overstocked and are increasingly being transformed into
irrigated farm land. The extensive grazing of livestock presently practiced in
the Dry Zone is likely to be progressively replaced by more intensive livestock
rearing within integrated small farms. Present cattle herd size averages about
-40 head with about 40Z of the herd being cows. These state lands also provide
grazing for buffalo herds in areas adjacent to paddy production.
1.25    The Urban Jaffna System.  Of the 65,000 ha under cultivation in the
Jaffna district, rice accounts for about 60%, coconuts 9%, chillies 7%, onions
6%, and groundnuts, sesame, pulses and maize account for the remaining 8%. The
Jaffna district is reported to have a cattle population of about 150,000 head of



-10-
which about 50,000 are located on the peninsula and the remainder on the main-
land. Of these 50,000, some 12,000 are either crossbreds or improved breeds
with a high proportion of European blood. The dairy industry on the peninsula
is largely based on the 12,000 improved cattle. Individual producers keep two
to six cows which are stall fed on concentrate, roughage (mainly straw), fodder
trees, and occasionally some green forage.
1.26    The Smallholder Buffalo System.  Buffaloes are mainly associated with
the provision of draft power for paddy cultivation in the Low Country and in
the Dry Zone. More than half of the total population are located in five dis-
tricts: Kurunegala 18%, Anuradhapura 12%, Hambantota 8%, and Polonnaruwa and
Batticaloa with 7% each. An estimated 70% of the buffaloes are located on
holdings of two ha or less. Most of the buffalo milk is a by-product from the
provision of draft power. Few buffaloes are used solely for milk production. A
fairly typical herd numbers about 18 animals, of which 7 are cows with about 4
in milk at any time. The herd grazes waste (state) land during the day and
returns to a night paddock in the evening. No additional feed is provided.
G. Development Activities and Project Rationale
1.27    District Rural Development Proiects (RDP).  The IDA-supported Kurunegala
RDP (Cr. 891-CE) was the first district level RDP implemented by GOSL in 1979.
This was followed by the IDA-financed Second (Cr. 1079-CE) and Third (Cr.
1363-CE) RDP in Matale and Puttalam districts and Mannar and Vavuniya districts,
respectively, and by the Badulla RDP (Ln. 111-CE) financed by IFAD. In addi-
tion, there are RDP underway in Hambantota and Nuwara Eliya districts with
financial assistance from Norway and the Netherlands, respectively. Each of the
RDP has a rather small livestock component implemented, in most cases, by DAPH.
1.28    Bilateral Livestock Development Proiects.  Tnese include the Sri
Lanka-Netherlands and the Sri Lanka-Swiss Livestock Development Projects and
the Sri Lanka-West German Goat Development Project. The first began in 1978
with a gift of 900 exotic dairy animals to Sri Lanka and includes activities
in the areas of dairy development, mainly in connection with the development
of two NLDB farms, and training in dairy farming; treatment of straw to increase
its feeding value; and improvement of animal draft power, mainly in the areas of
the Mahaweli Development Program. The Swiss-supported project covers the dis-
tricts of Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Amparai, and inter alia is
involved in the establishment and operation of district dairy cooperatives
(para 1.16).
1.29    ADB-Assisted Projects. The Anuradhapura Dry Zone Agriculture Project,
which also receives support from IFAD, was initiated in January 1981. The
livestock component of the project is concerned with the strengthening of
veterinary and AI services, expansion of two NLDB livestock farms, provision
of credit for the purchase of draft animals, and the establishment of a small
feed mill and three milk chilling centers in Anuradhapura district. In January
1983, GOSL began the implementation of an ADB-financed livestock development
project. The project covers 10 districts and the main components are dairy
development, improvement of animal draft power, upgrading of pig production,
development of poultry, livestock education and training, improvement of feed
and fodder supplies, strengthening of veterinary services, improvement of
marketing facilities, and the provision of credit.  Under the dairy component,



-11-
which covers the districts of Jaffna, Kegalle, Gampaha, Colombo, Kalutara and
Galle, A.I. services would be strengthened through the importation of breeding
animals and semen, and assistance would be given in the establishment and opera-
tion of dairy producer cooperatives (para 1.16). According to ADB's latest
review mission, the project is some six months behind schedule.
1.30    Bank Involvement in the Dairl Sub-Sector and Proiect Rationale.  The
Bank's involvement in the dairy sub-sector in Sri Lanka began with a 1971
Agricultural Sector Mission which concluded that a large scale dairy development
program was feasible. In early 1973, a project was prepared by a Sri Lankan
interagency team with assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
Appraisal took place in mid-1973 of a multi-component project which included
credit and technical services for on-farm development, supply of equipment for
expansion of milk collection, credit to cooperatives, importation of dairy
heifers, and the establishment of demonstration units for calf rearing and
forage production and management.
1.31    As a result of slow progress, the project was reformulated in 1978.
Emphasis was shifted from providing credit to commercial dairy farms to the
formation of dairy cooperatives (para 1.15) based upon the Anand pattern found
to be so successful in India. It was also agreed that the Government would
raise the price of milk to producers and stabilize concentrate feed prices. In
November 1978, the Government raised the procurement price by 38%. In addition,
subsidies were offered to producers of SLRs 120 to SLRs 2,500 per acre for
fodder production, and heifers were sold from calf rearing units at about 30%
below costs. Meanwhile, consumer prices were subsidized resulting in annual
operating deficits of the NMB ranging from SLRs 33 to 96 million. In the
liberalization of the economy in the late 1970s, export prohibitions on poonac,
the main ingredient of concentrate cattle feed, were lifted, raising prices to
international levels and reducing the profitability of dairying.
1.32    After 1978, further dialogue between IDA and the Government on milk
pricing and subsidies had little effect and progress of the project remained
generally slow, though formation of DPA, and milk collection from them, was
sufficiently successful to demonstrate the validity of this approach. In Decem-
ber 1981, the project closed after a one year extension. Approximately
US$4.9 million of the US$9 million credit remained unutilized and was cancelled.
It was clear from the outcome of the project that issues on institutional struc-
ture and pricing, and project performance could not be separated. Consequently,
it was agreed that, before embarking on further livestock investments, a joint
GOSL/IDA review mission would study the livestock and dairy sector.
1.33    Between November 14 and December 3, 1982, a sector mission jl visited
Sri Lanka to review and discuss with Government organizational and pricing
)j This mission and the subsequent follow-up mission received substantial
assistance from the India National Dairy Development Board which has suc-
cessfully guided smallholder dairy development throughout India through the
formation of village cooperatives under four IDA-financed projects. A full
description of the sector issues reviewed and discussed is presented in the
Sri Lanka Dairy Sector Review, World Bank Report No. 4365-CE, Volumes I and
II, April 18, 1983.

issues vithin the dairy industry. A smaller, follow-up mission returned between
February 27 and March 4, 1983, to continue this policy dialogue. X} The review
confirmed the potential of the dairy industry and outlined three policy options
for its development:
(a) Continuing with a Government-based milk board and processing industry;
(b) Inducing marginal changes in organization and the supply of technical
inputs whilst maintaining the NMB; and
(c) Initiating substantial institutional changes leading toward privatiza-
tion of the industry.
After review of the findings of these missions, GOSL selected the third option
and invited preparation of a project along the lines suggested by this option.
Responding to this invitation, and taking advantage of the data gathering and
analytical work accomplished in the sector review, the Bank mounted a joint
preparation/appraisal mission in November 1983.
1.34    The rationale for continued Bank involvement in the development of the
Sri Lankan dairy industry is:
Ca) The potential of dairying to bring benefits to large numbers of the
rural poor whilst also achieving significant foreign exchange savings in
an economically efficient way;
(b)  The need for radical institutional changes in the industry if this
potential is to be realized; and
Cc) The ability the Bank has to guide these changes based on considerable
experience with dairy development in the Region, in particular with the
apparently very successful cooperative dairy development program in
India.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Area
2.01    The proposed project would cover the entire country which would be
divided into five milksheds for operational convenience:
(a) Jaffna, including the districts of Jaffna, Hullaitivu, Mannar, Kil-
linochi, and Vavuniya, all of which are located in the Dry Zone;
(b) Colombo including the districts of Colombo, Kalutara, Kegalle, Matara,
Ratnapura, Galle and Gampaha, all (with the exception of about 40Z of
Gampaha district) of which are situated in the Low or Mid Country Wet
Zone;
(c) Kandv. including the districts of Kandy, Matale and Nuwara Eliya. Kandy
is located in the Mid Country Wet Zone; Matale in the Mid Country Inter-
mediate Zone; and Nuvara Eliya in the Hill Country Wet Zone;



-13-
(d) Polonnaruwa- including the districts of Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura,
Puttalam, Kurunegala and Trincomalee, all of which are in the Dry Zone,
except Kurunegala which is located in the Low Country Intermediate Zone;
and
(e) Monarakala. including'the districts of Monaragala, Badulla, Amparai,
Hambantota and Batticaloa, all of which are in the Dry Zone, except
Monaragala district which is partly situated in the Intermediate Zone.
B. Proiect Design
2.02    The present institutional structure for milk processing and marketing
in Sri Lanka has not operated according to expectations despite subsidies and
public investments in milk plants and chilling centers (paras 1.10 and 1.11).
Furthermore, pricing policy has tended to favor the relatively better off urban
consumer at the expense of the rural producer. As a consequence, dairying has
had very little incentive to expand and has not attained the economic and dis-
tributional impact that it could achieve.  To ensure that both rural producers
and urban consumers gain from a program of dairy development, major institu-
tional and organizational changes which result in increased milk production and
promote efficient processing and marketing are required. The proposed project
therefore would give primary emphasis to these aspects, and the project design
draws heavily on the experience gained in cooperative dairy development in
India, particularly over the past decade.
2.03    The system of dairy cooperative development .in India, known as the AMUL
or Anand pattern, has been developed over the last 35 years in the Kaira Dis-
trict of Gujarat State and tested widely throughout the country with con-
siderable success. Essential elements of the AMUL model involve the formation
of a cooperative society of milk producers at the village level, the selection
of a board of management which sets the policies of the society within the
framework of a general set of by-laws, and the appointment of a local person as
the paid secretary of the society. Each morning and evening the society buys
milk, on a commission basis, from all producers in the village who wiuh to sell
it, and makes payment to each producer based on the volume and fat content of
milk. The society also sells compound cattle feed and provides an artificial
insemination and veterinary first-aid service to village cattle. All milk
producers in the village are eligible to be society members irrespective of cast
or sex. Membership requires agreement to sell milk to the society only, to
subscribe to at least one share of the society, and to have one vote per member
with only one member per household. A further key element in the AMNL model is
that the 400 or so societies within a 50-75 km radius are members of a collec-
tively owned milk union. Milk from the constituent societies is brought to the
union dairy plant where it is pasteurized and sold as fluid milk or processed
into milk products. Each milk union has a board of directors elected by the
producer-members. The board employs a professional manager who is the union's
chief executive and professional staff who provide the society members the
technical inputs needed to sustain and increase milk production. Thus, the
unions organize mobile veterinary clinics, artificial insemination services, and
supplies of balanced cattle feed which are marketed to producers through their
societies. The milk unions within a state are joined together tc form federa-
tions, enabling all member-unions to benefit from shared processing, markLting,



-14-
financing and investment programs managed by specialists employed by the federa-
tions. Thus, the AMUL model is a three-tier structure of village dairy coopera-
tives, unions of village dairy cooperatives, and federations of milk unions; the
whole system is owned by the primary producers of milk and operates to their
benefit.
2.04    In order for producers to receive an incentive price to produce more
milk and for consumers to be protected from unduly high retail milk prices,
maximum efficiencies must be sought in milk collection, processing and market-
ing. To ensure these efficiencies it is recommended that Government divest
itself of the management of investments in milk processing and marketing vhich
are essentially commercial activities better handled by the private sector. As
long as these activities are carried out by the public sector, pricing and
marketing (as well as production) remain political issues vith Government taking
the brunt of criticism for any inefficiencies or price increases. In addition,
a private company, unlike a public enterprise, would have full autonomy in
pricing and management and could pay sufficient wages to attract high caliber
staff (paras 5.02 and 7.14).
2.05    For dairy producers to receive the benefits of higher prices, a reor-
ganization and expansion of the existing cooperative system is needed
(paras 1.15 to 1.17). In particular, producers should be granted greater con-
trol and they should be permitted to enter into partnership with entrepreneurs
in building the dairy industry. Therefore, the proposed project would establish
an organizational infrastructure patterned after the India AMUL model except
that the various entities created (i.e. village producer units, milkshed units,
milk processing and marketing unit, and the apex organization) would be
registered under the Companies Act and not under the Cooperatives Act. This
would have the advantage of embodying the most desirable features of smallholder
dairy cooperatives yet minimizing public sector influence and would place each
of the entities under the same requirements of accountability and procedures as
any other private sector firm. The proposed institutional changes would ensure
that the technical inputs necessary for increasing milk output and improving the
efficiencv of production are provided.  They would also aLlow producers to
participate in the profits obtainable in milk processing and marketing and vould
provide a mechanism by which incentive prices could reach the farmer.
2.06    Given the substantial institutional and infrastructural development and
the indivisibility of investments, the project would be implemented over seven
years. Experience with similar projects in India has shown that a relatively
long implementation period is necessary to construct and get into operation milk
processing plants and to allow adequate time for the new institutions to build
sufficient expertise to operate efficiently vithout outside assistance. To
reduce risk and to ensure rapid implementation following loan approval, certain
pre-investment activities have been completed Cpara 4.25). In addition, a
mid-term review (para 4.27) would be carried out at completion of the third
project year to ensure necessary adjustments required for effective implementa-
tion.



-15-
C. Obiectives
2.07    The primary objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) To create an institutional structure to provide technical support and
financing for the long-term development of dairying in Sri Lanka;
(b) To increase rural employment and incomes through expanding milk produc-
tion and by providing autonomous organizations for the efficient collec-
tion, chilling, processing and marketing of milk, and by allowing
producers to share in the management and profits of each of these
activities. The producer s share of consumer payments for processed
milk, currently about 54% (para 1.10), is targeted to reach 60% with the
project;
(c) To increase the supplies of domestically produced and hygienically
processed fluid milk to urban areas;
(d)  To provide technical assistance and training to support the development
of dairying; and
(e) To strengthen and support the monitoring and evaluation of projects in
the livestock sector.
D. Proiect Components
2.08    To accomplish its objectives, the proposed project would implement the
following components over seven years.
Organization and Management
2.09    The project would support the establishment of an organizational struc-
ture for the dairy industry consisting of:
(a) Dairy Development Foundation (DDF), a non-profit guarantee limited
company to provide finance for investments in dairying, as well as
training, technical assistance, research and development, and management
support in organizing and developing milk production, collection,
processing and marketing; 1j
(b)  Milk Industries of Lanka Companv Limited (MILCO), owned by producers and
private investors, to lease and manage 4 dairy plants currently owned by
the EMB, to lease the existing NMB chilling centers, and to invest in
about 3 new milk plants and about 10 new chilling centers;
AJ This would be a company limited by guarantee with no share capital. Such
companies are generally incorporated for charitable or quasi- charitable
purposes.  It would not obtain working capital from or pay dividends to its
members. The liability of each member is limited to the amount (not to
exceed SLRs 100) he guarantees to contribute in the event of liquidation of
the company.



-16-
(c)  Five Nilkshed Producers' Companies (NPC). owned by producers, to lease
from MILCO and manage NMB chilling centers as vell as new chilling
facilities.  The MPC would support village companies and cooperatives
through the provision of services, and vould collect milk from these
units and transport it to chilling centers and/or dairy plants; and
(d) About 1.950 Village Milk Producers' Companies (VMPC), owned by
producers, to collect milk from and provide technical and extension
services to producers.
2.10    The project would establish these companies, and project costs would
include the costs of organization and incorporation, as well as costs of initial
staff, office materials and equipment, vehicles, and Spearhead Teams to under-
take the establishment and efficient operation of VHPC (para 2.15 (a)). In the
case of DDF, the project would finance operating expenses for the duration of
the project.  Assurances were obtained that GOSL would lease to MILCO NMB's
dairy plants and chilling centers and abolish the IMB by September 30, 1986. It
would be a condition of effectiveness that the lease agreement between NMB and
MILCO had besn entered into. The better qualified NMB staff would be absorbed
by DDF, MILCO and the MPG; the remainder would be granted normal redundancy
payments by GOSL.
2.11    The existing dairy cooperatives, as well as those formed in the future,
would participate in the project provided they are small primary cooperatives;
they are financially viable; have management boards, the majority of whose
members have been elected from among the members of the cooperatives by secret
ballot; refrain from hiring, employing or otherwise renumerating employees of
Government; and agree to abide by the same rules of conduct and procedures as
the VMPC. The cooperatives, which would be referred to as Village Milk
Producers' Associations (VMPA), would buy shares in the MPC and have the same
benefits and obligations under the project as the VNPC.
Dairy Plants and Chilling Centers
2.12    To modernize, expand, and improve the efficiency of milk chilling,
processing, and marketing, the project would:
(a) Refurbish the existing Colombo milk plant;
(b)  Construct a pasteurization and URT milk plant in Colombo of about
200,000 lpd capacity;
(c) Construct a pasteurization and dairy products plant in Killinochi or
Vavuniya of about 60,000 lpd capacity;
(d) Construct a feeder-balancing dairy jJ in Amparai of about 100,000 lpd
capacity; and
j/ During the lean season, a feeder-balancing dairy transfers practically all
of the milk it receives to urban dairies; in the flush season, it transfers
only a portion to urban dairies and converts the surplus milk into dairy
products.



-17-
(e) Construct new chilling centers in the following areas: Haputale,
Baliela, Nawalapitiya, Chenkaladi, Ruwanwella, Vavuniya, Chilaw, Horana
and Tissamaharama (about 10,000 lpd capacity each), Kotagala and Norwood
(about 20,000 lpd capacity each).
Refurbishing of the old Colombo plant for the reconstitution of donated com-
modities would be carried out as a part of the Netherlands assistance. To
ensure that the designs and layouts of the new dairy plants and chilling centers
are completed in a timely manner, the Government gave an assurance that the
Dairy Plant Engineer would be appointed by December 31, 1985. Government also
gave an assurance that not only the final designs but also acquisition of the
building sites for the processing and chilling facilities whose construction is
scheduled for Project Year 2 would be completed by September 30, 1986.
Technical and Extension Services
2.13    To help increase the productivity of the national dairy herd, the
project would provide the following support to milk producers;
(a) Artificial insemination (AI) services using imported frozen semen;
(b) Routine and emergency veterinary services;
Cc) Para-veterinary first-aid services; and
(d) Production inputs such as planting materials, compound cattle feed, and
minerals; and
ae) Advisory services on fodder and pasture production, animal management
and feeding practices, crop-livestock integrated farming, calf rearing,
and milking hygiene.
2.14    The provision of these services would be at three levels.  Firstly,
centralized services provided by MILCO to MPC which would inclua_ bulk importa-
tion, storage and distribution of frozen semen, as well as the production,
storage and distribution of liquid nitrogen. Secondly, services provided by the
MPC to the VMPC/VMPA which would include distribution of semen on a regular
basis; the operation and maintenance of training centers and central animal
husbandry and veterinary units (including diagnostic laboratories), with
sub-units located at sub-district level; and veterinary services, for vhich a
fee would be levied for each emergency call attended. And thirdly, those
provided by the VHPC/VMPA to their members which would include AI services for
cattle, animal first-aid care, and a feed and livestock extension program
through trained village level staff (para 2.15 (e)) who would maintain daily
contact with farmers. VMPC/VMPA members would pay a fee for each AI performed.
The fees charged for veterinary and AI services would cover at least direct
costs. Some 200 farms owned by progressive farmers would be selected and used
for demonstration of improved methods of animal husbandry, pasture and fodder
production, crossbreeding, calf rearing, crop-livestock integration at the farm
level, and hygienic milk production.



-18-
Traininra
2.15    An important aspect of the project would be the training of farmers and
staff of DDF, MILCO, the MPC, and the VMPC;VMPA. The following training
programs are envisaged under the project:
(a) Spearhead Teams. Each MPC would have a Spearhead Team who would be
entrusted with the task of organizing VMPC. Each team would comprise
about 20 individuals and would include veterinarians, extension
officers, and agricultural graduates, as well as graduates in other
disciplines. Each team would undergo a comprehensive training program
of about four months in the organization of milk yroducers at the
National Dairy Development Board in Anand, India.
(b) Trainers. To staff the training centers to be established in each
milkshed, 15 trainers would be required initially. These would be
recruited and trained at the National Dairy Development Board. The
duration of training would be about four months.
tc) FellowshiDs. Selected personnel of DDF, NILCO and the MPC would be
provided with overseas fellowships to study organization and management,
project planning, dairy plant construction, dairy plant operation and
management, quality control, marketing, monitoring and evaluation, and
livestock and fodder production. Most fellowships would be for four
months duration and the project would provide a total of about 100 man
months of overseas training.
(d) Farmers' Study Tours. About 500 progressive milk producers selected by
the Spearhead Teams would visit Anand and other milksheds in India to
observe the operation of milk producers' organizations. The tours would
be 7-10-days in duration.
(e) VMPCIVMPA Staff. The staff would be trained at the MPC training centers
in artificial insemination, animal first aid, fodder production, dairy
production, milk testing, basic record keeping and accounting. The
duration of training would be about two months. The centers would also
be responsible for the training of project farmers.
DDF would have overall responsibility for supervision and administration of the
program.
Technical Assistance
2.16    Technical assistance would be essential for planning and implementation
of the proposed project. Since considerable specialist expertise is available
from professors in Sri Lankan universities, retired GOSL staff, private sector
managers, and in personnel of some Government departments, local expertise would
be used vherever possible. However, in certain areas, such as dairy engineering
and farmer organizations, such experts are not available locally and would need
to be recruited internationally in the early years of the project. The proposed
project would provide a total of 408 man months of technical assistance as
indicated in Table 2.1.

estimated at US$8,000 which would include travel, subsistence and allowance. if
Terms of reference for all technical assistance are given in Annex VII.  DDF,
after consultation with MILCO and the MPC, would be responsible for selection of
consultants and for administration of the technical assistance program.
Monitorin  and Evaluation
2.18    The project would undertake monitoring and evaluation separately.
Within DDF, a project monitoring unit would be established to monitor physical
and financial progress of the project. Within KRID, an existing technical
monitoring unit would organize evaluation studies to independently assess the
impact of the project. To enable it to do this the project would strengthen the
unit through the provision of about 12 man years of technical staff, 21 man
years of support staff, equipment, and vehicles.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
3.01    Total project cost is estimated at SLRs 2,780 million (US$111.2 mil-
lion), including SLRs 104 million (US$4.2 million) for taxes and duties on
imported vehicles machinery and equipment, SLRs 250 million (US$10 million) for
interest during construction, and SLRs 140 million (US$5.6 million) for
incremental working capital. Cost estimates are based on end-CY1983 prices
jj Based on the assumption that a high proportion of consultants would come
from India.



-20-
updated to March 1985. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
SLRs 1,224 million (US$48.5 million), which represents 44S of total project
costs. Physical and price contingencies over the project period amount to
SLRs 809 million (US$32.4 million), or 29Z of total costs. Physical contingen-
cies have been estimated at 5Z of base costs, except for vehicles for which no
physical contingencies have been provided. Price contingencies have been
applied at 8% in 1985; 9Z in 1986-1988; 7.5% in 1989; and 6% in 1990-1992 for
foreign costs. For local costs, rates have been applied at 12Z in 1985; 11% in
1986; 10% in 1987; 9% in 1988; 7.5Z in 1989; and 62 in 1990-1992.

B. Financina
3.03    The proposed Bank loan of US$38 million would finance about 34% of total
project costs, including about 552 (US$26.9 million) of foreign exchange costs
and about 18S (US$11.1 million) of local costs. Monetized donated commodities
are expected to finance about 51% (US$56.9 million) of project costs. EEC has
indicated that it vould be prepared to donate about 13,000 tonnes of skin milk
powder and 6,500 tonnes of butter oil over the life of the project subject to a
year to year review of project requirenents. UFP has also indicated that it
would be prepared to donate about 13,000 tonnes of skin milk powder. The
Netherlands Government has expressed a willingness to provide approximately
US$7.5 million equivalent which vould cover 7S of project cost. It would be a
condition of effectiveness that the cofinancing and the comodity assistance
agreenents have been properly executed between the Borrower and the respective
parties. Financing of the remaining cost (US$8.8 million, including incremental
working capital estimated at U8$5.6 million) would be through a government
short-term loan to DDF of US$0.4 million equivalent, US$2.6 million in equity
investments in project entities by shareholders, and US$5.8 million in funds
generated from operations. The proposed financing plan is shown in Table 3.3.
US$0.6 million of the total US$2.9 million pre-project costs would be financed
from the Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Advances from the PPF would
cover training (US$0.2 million), technical assistance (US$0.2 million), and
organization and management (US$0.2 million) costs. Dutch funds and commodity



-23-
assistance would finance US$1.5 million and US$0.4 million, respectively, of
pre-project costs. This support for pre-project activities would, hovever, not
provide DDF vith readily available cash for initial operation start-up costs.
on a direct payment basis, the PPF vould finance only technical assistance and
overseas training, while disbursements for local costs would be against state-
ments of expenditure. The Dutch assistance would be made available as a grant
package (equipment and technical assistance) and the sale of donated commodities
vould require some time before funds would be generated. Until such funds are
generated, DDF would need cash funding of about SLRs 10 million (US$0.4 million)
as short term loan from the Government. An assurance vas obtained that Govern-
ment would provide the funds required for project start-up operations under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.

3.04    On-lending Terms and Conditions.  The Government would be the Borrower
and vould repay the Bank loan over a 20-year period, including a 5-year initial
grace period, vith interest during construction capitalized for the first four
years, at the standard variable interest rate. GOSL would execute a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with DDF under which it would on-lend the Bank funds to DDF at
the standard variable interest rate plus two percentage points for the foreign
exchange risk, vith repayment over a 15-year period, including a 5-year grace
period. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. DDF would enter
into Participation Agreements with NILCO, the MPC and VMPC/V)APA providing for
the on-lending of part of the funds lent to it by GOSL. It would be a condition
of effectiveness that the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and the Participation
Agreements between DDF and MILCO and DDF and the MPC are satisfactory to the
Bank and have been properly executed. DDF would extend long-term loans to other
project entities for the financing of commercial (e.g. construction of milk
plants and chilling centers) as well as non-commercial (e.g. staff training,
technical assistance, technical services) activities. It would also make
short-term loans for working capital. On-lending of funds by DDF would be at
14% for long-term loans and 16Z for vorking capital loans. Repayment of
long-term loans would be over 15 years vith a 3-year grace period on repayment
of principal. At the current interest rate on IBRD loans of about 10, this
would yield a 4% to 6% margin to DDF on on-lent funds. In Sri Lanka current
commercial interest rates for medium- and long-term agricultural loans range



-24-
from 11.5% to 16Z depending on the reputation of the client and the nature of
the loan. Longer term loans provided by the National Savings Bank and the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon are at about 17%. Under the proposed
project, lending rates of 14% and 16% vould be positive in relation to
medium-term inflation rates (para 3.01). On-lending rates of DDF would be
reviewed semi-annually to ensure that they remain positive in real terms. An
assurance to this effect vas obtained.
C. Accounts and Audits
3.05    The entities established under the project would be limited liability
companies incorporated under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. This act
requires annual audit of accounts by a member of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Sri Lanka, registered under the Companies Act to undertake
audits. Each project entity would prepare separate accounts vbich would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Assurances
were obtained that DDF would furnish to the Bank certified copies of its audited
financial statements within nine months of the end of the financial year, and
that the Participation Agreements between DDF and the other project entities
(para 3.04) would spell out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank the disposition
of audited financial statements of MILCO, the MPC, the VHPC and the VNPA. The
audit reports would certify that funds disbursed against statements of expendi-
ture (SOE) have been used for purposes of the project.
3.06    To ensure that the auditors of VMPCIVHPA  accounts carry out their work
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and that there is a
uniform approach to auditing, a Draft Questionnaire and Validation Guidance
Program has been prepared and is available in the Project File. In addition,
auditors appointed by the Directors of DDF to carry out its audit would also
review on a regular basis the work of VMPC/VMPA auditors. Also, DDF and MILCO
vould make joint appointments to an Audit Committee which would act as a
sub-committee of their Boards of Directors. This Audit Committee would consist
of serving Directors with financial background, Chief Financial Officers (one of
whom would act as Secretary), and independent auditors from professional
accounting firms. The purpose of the Audit Committee would be to review the
overall progress of audits and to gain further insights into the financial
positions of the varluus project entities. Assurance was obtained that an Audit
Committee with composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank would
be formed within six months following loan effectiveness.
IV. PROJECT ORGAJIZATON AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Essential Features of Corporate Entities
General
4.01    The corporate entities which would be vested with the responsibility
of implementing the project are:
(a) Dairy Development Foundation (Guarantee) Limited (DDF);



-25-
(b) Milk Industries of LankA Company Limited (MILCO);
(c) Milkshed Producers' Companies Limited (HPC); and
(d) Village Milk Producers' Companies (Private) Limited (VNPC).
4.02    The charts in Annex II summarize the functions and financial structures
of these entities. In the Project File, Draft Memoranda and Articles of
Association are given. The ViPA participating in the project would have equal
status with the VMPC.
Dairy Development Foundation (Guarantee) Limited (DDF)
4.03    General. DDF would be formed to spearhead the development of the dairy
industry of Sri Lanka. It would be the focal point for implementation, and all
funding would flow through it. DDF would provide all initial funding for the
establishment of the other project entities, including long-term loans and
working capital. Machinery and equipment as well as technical inputs (e.g.
semen) for the project would be passed on to the implementing entities at full
cost to be repaid through long-term loans. DDF would be the recipient of com-
modity assistance and would sell the skim milk powder and butter oil to MILCO at
market price. The funds received would be used to help finance the project.
IBRD funds would pass from GOSL to DDF for on-lending to MILCO, NPC and
VMPCIVMPA. Funds from the Netherlands Government would also pass through DDF.
4.04    Objectives. As stated in its Memorandua of Association, the primary
objectives of DDF are:
(a) "To promote by all such means as are available to the Company the
development throughout Sri Lanka of the dairy industry in all its
aspects and to achieve the maxim  beinefit to the people of Sri Lanks
therefrom including attainment of increase in production of milk and all
other related dairy products in its several forms; and
(b)  To assist and aid the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka in develop-
ing the dairy industry."
4.05    Income and Turnover Taxes and Customs Duties.  The Company has been
classified as being formed for charitable purposes and therefore would be exempt
from income tax under Section 8 (d) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979.
The objectives and functions of DDF have been discussed vith the Couissioner of
Inland Revenues and the Company meets the basic criterion for exemption from
income tax. DDF would also be exempted from turnover tax and from customs
duties on imported dairy commodities under Section 19 (a) of the Customs
Ordinance.
4.06    Profits and Dividends.  No profits and/or dividends would be declared
and paid at any time during the existence of the Company (para 2.09 (a)). The
assets at the time of liquidation vould be realized and the cash so derived
donated to an approved charity as per the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982.
Milk Industries of Lanka Company Limited (MILCO)
4.07    Functions.  The functions of the Company would be:



-26-
(a) The purchase, processing and marketing of fluid milk and dairy products.
It would set the pricing from producer to retail level (para 5.02);
(b) Reconstitution or recombination of donated and commercially procured
milk products;
(c) Expansion of the capacity and continued modernization of the milk
processing industry; and
(d) Provision of professional management under contract vith concerned
organizations to undertake the management of dairy plants, other milk
processing facilities, and any other entities in the dairy sector or its
related subsectors, such as feedmills.
These functions would include the leasing and operation of existing dairy plants
now owned by NMB, the leasing of IMB chilling centers, and the construction of
new chilling centers. In the initial years, before the new dairy plants become
operational, recombination of donated skim milk powder and butter oil vould be
done at the refurbished Colombo plant. Commodities received before this plant
is ready vould be repackaged under contract and sold directly.
4.08    Share Capital.  The company would be a public limited liability company
whose shares would be quoted by the Colombo Brokers Association and thus be
freely marketable. Fifty one percent of the share capital would be offered for
subscription to the public (public issue by prospectus) and 49% vould be pur-
chased by MPC as they generate funds for investment. The share issue would be
underwritten by DDF. As stated in MILCO's Articles of Association, voting
rights of shareholders are proportional to the shares held; in the case of the
MPC, the shares held vould be in proportion to the value of the milk supplied to
MILCO during the previous year. Dividends vould be distributed on the basis of
share ownership, and an assurance was obtained that dividends would not be paid
until MIlCO-s debt:equity ratio had declined to 60:40. NILCO would have a
nine-member board consisting of three directors appointed by DDF, three MPC
representatives selected by lot from among the five elected MPC chairmen, and
three elected public shareholders. During the first year of operation, the three
MPC representatives would be appointed by Government. Prior to the issuing of
shares, and thus the election of public shareholders, the functions of the board
would be carried out by Government appointed company promoters consisting of
three DDF directors and four representatives from the private sector.
4.09    Income and Turnover Taxes.  Under the provisions of the Inland Revenue
Amending Act No. 14, Section 17 (A), of 1984, dairy development companies have
been granted a tax holiday for five years. Thus, MILCO vould not be liable for
normal taxes of 50Z of taxable income for this period. As it vould be a quoted
public company, withholding tax vould also not be liable on dividends dis-
tributed to shareholders. MILCO would be required to pay turnover tax at 1%.
Milkshed Producers' Companies Limited (MPC)
4.10    Functions.  Five MPC vould be established to cover all districts of Sri
Lanka. These companies would:



-27-
(a) Lease from MILCO and manage NMB chilling centers as well as new chilling
centers constructed by MILCO;
(b)  Collect milk on behalf of MILCO from the VNPCIVNPA and transport it to
chilling centers and/or dairy plants;
(c) Provide technical and extension services to milk producers; and
(d)  Engage in the training of VMPC/VMPA staff and farmers.
The MPC would also invest in MILCO on behalf of the VMPC/VMPA. Eventually the
HPC would hold 49% of the outstanding share capital in MILCO. Since the MPC
would be owned by the VMPC/VMPA in their respective milksheds, the 49% share
represents producer holdings in the processing company.
4.11    Share Capital.  The VMPC/VMPA would be encouraged to invest in their MPC
in proportion to their shares of milk sold to the MPC. Voting rights of
VMPC/VMPA would be in proportion to the value of milk sold to the MPC in the
previous year.
4.12    Distribution of Profits.  In the last month of each financial year, the
Boards of the Companies would ascertain whether surplus funds had been gener-
ated. Any such funds would be distributed on the basis of share ownership by
the V1PC/VMPA.
4.13    Income and Turnover Taxes.  As the Companies would be fully
producer-owned, they would offer services to VMPC/VMPA members at cost so as to
minimize their income and imposition of taxes. As dairy development companies,
they would be exempt from taxes for a period of five years (para 4.09). After
that period, any profits would be subject to income tax at 50Z. Turnover tax
would also be payable at 1Z.
Village Milk Producers' Companies (Private) Limited (VMPC)
4.14    Functions.  The functions of these companies would be:
(a) Collecting, testing, and arranging payment for milk from individual
producers;
(b) Providing technical services (artificial insemination and
para-veterinary services) to their members;
(c) Disseminating to their members extension information on fodder and
pasture production, animal management and fceding, calf rearing, and
milking hygiene; and
(d) Investing on behalf of their members in their respective HPC.
The VMPA would perform the same functions for their members as the VNPC. While
the VMPC/'MPA would sell most of their milk to MILC0, a small quantity (about 5%
of the total) would be retailed locally by the village units.
4.15    Share Capital.  These companies would be incorporated as private com-
panies. The share capital of a VNPC would be SLRs 500,000 divided into 50 Class



-28-
A shares of SLRs 10 each and 49,950 Class B shares of SLRa 10 each. The issued
share capital of a VMPC would at no time exceed SLRs 500,000 in order that such
companies could qualify as small companies under the Internal Revenue Act. The
Spearhead Teams vould organize the registration of VHPC according to a plan
agreed between the MPC and DDF. This organizational work of the MPC would be
done under contract with DDF, The contract would make the MPC responsible for
ensuring that each VMPC would:
(a) Have not less than seven members;
(b) Have only one member per family;
(c) Have as members only those who own milk producing cattle or buffaloes;
(d) Purchase from each member only milk produced by the member;
(e) Sell to each member only one Class A share carrying voting rights;
(f) Sell to all members such Class B shares as they may wish, as and when
these are issued;
(g) Issue Class B shares and so organize its finances as to permit it to
purchase shares in its MPC in proportion to the total milk sold to the
MPC; and
(b)  Inform the MPC when the number of members plus qualifying applicants for
membership approaches 50 so that such companies could be converted into
public companies by passing an appropriate resolution and filing a
statement in lieu of a prospectus.
As long as the VMPC remain private companies, the right to transfer shares would
be restricted so that no Class A share would be transferred to a household which
already held a Class A share in the Company. Class B shares would, however, be
freely transferable among producers supplying milk to the VNPC. In the last
month of each financial year, the VNPC boards would ascertain whether surplus
funds had been generated. 50Z of any such funds would be distributed among
stockholders on the basis of share ownership. The balance of 50Z would be
dist=ibuted on the basis of the value of milk supplied to the VMPC by each
member.
4.16    Income and Turnover Taxes.  The companies would be exempt from taxes
for a period of five years under current law (para 4.09). Since the VMPC would
be fully owned by producers, they would deliver services to producers at or near
cost so as to minimize income, and thus tax obligations, when exemptions would
no longer be applicable.
4.17    After the tax holiday, income tax would be levied on the taxable profits
of these companies at the following rates:



-29-
Up to SLRs 50,000 of taxable income          20%
Next SLRs 100,000                           30%
Next SLRs 100,000                            40%
Balance                                      50%
The companies would be liable to a turnover tax of 12.
4.18    DDF would enter into Participation Agreements with MILCO, the MPC, and
the VMPC/VMPA providing for the onlending of funds by DDF (para 3.04). The
Agreements between DDF, MILCO, and the MPC would also set forth their under-
standings and responsibilities for project implementation. The MPC would enter
into similar agreements with the VMPC/VMPA in which the latter would agree to
abide by the rules and regulations governing milk procurement and the provision
of technical services at the village level. Assurance was obtained that Par-
ticipation Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, would be exchanged between the
MPC and the VMPC/VMPA.
B. Inter-Ministerial Coordination
4.19    Steerinz Committee.  As dairying is influenced by developments and
policies in several ministries, a Steering Committee vould be established which
would coordinate inter-ministerial activities and policies and serve as a deci-
sion making body on policy matters affecting the dairy industry. This Steering
Committee, as a sub-committee of the Committee of Development Secretaries, would
formulate and recommend to the Cabinet, through the concerned ministry, policies
and directives for Sri Lanka's dairy development.  The Committee would not set
milk prices (para 5.02). It would meet at least once every three months and
NRID would provide the secretariat. The Committee would consist of the follow-
ing members:
Chairman: Minister, Ministry of Rural Industrial Development
Convenor:  Secretary, Ministry of Rural Industrial Development
Members:   Secretary, Ministry of Rural Industrial Development
Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning
Secretary, Ministry of Agricultural Development and Research
Secretarv, Ministry of Lands and Land Development
Secretary, Ministry of Trade and Shipping
Secretary, Ministry of Mahaweli Development
Secretary, Ministry of Food and Cooperation
Secretary, Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction
Chairman, Agricultural Development Authority
Chairman or Chief Executive, DDF
Chairman or Chief Executive, MILCO
Assurance was obtained that the Steering Committee with the above composition
and with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank would be formed within
three months after loan effectiveness.

4.21    Procurement of goods and services financed by the Bank would be carried
out by DDF. MILCO would procure the land for the construction of dairy plants
and chilling centers in accordance with established Goverment procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Civil work contracts (US$14.7 million) for construction
of dairy plants, chilling centers, training centers, staff quarters, etc., would
be individually small and dispersed in time and place. Thus, they would be
unsuitable for ICB and would be contracted through LCB under procedures accept-
able to the Bank. Major items of machinery, equipment and vehicles
(US$16.8 million) would be bulked and procured by ICB in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Minor equipment (US$0.5 million) costing less than US$15,000 per
contract that could not be bulked into packages suitable for ICB, or which vould
be required urgently for project implemerntation, would be procured after



-31-
solicitation of quotations from at least three independent suppliers in accord-
ance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Machinery, equipment and
materials procured by Dutch aid (US$3 million) would be on a tied basis from
Dutch suppliers. Bids for imported frozen semen (US$6 million) would be sought
from at least three countries, to be selected in agreement with the Bank, wbere
bulls of the required types are readily available. Hiring of consultants
(US$4.2 million) for assistance in project implementation would be in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Bids for civil works contracts costing over US$185,000
equivalent and equipment contracts over US$50,000 would be subject to prior Bank
review. Other contracts would be subject to selective post award review.
4.22    Disbursements.  Disbursements under the loan would cover:
(a) Civil works - 90% (US$9 million);
(b) Machinery, equipment, materials (including laboratory and veterinary
equipment, chemicals, veterinary pharmaceuticals and semen) and vehicles
(US$12 million):
ti) directly imported - 100% of foreign expenditures;
Cii) locally manufactured - 100% of local expenditures, ex-factory;
Ciii) locally procured (off-the-shelf) - 65% of local costs;
Cc) Consultants' services, training, fellowships and study tours - 100%
(US$2 million);
ud) Incremental staff salaries and operating costs (US$1 million) on a
declining basis: Years 1 and 2 - 95% and Year 3 - 80%;
Ce) Loan interest during construction (US$10 million);
(f) Refunding of project preparation advance (US$0.6 million); and
(g) Unallocated (US$3.4 million).
Disbursements for small civil works contracts (i.e., less than SLRs 500,000)
and for items under (d) above would be made against statements of expenditures
certified by the Chief Executive of the executing entity. Documentation sup-
porting the statements, including receipts and project records, would be
retained in the relevant project office and wade available for review by Bank
staff on request. Assurances were obtained that all documents supporting SOE
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
(para 3.06). Disbursements for civil works contracts for SLRs 500,000 or more
and for items under (b) and (c) above would be documented in accordance with the
Bank's standard requirements. Reimbursement applications would be submitted on
a monthly basis or when such expenditures reach the equivalent of US$20,000.
The withdrawal applications would be prepared by the appropriate executing
entity and then forvarded to DDF for countersigning prior to submission to the
Bank. Advances drawn from the Project Preparation Facility (para 3.03), with
the service charges accrued thereon, would be repaid out of the proceeds of the
proposed loan as soon as it is declared effective.



-32-
4.23    Proiect Special Account.  To ensure that adequate funds are available
for the prefinancing of small contracts and other project expenditrres and to
facilitate the project's timely implementation, a Project Special Account in
US dollars would be established in the Central Bank of Ceylon and operated under
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Only one Special Account would be opened and
only the Bank's share of project costs would be deposited into and disbursed out
of the Account. The initial deposit to be made by the Bank in the Account would
be US$1 million, estimated as the equivalent of four months' average expendi-
ture. The Account would be operated by the Chief Executive of DDF, or his
designate.
4.24    Approximately 80Z of total project expenditures are expected to be
incurred by project Year 5. Since Government would provide no project financing
and since funds generated by the sale of donated dairy commodities would not be
immediately available, the flow of Bank funds to DDF would be accelerated in the
early project years, and loan disbursements are expected to be completed by June
30, 1990, i.e. at a considerably faster rate than that indicated by the South
Asia 10-year average disbursement profile ('nnex VI). However, total project
expenditures would be spread over 7.5 years and would thus resemble rather
closely the average profile. The 7.5-year period is in line with experience
with similar type dairy projects in India.
D. Pre-Investment Activities
4.25    To ensure more rapid implementation of the project, the Government has
initiated a number of activities, some of which have been completed. These
include:
(a) Establishment of an inter-ministry Action Committee c'aired by the
Minister of MRID and including representatives of the Ministries of
Trade and Shipping and Finance and Planning;
(b) Registration, under the Companies Act, of DDF, MILCO, and the MPC, and
the appointment of the initial Boards of Directors (i. :luding the Chair-
men) of these companies;
(c) Acquisition of letters of intent from donors to participate in the
project; and
(d) Completion of arrangements for the initial staffing of DDF, MILCO and
the MPC, including the organizational structure and job descriptions of
key personnel.
4.26    Other pre-project activities currently underway include the folloving:
(a) Recruitment and training overseas (India) of the first members of the
Spearhead Teams and about 15 trainers who would be responsible for
training local project staff and farmers in-country;
(b) Initiation of the refurbishment of the Colombo dairy to enable it to
recombine the donated dairy commodities; and



-33-
(c)  The carrying out of a market survey and z -dies in the field of animal
feeding, animal breeding, and farmer training and extension.
B. Monitorim  and Evaluation
4.27    Given the innovative nature of the project and the substantial institu-
tional and infrastructural development required, an essential feature of project
organization would be a strong monitoring and evaluation system which would
provide guidance for project implemertation and permit a realistic assessment of
project progress. Two independent units, an existing unit within MRID, which
would be strengthened under the project, and one to be established within DDF,
would be responsible for these activities (para 2.18). DDE would organize and
coordinate the collection of data which would be used to prepare regular
progress reports, compare project progress with appraisal targets, and keep
project management informed of implementation problems. Semi-annual progress
reports would be prepared in accordance with a format to be agreed with IBRD.
The MRID unit would prepare annual project evaluation reports for Bank's review
based on independently collected data, as well as data provided by DDF, and
would be responsible for preparation of the Project Completion Report. Assuran-
ces to this effect were obtained. A mid-term review of project activities would
be carried out by IBRD in cooperation with DDE, MRID and the other project
financiers at the completion of the third project year to ensure necessary
adjustments required for the attainment of project obiectives (para 2.07).
V. MARKETING, PRICES. TARIFFS AND SUBSIDIES
A. Narketing
5.01    The main marketing strategy of the proposed project would be to increase
the consumption of fluid milk in both urban and rural markets. However, in the
marketing of fluid milk in rural areas, the cheapest and simplest processing
system-pasteurization--does not give the product sufficient shelf-life to be
distributed by the wholesale-retail network. In addition, the present milk
marketing system does not provide the consumer with fluid milk of satisfactory
quality, convenience, and price, and, consequently, about one half of the milk
presently consumed is purchased in the form of powder. MILCO's basic marketing
aim would be to distribute pasteurized milk in the larger urban markets closer
to the dairy processing plants, and supply long-life (UHT) milk to more distant
markets. The private distribution system which presently handles packaged foods
is both enterprising and efficient and would be used to retail fluid milk and
milk products produced under the project.
B. Prices
5.02    Under the project, MILCO would be granted autonomy in milk pricing from
producer to retail level. The ceiling on consumer prices would be determined by
imported dairy commodities. Differences between prices paid to producers in
different regions of the country would be based on differences in the marginal
costs of milk collection and transport and not on differences in the regional
cost of milk production as this would tend to discourage production in low cost



-34-
areas and encourage it in relatively higher cost areas. The pricing mechanism
should be based on carrying back through the marketing, processing, collection
and transport chain the retail price deducting at each stage the actual ma-ginal
costs incurred. Retail prices would be based on sound economic principles
applied to milk processing and marketing. While Government would always have
the prerogative to intervene in extraordinary situations, an assurance was
obtained that MILCO would be granted autonomy in milk pricing. one of the
objectives of the project (para 2.06 (b)) is to increase the producer's share of
consumer payments for Processed milk to at least 60Z through more efficient
collecting, processing, and marketing. The financial prices used are given in
Annex IV, Table 8. Annex V, Table 2, gives the economic prices used.
C. Tariffs
5.03    With constant domestic milk production, it is estimated that dairy
imports would increase from about 450,000 lpd in milk equivalents to about
730,000 lpd by 1991, and to nearly 1 million lpd by 1996. An incremental milk
production of about 300,000 lpd by 1991 would be required to stabilize imports
at current levels. The proposed project would result in an incremental produc-
tion of about 80,000 lpd by 1991 and about 200,000 lpd by 1995. Thus, even with
the project, commercial dairy imports are not expected to fall from present
levels, and, in fact, may increase.
5.04    The project would promote the development of a more efficient dairy
industry in Sri Lanka through the introduction of major institutional and
organizational schemes (paras 2.02 to 2.06). However, improved efficiency in
the production, collection, processing, and marketing of milk would not be
apparent until these changes are in place and the industry is adequately staffed
with trained personnel. Furthermore, since dairying is a long-term growth
activity, reasonable stability in domestic milk prices is required, especially
during the development period, in order to sustain a steady rate of investment.
The dairy industry would, therefore, continue to need some protection from cheap
milk imports dulring the life of the project. To provide this protection and
stability, the Sri Lanka Dairy Sector Review (April 1983) suggested a variable
tariff on dairy imports. The level of tariff would need to be set in the light
of actual trends in international prices, as well as local milk production
costs. The Steering Committee established under the project (para 4.19) would
periodically review the price/cost data of locally produced and imported milk
and recommend appropriate tariff levels to the Tariff Commission. To minimize
the risk of misallocation of resources and consumer welfare loss, the Goverument
would seek the concurrence of the Bank before raising the tariff above 25%.
Assurance to this effect was obtained.
D. Subsidies
5.05    The project seeks continued and sustained operational and product line
improvements in Sri Lanka's milk processing industry, and the Bank would thus
seek the removal of subsidies presently paid to NMB (para 1.10). Accordingly,
it would be a condition of effectiveness that the SLRs 0.50 per liter subsidy on
processed fluid milk had been removed. It is expected that the subsidy would be
passed entirely to the consumer raising the retail price of fluid milk to
SLRs 8.50 per liter. This should not unduly impair fluid milk's competitiveness



-35-
since the existing price of imported whole milk powder is SLRs 8.90 per liter
equivalent. Furthermore, assurance was obtained that the present subsidy of
SLRs 1.0 per liter of milk used for the domestic manufacture of whole milk
powder would be phased out within two years of loan effectiveness. Under the
project, MILCO would take over the operation of NMB's existing milk powder
factory and, through diversification into more profitable products, eliminate
the basis of the subsidy on fluid milk processed locally into whole milk powder.
VI. FINANCIAL VIABILITY
6.01    Detailed financial projections for all project entities are available
in the Project File. For the financial analysis the detailed projections were
consolidated and summarized in order to highlight critical areas.
A. Dairy Development Foundation
6.02    All funds for the project would be channelled through DDF.  External
funds in the form of a grant, monetized commodities and the IBRD loan would form
the basis of financing for the project. In addition, DDF operations would
generate significant funds over the project period. The flow of funds and DDF's
financial projections are summarized in Table 6.1.

DDF's main operational concern would be to ensure that sufficient funds are
available to provide the necessary inputs to project operating units during
implementation. More detailed financial projections (Annex IV, Table 1) indi-
cate that net fund flows for DDF would be adequate. From Year 4 on, DDF vould
have generated sufficient internal cash flow to cover operational requirements
and could begin retiring its debt. However, it has been assumed that the
long-term debt would have a 5-year grace period in order to provide some
allowance for project implementation slippage. Debt servicing would start in
Year 6. While DDY s cumulative profits are not positive, its cumulative cash



-37-
flow is. At the end of Year 10, DDF vould have sufficient net assets to retire
its remaining debt.
6.03   DDF would underwrite the share issue of HILCO, and thus it would have
a contingent liability in the early years of about US$2 million for the equity
inputs to NILCO. This liability would reduce as MILCO stock is taken up by the
public and the VMPC/VMPA. The project envisages that 512 of MILCO stock would
be held by the public and 49Z 'y the VMPC/VNPA.

These projections indicate that NILCO from its incorporation would be a viable
and profitable operation. Sales revenues are projected to increase substan-
tially over the period from a level of about SLRs 800 million in Year 1 to over
SLRB 4,400 million by Year 10. Profitability is relatively consistent over the
period with gross profit averaging IlZ of sales and net profit after tax about
3Z. Net cash flows are positive for all operating years and after dividend
payments and allowances for working capital would accumulate to about SLRs
902 million by Year 10. The financial rate of return (FRR) is estimated to be
about 26Z. MILCO's total assets would increase over the period to SLRs 1,326 million-
and owner's equity to SLRs 902 million in current terms. Debt to equity ratio
would average about 60:40 falling to about 30:70 by Year 10 as debt is retired.
Debt service coverage which averages about 1.4 from Year 4 on is satisfactory.
6.05    The FRR, while at an acceptable level of about 26Z, is very sensitive
to changes in benefits or costs. A 5% negative change in either stream, without
a corresponding change in the other, would cause the FRR to fall below 10%.
This indicates that MILCO would have to pass most of any market price reductions
on to the NPC and VMPC/VNPA.
C. Milkshed Producers' Companies
6.06    These companies would be incorporated to provide services to the VMPC
and earn sufficient revenues to cover cash outlays. Consolidated revenue for
the EPC is projected to increase from SLRs 96 million in Year 1 to about
SLRs 600 million in Year 10. Consolidated statements (Annex IV, Table 3) for
the MPC indicate that estimated net cash flow would be positive. Cash flow from
operations is expected to accumulate to SLRs 150 million over the first 10
years. Generated funds from DDF (2% of the resale value of donated commodities)
would be passed on as a grant to the MPC for the purchase of shares in MILCO on
behalf of the VWPC/VMPA. It is estimated that this transfer would allow the MPC
to purchase about SLRs 27.5 million in MILCO equity.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Milk Production and Procurement
7.01    As summarized in Table 7.1, by Year 7, 1,950 VMPC are expected to be
formed with a total membership of about 180,000. Incremental milk production
is estimated at 106,000 lpd by Year 7, and about 208,000 lpd by Year 10.
Increased milk production would result from increases in milk yields as a conse-
quence of improved feeding and management and the partial conversion of the
national herd from low-yielding indigenous animals to higher-yielding
crossbreds, and modest growth in the herd due to increased calving rates and
reduced mortalities. Milk procurement is projected to expand by about 173,000
lpd by Year 7 and 275,000 lpd by Year 10. Milk procurement under the project is
expected to rise from the present level of about 27% to 46% of total production.
This increase appears feasible given the village-based procurement system
envisaged under the project. The difference in incremental production and
procurement represents the gains in procurement from collecting milk in pre-
viously untapped areas. Milk now produced in these areas is either consumed at
home or is sold locally (para 1.07).
7.02    In a typical VMPC, the number of milk animals would increase by about
10% by Year 7 of the project, and by about 16% by Year 10. The composition of
the VMPC herd would also change. While the percentage of buffaloes would remain
fairly constant at about 20%, the proportion of indigenous cattle would drop
from a present level of about 65% to 58% by Year 7, and 42% by Year 10.
Crossbreds, on the other hand, vould increase from about 13Z of the total at
present to 20% and 35%, respectively, by Years 7 and 10. Average daily milk
yield per animal would also rise, and by Year 7 of the project it is expected to
be 25% higher than the present yield (0.9 lpd) and by Year 10 about 60% higher.

B. Proiect Viability and Economic Returns
7.03    Analysis of the project's viability is based on three benefit streams:
Ca)  Benefits from the incremental procurement of milk and its movement from
rural areas where it commands a low value to urban areas vhere it
fetches a higher value;
Cb)  Benefits of incremental home consumption of milk; and
(c)  Benefits from incremental by-products, including sales of manure and
stock.
Incremental milk production has been estimated through the use of herd models
for each milkshed which take into account increases in milk yield and growth of
the herd due to increased calving rates, reduced mortality, and the partial
conversion of the herd from low yielding indigenous animals to higher yielding
crossbreds. Incremental milk procurement has been estimated on the basis of
expansion in the number of VMPC, the increase in the number of producers supply-
ing milk to VMPC, and the incremental milk production occurring in the VMPC area
of influence. Home consumption of milk was taken as production net of procure-
ment. In calculating benefits, the value of incremental procurement of milk was
estimated from the increased projected sales of milk and milk products by the
project's dairy plants. Economic prices for fluid milk were based on the Decem-
ber 1984 CIF cost of imported whole milk powder adjusted for handling, process-
ing and packaging costs. For milk products, current local prices were adjusted
by conversion factors to estimate equivalent border prices.. Economic prices
used are shown in Annex V, Table 2. A fertilizer conversion factor was applied
in estimating the value of manure.



-42-
7.04    Investment costs include costs of primary producers as vell as costs of
all project entities, i.e., VMPC, MPC, MILCO, and DDF. In the case of primary
producers, these are based on incremental capital costs per liter of milk tines
year-to-year incremental milk production of the first 10 years of the project,
assuming replacements at the same levels for subsequent 10-year periods.
Project entities' investment costs cover civil works, machinery and equipment,
vehicles, technical assistance, training, technical services, and organization
and management.
7.05    Farm models for the different milksheds and types of animals were
employed to estimate operating costs under the existing technology of milk
production and under improved technology. In the benefit streams, it is assumed
that the new technology is fully adopted by a producer five years after he
becomes a supplier of milk to a VNPC. Operating costs include costs for primary
producers, VMPC, MPC, and MILCO. Producer operating costs are based on per
liter production costs estimated for different milksheds under both existing and
new technology conditions. The production costs were converted to economic
values by a standard conversion factor of 0.9. Family and hired labor were
shadow priced at 80% and 90Z of market values, respectively, to reflect current
levels of unemployment.
7.06    Computations based on the above premises yielded an economic rate of
return of about 23% (Annex V, Table 1). Sensitivity tests indicated that the
project is more resilient to increases in investment and operating costs than to
decreased sales revenues stemming from a decrease in price. A second base run
was made on the assumption that the skim milk powder and butter oil donated for
the purposes of the project would be a tied resource; that is, they would not be
fungible nor forthcoming without the project, hence, their value is treated as
an economic benefit. Under this assumption, the estimated economic rate of
return is about 46%. Economic rates of return are summarized in Table 7.2.

C. Other Impacts
7.07    The main institutional changes brought about by the project and the
establishment of a vertically intergrated organizational structure with producer
ownership in the entities' responsible for the collection, processing, and
marketing of milk would:
(a) Help ensure that the technical inputs necessary for increasing milk
output and improving the efficiency of production are provided;
(b) Allow producers to participate in the profits obtainable in milk
processing and marketing;
(c) Provide a mechanism by which incentive prices can reach the farmer; and
(d) Help ensure that consumers have increased access to high-quality milk
and milk products at fair prices.
7.08    Incremental on-farm employment generated during the first seven years
of the project is estimated at 25,000 man years distributed among about 180,000
households. Additional employment along with management opportunities vould
also be created through the establishment of the various project entities. In
terms of gross income, it is estimated that in year 7 project participants would
receive about SLRI 750 million as income from the sale of milk. With a average
return to labor of about SLRs 3.40 per liter, this is anticipated to yield an
increase in net income by year 7 of about SLRs 265 million, or about SLRs 1,470
per household.
7.09    As cattle and buffaloes are more evenly distributed the land, with even
those too poor to own cultivable land often keeping animals, the incremental
income from milk among rural households would tend to be more evenly distributed
than with developmert projects involving crop production. With dairying
expected to expand into the Dry Zone, vhere incomes and opportunities for alter-
native production activities are particularly low, regional distributions of
income would also improve.
7.10    As milk is an expensive source of both calories and protein, the low
allocation of household expenditures to milk and milk products by low income
households indicates a rational utilization of income since equally nutritious
sources of these nutrients can be purchased at lower cost in other foods, thus
resulting in a positive contribution to overall nutrition. Furthermore, in
rural areas, dairying offers farmers the opportunity to gain good returns
steadily over many months of the year.
7.11    Draft power is a major contribution of the livestock sub-sector in
Sri Lanka; however, it is difficult to effectively tackle the problems of draft
animals directly. On the other hand, it is considered that draft animals would
benefit from the development of the dairy industry, and their general improve-
ment through better feeding and veterinary care and through crossbreeding would
be an important side benefit of dairy development.



-44-
D. Proiect Risks
7.12    The proposed project would require substantial institutional change and
like all such projects would have inherent risks. Change, while welcomed by
many, is resisted by those with vested interests in the status-quo, despite the
inefficiencies and the costs it often imposes on others and on a country's
development. To minimize this risk, any ESB staff taken on by the new project
entities would be rigorously screened by the entity concerned before employment.
Experience vith many Bank projects has indicated that directing investments
through inefficient organizations also has inherent risks and often results in
projects that fail to fulfill their objectives. Such was the case with the
Bank's involvement in the first Sri Lanka Dairy Project (Cr. 504-CE) where the
institution (UHB) directly involved with the project was overstaffed, ineffi-
cient, and heavily subsidized. As a consequence, and despite investments in
technical inputs and technical assistance by the Bank and other donors, the
development impact through increased milk production could not be realized as
the institutional and pricing structure inhibited producers from adopting new
practices. GOSL and the Bank both realize that such inefficiencies must be
alleviated through institutional change despite the difficulties and risks
involved in such change. The Government's recent pricing reforms (para 1.10)
indicate their commitment to putting economic rationale into the sector. The
proposed project also has the support of many in the private sector who would
like to see the dairy industry achieve its potential through folloving commer-
cial principles and the building of an efficient processing and marketing Sys-
tem.
7.13    The project carries a financial risk.  Monetized donated commodities
are expected to finance about 51Z of total project costs. Both the EEC and WFP
have indicated an interest in supporting the project through the provision of
dairy commodities, and it is expected that such support would be provided
throughout the project implementation period. Hovever, in the event of a
shortage of commodities, the following sources of financing could be explored:
borrowing by DDF from local development bank and other sources of commodity
assistance. The Netherlands' Government has also indicated that it might
provide funding beyond Year 3. If financing from these sources was not
forthcoming, the project would have to be reduced in scope.
7.14    The project would also carry the inherent risks of a private sector
development where uncertainties in supplies and markets put premiums on expert
management. Since this would be the first attempt at implementing such a
project, the appointment of top level staff for the project entities would be
critical. The institutions established under the project, being private sector
with high-valued throughput (by Year 7 of the project MILCO would process milk
with a retail value of SLRs 1,350 million), would be able to attract and hold
highly qualified management staff who are available in Sri Lanka. To ensure
that DDF, MILCO, the MPC and the VMPC are adequately staffed, the project would
give considerable emphasis to staff training (para 2.15). Financial analysis of
the various project entities indicates that rates of return are relatively high
and operating performance resilient to many of the uncertainties facing the
firms (Chapter VI).
7.15    MILCO is envisaged as a high volume/low margin operation and thus is
highly sensitive to changes in revenue or costs, especially if one changes
without a corresponding change in the other (para 6.06). On the reverse side,



-45-
the basic determinant would be the international price level of dairy com-
modities. At the present time, these international prices are very depressed,
and as it is these depressed prices which have been used in the analyses, the
probability of major price falls undermining HILCO's viability is low. However,
to guard against deleterious movements in international prices, provision is
made for the imposition of a variable tariff (para 5.04). This would protect
against a fall in international prices of about 16Z from the levels used in the
analyses. Any further fall in international prices would have to be cushioned
by reducing the procurement price offered producers. On the cost side, there is
no reason to believe that MILCO's costs will move out of line with the general
cost/price relationships assumed in the analyses.
7.16    Although the project would not be implemented by Goveroment agencies,
Government commitment to the project would be critical, particularly in the
early period to ensure the establishment of sound implementing agencies.
7.17    Farmers' responsiveness to the proposed project is a risk.  They may be
reluctant to accept the unfamiliar, private VHPC. In this connection, the
effectiveness of the MPC Spearhead Teams (para 2.15 (a)) becomes all important.
7.18    Lastly, timing of the project could be considered a risk.  Given the
present world prices of dairy commodities (skim milk powder and butter oil),
it could be argued that this is not the proper time to implement the project
since milk producers in Sri Lanka cannot compete with imported dairy products
without some type of Government intervention (para 5.04). Furthermore, increas-
ing the local production of milk in effect simply adds to the vorld surplus of
dairy products. On the other hand, recent events indicate that this may be an
opportune time to undertake the project. Both EEC countries and the US have
taken what appear to be effective measures to reduce surplus production of milk.
Given the time required to increase milk output through the development of a
national herd of genetically superior dairy animals, it seems obvious that now
is the time to initiate the development of Sri Lanka's dairy industry rather
than waiting until world surpluses of dairy products disappear, especially so
since even with present prices the project is economically viable (para 7.06).
In any event, since the project is heavily dependent upon donated dairy com-
modities for financing, it must be carried out while surpluses of such com-
modities exist.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01    At negotiations, Government gave assurances that:
(a) NNB's dairy plants and chilling centers would be leased to MILCO and the
NMB would be abolished by September 30, 1986 (para 2.10);
(b) The Dairy Plant Engineer would be appointed by December 31, 1985 (para
2.12);
(c) The acquisition of building sites and the final designs for the process-
ing and chilling facilities scheduled for construction in Project Year 2
be completed by September 30, 1986 (para 2.12);



-46-
(d) Funds required for project start-up operations would be provided under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.03);
(e) Interest rates on loans by DDF to MILCO, the MPC and VMPC/VMPA would
be reviewed semi-annually and adjusted as necessary to ensure that DDF's
on-lending rates remain positive in real terms (para 3.04);
(f) DDF would furnish to the Bank certified copies of its audited financial
statements within nine months of the end of the financial year, and that
Participation Agreements between DDF and the other project entities
would spell out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank the disposition of
the audited financial statements of MILCO, the MPC and the VMPC/VKPA
(para 3.05);
(g)  An Audit Committee with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank
would be formed within six months following loan effectiveness
(para 3.06);
'h) MILCO would not distribute dividends until its debt:equity ratio
declined to 60:40 (para 4.08);
(i) The MPC and the VMPC/VNPA would exchange Participation Agreement, satis-
factory to the Bank, setting forth their understandings and respon-
sibilities under the project (para 4.18);
(j) The Steering Committee with terms of reference and composition satisfac-
tory to the Bank would be formed within three months after loan effec-
tiveness (para 4.19);
(k) All documents supporting SOE would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank (para 4.22);
(f) DDF would prepare semi-annual progress reports while the monitoring unit
in MRID would prepare annual project evaluation reports and would be
responsible for preparation of the Project Completion Report (para
4.27);
tm) MILCO would be granted autonomy in milk pricing (para 5.02);
(n) Concurrence of the Bank would be sought before the tariff on imported
dairy products is raised above 25% (para 5.04); and
(o) The subsidy on milk used by NMB for the local manufacture of whole milk
powder would be phased out vithin two years of loan effectiveness
(para 5.05).
8.02    Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that:
(a)  The lease agreement between NMB and MILCO concerning NMB's dairy plants
and chilling centers has been entered into (para 2.10);
(b) The cofinancing and the commodity assistance agreements have been
properly executed (para 3.03);



-47-
(c) The Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOSL and DDF and the Participation
Agreements between DDF and MILCO and DDF and the MIPC have been properly
executed (para 3.04); and
(d) The subsidy on processed fluid milk has been removed (para 5.05).
8.03    With the above assurances and covenants, the project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$38 million to the Democratic Socialist Republic of
Sri Lanka for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
