SHALLOW TUBEWELL AND LOW-LIFT PUMP IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Cr, 2253-BD)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Shallow Tubewell and
Low-Lift Pump Irrigation Project in Bangladesh for which Cr. 2253-BD in the amount of
SDR 52.2 million (US$75 million) was approved on May 30, 1991 and made effective on
December 30, 1991.
Due to slowness in disbursement, two-thirds of the credit, SDR 35 million, was
cancelled at Government's request on 13 April, 1994. The remaining SDR 17.2 million
was disbursed by the closing of the project accounts on 10 May, 1995.
Preparation of the ICR was undertaken by an FAO/CP mission' which visited
Bangladesh in February 1995. It is based on a review of project files both in Washington and
Dhaka, field investigations and discussions with Government and project staff and interested
agencies and institutions. The aide-memoire (Appendix A), drafted by the mission, has been
conformed to include views expressed at the final meeting in Dhaka. Bangladesh Bank prepared
its evaluation of the project, whiich is included as Apendix C. The Borrower also contributed by
providing other data required during the mission's stay and assisting the mission in its work.

SHALLOW TUBEWELL AND LOW-LIFT PUMP IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Cr.2253-BD)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
A policy dialogue between the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and IDA developed
from the Agricultural Sector Review in 1988/1989 recognized the potential for agricultural
development based on expansion of minor irrigation and the need for policy changes towards
greater deregulation of agriculture and encouragement of the private sector. As a result, a
strategy was developed and agreed between GOB and the main donor agencies for an Action
Programme for Policy and Institutional Reforms for the minor irrigation sector covering minor
irrigation equipment and inputs, foodgrain management and institutional reform. Emphasis was
given to deregulation and encouragement of minor irrigation development led by the private
sector. The strategy for policy reform was also supported by the contemporary National Minor
Irrigation Development Project (Cr.2246-BD) as well as projects financed by the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB).
Project Objectives
In addition to the above policy objectives, the project aimed at increasing agricultural
production, incomes and employment. The credit was to finance the foreign exchange cost of
importing 81,000 engines of up to 20 hp for use with shallow tubewells (STW) and low-lift
pumps (LLP) and import of 18,000 power tillers. This equipment was expected to irrigate and
cultivate an area of around 460,000 ha. The credit was to be drawn on to finance letters of credit
for pump importers/dealers and was to be channelled through the Bangladesh Bank (BB) and the
commercial banks. Since BB was to be reimbursed with the Taka value of the letter of credit
by the importer/dealer, through the commercial bank, there were no on-lending arrangements.
While BB was to be the main implementing agency, it was planned to establish a small
monitoring and evaluation unit within MOA, which, in the event, was never implemented.
Implementation Experience and Results
Covenants included in the Development Credit Agreement required the commercial
banks to sign a Participation Instrument with BB and the importers/dealers to sign a Dealer
Agreement with the commercial banks. These conditions seriously constrained disbursements at
a time when foreign exchange had, in any case, become much more freely available. As a result,
disbursements were very disappointing and two-thirds of the credit (SDR35 million) were



iii
cancelled. However, due to the availability and import of somewhat smaller and very much
cheaper engines than those envisaged at appraisal, it appears that the number of items of
equipment imported and the total area benefitted, exceed the estimates made at appraisal.
Records maintained by the Bangladesh Bank show that around 118,500 pump engines and about
12,600 power tillers have been imported under the project, and these figures have been used in
the calculation of project benefits. There does, however, seem to be a considerable discrepancy
between the disbursements made for import of power tillers and the much larger number of
power tillers (33,000) for which letters of credit were opened under the credit. This appears to
be the result of the eventual financing of a portion of these imports from other available import
credits from IDA and other sources.
Re-evaluation of financial and economic performance of the project indicates that
increases in farm family incomes, return per day of family labour and financial rate of return on
investment in STW, LLP and power tillers would all be broadly similar to those estimated in the
SAR. The economic rate of return is recalculated at about 65%, slightly higher than the 62%
calculated at appraisal. Furthermore, the estimated area and number of families benefitted is
about the same as those estimated at appraisal, which, considering that only one-third of the credit
was used, is a remarkable achievement.
The project was similarly successful in assisting Government to make the policy
changes to encourage deregulated minor irrigation development led by the private sector, to
withdraw the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) from involvement in
STW and LLP equipment and spare parts supply, to liberalize fertilizer supply and discontinue
subsidies, and to provide greater freedom to the private sector in grain import and storage.
IDA performance was very good in providing the necessary assistance in sector
studies and in promoting a detailed strategy of policy reform to be agreed between Government
and the main donor agencies. Performance was similarly good in maintaining good cooperation
with the other main donor, AsDB. Inclusion of restrictive conditions regarding the need for
Participation Instruments and Dealer Agreements to be signed by commercial banks and dealers
was a major reason for poor disbursements and a flaw in project design.
Borrower performance was generally satisfactory. Carrying out the schedule of
policy changes was clearly not easy for Government, but all of the major policy changes
supported by the project had been implemented by the end of the project. Compliance with other
legal covenants included in the DCA was somewhat erratic.
Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
There is no reason to believe that the project is not fully sustainable. The financial
analysis indicates that farmers should not have any difficulty in being able to purchase
replacement equipment from their accumulated savings from irrigated agriculture. Moreover, the
availability of workshops and mechanics able to undertake major overhauls appears to have
increased as a result of this and other similar projects. The mission has also reviewed the



iv
information available on groundwater exploitation by STW and concludes that at present
generally, outside urban areas, groundwater resources are not being over-exploited. Despite the
fact that some wells dry up at the end of the dry season, it appears that generally each year the
aquifer is completely recharged by the end of the wet season. The overall assessment of the
project is satisfactory.
The main lessons learned as a result of the project are as follows:
(i)       projects which aim at de-regulation and liberalization should not impose
additional restrictions which jeopardize achievement of the project's
objectives;
(ii)      as conditions change, such as liberalized access of the private sector to
foreign exchange, IDA should be alert to adjust projects more rapidly,
(iii)     projects based on careful sector and policy analysis and involving
agreement on a policy strategy agreed by Government and major donors
provide a good basis for making politically problematic policy reforms;
(iv)      continued commitment and vigilance is required to ensure, even where
policy changes have been made in order to liberalize markets and
encourage private sector development, that there is no piecemeal return
to regulated markets in response to pressures for introduction of
subsidies, duties, taxes and physical controls;
(v)       monitoring and evaluation proposals need to be detailed and focussed
and borrowers need to be convinced of the need for such activities;
(vi)      small pumps and engines which require a minimum of sharing with
other users are much more popular than larger units;
(vii)     a project launch workshop is valuable in providing information on the
project to the implementing agencies and intermediaries and provides an
opportunity for them to express their concerns on implementation
arrangements.

SHALLOW TUBEWELL AND LOW-LIFT PUMP IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Cr. 2253-BD)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.        As well as the immediate and direct objectives of promotion of agricultural
production, incomes and employment, the project had a more fundamental objective as part of
a strategy developed and agreed between Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and the main donor
agencies. This was to carry through an Action Programme for Policy and Institutional Reforms
for the minor irrigation subsector, covering minor irrigation and power tillers, complementary
inputs, foodgrain management and institutional reform. Particular emphasis was given to
deregulation and encouragement of minor irrigation development led by the private sector,
including the retirement of the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Cooperation (BADC) from
supplying shallow tubewell and low-lift pump equipment and spare parts, removal of all
restrictions on fertiliser importation as well as fertiliser subsidies, and allowance of a greater and
freer role for the private sector in grain storage and importing. This agreed strategy of policy
change was embodied not only in this project, but also in the National Minor Irrigation
Development Project (Cr. 2246-BD) as well as in the Foodcrop Development Programme and the
North-East Minor Irrigation Project, financed by the Asian Development Bank (AsDB).
2.         The project's direct objectives of increasing agricultural production, incomes and
employment, were to be achieved by expanding irrigated area and improving land cultivation.
To this end, the project provided foreign exchange to allow import of:-
(i)       81,000 engines of up to 20 hp to power shallow tubewells (STW) and
low-lift pumps (LLP), so as to allow farmers to irrigate a further
460,000 ha; and
(ii)       18,000 power tillers to cultivate around 460,000 ha.
3.        In addition, the project was to finance consultancy and other costs for monitoring
and evaluation of the project's progress and impact, at a cost of US$150,000.
4.        The IDA credit was channelled through the Bangladesh Bank (BB) which established
a foreign exchange facility, which could be drawn on by private equipment importers/dealers
through their commercial banks, as letters of credit. Payment at all levels was on a cash basis
with Bangladesh Bank receiving payment in Taka to the value of the letter of credit from a Taka



2
payment made by the dealer/importer, who subsequently sold the equipment to farmers. There
was, therefore, no on-lending of the credit.
5.         The project objectives were clear and well developed, based on adequate sectoral
studies, and were supported by good dialogue and agreement between GOB and the main donor
agencies. Moreover, the project concept and method of operation was simple and appropriate to
the development needs of the subsector. However, two aspects constrained the project's
performance as discussed in the following section.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
6.        The project was successful in helping GOB to attain its policy objectives. Covenants
in the Development Credit Agreement were supported by similar conditions in other IDA and
AsDB projects and included: phasing out of BADC involvement in STWs and LLPs; abolition
of fertiliser subsidies; reduction in customs duty and tariff on engines for irrigation up to 20 hp
and power tillers not to exceed 5%  of the free on board (f.o.b.) value;  abolition of
standardisation on imported irrigation equipment and restrictions in siting of wells; ensuring that
contracts for commercial import of foodgrain be awarded on the basis of international tender and
abolition of restrictions on credit for foodgrain storage. All of these covenants were eventually
complied with by GOB.
7.         The credit became effective on 30 December, 1991. Since project preparation,
foreign exchange had become much more freely available, both as a result of increased foreign
exchange reserves as well as funds provided by the IDA Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit
(ISAC) and the Public Resource Management Adjustment Credit (PRMAC). Also, the project
required the commercial banks involved in the project to sign a Participation Instrument with BB
and for dealers to sign a Dealers Agreement with the commercial bank. These two documents
included a number of undertakings inter alia that the dealer would sell engines only for irrigation
and cultivation, that only engines with 6 months warranties (guarantees) would be imported and
the warranties would be passed on to the farmers; the dealer would keep a list of those farmers
receiving engines and power tillers; and that the commercial bank would provide a signed copy
of the Dealer agreement to BB. Thus, at the same time as encouraging deregulation, the project
attempted to impose a few rules of its own.
8.        As a result of the ready availability of foreign exchange from other sources and the
restrictions imposed by the two above requirements, disbursement 18 months after credit
effectiveness was only about 12% of the total credit. Although the restrictive effects of the
Participation Instrument and the Dealers Agreement were recognised by the first supervision
mission in September 1992, it was not until late 1993 that the requirement for a Dealers
Agreement was waived by IDA, and in view of the slowness of disbursements GOB requested
cancellation of two-thirds of the credit (US$50 million) as from 13 April, 1994. The remaining
third of the credit was fully disbursed by closure of the credit accounts on 10 May, 1995.

9.             As a result of the policy of deregulation of imports, somewhat smaller and very
much cheaper engines and power tillers have been imported than foreseen at appraisal with the
result that numbers of units provided as a result of the project apparently exceed the numbers
projected at appraisal, as follows:-
SAR                                      ICR
No. or Units  |   Area benefitted        No. of Units       Area benefitted
(ha)                                     (ha)
STW engines                      75,000             340,000)
118.465             460,000
LLP engines                       6,000             120,000)
Power tillers                    18,000              460,000              12,608              294,000
10.          Based on the assumed number of units derived above, the number of families
benefitted, foodgrain produced and incremental employment generated would be similar to those
projected at appraisal, as shown below'
SAR                 ICR
Benefiting farm families (no.)                                             525,000            525,000
Annual incremental foodgrain production (tons)                           1.3 million        1.6 million
Annual incremental agricultural employment (days)                       46.7 million       52.4 million
11.          The small component for establishing a monitoring and evaluation unit within the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was not proceeded with. The National Minor Irrigation
Development Project (Cr. 2246-BD) and the FAO executed project Assisting Transformation to
Irrigated Agriculture (ATIA) are both monitoring agricultural development and production.
12.          Re-evaluations of the financial and economic benefits of the project are broadly in
line with the projections made at appraisal. Financial analysis of a I ha farm indicates that
family income with the project would be about 59% higher than without the project. This
compares with a 75% increase forecast at appraisal. The poorer performance in the ICR
evaluation is due to the lower output prices and higher input costs assumed, which reflect the
present cost/price squeeze on farmers, relative to the situation at appraisal2 . For the same
reason, returns per family labour day are estimated to increase by about 25% in the ICR re-
evaluation compared to a 43% increase calculated in the SAR.
I.  Assumptions made to estimate these numbers are described in Appendix B.
2.  The appraisal analysis was also based on subsidised fertiliser costs, which was somewhat inconsistent in a
project aimed at supporting removal of fertiliser subsidies by government.



4
13.        Financial rates of return calculated on farmers investments in equipment, compared
with those calculated in the SAR are as follows:-
SAR              ICR
FIRR (%)
Low-lift pumps          60               61
Shallow tubewells       39               40
Power tillers f         59               29
f          The basis of calculation of the financial rate of return differs
from that used in the SAR, as described in Appendix B:
14.        The economic rate of return of the project is re-estimated at 65%, assuming a price
for paddy based on export parity.  Since the project's impact has not been monitored or
evaluated, and since the control on end use of pumps intended to be provided by the Dealers
Agreement never occurred, there must be concern as to whether it is realistic to assume that all
the engines have., in fact, been used for powering pumps for irrigation purposes. As set out in
Appendix B, a sensitivity analysis has been made to see the effect on the project's economic rate
of return if a proportion of pump engines are used for purposes without an appreciable economic
benefit. This shows that if 20% of engines were so used and 80% used for irrigation, the
project's economic rate of return would decline to 59% and, if only 60% were used for irrigation,
the economic rate of return would be about 50%. However, most alternative uses of engines,
such as propelling boats, would also provide substantial economic benefits.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.        Factors not generally subject to government control. The three main factors
affecting the project's performance were the increased availability of foreign exchange as a result
of increased foreign exchange reserves, repatriation of money by expatriate Bangladesh citizens
and additional import credits from IDA and other sources; the constraint to disbursement
represented by the restrictions imposed by the project, in particular the Dealers Agreement; and
the large decrease in cost of imported engines, facilitated by deregulation of imports and
benefiting from low-priced exports, predominantly from China.
16.        Factors generally subject to government control.  Government policies for
liberalization of access to foreign exchange for private sector importers, while beneficial for the
economy as a whole, reduced the need of private sector importers to make use of the credit, when
less restrictive sources of funds were available. Despite the fact that a monitoring unit was
reported in the SAR to have been set up wvithin MOA, no separate unit was established and no
monitoring was undertaken by the project. The lack of data collected specifically to enable an
assessment to be made of the project's performance and impact is a constraint to a proper
evaluation of the project results.



5
17.       Factors generally subject to implementation agency control. The project was
effectively implemented by BB, which generally appears to have performed its role satisfactorily.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
18.       The policy changes made by GOB and supported by the project have had a positive
effect on encouraging private sector participation in the minor irrigation subsector and in partially
liberalising the fertiliser trade. However, it will be important to avoid any possible regression
to the previously existing situation. Customs duty on engines of between 3 and 20 hp for
agricultural use has already been increased to 7.5% as part of a tariff simplification supported by
the ISAC. Moreover, the amount payable is calculated on a tariff value higher than the actual
value and consequently importers pay a higher rate of customs duty. In addition, all equipment
has to pay a value added tax of 15%. Government also continues to fix prices and control the
movement of urea produced in the country by Bangladesh Chemical Industries (BCI), which is
a state monopoly. In early 1995 the ex-factory price was fixed at around US$93 per ton, whereas
the world price had risen sharply to over US$200 per ton.
19.       The cheaper engines which have been imported are likely to have shorter lives than
the more expensive types imported previously. However, the engines imported are of a simple
type and lend themselves to repair by local mechanics with only simple facilities. It is reported
that there is considerable growth in village workshops able to overhaul and repair these simple
engines.
20.       Concerns regarding possible over-exploitation of aquifers by STW do not seem to
be supported by the information presently available. Although there are regular reports of wells
for drinking water purposes going dry at the end of the dry season, present monitoring of the
water table indicates that the aquifers are fully recharged at the end of the succeeding wet season
and outside urban areas there is no trend towards permanently lowered water tables. On the
contrary, the indication is that storage in groundwater aquifers is being made better use of for
irrigation. Problems of village drinking water supply at the end of the dry season can be resolved
cost effectively by increased use of force mode pumps, which are being more generally installed.
Continued monitoring of the groundwater situation is, however, required and is being undertaken
E. IDA PERFORMANCE
21.       IDA performance in pre-appraisal sectoral studies and helping Government to
develop a well thought through policy strategy in close collaboration with the other donors was
excellent, and project appraisal and implementation benefited from this sound basis. The project
experience has shown that it was a mistake to include restrictions on the commercial banks and
dealers in the operation of the project. It was also unfortunate that, although the effect of these
restrictions in reducing disbursement had been identified by the first supervision mission in
September 1992, it was about a further year before they were lifted. The IDA recommerliaticr
to cancel two-thirds of the credit was sensible and relations with the borrower were generally



6
supportive and satisfactory. Very good cooperation between IDA and AsDB was a very positive
feature of the project.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.       Borrower performance was good in undertaking the difficult policy changes
supported by the project, all of which were successfully carried through by the end of the project
period. Greater efforts in the initial year of the project in encouraging applications to draw on
the credit by the commercial banks could have resulted in more satisfactory disbursement. A
reintroduction of siting restrictions for tubewells in January 1992 was rescinded in August 1992
after representation by IDA.
23.       Implementation of the policy changes was not easy for GOB. In particular, the
practical problems of selling of BADC's STW/LLP equipment and spare parts presented
difficulties, which were only resolved at the end of the project.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
24.       The project, together with the other projects having similar conditionalities and
covenants, was successful in supporting Government in making the important policy changes to
encourage a more liberal minor irrigation subsector led by the private sector. The outcome has
been assessed as satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
25.       Based on the apparent returns from operation of STW and LLP, farmers should be
able to finance re-equipping when required from accumulated profits. Expansion in small scale
pumped irrigation using small, simple engines and pumps has encouraged growth of village
workshops and provided a livelihood for their mechanics, who can service the equipment and are
increasingly able to undertake complete overhaul and even manufacture spare parts. Future
operation is, therefore, fully sustainable.
26.       The implications of increased use of STW on groundwater resources is discussed in
para. 20.

I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
27.        Covenants. With the benefit of hindsight, it does not appear sensible in a project
which aims to support deregulation, to include a number of restrictions in the use of the credit
and the operation of the financial intermediaries, which were problematic in compliance, and in
any case virtually impossible to police.
28.       Borrower/credit agency relationship. The project demonstrates that thorough
sector studies and good collaboration between GOB, IDA and AsDB can result in considerable
success in helping Government to deregulate and liberalise its policies.
29.       Adaptability.  The project demonstrates that as conditions change, such as
liberalization of private sector access to foreign exchange, IDA should be alert to adjust projects
more rapidly.
30.       Sustainability.  Despite the gains made as a result of the policy changes,
Government commitment to their new policies will be needed in order to prevent a creeping
return to a regulated market in response to pressures for introduction of subsidies, duties, taxes
and physical controls. The recent rapid increase in the world price of urea has had the effect of
making the GOB price heavily subsidised.
31.       Monitoring and evaluation. Proposals for monitoring and evaluation in projects
are frequently inadequately detailed and focused and borrowers are often reluctant to establish
permanent monitoring and evaluation units.
32.       Pump and engine size.  Sharing of water from a well can involve social and
organisational complexities and requires cooperation between farmers.  Low-priced, small
capacity pumps. which require a minimum of sharing with other users, are much more popular
than larger units.
33.       Project launch workshop. The slow start of the project might have been mitigated
by arranging a workshop, which would have provided information on the project to the
implementing agencies, including the commercial banks and dealers, as well as providing an
opportunity for them to express their concerns on implementation arrangements.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
SHALLOW TUBEWELL AND LOW-LIFT PUMP IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Cr.2253-BD))
Appendix A
Mission's Aide-Memoire
1. Introduction
1.        An FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP) mission consisting of J.
H. Weatherhogg (Mission Leader/Economist), R. G. Paterson (Irrigation Engineer) and
Muhammad Ali (Irrigation Engineer/Hydrologist, local consultant) visited Bangladesh from 6 to
19 February, 1995, to prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on the above project.
This Aide-Memoire is based on discussions with Government and World Bank staff, Bangladesh
Bank, commercial banks and dealers who participated in the project, as well as with a number
of agencies and individuals involved in irrigation and agricultural development in Bangladesh,
and a review of World Bank (WB) documentation on the project and other relevant studies and
reports.
2.        A draft of this Aide-Memoire was presented and discussed at a wrap-up meeting,
chaired by Mr. Azad Ruhul Amin, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, on 18 February,
1995. Amendments put forward at the meeting have been incorporated.
3.        The mission wishes to thank all the agencies and their staff for their time given in
the discussions and the valuable information and opinions received.
2. Background
4.         Project origin. A policy dialogue between Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and
WB developed from the Agricultural Sector Review in 1988, recognised the potential for
agricultural development based on expansion of minor irrigation and the need for policy changes
towards greater de-regulation of agriculture and encouragement of private sector participation.
These changes in policy were embodied both in this project as well as in the National Minor
Irrigation Development Project (Cr.2246-BD), also financed by IDA, as well as the Foodcrops
Development Programme and the North-East Minor Irrigation Project, financed by the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB).
5.        The project objectives were to assist Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in
increasing agricultural production, incomes and employment by expanding irrigated area and
improving land cultivation. The project was to provide the foreign exchange to allow import of
(a) 81,000 engines of up to 20 hp to power shallow tubewells (STW) and low-lift pumps (LLP)
to enable farmers to increase irrigated area by around 460,000 ha, and (b) 18,000 power tillers

Appendix A: Mission's Aide Memoire
for land cultivation, as well as (c) monitor and evaluate the above activities through establishment
of a project monitoring and evaluation unit in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The estimated
project cost over a three year implementation period of around US$127 million was to be
financed by an IDA credit of US$75 million and by a farmer contribution, estimated at around
US$52 million. The contribution of GOB was limited to US$50,000 for monitoring and
evaluation.
6.         Covenants in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) required GOB to (a) cause
the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) to dispose of its stock of STW
and LLP, (b) abolish subsidies and not thereafter subsidise prices of fertilisers, (c) ensure that
customs duty and tariff on imported engines up to 20 hp for minor irrigation and power tillers
did not exceed 5% of the free-on-board (f.o.b.) value, (d) abolish standardisation requirements
for imported irrigation equipment, (e) abolish restrictions on siting tubewells in non-surface
irrigation areas, (f) ensure that contracts for commercial import of foodgrain are awarded on the
basis of international tender, and (g) abolish restrictions on credit for storage of foodgrains and
facilitate foodgrain storage by the private sector.
7.         Project organisation arrangements were for the credit to be used by Bangladesh
Bank (BB) to provide the foreign exchange to participating commercial banks so that they could
provide letters of credit as required by the importers of the equipment. BB was therefore
responsible for use of the IDA credit and MOA only had responsibility for the small monitoring
and evaluation component.
8.         Project implementation. The credit became effective on 30 December, 1991.
flowever, in the period since preparation of the project, foreign exchange had become more freely
available, both as a result of increased foreign exchange reserves and funds provided under the
IDA financed Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit (ISAC) and the Public Resource Management
Adjustment Credit (PRMAC). As a result, disbursement 18 months after credit effectiveness was
less than 3% of the total credit. Accordingly GOB requested cancellation of two-thirds of the
credit (US$50 million) as from 13 April, 1994. The remaining third of the credit is expected to
be virtually completely used as intended in provision of foreign exchange for import of engines
for STW and LLP and power tillers. Although the total cost of imports is much lower than
originally projected, due to a very significant decrease in unit prices of imported pump engines
as a result of de-regulation, the numbers of engines imported appear close to the numbers
estimated in the SAR and numbers of power tillers will exceed the SAR estimates. The
component for establishment of a monitoring and evaluation unit within MOA was not
implemented under this project. The NMIDP and ATIA projects are now monitoring agricultural
development and production. The TA team attached to NMIDP is to explore the possibilities and
recommend a permanent solution for long-term monitoring of minor irrigation.

9.          All the covenants included in the DCA which related to changes in policies were
eventually complied with by GOB. The financial covenant regarding audit (DCA Section 4.01,
(b) (ii)) requiring audit reports to be submitted within six months of the year end date was not
met. The first audit report of the project was submitted on 14 August, 1994.
3. Mission Findings
10.        Project results. Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the number of pump
engines and power tillers imported and area benefitted is broadly comparable to the estimates
made in the SAR. Financial benefits to farmers and economic benefits to Bangladesh can
therefore be expected to be quite positive. In addition to the direct production and income
benefits, the project also has much larger beneficial effects through the policy changes which it
has supported. These include the liberalisation of the minor irrigation sub-sector, increased
mobilisation of the private sector and reduction in the distortions in trade of fertilisers and
foodgrains.
11.        Borrower performance was quite good in undertaking the difficult policy changes
supported by the project. Greater efforts in the initial year of the project could have resulted in
more satisfactory disbursement of the credit.
12.        IDA performance. The project experience has shown that it was a mistake to
include restrictions on the commercial banks and dealers in the operation of the project. Both the
Participating Instrument between BB and the banks, and the Dealer Agreement between the
commercial banks and the dealers effectively blocked the credit and the Dealers Agreement
subsequently had to be waived. IDA's recommendation to GOB to cancel two-thirds of the credit
was sensible.
13.        Sustainability: (a) Continued compliance with covenants. Customs duty on
engines of 3 to 20 hp for agricultural use and on power tillers has been increased to 7.5% as part
of simplification of tariff rates supported by WB, and in accordance with the ISAC. In addition,
all equipment has to pay a value added tax of 15% Duties are generally calculated on a tariff
value for each item of equipment, which is generally set above the actual price'. On fertiliser,
the ex-factory price of urea is set by GOB, currently at Tk3,750 per ton (US$93 per ton),
considerably below world prices which have recently risen sharply to US$200 or more per ton.
1. For example, a power tiller may have an actual price of US$760, but a tariff value, set by the customs for the
purposes of calculating duty of US$825. The effective rate of duty in this case is therefore 8.1%.

Appendix A: Mission's Aide Memoire
14.        (b) Life of engines and power tillers. The engines being imported are considerably
cheaper and apparently more popular with farmers than the more expensive engines imported
when the market was regulated. Although this change must be to the benefit of farmers, these
engines are expected to have a much shorter economic life compared to the engines previously
imported.
15.        Environmental impact: (a) Groundwater level. As tubewell irrigation increases
the level of the water table in the dry season declines and shallow wells, including those for
drinking water supply, run dry in the latter part of the dry season. In this situation, in order to
maintain supplies it is necessary either to deep-set the pump, or adopt force-mode pumping, using
the Tara pump for drinking water supply. The additional costs of so doing are minor compared
to the benefits obtained from irrigation. Environmental aspects of minor irrigation are presently
monitored by MOA through NMIDP.
16.        (b) BADC. Once BADC disposed of its stock of STW and LLP as required by the
project and most of its deep tubewells (DTW), the role of the irrigation wing of BADC largely
disappeared. Nevertheless, a staff of 6,000 or more will remain after planned voluntary
redundancies have been effected. Under NMIDP and Cereal Seed Project II, GOB is to
restructure BADC. This is expected to be undertaken shortly, including recommendations for
redeploying staff remaining following the retirement programme.
4. Lessons Learned
17.        Covenants. With the benefit of hindsight it does not appear sensible in a project
which aims to support de-regulation to include a number of restrictions on the use of the credit
and the operation of the financial intermediaries, which were problematic in compliance and in
any case virtually impossible to police. This was identified as a problem by the first supervision
mission in September 1992, but it was not until more than half way through the project life that
the requirement for Dealers Agreements was waived by WB. This emphasises the need to ensure
that projects do not include unrealistic covenants.
18.        Borrower/Credit Agency Relationship. The project demonstrates considerable
success in helping Government to de-regulate and liberalise its policies, based on thorough sector
studies and good collaboration between GOB, IDA and AsDB.
19.        Sustainability. Despite the gains made as a result of the policy changes introduced
by the project, the recent movements in fertiliser prices and problems in the supply of fertilisers,
indicates that GOB will need to be vigilant to prevent a creeping return to a regulated market
supported by various distorting subsidies, duties, taxes and physical controls.

20.        Monitoring and evaluation proposals included in projects are frequently
inadequately detailed and focused and borrowers are often reluctant to establish permanent
monitoring and evaluation units. In the case of this project, it was apparent that there was an
overlap in monitoring needs with the NMIDP. It will clearly be important for further successful
development of the sub-sector that arrangements are made for continuous monitoring to be
undertaken by an adequately staffed and equipped permanent unit.
21.        Pump and engine size. Sharing of water from a well can involve social and
organisational complexities and requires cooperation between farmers. Low priced, small
capacity pumps, which require a minimum of sharing with other users, are much more popular
than larger units.
22.        Project Launch Workshop.  The slow start of the project might have been
mitigated by arranging a workshop, which would have provided information on the project to the
implementing agencies, including commercial banks and dealers, as well as providing an
opportunity for them to express their concerns on implementation arrangements.
5. Follow-Up
23.        The mission will prepare an ICR report which will be transmitted to WB by mid-
April 1995. The mission requested the assistance of BB in providing data on letter of credit
operations to Mr. Muhammad Ali to enable him to finalise information on expenditures and
quantities of equipment imported as a result of the project. This would be sent to the mission
in Rome by the end of February 1995. GOB should prepare their own evaluation of the project
implementation. General guidance for the GOB contribution is presented in Attachment 1.

Attachment I
Guidance on Government's Contribution to the ICR
Government's own final evaluation of the project implementation is an important
part of an ICR. It is attached, unedited, to the ICR sent to the WB Board. It can be selective
in its coverage and should address issues and lessons learned in project implementation, from the
borrower's perspective. Topics covered can be the same as in the ICR, namely, project design,
appraisal, implementation and project results. At each stage of the project the contribution should
comment on both IDA and the implementing agencies' performance, with the observations, where
possible, supported by evidence or reasoned argument.
For project design the contribution could address such questions as the
appropriateness of the project's objectives, the size of the project and scope of the investments
proposed, aspects of design leading to easy (or difficult) implementation and the effect on
government institutions.
For project appraisal comments should concentrate on any significant changes in
the objectives, size and scope of the project and whether these were appropriate.
Project implementation experience should be divided into an assessment of IDA
performance in supporting and supervising the project and the performance of the implementing
agencies.
Project results include both an assessment of the direct physical benefits leading to
financial and economic benefits (or dis-benefits) arising from the policy changes. Since financial
and economic re-analysis of the project will be undertaken as part of the ICR, it is suggested, if
GOB so wishes, that the contribution could most usefully comment on the effect of the policy
changes from the Government's perspective. Such an analysis would be a most useful
contribution to the ICR.
Based on the foregoing sections, the contribution should list the main lessons learned
from the implementation experience and arising from the above analysis.
WB suggest that if the contribution is more than ten pages it should include a
summary. The latter is recommended for all but the shortest contributions.
The mission will be happy to provide any further elaboration or clarification required
to assist in preparation of the contribution.

Financial and Economic Analysis
Financial Analysis
1.          In the absence of any specific monitoring of the project and its beneficiaries, the
financial analysis has been based on surveys carried out by the National Minor Irrigation
Development Project supplemented by other recent feasibility reports and studies. Discussions
in Bangladesh with government and project staff confirmed the validity of the cropping patterns
assumed in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and generally also confirmed the yield projections
for the without and with project situations. Clearly, it is problematic to arrive at average
cropping patterns and yields for the whole of Bangladesh, particularly when survey data is always
location-specific. The ICR analysis adopts the SAR cropping patterns without any amendment.
Changes in yield estimates, which reflect some improvements in the without project situation
compared to those projected at appraisal, and some increase in yields with the project, notably
in the boro crop, which appear to be indicated by the survey information, are as follows:-

This is not intended to show that the SAR understated yield of vegetables, but simply that the ICR has adopted
eggplant (brinjal) as the representative of the category.

2.           In parallel with the increased yield of some crops in the with project situation, use
of crop inputs, shown in Table 2, are generally somewhat higher than in the SAR.
3.           Based on the cropping patterns, yield estimates and input use, a budget for a I ha
farm, comparable to that included in the SAR, has been prepared, which is presented in Table
4. This covers arable cropping enterprises only. The analysis shows that at the financial prices
assumed, given in Table 3, in the without project situation the income from arable cropping is
inadequate to fully cover the family's subsistence needs, even if no hired labour is employed. It
also shows that on the basis of the assumptions included in the SAR regarding the division of
costs and benefits between landlords and sharecroppers, the return to the latter is going to be
considerably less than required to support a family. The table does not show the full family
budget including income from tree crops, livestock and off-farm income. However, with small
owner operators facing the same cost/price squeeze there will be a tendency to mobilise family
labour to the full extent possible and reduce hire of labour, so lessening opportunities for
increased off-farm income in rural areas.
4.           Gross family income from crops and net value of production per family labour day
in the SAR, compared with those shown in Table 4, are as follows:-

5.           Re-estimation of the financial result for investment by farmers in low-lift pumps,
shallow tubewells and power tillers are all positive and broadly in line with the rates of return
calculated at appraisal, decrease in margin between value of production and production costs
being offset by the significantly lower cost of the equipment. Equipment life has been estimated
at 5 years for motors, pumps and power tillers and at 10 years for STW and low-lift
infrastructure. The analyses are presented in Tables 5, 6 and 7. For low-lift pumps and shallow
tubewells the analysis is comparable with that made at appraisal but with an allowance made in
the ICR calculation for incremental working capital. For the analysis of power tillers, the SAR
included also the costs and benefits from 6 STW, which does not give any indication of the
return from investment in power tillers per se. The ICR therefore uses a financial analysis based

on benefits equal to the cost of cultivation by animal power. Additional benefits from improved
quality of cultivation and improved timeliness have not been calculated. An allowance has been
made in the ICR calculation for incremental working capital. The financial rates of return
calculated, together with those included in the SAR, are as follows:-
SAb|               ICR
Low-lift pumps              60                 61
Shallow tubewells          39                  40
Power tillers               59                 29
Economic Analysis
6.         For the economic analysis, in addition to the rather broad assumptions that are
required in estimating net production benefits, a number of important assumptions are required
in estimating the total project costs and the number and type of units of equipment actually
fielded and installed. The pump engines imported using the foreign exchange made available by
the project only account for less than 30% of total project cost', with the balance provided by
farmers. According to Bangladesh Bank, the credit was used for the import of a total of 118,465
pump engines and 12,608 power tillers.
7.         The economic analysis assumes that the above numbers of engines and power tillers
have been fielded. Also, since there is no information on the subsequent use of the engines made
by the farmer, it has been assumed that they were all used for powering new shallow tubewells.
The fact that some would have been used for low-lift pumps, and a number would have been
used to replace existing engines, would tend to result in a higher economic rate of return than that
calculated.
8.         Pump engines and power tillers have been valued at late 1994/early 1995 prices,
before tax. Local costs have been adjusted by a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9. Labour
for installation of the equipment is considered as skilled and no labour conversion factor has been
applied. The local component of operating costs has also been adjusted by the SCF and diesel
has been charged at the unadjusted financial price of Tkl2.7 per litre.
1.  The SAR estimated 59%, based on more expensive engine types.

9.         Agricultural production benefits have been projected based on World Bank price
forecasts for internationally traded commodities.  In view  of Bangladesh's apparent self-
sufficiency in rice in years of normal weather, paddy prices have been calculated on export parity,
as shown in Table 8. Locally traded commodities and local costs of production have been
adjusted by the SCF of 0.9. Both family and hired labour has been costed at market rates adjusted
by a labour conversion factor (LCF) of 0.7 as well as by the SCF of 0.9.
10.        On the basis of these assumptions, estimates and adjustments, the economic rate of
return on the project investments is as set out in Table 9 and summarised below:-
Economic Rate of Return
Pumped irrigation               71
Power tillers                   35
Whole project                   65
11.        At appraisal, conditions were included to try to ensure that the equipment was used
for irrigation purposes, but this restriction prevented disbursement and was relaxed. It is,
therefore, not possible to provide any estimate of those engines used for irrigation and those kept
for other purposes. The same type of engine is now popular for propelling boats, but often this
seems to use old engines after they have been used for irrigation. Also, generally no matter what
use the engines are put to would result in a corresponding flow of economic benefits. However,
assuming that 20% of the engines were used for some purpose without any appreciable benefit,
the economic rate of return of the pumped irrigation component would decline to about 64%.
If the number of engines diverted to other non-economically beneficial purposes increased to
40%, the economic rate of return for the irrigation component would fall to 54%, indicating the
relatively minor importance of the capital costs compared to the incremental value of production
and production cost streams. Taking into account the combination of the irrigation and power
tiller components, the effect of assuming 20% or 40% of the engines were diverted to non-
economically beneficial purposes would be to reduce the economic rate of return for the total
project to 59% and 50% respectively.

I.   The   Project   .    DA's   Shallow   TubeWeil   and   LowLift
Pumc(Si -V&-L:?)Irrg  atian ?roject (Cr 32 3-D) f1cr SDR 52.2 million.
effe :ive  rcrm 30.'2.91 and corcluded on 3I.l2.I994, was designed
to saucort _angladesn Government's policy and institutional reforms
in the mincr irri,ation sector, with emphasis cn deregulation and
orivate  setoro  led development  of minor  irrigat ion. The  policy
reform was also supported , mcre or less concurrently    by IDA's
National  Min.or  Irrigation  Development  Project  (NMTDP).  ADB'S
Foodcrops De-velopment Programme Loan (Loan No - 1045 BAN(5F)) and
Ncrth East Minor Irrigation Project (Loan NO-1125 -BAN(SF)).
Althcugch  the  S'W  & LLP  Ir-igation  Development  Project  was
originally apc-roved for SDR 52.2 mi!lion . it was scaled down in
ear!y  1994  to) one  third  the  initi-a  size,  to  SDRI7 .2 mil lion
ecause arf  ow offItke of project funds.
2.   Operational  Objectives  and  Impiementation  Design  of  the
Project            With covenan.s  requiring  implementation of the
overali po'icy objectives mentioned above , the project sought to
suoocrt inc7ease in agriculture producticn, incomes ard employme.-nt
by :inancin,g the foreign exchange cost of importing 81,000 engines
Cf up to   2Oh-u for use with Shallow 'rubeWe1ls(STSW)  and LowLilt
Punips(L-LP) and imnort of 18,000 Power Tillers . Bangladesh Bank(BB)
was to use Pro ject funds to provide foreign exchange to commercial
banks establishing letters of credit for import of these equipments
by impcrter!/ dealers. The project was also to finance consultancy
and  other  costs  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project
prcvress an-- impact.
Coveneants  included  in Development  Credi;  Agreement  (DCA)
required comme rciai banks to sign Fa:ticipation Instruments with h BB
and the imrioorers/dealer3 to sign Dealer Agreements (DA) with the
com,mercial banks.  In terms of the Dealer Agreement a dealer was to
import  engines lnd  lor  power  tillers  with  at  least six  month
warranty and t^ provide such warrenty to farmers. A dealer was also

required to sell the equipment only to farmers who would u  trm w
exclusively for purposes intended by the project.
The project a!so stipulated establishment of a Monitoring and
_va _ation Mnit(MEt   in the Ministry of Agriculture ('40A). Ths MEU

to ,monitor use of these ecuipmenrt by farmers to ensure thst these
were used exclu.ively Tor purposes intended by the prcject.
3.   Implementation  Experience and Results: Reports of appraisals
car,-ied out at IDA's behest bear out  that  the major policy and
.nstitu:ion|. changes covenanted in the DCA, (viz, phasing cut of
BADC  involvement  i-  S7s  and  'LPs,  abolition  c  fertilizer
subsidies, reduction  in, customs  duty  and tariff on engines  for
irrigation  and  power  tillers,  abolition  of  standardisation  of
imported  irrigation  equipment  and  well-  siting  restrictions,
ensuring that commercial foodgrain import contracts are awarded on
tne  basis  of  international  tender  and  abolition  of  credit
restriction on focdgrs.in storage) were duly ccmplied with byt the
Government.
W iit h   BADC   disengaging   itself   from   procurement   and
distribution of minor irrigation  equipment  , private sector. got
fully involved in these ope-rations. As per available data ,import
of about  UtSS 41 miliion worth of  irrigation  engines and power
tillers took place during July 1991 to December 199d. Despite this
substantia! imoor;a.in activity of irrigation engines and power
tillers over the project pericd , offtake of project iunds proved
extremely  slow.  W:th  easy  azcess  to  foreign  exc,,ange    for
importation under no rmaI ccmmercil acrran :mernts , dealers were not
1nterested in. executing the restrictive and cunsstraining  Dealer
Agreements with  commercial  banks  for  import under the project.
Likewise   ,  commerc ial  bannk s  were  very  slow  ir  executing
Participation  Instruments  with  0B  as  they  saw  no  particular
advantage ir. doing so over normal commercial import carrangementa.
Private secto. imocrts of irrigation engines cnd power tillers were
nhus essentially cut o' cash  Loreign exchange  resources of the
count.-y.  As  the:e were no Dealer  activity and ccmmercial  bank
activity under any Dealer Agreement cr Participation Instrument,
there was  little in practice for the M,EU in the MOA to monitor.
7his was perhaps thc r-ason why no separate MEU specifically for
this project was set. uo in the MOA.

That the restrictive conditionalities of the Dealer Agreement
were  severely  impeding  utiiisation  of  the  project  funds  was
recognized early on; but thc docision to -escind the reaulrr3mett uL
Dealer Agreement and to use instead on ex-post basis the documents
of ,,Mpor-.  ,rom the countrv's own resources, of eligibla items over
the  project  period  came  abo ut  in  late  '99;           afier  which
utilisaticn  of the project  funds 3acelerated.  With tIe observed
preference of farmers for the smaller caaacity lower priced
engines.the prcject fund siza   was reassessed and scaled down(as
from, 13 Aprll,1994) to one third the originally sanctioned amount
viz  t0 SDR :7t.2 millicn. The f-ull tum of this scaied down amcunr
was fully ut iised b.y the end of -he project  period.

cf over SDR  50 mllioni  the actual position  of importation  cf
118365 units Co  engines and 12608 units of Power tillers at a cost
of cnly SDR 17.2 million   appctr2 to reflect favorably on project
performance, even after taking into account the smaller capacity

The USS 24.33 millin  (SDR 17.2 million)  financed by this
project is seen to have covered about 60% of the total import co0t
(around UTSS 41 million) c. t'ne ccuntry over the project period.for
these itens.
4.  Conclusion: From the zosie-cn ciscused in the foregoing it
mav be inferred  that   pe ,rcje:t  acLaieved  in  'uLL  its policy
ob-ectives.there was over  achievement  D-  physical  objectives  in
resoect G. irr Liation engines and under performance in respect of
power tiLler- imports.However, not &!' private sector power tiiler
cr   rria tion engine imo-rts over- zhe zrcj  : Period was covered by
this :rOjec: and the shortfali  does not necessarily indicate any
scarzity irn power tiller ava:ILability.
.t appears  that  the  initial fu,nd size  for the project was
estillatedbby project desiSner, on the basis of past experience wi.th
costiier.  Iarger  capacity  ir:igation  equipment  procured  aid
supervised by BADC for collective use. When, as intended by the
project. procuarement deci9'sicns were left- to the private sector, the
users were seen to opt for smaile. and cheaper equipment usable
with  a  minimum  of  sharing.7he  ir tial  project  cost  estimate
consequently proved to be on the high s ide.  It also appears that
the restrictive conditioriatities of th.e "ealer Agreement intended
to ensure  proper end use c. the  equicment were  thought  to be
practicable  on  the  assumption  that  the  general  situati-on  of
scarcity and restricted aillcative access to foreign
exchange would conti nue ,There was however major liberaIisation
in .he fc-iegn excha:nge regi.me during the proje. period and allI
permissible  imports  had  easy non allocative  access  to f7r;egn
exchange.This caused the special, restrictive acce8s window through
Deaer   Agreements  to  be   ignore-  by   intended   uSer3.These
deveiopments were not clearly foreseen or adequately provided for
in the original  pro.ect design. but the project did subseqently
adapt appro:riately.leading to its succe3ful conclusion.
