MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A SHALLOW TUBEWELL AND LOW LIFT PUMP IRRIGATIONI PR CT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Bangladesh for SDR 52.2 million (US$75.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity, to help finance a Shallow Tubevell
(STW) and Low Lift Pump (LLP) Irrigation Project.
2.        Sector Background. Agriculture in Bangladesh accounts for 50X of
GDP, employs 75X of the labor force and generates 60% of the country's export
earnings. For almost three decades, the main source of growth in the
agricultural sector has been expansion of the area under irrigation, which has
led farmers to begin using modern agricultural tecbniques and inputs such as
fertilizers and seeds of high-yielding varieties (HYV) of crops, especially
paddy. More recently, to meet the more demanding cropping schedules
associated with the use of improved inputs under irrigation, farmers have been
investing in power tillers, especially in view of the shortage of draft
animals caused by the scarcity of land required to raise feed and fodder.
With sufficient investment in irrigation, the growth of foodgrain production,
consisting mainly of rice, could reach 4X-5Z per annum, compared to 2.6X in
FY81-90.
3.        Substantial sector work undertaken by IDA over the past two years
in close collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and other
donors, and discussed at the 1989 Donors Meeting on Agriculture, chaired by
IDA, has helped clarify that the chief constraints to accelerated minor
irrigation development are: (a) barriers to private sector distribution of
minor irrigation equipment in the form of: (i) high customs duties and
Government standardization requirements on imported equipment and power
tillers; (ii) siting regulations for equipment; and (iii) high public sector
stocks of equipment which have deterred the private sector from entering the
business; (b) the absence of a well-functioning credit system; (c) limited
access by the private sector to predominantly imported triple superphosphate
(TSP) and muriate of potash (MP) fertilizers and HYV seeds, which has
constrained farmer access to these critical inputs; and (d) excessive reliance
on public sector imports of foodgrains, which have resulted in downward
pressure on producer prices for the main outputs of irrigated agriculture,
rice and wheat.
4.        Influenced by the findings of IDA sector work, GOB has embarked on
a long overdue program of liberalization, deregulation and privatization
designed to unleash the energies of the private sector in minor irrigation
development. As a first step under this strategy, GOB suspended customs
duties and standardization requirements on small imported engines suitable for
the operation of STW and LLP, as well as regulations governing their siting.
As a result, investment by farmers in both STW and LLP grew by 221 in 1989.
Tentative figures for 1990 indicate a further increase of 211 for STW and 18X
for ILP. Customs duties and standardization requirements for power tillers



2
were also suspended, after which investments rose by 400X. GOB is now eager
to consolidate the reforms undertaken and to complete the transition to the
new, more liberalized/deregulated regime. However, it is concerned that it is
unable to finance the foreign exchange cost of the increased private
investments in minor irrigation equipment and power tillers resulting from the
reforms. Investment in this type of equipment Is not directly supported by
any donor assistance program, since it is financed largely from farmers,
savings and/or non-institutional credit, the latter of which has traditionally
provided 901 of credit requirements. Assistance is now required so that the
private sector can meet the increased demand for STW, LLP and power tillers,
sales of which are presently handled by about 315 private equipment dealers
located mainly in Dhaka and Chittagong, as well as other cities and towns
throughout the country.
5.        Experience gained during the implementation of previous minor
irrigation projects and the IDA supported Import Program Credits has
highlighted the need for the liberalization of input suiqly and subsidy
removal to encourage more efficient private sector involvement, particularly
in the supply of irrigation equipment and fertilizer. On the basis of this
experience, GOB, in close cooperation with IDA and the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), has developed over the past year a list of investments and input
requirements linked to an Action Program for Policy and Institutional Reforms
for minor irrigation development covering minor irrigation equipment and power
tillers, complementary inputs, foodgrain management and institutional reform.
ADB is supporting this package with a quick-disbursing Foodcrops Development
Program Loan financing a broad positive list of agricultural equipment and
inputs. IDA plans to support the program through four complementary projects:
(a) the proposed project which will finance simple, low-cost investments by
farmers in STW, LLP and power tillers, sold *off the shelf" for cash by
private dealers without any public sector involvement in their
installation/delivery or operation; (b) the proposed National Minor Irrigation
Development Project (NMIDP), which will finance mainly the more expensive and
complex deep tubewells (DTW) which require organization of farmer groups,
technical assistance and public sector support in the initial stages; (c) the
proposed Agricultural and Rural Credit Project (ARCP), which will focus on
improving the performance of agricultural credit institutions, but which will
only finance about 10 of the institutional credit required for a wide range
of agricultural investments, including minor irrigation equipment and power
tillers; and (d) the recently approved Agricultural Support Services Project
(ASSP), which will finance, inter alia, the extension activities of the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to improve water management, seed supply and
crop diversification.
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement. As noted above, IDA has worked
closely with GOB to formulate and introduce policy measures aimed at
liberalizing the trade and siting of minor irrigation equipment as a means of
accelerating growth in the agricultural sector. The experience IDA has
acquired in the context of this policy dialogue and through past projects in
support of minor irrigation gives it a comparative advantage among donors in
providing effective support to GOB in implementing this project. IDA's
financing of this project will also support deepening of the liberalization
process in the areas of fertilizer and foodgrain marketing, which are



3
important components of the sector reform strategy pursued by IDA In its
policy dialogue with GOB since the early 1980s. Furthermore, the proposed
project will provide an opportunity for IDA to make a contribution in an area
of special emphasis: private sector development.
7.        Prolect Objectives.  The project is intended to promote
agricultural production, income and employment by supporting increased
investment by farmers in simple, low-cost minor irrigation equipment sold by
private equipment dealers for cash under GOB's liberalized/deregulated policy
and institutional framework for private sector-led minor irrigation
development. It would accomplish this by providing a foreign exchange
facility to allow private equipment dealers to import power tillers and sall
engines required for STW and LLP to be sold to farmers. To ensure that the
project funds are used for capital goods investment, the flow of funds will be
monitored and evaluated by the MOA. The project will cover the entire
country, with the exception of areas having saline groundwater (see Map
No. 22593), and will complement the proposed NMIDP which will concentrate on
areas where only DTW technology can be used due to the relatively deep
aquifer.
8.        PXJr ect Deacripti*n.  Over the three-year period, FY92-94, the
project will support investment by farmers in: (a) an estimated 75,000 STW to
irrigate some 340,000 ha of land (base cost US$80.0 million); (b) about 6,000
LLP to irrigate around 120,000 ha of lznd (base cost US$12.8 million);  and
(c) about 18,000 power tillers to cultivate approximately 460,000 ha of land
(base cost US$23.4 million). Farmers' choice will determine the actual
numbers of STW, ULP and power tillers supplied, so that the above figures are
only indicative. Support for these investments will be provided in the
context of consolidating the existing policy framework for private sector-led
minor irrigation development, as well as reforms in the closely related areas
of fertilizer marketing and foodgrain management. The project will be
implemented by GOB through the Bangladesh Bank (BB) and KOA.
9.        The total project cost is estimated at US$126.7 million, including
a foreign exchangs component of US$75.0 million, representing the foreign
exchange cost of the imported engines for STW and LLP, the power tillers and
equipment for the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) to be established in
MOA. Procurement of the STW, ULP and power tillers to be provided under the
project would be done by private equipment dealers following established
commercial practices. However, to ensure competition for large import orders,
any single contract estimated to cost US$1.0 million or more will be procured
by ICB. IDA funds will be channeled to private dealers on a "first-come,
first-served" basis through a Special Account in Foreign Exchange (SAPE) to be
established in BB. Withdrawals from the special account will be on the basis
of actual eligible expenditures. Withdrawals under statements of expenditure
(SOE) procedures will be permitted for equipment contracts aggregating less
than US$50,000 equivalent. Withdrawal applications for import contracts
amounting to an aggregate of US$50,000 or more will be fully documented.
Onlending arrangements are not applicable siace the SAFE would be a foreign
exchange facility for project imports. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. hmounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A

timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), No. 9003-BD dated May 7, 1991, is being
distributed separately.
10.       At negotiations, agreements were obtained that GOB will:  (a) take
all necessary action to: (i) ensure that customs duty and tariff on imported
engines of up to 20 hp for use in minor irrigation equipment, as well as on
power tillers, do not exceed the rate of 51 of their free on board (FOB)
value; (i.) abolish and thereafter not institute standardization requirements
on imported minor irrigation equipment; (iii) abolish and thereafter not
institute restrictions on siting of tubewells in non-surface irrigation areas;
(b) require BADC to sell or otherwise dispose of its entire stock of STW/LLP
includeng spare parts, by March 31, 1992, through direct sales to farmers or
auction in dealers, and thereafter to refrain from further pur¢hases of
STW/LLP; (c) take all action to: (i) remove all restrictions on fertilizer
imports (TSP, MP and urea); (ii) ensure that all contracts for the comercial
import of foodgrain are awarded on the basis of open international tender;
(iii) abolish and thereafter not institute any restrictions on credit for
storage of foodgrain and take steps to facilitate foodgrain storage by the
private sector; (d) abolish its subsidies on TSP and MP fertilizer as follows:
at least 60X by October 31, 1991; 100l by March 31, 1992; and thereafter not
directly or indirectly subsidize fertilizer prices; (e) cause BB to enter into
Participation Agreements with Participating Banks, and cause Participating
Banks to enter into Dealer Agreements with Dealers on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA; (f) monitor: (i) compliance with Participation
Instruments and Dealer Agreements; (ii) prlce at which equipment under the
Project is sold to farmers; (iii) use of equipment sold to farmers to ensure
that it is used for the purposes of the Project; and (g) not later than
December 31, 1992, review the implementation of the project with IDA, and
promptly thereafter take all actions required as a result of the review.
11.       As conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit, GOB will
have: (a) abo±ished at least 301 of the subsidies on TSP and MP fertilizers;
(b) approved the pro forma for carrying out the Monitoring and Evaluation
Component of the project; and (c) had BB issue to Participating Banks a model
Participation Instrument and a model Dealer Agreement, satisfactory to IDA,
along with a description of the procedures under which the proceeds of the
Credit will be made available to finance project investment expenditures.
12.       Benefits and Programs of Special EmDhasis.  The economic rate of
return (ERR) is estimated to exceed 501. The estimated financial rate of
return (FRR) is 391 for the STW, 601 for the LLP and 591 for the power tiller.
At full development, the project is expected to result in: (a) incremental
annual foodgrain production of 1.3 million tons valued at US$240 million;
(b) additional annual employment of 47 million days; and (c) an increase in
the average annual per capita income of some 525,000 farm families from US$48
to US$78, thereby lifting them above the poverty line of US$68 per annum. In
addition to poverty alleviation, the project, through its assistance to
private equipment dealers, focuses on another of IDA's areas of special
emphasis: private sector development. It is also responsive to the
development needs of women and landless share croppers who will benefit from



5
the economic activities and the investment opportunities generated by the
project.
13.      Rlsks. The major rlsk is potential reversals in GOB policy,
leading to a contraction of prlvate sector activity and farmer access to minor
irrigation equipment, complementary inputs and output markets. This risk is
addressed through appropriate conditionality (paras 10-11). An Environmental
Assessment was carried out for the project and the three other agricultural
development projects to be supported by IDA (para 5). It concluded that the
project would, overall, have major societal benefits, but that negative
environmental impacts could develop as in the case of excessive abstraction of
groundwater. To guard against such negative impacts, continuous monitoring
and suitable mitigating arrangements have been Incorporated into the NNIDP and
ASSP projects, ln line with the recommendations made in the Environmental
Assessment.
14.      a2ommendatLon. I am satlsfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Assoclatlon and recommend the
Executlve Directors approve the proposed Credit.
