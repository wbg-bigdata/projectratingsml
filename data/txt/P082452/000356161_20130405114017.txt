1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Zambia is a landlocked state in sub-Saharan Africa bordering eight other countries. By
mid-1990, its economy began to grow after opening its mining sector to foreign
investment. In addition, rising copper prices -- Zambia is Africa’s largest copper producer
-- stimulated sector growth at 6 percent per annum. At the end of the decade, the overall
economy consistently posted modest gains, averaging 5 percent a year. Subsequently,
there was a secular decline in the purchasing power of its copper resources, leading to
growing concern about a return to dependency on copper revenues that could derail
economic diversification and lead to international trade risks. On the social side, frequent
droughts and the state’s inability to manage food shortages, coupled with a public health
crisis caused by an HIV/AIDS pandemic, drew attention to the government’s endemic
incapacity to plan and manage its human, physical, budgetary, and capital resources.

Debt relief came at the end of 2000, when Zambia received support under an enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) framework, with a floating completion point
reached April 2005, the time at which this Project was being prepared. The country was
among 18 African countries receiving 100 percent multilateral debt relief through a G8
initiative, which enabled it to eliminate most of its foreign debt by 2006.

Poverty reduction remained a challenge in 2005 because of the country’s systemically
weak institutional capacity, illustrated, inter alia, by its inability to set spending priorities
and apply budgetary controls. Key public sector issues included the need to: (i) develop a
budget and procurement system with greater transparency and effectiveness; (ii) improve
accountability and transparency in the use of public funds; (iii) right-size ministries and
agencies based on organizational functions and the budget envelope; (iv) implement pay
reforms, including incentives to attract and retain skilled professionals in key sectors; and
(v) implement a decentralization strategy in line with the capacity of central government
agencies to support it and the capacity of local governments to deliver services
effectively.

Sector reforms began in 2000 as a part of a World Bank-financed Public Sector Capacity
Building Project (PSCAP) - structured initially as the first of a 3-phase 13-year APL -
part of a multi-donor effort to advance and institutionalize progress made in public
expenditure and public service management reforms. During implementation, the
government, with donor participation, reviewed overall country aid, national planning,
and the public sector development framework -- the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia
(JASZ). The outcome was a decision to end all individual, stand-alone donor projects,
replacing them instead with sector-wide approaches (SWAps) and other joint assistance
mechanisms.

Given this shift, APL Phase II became the Public Service Management Program -
Support Project (PSMP-SP), and IDA funding was thus integrated into a “harmonized



                                               1
framework? of pooled donor funds. For the PSMP-SP, this translated into two SWAps
(components 1 and 2), in partnership with 11 other donors, plus a stand-alone, Bank-
funded component 3 dealing with retrenchment, to complement the government’s Public
Service Reform Program.

The PSMP-SP was designed to support the emphasis in the Zambia Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) on the importance of public service management capacity in the
leadership and management of PRSP programs. The project was also designed to support
the CAS Strategic Priority 3, which was to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
the management of the public service. The project was part of a multi-donor effort to
advance and entrench the progress made up to that point and to consolidate gains in
public expenditure management and public service management reforms.

Preparation of the program was based on a number of studies including the GRZ/World
Bank Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Report (PEMFA)
diagnostic report, a complementary study by Oxford Policy Management completed for
DFID, the GRZ Public Service Reform Priorities Report and the report of the multi-donor
appraisal teams. IDA worked closely with GRZ and other development partners to ensure
consistency across program components.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO was: “To make public service delivery institutions and processes more effective
and efficient by enhancing the efficiency and accountability of the management of public
expenditures and the public service in line with Government strategies to support poverty
reduction and promote economic growth.?

It should be noted that a different PDO appears in the Results Framework at Annex 3 of
the PAD as follows: “To improve the quality of public expenditure management and
public service effectiveness in Zambia as a means to achieve: (1) economic growth and
poverty reduction; (2) a more efficient public service; and (3) the adoption of direct
budgetary support as the principal mechanism for development aid in Zambia.?

The PDO used for the purposes of the ICR is the first one above as it is also the one used
in Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement between the Republic of Zambia and the
International Development Association dated February 10, 2006.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as outlined in the PAD and the Financing Agreement
were:

   1. Activity-based budgeting in place in all ministries, departments and institutions
      aligned with and linked to the MTEF process;
   2. Percentage deviation of actual spending from approved budget reduced from over
      20% to under 15%;
   3. Time taken to prepare audited annual reports for GRZ accounts is within statutory
      limits;



                                            2
   4. There are no discrepancies between the final payroll and staff establishment;
   5. At least four ministries have published service delivery charters and have
      implemented effective service delivery feedback systems; and
   6. All public procurement is decentralized, and Zambia National Tender Board’s
      (ZNTB’s) oversight and regulatory role is strengthened.

Once again, there was a different set of PDO indicators used in the Results Framework at
Annex 3 of the PAD. However, while noting this divergence, the ICR team opted to use
the KPIs actually used to track and monitor progress in the Project ISRs -- the indicators
mentioned in the Results Framework and not those from the PAD and Financing
Agreement – as these were the indicators for which data are available. These are:

   1. GRZ PEM framework characterized by full MTEF structure adopted in all
      ministries, departments and institutions and major parastatals.
   2. MTEF is based on central government wide IFMIS;
   3. Strategic planning, business planning and performance planning hierarchy and
      process aligned with and linked to the MTEF process;
   4. Ratio of Public Wage bill to public service headcount reaches 15% in real terms;

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The project objective was not formally revised. No changes were made to the PDO and
indicators by the original approving authority; however, substantive changes occurred
during implementation that were not formalized by way of a Restructuring Paper, as
required under Bank procedures (see 1.7 below).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the Project were public service delivery institutions whose
processes would become more effective and efficient, as well as those responsible for the
financial management and accountability functions. This, in turn, would enhance the
efficiency and accountability of public expenditure management and the public service in
general to support Government strategies aimed at reducing poverty and promoting
economic growth.

1.5 Original Components

The PSMP-SP had three components: (i) Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability (PEMFA); (ii) Public Service Management (PSM); and (iii) Supporting
Retrenchments.




                                            3
Component 1: Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
(PEMFA) (IDA: US$8 million; other donor funding: US$60 million)

This component, with up to 12 donors and 12 inter-related technical sub-components (in
addition to a sub-component that supported an implementation secretariat), each of which
addressed a specific institutional or capacity deficit identified in the reviews/assessments
undertaken, aimed to strengthen and increase efficiencies in legal, accounting and
administrative frameworks for public expenditure management, primarily through the
roll-out of an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), the
development of a macro-economic budget model, improvement of budget presentation, a
better cash release system, improvement of the debt management strategy and systems,
strengthening of internal and external audit functions and oversight of Parliamentary
Committees, and reform of the public procurement system.

Component 2: Public Service Management (PSM)
(IDA: US$11 million; other donor funding: US$16 million)

This component, with 4 sub-components (plus an implementation secretariat) to which
4 donors contributed, was a key ingredient of the overall Public Service Reform Program
(PSRP) and aimed to strengthen and increase efficiencies in public service management
by focusing on the effective management of public servants to improve their performance
and that of the ministries and institutions to which they belonged.

Component 3: Supporting Retrenchments (IDA: $10.0 million)

This component, to which only the World Bank contributed, provided resources to pay
separation packages (a pre-requisite to successful implementation of the previous PSRP)
and implement a comprehensive social safety net program to cushion the impact of
unemployment on those retrenched as a consequence of the rightsizing efforts,
implementation of the Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system
and the operationalization of restructured ministries. This component was separately
funded outside of the pooled mechanism. As it was a straightforward cash transfer, it is
not dealt with in the ICR to the same degree as the other 2 components.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not formally revised, although some of the sub-components were
either modified, added or dropped during implementation (see 1.7 below).

1.7 Other significant changes

Changes occurred outside normal Bank procedures (i.e., Restructuring Paper) through a
Joint Technical Working Group (JTWG), which agreed to them in a forum comprising
GRZ and other donors. The PEMFA component was modified by way of an addendum to
the original Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) (dated December 8, 2004) signed on
July 11, 2008, and again on June 30, 2011. The 2008 addendum extended the program to



                                             4
6 years up to December 31, 2010 – which was in fact the original closing date of the
Bank’s Project - and reduced the number of components from 12 to 7. In addition, the
PEMFA Secretariat was abolished and GRZ took on direct responsibility for project
execution. The second revision extended the program by a further 2 years to December
31, 2012 – 6 months beyond the extended closing date of the Bank’s Project – and further
reduced the number of sub-components to 4. The reduction in the number of sub-
components is explained by the fact that some sub-components had already been
completed. The one exception was the introduction of a new sub-component focusing on
capacity-building in the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA), which was not in the original
project.

Similarly, PSM sub-components were modified at Mid-term Review in 2009. Sub-
component 1 (Rightsizing) became “Institutional Appraisal and Organizational
Development,? to improve service delivery, and sub-component 2 (Payroll Management
and Establishment Control, and Pay Reform) to combined into one component called
“Payroll and Human Resources Management,? to complete the pay policy reform and
manage the payroll. Although the titles of the sub-components changed, their objectives
remained largely the same; and while the PDO indicators being tracked were not the
same as those in the Financing Agreement, they were reiterated and modified at mid-term
review as indicated below:

      Ratio of Public Wage bill to public service headcount reaches 15% in real terms
       (changed from 20% in original KPI);
      Strategic planning, business planning and performance planning hierarchy and
       processes aligned with and linked to the MTEF process;
      MTEF is based on public service wide (as opposed to central government wide)
       FMS (changed from IFMIS) followed by gradual transition to a public service
       wide IFMIS; and
      GRZ PEM framework characterized by full MTEF structure adopted in all
       ministries, departments and institutions and major parastatals.

At Mid-term Review, an effort was also made to streamline the complex multi-level
government and donor implementation arrangements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

As aforementioned, the Project was the second phase of what was originally conceived as
a 3-phase APL. In the first phase (the PSCAP, which ran from 2000–2005), the
development objective was to design and implement critical system-wide reforms that
supported improved service delivery. These reforms included rationalizing staffing,
particularly in the core civil service, reforming pay, introducing more effective
management of payroll and establishment, replacing the cash budget with a Medium
Term Expenditure Framework, improving financial management systems, accelerating
privatization and private sector participation in the economy. Phase 2 - the Project to


                                           5
which this ICR pertains - was intended to roll out the systems developed and piloted
under Phase 1 throughout the public service and at least partially decentralize service
provision. The third phase would then be a consolidation phase during which the benefits
of the two previous phases would be monitored and evaluated, and appropriate
adjustments made to make them even more effective.

The ICR for Phase 1 rated the achievement of the four KPIs as Moderately Satisfactory
(in two instances), Moderately Unsatisfactory (in one instance) and Unsatisfactory (in
one instance). It also found that, of the 5 components included in that project, 2 were
rated Moderately Satisfactory, 1 was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, and 1 was rated
Unsatisfactory. The project was described as being a very ambitious project that
addressed a large number of civil service and public finance reform issues. However, the
ICR also observed that the project was based on an inadequate assessment of the
readiness of key GRZ implementing MDAs for such an ambitious reform program,
particularly given the lack of significant achievements under the PSRP launched in 1993;
and as having a number of design problems which led to component or sub-component
non-implementation, failure or under-performance.

The successor project to the PSCAP included 16 technical sub-components, most of
which sought to build directly on the PSCAP. Some of the major sub-components such as
the IFMIS, rightsizing, pay policy/reform and the divestment of non-core functions, were
actually intended to address the implementation deficits of the PSCAP. In order to gain
commitment to Project objectives, and drawing on lessons from Phase I, extensive
consultations were held with government and donors, coordinated by Government
Technical Working Groups. Subsequently, these Working Groups prepared Project
components using a harmonization-in-practice framework. Financing arrangements for
PEMFA and PSM were based on a pooled funding mechanism agreed in multi-donor
Memoranda of Understanding (MoU). Twelve 12 donors supported the PEMFA
component and 4 supported the PSM component. The Government requested the Bank to
fully support Component 3, Retrenchments.1

The PSMP-SP was designed by Government Technical Working Groups in collaboration
with Cooperating Partners (CPs). The Government assigned task managers responsibility
for project preparation, including work plans, with donor participation. Consultant
recommendations from PSCAP were used as the framework. A Project Steering
Committee comprised of senior officers in MOFNP and the Cabinet Office was assigned
implementation responsibilities.




1
  In the Concept Note and earlier versions of the PAD, Component 3 was listed as ‘Decentralization’,
which had also been a component of the predecessor PSCAP that was rated as Unsatisfactory. The
introduction of the ‘Retrenchments’ component at a late stage in project preparation is explained by the
perceived lack of political will to implement decentralization as well the shortfall in retrenchment under the
PSCAP. This is ironic given that many aspects of Component 2 were premised on the assumption that
decentralization would take place.



                                                      6
The Project design was considered overly ambitious by the PCN and QER panels. The
large number of sub-components in the PEMFA component seemed unrealistic given the
low institutional capacity in Zambia and previous experience with similar projects. The
QER questioned the implementation timeframe of only four years, given the wide scope
of the project. The IFMIS sub-component appeared too complex to be managed well and
unlikely to be implemented on schedule, with no convincing mitigation strategy. It should
be emphasized that this was the same IFMIS sub-component that was not introduced
under the PSCAP, although the design study for it had been completed.

On implementation arrangements, the complex and “highly-engineered? committee
structures and implementation arrangements were thought difficult to manage - even in a
developed country context. The risk mitigation measures seemed inadequate. With 12
donors supporting the PEMFA component and 4 supporting the PSM component, donor
coordination was flagged as a major risk. Concerns were also raised over the several
levels of committees and separate secretariats for each component. It should be noted,
however, that the Bank had entered into the MoU with GRZ and other CPs for the
PEMFA component in mid-2004, long before the Project was designed and approved; the
Bank’s hands were tied even before the Project began. The MoU for the PSM component
was finalized after the Bank’s project was approved but was largely patterned on the
PEMFA MoU.

The Bank’s internal review processes also suggested that inter-ministerial/departmental
collaboration on a project of this scale would be challenging. Priorities and sequencing
seemed problematic given the lack of demonstrable political, technical, and
administrative capacity and poor record of Zambia in delivering reforms in the targeted
areas. However, for whatever reasons, the team did not reduce the scope of the project or
simplify the complex reporting and coordination arrangements described above.

2.2 Implementation

While the joint government/donor coordination worked well in the initial stages of
project preparation, indications are that they worked less well during implementation.
The MoUs on donor coordination described a complicated decision and coordination
structure in which overall oversight and policy guidance for both components was to be
provided by a PSRP Steering Committee (PSRP-SC), comprised of chief executives,
chaired by the Secretary to the Cabinet, and assisted by a Secretariat. The PEMFA
Steering Committee and the Office of the Deputy Secretary to Cabinet - Finance and
Economic Development (DSC-FED) were responsible for monitoring project
implementation, control of financing and provision of policy guidelines. The PSM
Steering Committee provided high-level oversight and back-stopping, and was intended
to work closely with the Permanent Secretaries in the Management Development
Division (MDD) and the Public Service Management Division (PSMD), both in the
Cabinet Office. Both Steering Committees reported to the PSRP-SC to ensure compliance
with PSMP program and policy guidelines, each assisted by a Project Secretariat staffed
by a Director and various specialists (e.g. Finance, Procurement, M&E).




                                           7
There were separate Joint Technical Working Groups where donors and GRZ officials
met to take stock of progress and discuss the technical aspects of program
implementation, and committees where CPs alone met to review progress. Some CPs
complained that the meetings tended to become quite “heavy? as most CPs were not
equipped to get into detailed technical discussions. The Bank’s technical expertise gave it
a natural leadership role on some topics such as procurement and PFM.

The decentralized institutional arrangements of PSCAP were used by the PSMP.
Implementing units, under the PSRP-SC, through the Project Secretariats, were
responsible for carrying out procurement, drafting TORS, selecting consultants, defining
equipment needs, and preparing training plans.

However, the SWAp pooled funding arrangements did not appear to work very well.
Several donors reported dissatisfaction because of poor implementation arrangements
that surfaced when they began to disburse, in particular the coordination of the release of
funds on a timely basis. The arrangement made it difficult to coordinate timely release of
funds when multiple donors began to disburse and this slowed implementation. In the
case of the European Commission (EC), they had no instrument for pooled funding even
though they were signatories to the MoU and provided their contribution directly to GRZ
by way of budget support.

The Project was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) at mid-term review. The
Government still had not settled into its counterpart role, with continuous turnover of
senior staff in key ministries/departments. Changes in personnel are very commonplace
in Zambia, particularly after changes in government. Hence, there were many changes in
personnel that negatively impacted on the implementation of the program (eg. six
different Permanent Secretaries in the MoF, four different Accountants-General and four
different project managers overseeing PEMFA implementation). Subsequently, because
of implementation delays caused by turnover and lack of strategy and priority setting, the
closing date of the Project was formally extended from December 30, 2010 to June 30,
2012 to try to meet PDOs, while the PEMFA program (as opposed to the PEMFA
component in the Bank’s Project) was extended until December 31, 2012. A new
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Department was set up reporting directly to the
Cabinet to streamline implementation procedures.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design: The outcomes and results of the government’s program were to be monitored on
the basis of the agreed performance indicators described in Annex 2. According to the
PAD, the project should have been subject to supervision missions that monitored
progress through Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), a mid-term review, and this
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR). The latter two reports were to be
jointly prepared by IDA and the relevant implementing units, and the results discussed
and presented to relevant stakeholders through the component steering committees and
the higher level committees to which they reported.




                                            8
On the GRZ side, the two secretariats responsible for the implementation of the PEMFA
and PSM components were to include M&E Specialists who were to monitor and report
the sub-components falling within the purview of their respective secretariats. These
M&E Specialists were required to prepare quarterly and annual progress reports for
submission to the PEMFA and PSM Steering Committees and the JTWGs, to brief the
project Steering Committee and Secretary to Cabinet, and agree with the sub-component
task managers on results frameworks and work plans. The data sources in the Bank’s
M&E plan relied heavily on these reports.

Implementation: Despite these M&E arrangements, the complex web of implementation
arrangements became a substitute for routine Bank supervision. It does not appear that
there were regular supervision missions to take stock of progress being made, as
evidenced by the absence of standard Bank supervision documents such as Aide
Memoires and Management Letters. The Bank team did not update ISRs on a timely
basis or in accordance with the norm in the Africa Region (i.e. 2 per fiscal year), and
frequently prepared memoranda on progress or the lack thereof that were not formally
submitted for management review or approval. Moreover, it appears there was weak
leadership in the CP group, with tardy follow-up by the leads for certain subject areas or
sub-components. One donor described the governance structure as being “too onerous.?

The M&E Specialists embedded in the respective secretariats did carry out their intended
functions, except that the PEMFA Secretariat was disbanded and, with it, the M&E
Specialist. Due to implementation delays caused by staff turnover, and lack of strategy
and priority setting, a new Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Department was set up
reporting directly to the Cabinet to streamline implementation procedures.

Utilization: M&E Reports prepared by the M&E Specialists were presented to the
JTWGs and formed the basis of CP discussions, decisions and reporting. Data provided
in these reports and decisions resulting therefrom were used to track progress and update
ISRs. Similarly, the mid-term evaluations carried out on both the PEMFA and PSM
components were tabled and discussed in the context of JTWGs, and the components
were modified on the basis of discussions/decisions of these JTWGs. However,
weaknesses in the M&E framework and the implementation arrangements, coupled with
the lack of routine Bank implementation support missions, left the Bank unable to
recommend corrective actions outside of the JTWGs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The World Bank Financial Management Specialist (FMS) and Procurement Specialist
(PMS) were rarely involved except on the transactional fiduciary side until after 2010,
relatively late in the life of the project. Eventually, the FMS took over the PEMFA
component, which included a procurement sub-component that was overseen (or at least
monitored) by the PMS.




                                            9
Fiduciary issues included:

   (i)     Reporting: While the annual audited financial statements were submitted on
           time, the Unaudited Interim Financial Reports (UIFRs) were generally
           submitted late. Although the UIFRs included statements of expenditure
           comparing actual expenditure against the budget line item, there were no
           explanations of variances, rendering the analysis inadequate, as most of these
           variances were substantial. The project normally exceeded operating costs
           while under-spending or failing to use funds budgeted for core activities, like
           consultancies and equipment.
   (ii)    Internal controls: In internal control, weaknesses appeared during external
           audits by the Office of the Auditor General. These included ineligible
           expenditures the manual accounting system not interfacing with the Financial
           Management System (FMS) maintained by MOF, weak internal audit control
           checks, and failure to follow up retirement of imprest.
   (iii)   Contract management: Under the IFMIS sub-component, change orders were
           signed with the contractor, INDRA, and payments made before seeking Bank
           non-objection. When the non-objection was eventually sought, the changes
           were found to be unjustified and so the Bank declined to give the non-
           objection and asked that the funds be repaid into the pool. Though this did not
           affect only IDA funds, IDA funds were included in the pooled funds. GRZ has
           made provision in its 2013/14 budget to repay the funds into the common pool.
   (iv)    Disbursements: Funds disbursed slowly during the project’s life with the
           Designated Account inactive or nearly so. The project was not proactive in
           submitting withdrawal applications for either replenishment of the DA or
           documentation of expenditure. When the PSM component of the project
           closed in June 2012, it had used only 85% of the Credit.
   (v)     Undocumented/ineligible expenditure: Nearly US$800,000 remained
           undocumented at project close; there were also a number of ineligible
           expenses amounting to ZMK519,825,200 which were subsequently
           reimbursed to the Bank by the Government to be proportionally refunded to
           the respective donors.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Discussions are currently in progress for a follow-on operation focusing on public
financial management, building on what was achieved under the PEMFA component.
GRZ has shared the draft PFM Strategy and implementation plans with the PFM donor
group and discussions are in progress on funding modalities. The final strategy and
implementation plans will become the basis for a follow-on project to be financed out of
a pooled mechanism.

The Bank has also received requests from GRZ for assistance with the reform of the
pension scheme and implementation of the pay policy developed under the project, and
discussions are at an exploratory stage. A pension reform mission has visited Zambia and




                                           10
the pay policy dialogue is on-going to try and define the exact nature of the assistance
GRZ requires.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives - Satisfactory

The Project Development Objective was relevant at the time of design and remained
relevant throughout the life of the project. As mentioned in context at appraisal, PSMP-
SP was originally designed to support the Zambia PRSP on improving public service
management capacity in the leadership and management of PRSP programs, in addition
to supporting the CAS Strategic Priority 3, which was to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the management of the public service.

The PDO is still relevant to Zambia’s current development priorities. As articulated in the
National Vision 2030, Zambia’s current development challenges include achieving an
adequate supply of competent, highly skilled human resources, a knowledge-based
economy, and maintaining efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability in
the use of public financial resources. The project’s objectives are also relevant to the
World Bank’s current Africa Strategy. The World Bank Africa Strategy pillars
(vulnerability and resilience, and competitiveness and employment) and its foundation
(governance and public sector capacity) have been adapted to Zambia's context. Last, the
project’s objectives are relevant to the upcoming CPS’s third objective, which seeks to
improve governance and strengthen economic management though strengthened public
sector performance and enhanced citizen voice and participation in public service
delivery.

Relevance of Design – Unsatisfactory

The design of the project was not relevant to Zambia’s circumstances and development
priorities. First, although it addressed real needs, the project design was far too ambitious
and optimistic given the capacity of the government and previous experience, with 16
technical sub-components in all. It has been suggested that the number and content of the
sub-components had more to do with what the CPs were interested in funding than what
the country could manage. Under the IFMIS sub-component, for example, it was found
that introducing 13 modules at once was problematic as ministries complained it was too
demanding, causing a slowdown in the roll out. The sequencing was not well thought-out
and planned in a way that addressed immediate problems first. Capacity building was
required, including capacity for change management, and greater attention to issues of
organizational readiness and sequencing.

Second, the project design did not adequately draw upon the lessons learnt from past
experience, in particular the PSCAP. Section 2.1 above summarizes some of the findings
of the PSCAP ICR, and it is possible to recognize some of the very same shortcomings in



                                             11
the PSMP-SP design. There was no plausible basis for the expectation that the
government could achieve everything the project set out to do in the original timeframe.

Third, the sub-components had difficult-to-measure indicators which had tenuous causal
links in the results chain. It is questionable, for instance, whether the PDO indicators (eg.
ratio of the wage bill to the public service headcount) could actually be measured in the
Zambian context, let alone used to measure the outcomes identified in the PAD. There
also appeared to be no weighting of the indicators in proportion to the resources allocated
to each sub-component so that, for instance, there were no explicit indicators for PSM
sub-component 2.3 on Service Delivery Improvement, with a value of $11.28 million –
almost half the total amount of the pooled funding for this sub-component.

Relevance of Implementation – Moderately Satisfactory

Implementation arrangements were only mildly relevant to the changing circumstances of
the project and the complex in-country donor working group arrangements may have
been a recipe for overwhelming the relatively inexperienced TTL and subverting standard
Bank supervision. The entire process was seemingly designed to ensure an endless
schedule of meetings that created problems for both the TTL and GRZ. Weak M&E
systems may have further undermined the TTL’s ability to take decisive action and bring
about positive changes throughout the implementation phase. Yet, despite these
handicaps, the TTL and – from 2010 – the FMS were instrumental in getting some of the
achievements of the project implemented.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Moderately Unsatisfactory

As pointed out at 1.2 above, there were two very different sets of PDO indicators: one in
the main text of the PAD and in the Financing Agreement, and the other in the Results
Framework (Annex 3), which was used in the Project ISRs. The PDO used was: “To
make public service delivery institutions and processes more effective and efficient by
enhancing the efficiency and accountability of the management of public expenditures
and the public service, in line with Government strategies to support poverty reduction
and promote economic growth.

When decomposed, the PDO set out to:

    Make public service delivery institutions and processes more effective and
      efficient;
    Enhance the efficiency of public expenditure management; and
    Enhance accountability in the public service.

To determine whether the PDO has been achieved, then, requires an assessment of
(a) whether public service delivery institutions and processes in Zambia are more
effective and efficient in 2012 than they were in 2006; (b) whether public expenditure


                                             12
management in Zambia is more efficient in 2012 than in 2006; and (c) whether the public
service is more accountable in 2012 than it was in 2006?

The first observation to be noted is the caveat that several of the indicators were not
appropriate for measuring progress towards the achievement of the PDO. It is arguable
whether the indicators identified at the outset of the project and reported upon in the
ISRs, when aggregated, can provide much insight into the achievement of the PDO.

Secondly, for much of the period the project was being implemented, several sub-
components showed no progress (as demonstrated by the ISR ratings), most notably
under the PEMFA component where the IFMIS and the strengthening of the procurement
processes, relatively little was accomplished up to the time the project closed despite the
extension of the closing date. Under the PSM component, many outputs (reports, studies,
organizational structures, manuals, tools) were produced but not implemented. Indeed,
one participating CP referred to PSM as a “machine for the generation of consultancies.?
Other activities were only partially completed by the closing date of the project with
persistent challenges leading to delays in nearly all project components. Institutional
capacity weaknesses continually clouded project focus, and a significant number of
outputs did not yield expected outcomes (such as Service Charters and strategic plans).

Nevertheless, the project was instrumental in providing a platform for future
improvements in public sector performance as several outputs were delivered, though it is
difficult to attribute any outcomes directly to the Bank’s Project. For instance, the IFMIS
roll-out to 28 sites was intended to improve financial reporting and assist in annual
budget monitoring, but until the system is fully rolled out this impact will not be
manifested on the ground. Similarly, the implementation of the new pay policy has only
recently begun; expected improvements in performance by public servants can be
achieved only when provisions of this policy are fully implemented. Some sub-
components showed positive effects, eg. payroll management and establishment control
system (PMEC), which was fully decentralized to the provinces, led to the weeding out of
“ghost workers? and government savings, and greatly improved payroll management and
services to public servants countrywide.

  There is a discrepancy in the PAD on the IFMIS. The indicator as set out in the Results Matrix shows
IFMIS being piloted in 5 key ministries and 2 provinces, as well as capacity building of staff at the ITU and
CCSD to support IFMIS after implementation, whereas the detailed sub-component description states that
the IFMIS will be piloted in 5 ministries and will be rolled out to all ministries, provinces and spending
agencies.

were met. These were: (a) Construction of the ZICA Resource Center; (b) Procurement of office furniture
and equipment; (c) Revision of the Accountants Act which was passed in 2008; and (d) Revision of the
Code of Ethics to regulate the behavior of accountants.

The matrix does not capture the results obtained under the revitalized SDIF launched in
November 2006 as there were no specific indicators associated with this, which, as earlier
mentioned, was part of the sub-component with the largest allocation under the PSM
component. The SDIF, which was administered by MDD, funded 18 sub-projects, 15 of
which were completed. The sub-projects were from eight sectors: education, agriculture
and livestock, health, forestry, local government, judiciary, social security (pension
services), and disaster management. Several sub-projects recorded improvements in local
service delivery and became pilots for activities that were intended to be scaled up or
expanded to other provinces/districts. Sub-projects included: (i) promotion of science and
technology education through the use of mobile science exhibition units; (ii)
establishment of a mobile court system in Namwala and Itezhi Tezhi Districts; (iii)
strengthening community participation in safe motherhood and child health in Mpika
District; (iv) decentralized work processes for improved access to pension services;
(v) integrating municipal systems for service delivery in the Mazabuka Municipal
Council; and (vi) establishing a decentralized, integrated land administration system in
Kitwe.

Particularly innovative projects were carried out in the Itezhi-Tezhi province in the areas
of access to justice and health. In the former case, the introduction of mobile courts led to
a reduction of pending case load from 400 in 2005 to zero in 2009, and the disposal of
new cases in an average of 10 days compared with 60 days before the intervention. The
project was recognized in 2009 by the African Association of Public Administration and
Management. In the latter case, there was a reduction in maternal mortality from
179/100,000 live births (2005) to 69/100,000 (2009). First antenatal attendance rose to
87%, immunization to 74% and supervised deliveries to 85%. Improved service delivery
resulting from this project was recognized by the United Nations in 2009.

Unfortunately, there was no provision for scaling up the successful sub-projects so they
remained highly localized, district-level interventions that had little broader impact on
service delivery improvement.

3.3 Efficiency

ModeratelyUnsatisfactory

The PSMP-SP was designed to support public service reforms and capacity building to
improve the performance of key public institutions in implementing a number of specific
public expenditure management and public service reforms. At the time of appraisal,
much of the anticipated return on investment under the PSMP-SP was in the form of
better performing public institutions that employ financial and human resources in a
transparent and accountable manner to implement the policies of the GRZ and improve
service delivery to the population.

The project was expected to contribute significantly to improved economic management
by promoting transparency and accountability in the management of public resources,
and increasing efficiency through deconcentration of key public finance functions.
Specifically, the project was anticipated to have a positive economic impact by
supporting: (i) the implementation of a series of public financial management reforms in
budgeting, public expenditure, procurement and auditing; (ii) the improvement of
ministries’ performance through the integration of strategic planning, the implementation
of annual work plans, performance appraisal of senior public servants and the MTEF
framework and results; and (iii)continuing support to the restructuring of public sector
institutions through ongoing decentralization initiatives.

It was envisioned that improvement in budget execution, public procurement and public
service audit capacities will contribute to a reduction of the fiscal deficit, an improvement
of the predictability and flow of allocated budget resources to GFU policy and service
delivery priority programs and activities, and an improvement in the quality of public
expenditures.

However, based on the sum of money allocated to the project overall and the mixed
success in achieving the project development objectives, it is doubtful whether this
project delivered value-for-money as anticipated. One donor partner which was a
signatory to the 2008 PEMFA MoU described it as being a case of “too much funding,
too little spending.?

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Moderately Unsatisfactory

Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation was mixed (S, U and MS
respectively): The PDOs remained relevant throughout the life of the project and are still
relevant to Zambia’s current development priorities. As articulated in the National Vision
2030, World Bank Africa Strategy, and the CPS. However, the design of the project was
seriously flawed and only moderately relevant to Zambia’s circumstances and
development context. Implementation arrangements were only mildly relevant to the
changing circumstances of the project and weakness in M&E systems further



                                             17
compromised the team’s ability to effect positive changes throughout the implementation
phase.

Achievement of development objectives was moderately unsatisfactory: The project
did not fully meet the PDO at Project close, despite the extension. While many
consultants were engaged, many reports and recommendations were produced, many
strategies and tools developed, and many public officials were trained, the Project has not
yielded the intended outcomes/impact and many outcomes remained aspirational,
particularly under the PSM component. However, in spite of the delays, constraints and
challenges, there were several noteworthy achievements such as the completion of the
PMEC, the pay policy, the strengthening of the OAG and the overall improvement of
accountancy standards and the accountancy profession in Zambia.

The MU rating for the project in the last ISR occurred after previous MS ratings in 2010
at the time the closing date was extended. The Project basically fell short of meeting its
outcomes. Many things remained to be implemented after Project close.

Efficiency was moderately unsatisfactory: Based on the funds allocated to the project,
the mixed results in achieving the development objectives, and the wastage that occurred
(numerous consultancies, study tours and vehicles purchased) it is doubtful whether this
project delivered value-for-money as anticipated. Feedback from suggests that the
project’s incentives were misaligned and that, on a cost-benefit basis, the outcomes did
not justify the expenditure. Given the pooled funding mechanism, however, it is not
possible to arrive at a definitive conclusion for the Bank’s portion only.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Gender Strategy for the Public Service: Under the PSM Component, a strategy for
“engendering? the public service was developed and adopted. The Zambia Public Service
now has a framework for a coordinated and effective approach to gender issues. Work on
the strategy was concluded in September 2008 and it was approved an launched in July
2011. The launch signaled the commencement of the implementation of the strategy and
recommendations of the associated consultancy.

HIV/AIDS Prevention and Mitigation Strategy for the Public Service: Also under the
PSM component, the HIV/AIDS strategy for the public service was developed and
adopted. It was launched in May 2011. Manuals on the sensitization and dissemination of
the strategy were developed and an M&E mechanism put in place. As a result, there is
now a coordinated response to the pandemic by ministries and institutions, clear
guidelines on the administration of food supplements and provision of medical care to
public service employees and each ministry has a budget line for HIV/AIDS programs.




                                            18
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Considerable institutional strengthening took place under the Project. Capacity was built
in the Ministry of Finance, which took over direct execution of the PEMFA component
after the disbanding of the PEMFA Secretariat. Various MOF departments (eg. Controller
of Internal Audit, Accountant-General’s Department, Debt Management) benefited from
training, study tours, hardware and software acquisition The OAG has explicitly been
strengthened under the project through the construction of 5 provincial offices, the
acquisition of vehicles, computers and equipment. Altogether, these things have enabled
the OAG to increase audit coverage to about 85%.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Moderate

There are several risks that may affect the sustainability of PSMP-SP’s development
outcomes, which based on their likelihood and impact are rated as moderate.

Administrative Changes: The change of government in late 2011 ushered in frequent
changes in senior management positions in the public service, that have affected the
functioning of the Government machinery. Ministries have also been re-aligned
frequently. These changes have been disruptive and can continue to come in the way of
fast movement on the portfolio and in transitioning the Bank from a lending institution to
a solutions Bank. To mitigate the risk, the Bank team will attempt to develop a wider and
deeper set of stakeholders within the Government on the programs it pursues so that
departure of individuals does not derail the program. Overall pace of movement on Bank-
supported programs is likely to remain a function of administrative stability, however.

Capacity Constraints: The Government has sent important signals on its commitment to
improving public governance, yet still needs to tackle fundamental reforms. Quality of
governance remains weak, institutions charged with oversight have not been very
effective and public administration systems and controls are frail. Procurement capacity
also remains weak. In order to address these weaknesses, successive governments have
been implementing reforms addressing the efficiency and accountability of the public
sector, and tackling corruption, but with limited success. There are now new
opportunities to work with the new Government as it has placed improving governance
institutions and anti-corruption at the core of its programs. The MOF for example,
realizes the need to strengthen debt management capacity (as evident in the recently
released MOF Strategy for the next five years) and initiated the request for a follow-up to
the DEMPA mission.

Political Will: Under the PSM component, as previously indicated, many of the
outcomes/impacts remain somewhat “aspirational?; policy proposals and
recommendations are still pending Cabinet approval after 2 or more years in some cases,
and in the meanwhile there has been a change of government and it is not clear whether




                                            19
the current administration is committed to – or even interested in – all or some of the
reforms funded under the PSMP-SP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Unsatisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory. The project
objective was relevant but the design was flawed. Although the Project was the successor
project to the PSCAP, it did not adequately take into account the lessons of experience
from the PSCAP project, including the capacity challenges and the issue of political will
for reform. The complex design involving multiple sub-components was ambitious in the
Zambian context. The risks were not adequately assessed and/or risk mitigation measures
not properly developed. The implementation and M&E arrangements lent themselves to
poor supervision.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Moderately Unsatisfactory

The implementation arrangements surrounding the SWAp and pooled funding approach
clouded the actual supervision requirements resulting in reliance on agreed review
mechanisms within the framework of the original MoU signed in 2004. These
arrangements substituted for standard Bank supervision; supervision took place in the
JTWGs, various committees and donor working groups, and there were no routine
implementation support missions and Aide Memoires, Management Letters, etc. Hence,
for example, the MTR was commissioned by GRZ (not the Bank) and discussed at the
JTWG, and then changes were made to the design and indicators modified that were
never formalized by way of a Restructuring Paper. The long gaps between ISRs – for
example,18 months between the penultimate and final ISRs - compromised the purpose
of using ISRs as a reporting and project management tool. The realism of some of the
ISR ratings was also called into question by Bank management.

Moreover, the failure of the Bank team to have a voice in ongoing discussions by donors
and Government about the technical content of some sub-components may also be
attributable to the funding arrangement, whereby the CPs chose leads for each sub-
component and the Bank had sole responsibility only for the Retrenchment component
and limited itself to procurement and financial management issues — which were many.
However, this does not explain the delays in ISR delivery and overrating Project
outcomes, even despite management objections and calls to downgrade the
implementation progress and PDO ratings.




                                           20
On the other hand, there were positive aspects of Bank’s engagement and the TTL should
be credited with the attainment of some results in areas such as PMEC and pay policy,
which are not inconsiderable. Significantly, unlike in the predecessor PSCAP, there was
consistency in the Bank’s management of this Project as there was only one TTL for the
entire time the Project was under implementation. In addition, from mid-2010 with the
arrival of a new FMS, GRZ benefited from technical advice and handholding on areas
relating to IFMIS, procurement and Internal Audit, with the ensuing progress in these
sub-components. The IFMIS sub-component had been particularly problematic as a result
of overly ambitious timeframes and targets; it had been languishing for the first 4 years of
the project’s implementation and only really took off after the Project’s closing date was
extended beyond December 2010. For these reasons, the Bank’s quality of supervision is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Unsatisfactory

As Bank performance for quality at entry was rated unsatisfactory and quality of
supervision were rated as moderately unsatisfactory, overall Bank performance is rated
unsatisfactory in accordance with the harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for ICRs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Borrower failed to provide adequate oversight and management presence to guide
and maintain implementation schedules and deliverables. The highly complex reporting
and decision-making structure agreed at Project outset was a major cause of
implementation delays. But this was exacerbated by continual turnover of senior officials
affecting both PEMFA and PSM components. In the case of the PEMFA component, it
was negatively impacted by the number of changes at various levels as described earlier,
i.e. 6 Permanent Secretaries in MOF, 4 Accountants-General and 4 IFMIS Project
Managers during the implementation of the project. The commitment of the Borrower
was uneven at best, complicated by staff capacity constraints, and contributed
significantly to not fully achieving PDO and IO outcomes. Consequently, the Borrower’s
performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Moderately Unsatisfactory

Several different agencies were involved in project execution under both major
components. Under PSM, the two main implementing agencies were the PSMD and the
MDD, both in the Cabinet Office. However, under the 18 SDIF-funded sub-projects,



                                            21
there were several implementing agencies involved. Under the PEMFA component, there
were many more implementing agencies; other than the MOF itself, was the Controller of
Internal Audit, External Technical Cooperation Department, the Investment and Debt
Department, Planning Department, and the Financial Management and Accounting
Department. In addition, there were implementing agencies outside of MOF such as the
Office of the Auditor-General, the Zambia National Tender Board, the Ministry of
Justice, the Parliament, and the Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZICA). It is,
therefore, difficult to come to a unified rating given the large number of implementing
agencies, and the best guide is the performance of each sub-component as shown in the
matrix under section 3.2 above.
Under the PSM component, the PSMD was the department which managed to get the
PMEC system in place and got the pay policy finalized and approved, and hence it is
rated as moderately satisfactory. The MDD, on the other hand, while managing to
develop a number of tools for public sector reform activities (such as the IA/OD tool),
also failed to achieve its objectives in relation to the performance management system,
rightsizing and contracting out. As such, MDD is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
An IDA independent procurement review and in-depth financial management reviews for
the project observed that there were continual concerns with record keeping, especially
ineligible expenditures in relation to operational cost such as allowances and per
diems. More generally, the major risks for successful implementation at extension
continued throughout the project after extension, namely, poor senior management
oversight, lack of clear lines of accountability by officers implementing the reforms, and
oversight of contract management. An additional problem occurred because of
presidential and general elections, with no mitigation strategy by implementation
arrangements. A common problem was continual turnover of experienced managers
(described above) — when they appeared. For example, the project benefited from
senior managers who pushed implementation for the IFMIS and integrated approach to
restructuring; however, the Bank team noted the likelihood of these managers retaining
their positions after the elections was uncertain. This proved to be the case on a regular
basis.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Moderately Unsatisfactory

As both Government performance and Implementing Agency performance were rated as
moderately unsatisfactory, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory in accordance with the ICRR harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 The Bank must tread carefully when getting into government-led, multi-donor
pooled funding arrangements. In the case of the PSMP-SP, the MoU was entered into a
full year and a half before the Bank’s Project was approved by the Board. This meant that
the Bank’s hands were effectively tied (which may explain the reticence to change the



                                           22
design despite adverse comments during the internal review processes). The pooled
funding arrangement and the committee system accompanying it, in all probability,
contributed to the problems of supervision and implementation. The complex in-country
donor working group arrangements may have overwhelmed the relatively new and
inexperienced TTL and led to the observed disconnect between the original PDO
indicators and subsequent changes. The JTWG became a substitute for proper Bank
supervision and the Bank’s leverage in such a context was lost. Pooling of donor funds
may not be the most effective funding mechanism to achieve uniform results in a
programmed sequence of activities as interdependencies among various donor inputs are
subject to external and internal governmental factors not subject to control or
coordination (eg, political changes, different procurement and disbursement rules, and
transparency issues, among others).

6.2 Government ownership needs to be carefully assessed in terms of potential for
political change and risk mitigation measures put in place to offset its effects. In
terms of encouraging Government ownership, the CPs appear to have been reluctant to be
overly directive at key points during implementation; there were times when a more
timely and robust CP intervention (even suspension of problematic components) may
have been appropriate (such as during the delayed appointment of the Accountant-
General and during the IFMIS/FMS uncertainties).

6.3 Projects involving far-reaching institutional and behavioral change need to be
more realistic in setting objectives, targets and timeframes. The multi-component,
multi-institutional nature of the Project made setting clear goals, targets and indicators
difficult, hence a project that has two PDOs and two sets of KPIs which have a tenuous
link to the PDO. It also makes monitoring and measurement a challenge. In addition,
projects entailing IT-related reforms should adopt a modular approach that minimizes
risk and cost. Any major reform process (whether involving IT or not) should also
assume the requirement for change management ex ante, and not as an afterthought when
implementation faces challenges. This includes the various aspects of change
management such as organizational development/restructuring, management training,
etc., and may also include the commissioning of appropriately skilled and experienced
technical advice to create the ‘space’ that is required to properly consider reform options
and facilitate implementation. Successful project and program delivery is often about
properly specifying and actively managing risk. This was a major area of weakness in the
PEMFA that should not be repeated in future project and program management.

6.4 To ensure effective project management, there must be a rigorous recruitment
process for key positions. Many of the problems that plagued the IFMIS sub-
component, for instance, were due, in hindsight, to the appointment of a project team that
had to be replaced because of lack of capacity. A reform of the size, scope and
complexity of the PEMFA should not be attempted without commissioning the provision
of sufficient internationally experienced PFM expertise to advise on the direction of
reform and on some of the more complex reform areas. There appears to have been some
confusion in the PSMP-SP between harmonization and common sense; being properly
advised does not mean that harmonization is compromised.



                                            23
6.5 TTLs need better support when managing such complex projects and should be
made more aware of the resources and support available to them within the Bank.
This is especially pertinent in cases where the TTLs are new to the Bank and may not
fully understand its internal processes, procedures and incentive structures. It is even
more critical where the TTLs are locally-recruited staff who lack the contacts and
connections with professional colleagues at headquarters, and so are unsure who to call
on for support and assistance. In fact, there is need to consider the extent to which new
TTLs should be assigned responsibility for such complex projects without the benefit of
adequate mentoring and oversight.

6.6 The achievements under the SDIF program raise a fundamental question about
the relative merits of different approaches to institutional reform/change. There has
been a tendency to favor the “grand design? of system-wide, whole-of-government
reforms over small, modest but catalytic interventions that employ innovative approaches
to solving specific service delivery problems and that could be scaled up. Although there
was no follow-through to the next stage, several of the projects funded under the SDIF
produced impressive results, in stark contrast to the overall PSMP-SP.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower noted that during the entire duration of both the PSM and PEMFA
program implementation, a number of challenges were encountered that affected the pace
of change. While some challenges were addressed in the course of implementation, it is
recommended that measures are put in place to address those challenges that are still
visible to date. The major challenges encountered were:

      Inadequate capacity to implement the work plan activities of some components.
       The slow pace of activity implementation by some components tended to pose a
       challenge; this resulted in the inclusion of the same planned activities year after
       year. This problem manifested itself as underutilization of budget.

      Late approval of work plans and budget by Cooperating Partners (CPs). Quite
       often approval of work plans would be delayed while waiting for Government to
       address concerns or issues raised by CPs. This led to delayed disbursement of
       funds and delayed commencement of reform activities. Management should strive
       to address issues affecting the program in the shortest possible time.

  There is a discrepancy in the PAD on the IFMIS. The indicator as set out in the Results Matrix shows
IFMIS being piloted in 5 key ministries and 2 provinces, as well as capacity building of staff at the ITU and
CCSD to support IFMIS after implementation, whereas the detailed sub-component description states that
the IFMIS will be piloted in 5 ministries and will be rolled out to all ministries, provinces and spending
agencies.

  Although there were no indicators for this sub-component, the ICR team met with the implementing
agency (Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants – ZICA) and found that the sub-component’s objectives
were met. These were: (a) Construction of the ZICA Resource Center; (b) Procurement of office furniture
and equipment; (c) Revision of the Accountants Act which was passed in 2008; and (d) Revision of the
Code of Ethics to regulate the behavior of accountants.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The Project provided a means to better budgeting, and thus potentially better use of
public resources. The advantage of a MTEF is that it provides a framework within which
overall budget magnitudes and sector allocations can be planned, enabling governments
to escape from the incremental budgeting followed by actual cash budget at the execution
stage with substantial discrepancies with initially stated priorities.

It is envisaged that implementation of a government wide IFMIS system will result in
significant financial savings for GRZ through more efficient control of public
expenditures, although the savings cannot be quantified at the moment. There is a
significant pay-off implementing modem computer-based payroll management system
when the transfer of data to the new system is accompanied by continuous payroll
verification exercises and followed by appropriate control mechanisms.

Expected benefits of operations of this kind in terms of fiscal savings, effectiveness and
efficiency will only fully materialize in the medium term and cannot be attributed to a
single action, but a combination of reforms. However, the positive contribution the
Project will have on state finances and economic conditions can be summarized as
follows.

CHALLENGES, LESSONS LEARNT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

CHALLENGES

      During the implementation of the PSM project, several challenges were encountered. The
      following were the key challenges:

Funding of the PSM

      During the implementation of the PSM, there were delays in disbursements. For instance,
      in 2008, IDA did not release its contribution for the first six months of the year. Similarly,
      the World Bank only disbursed its last commitment of USD1, 000,000,000 in September
      2011, when the disbursement was expected during 2010. Notwithstanding this, about
      SDR 850, 000 from the exchange gains was not disbursed. The delayed funding affected
      the timely signing of a number of contracts and the execution of some activities. To
      address these challenges, the PSM management constantly engaged the Cooperating
      Partners in an effort to resolve the issue but with little success.

      Towards the end of the PSM project, the World Bank and FINIDA indicated that they
      would make available some additional funding for PSM activities. Consequently, the
      workplan was revised to include new activities. The Bank however, later advised that the
      funding was not going to come through. This development affected the implementation
      of the revised workplan. By June 2012, Government decided to take up responsibility of
      paying all the outstanding commitments of the PSM amounting to US$1.4 million.

Procurement

      A number of challenges were encountered in the procurement process at various levels
      resulting in delays in the procurement of the required works, goods and services, thereby
      impacting negatively on the timely implementation of planned activities. Specifically,
      these challenges included:

      i) Delayed delivery of goods and services by suppliers, resulting in the late
         implementation of project activities. To address this, meetings were held with the
         suppliers and where necessary, punitive corrective measures like the application of
         liquidated damages were taken.

      ii) Limited capacity on the part of SDIF project implementers to timely procure goods
          and services for the projects, which also led to delays in the attainment of project
          outputs and objectives. To address this challenge, the PSM conducted a number of
          capacity building sessions with procurements entities in the implementing institutions.

      iii) Delays in granting No Objections on the part of the World Bank and delayed
           response by Government on issues raised by the Bank. To address these challenges,
           the Government and the World Bank agreed on a system to document timelines for



                                               48
             submissions and decision for all procurement matters that were being processed. As a
             result, the Government prepared a schedule of procurement activities which was
             closely monitored. On the part of the Cooperating Partners, the World Bank set up a
             procurement tracking system through which it was possible to track the status of all
             requests made to the Bank.

         iv) The long procurement processes for minor civil works impacted negatively on
             implementation of activities. This was particularly so for procurement related to
             works such as those under the Ministry of Health. This was compounded by the fact
             that many of these works were at sites spread over vast geographical areas located in
             remote areas with poor road infrastructure making accessibility difficult especially
             during the rainy season.

Implementation of the SDIF

    There were also a number of challenges related to the implementation of the SDIF. Key
    among these was:

    i)     Quality of proposals: Despite an elaborate sensitization programme and technical
           guidance, only a few Government ministries/institutions were able to submit project
           concepts and proposals that met the SDIF criteria. As a result, only eighteen projects
           were approved for funding out of more than two hundred (200) project concepts
           submitted. Further, the implementation of certain projects failed to realise the intended
           outputs due to limited capacity on the part of the implementers.

    ii) Documentation and publicity of service delivery improvements: While a number
        of projects recorded improvements in service delivery, there was limited
        documentation and publicity of the achievements. At the national level, efforts were
        made by the PSM secretariat to document and publicise service delivery improvements.
        However, there was little effort made at local level in documenting or publicising
        these improvements by implementing institutions due to limited capacity. To mitigate
        this, the PSM Secretariat successfully encouraged implementing institutions to use the
        local community media to publicise their activities.

    iii) Mainstreaming of project activities: Mainstreaming of project activities into wider
         government reforms, up-scaling and replication of project activities by sector
         ministries was initially a challenge. This was because projects were viewed as an end
         in themselves and were thus implemented as stand-alone efforts. Following constant
         interaction and technical guidance, implementing ministries and institutions
         appreciated that project activities were only a means of addressing service delivery
         gaps in the short term but were part of sector mandates which needed to be
         implemented as an integral part of the ministries/institutions.

Task Managers Incentives
     Officers who were appointed to manage PSM activities under their respective institutions
     had to do this in addition to their responsibilities outlined in their job descriptions. Over



                                                49
      time, lack of an incentive scheme for these officers adversely affected the pace and
      smooth implementation of PSM activities. The performance based scheme that was
      eventually adopted in 2010 came rather late. The scheme nonetheless helped to motivate
      and expedite the attainment of targets for some institutions that benefited from it.

 Natural Causes

      There were a number of natural causes that adversely affected the effective and timely
      implementation of PSM activities. This was especially so for three SDIF projects. One
      such challenge had to do with the death/sickness of key members of the implementing
      teams. These members played a critical role in the initiation of the projects and were the
      vision carriers and their abrupt displacement resulted in a negative effect on continuity.
      Another challenge was the heavy rains and floods in some targeted areas. The rains and
      floods led to delays in the implementation of activities as most of the project sites could
      not be reached.

 Retrenchments

      The payment of retrenchment packages took longer than planned because of delays in
      arriving at decisions by both the Government and the World Bank on the people eligible
      to be paid. This was the case with the former road sector employees where although funds
      were disbursed the payment of retrenchment packages took more than four years to be
      concluded.

 Execution and approval of consultancy services

      A number of delays were experienced in the execution of consultancies and approvals of
      final outputs. This is despite the fact that Government put in place Quality Assurance
      Teams (QATs) to timely manage the execution of consultancy services. The QAT
      experienced challenges in timely providing feedback to the consultants due to competing
      demands.

      In addition, the Government approval processes for a number of consultancy outputs took
      longer than expected. Further, the poor quality of consultancy outputs lead to repeated
      reviews of consultancy reports by Government.

      These challenges contributed to the PSM implementation being rated unsatisfactory
      during the PSM mid-term review that was conducted in 2009.

Implementation of the IA/OD

      Following the PSM mid-term review, Government and CPs agreed that the way forward
      to implementing Public Service Management reforms needed to be anchored on an
      integrated approach. The IA/OD approach which the MDD had embarked on offered a
      viable option for implementing Public Service Management reforms. It was therefore
      agreed that after the mid-term review, the IA/OD be piloted to establish its efficacy.



                                              50
      Further, depending on the outcome of the pilot, it was expected that the IA/OD would
      inform the development of the PSM successor programme.

      However, the piloting of the IA/OD progressed at a slower than expected pace due to
      various intervening variables among stakeholders including availability of ministries in
      some cases, and the overwhelming workload in the approach which was not anticipated.
      This led to not concluding the piloting on time for Government to be able to determine
      the efficacy of the approach. Consequentially, it became a bigger challenge to design the
      PSM successor programme on the basis of the IA/OD approach.

LESSONS LEARNT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

      The implementation of the PSM has brought a number of lessons to the fore that can
      inform the design and implementation of similar and future reform programmes:

Funding

      The successful implementation of a reform programme like the PSM requires firm
      commitment from all stakeholders. In this regard, if the funding is from the Cooperating
      Partners, the pledges made need to be honored timely and in adequate amounts. Equally,
      it is important that Government demonstrates ownership of the programmes by
      committing the required financial resources.

Procurement

      While it is important to adhere to procurement procedures and processes, it was noted in
      a number of cases that the procedures proved to be an impediment to timely execution of
      activities. The preparation and approval of procurement plans, the need for “No
      Objections? at various stages of procurement and delayed decision making adversely
      affect the speedy implementation of project activities.

      There is therefore need to streamline these procedures and processes so that they
      facilitate speedy securing of goods and services for speedy implementation of activities.

Comprehensive IEC strategy

      The implementation of the PSM activities had an IEC component as an integral part of
      programme management. The main objective of the IEC strategy was to engage members
      of the public as key stakeholders and active players in the reforms. Although some
      awareness was created among the public, very few members of the public took an active
      part in giving feedback on the way the reforms were impacting on service delivery.

      A nationwide IEC strategy needs to be supplemented by physical interaction with the
      various stakeholders through a number of strategies like local meetings, focus group
      discussions, drama, and road shows. IEC could also be made more effective by
      deliberately designing sector based IEC strategies.



                                             51
Innovations for Service Delivery Improvement

      The implementation of the SDIF was a good strategy for improving service delivery. For
      the future, this strategy can be enhanced through among others:

      i)     Building adequate capacity among the implementers to enable them deal with
             issues of developing bankable proposals, procurement, mainstreaming, scaling up
             and publicity of activities.
      ii)    Fostering partnerships that are well thought through and detailed agreements
             reached on the roles to be played by the partners.
      iii)   Ensuring adequate engagement and consultation among the stakeholders in the
             development of project proposals.

Implementation of the IA/OD pilot

      The implementation of critical initiatives such as the piloting of the IA/OD requires a
      dedicated team from both MDD and targeted institutions. In addition scheduling of
      activities should reflect the realities on the ground. This would ensure that such initiatives
      are implemented within the agreed time. The staff would only go back to their
      substantive duties once the piloting has been concluded.

Consultancy Contract Management

      The QAT initiative enhanced the overall management of consultancy assignments
      although it had challenges of ensuring that assignments were completed according to the
      contract schedule. To address this it is essential that all stakeholders strictly adhere to
      their roles and obligations as stipulated in the consultant’s contracts and TOR for the
      QAT’s.

Approval of Consultancy Service Recommendations

      During the design of the PSM, it was expected that the recommendations from the
      consultancy assignments would be implemented during the lifespan of the PSM. This
      would have enabled Government to benefit from the new systems/procedures
      recommended by consultancies. However, most of the consultancy outputs including
      recommendations were not implemented. This was because the Government approval
      process took long. It is recommended that the Government approval process for
      consultancy outputs be reviewed to ensure that the approvals are timely done in order for
      Government to benefit from the implementation of the recommendations.




                                               52
Task Managers Incentives

       The lack of incentives for officers working on reforms has always adversely affected the
       implementation of reform activities in the past. It is recommended that a well designed
       performance based incentive scheme should be an integral part of the reform
       implementation process.

CONCLUSIONS

       By June 2012, the PSM recorded some improvements in service delivery, especially
       through the implementation of the Service Delivery Improvement Fund. These
       improvements are a result of collective and concerted effort. Equally, the PSM
       encountered challenges, which can also be attributed to all stakeholders involved in the
       implementation process.

       Although the short to medium terms objectives of the PSM have been met, improvements
       arising from system wide reform initiatives needed more time to be concluded for the
       results to be seen and appreciated. In this regard, it is important that Government
       continues with the public service management reforms in order to attain efficiency and
       effectiveness in the way Government delivers public services to the people of Zambia.
