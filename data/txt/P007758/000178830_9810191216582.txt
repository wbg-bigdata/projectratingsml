CHAPTER I
THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
1.01      The Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM) (Managua Water Supply Company),
has requested Bank financing for the Managua Water Supply III Project. This
project would be the fourth Bank operation in the sector. Previous operations
include the expansion of Managua waterworks and the rehabilitation and
expansion of the system after the 1972 earthquake.
1.02      The Managua Water Supply Project has a cost of US$13.8 million.
The proposed Bank loan for this project is US$10.1 million, including financing
of the foreign exchange cost of the project (excluding interest during con-
struction). The project was prepared by consultants (Chang, Hazen and Sawyer)
and presented to the Bank in October 1976. The project was appraised in March/
April 1977 by Claudio Fernandez, FNA, and Ernesto Maisch, EGR, LCPWS.
Population
1.03      In 1976, Nicaragua had an estimated population of 2.3 million, of
which 51.5% (1.18 million) lived in rural areas. 1/ The country is divided
into eight regions and 16 provinces. The average population density is
17.6 inhabitants per square kilometer, the lowest in Central America, but
varies from 115 in Region II (Central Pacific) to 1.9 in Region VII (North
Atlantic). Population growth averaged 3.2% p.a. in the period 1965-75. As
in most developing countries, the urban population has been growing at a
fast rate and, between 1965-75, the urban population almost doubled, reaching
a compound rate of 4.8% p.a. and increasing the percentage of urban popula-
tion from 42% to 48%. Present forecasts predict that the urban population
will reach 52% of the total population by 1985 and 59% by the year 2000. The
population growth between 1975-85 is estimated at 3.3% p.a. 2/
Population Served
1.04      The availability of water and sewerage services in urban towns
ranks average in comparison to other Latin American countries, 3/ but their
availability in rural areas ranks low, and only five countries in the
Hemisphere have lower service levels.
1/   Urban towns, according to Nicaragua's Census Office, are villages with
1,000 or more inhabitants or, if less than 1,000, showing urban charac-
teristics (streets, energy, services).

Jerrold W. Huguet.
3/   Statistical data on the sector are poor.

1.06      Health statistics are seriously distorted and should be used with
caution (see Table 1.1). The main reasons are unreported deaths, especially
infant mortality; mortality and morbidity which are reported where they are
diagnosed, mostly in urban areas; and, finally, substantial seasonal labor
migration for the cotton and coffee crops which distorts morbidity rates
in the Pacific Regions.
1.07      There is no effective regulation for contamination control; sewer-
age and industrial wastes are untreated and contaminate water resources,
especially Lake Managua. A Managua sewage treatment project being con-
sidered by IDB for financing is designed to solve this problem by 1982.
Sewerage services are minimal and outside Managua exist only in six cities
which have 7,946 connections for a (1975) population of 265,488 persons.

Sector Organization
1.08      The main institutions working in for the water supply and sewerage
sector are:
(i)  The Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM) (Managua Water Supply
Company), supplying potable water to the capital city, a well-
organized and properly managed institution that served 471,000
persons (about 90% of population) by house connections in mid-1977.
The Ministry of Public Works has a de jure authority over EAM;
(ii)  Departamento Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado
(DENACAL), which administers all urban water supply systems
(excluding Managua and four other municipalities which
have their own water supply systems), sewerage systems
(including that for Managua), and some solid waste collection
and disposal. DENACAL plans and runs its systems moderately
well and depends on the Ministry of Public Health. In 1976 it
served 62,000 water house connections, supplying water to
about 320,000 inhabitants and had 48,000 sewer connections,
serving 390,000 persons.
(iii)  The Ministry of Public Health has been responsible for rural
water supply and excreta disposal (Rural Health Services)
outside the urban towns, as defined in footnote 1/ of
para. 1.03.  A new department in this Ministry, PLANSAR
(Rural Health Program), was established in 1976 and is now
responsible for the construction of rural water supply
and excreta disposal systems.
Sector Investments
1.09      Investments for water and sewerage during the last six years (1971-
1976) averaged US$2.90 per person per year (US$38.2 million, about 7.8% of the

public sector investment). Ninety five percent of this investment has been
made in the urban areas (see Table 1.2). The Government, however, is ini-
tiating an ambitious program to provide water supply and waste disposal
facilities to rural communities, and for this purpose it created PLANSAR in
1976. PLANSAR is presently carrying out a project in Region II, IV and V with
the financial assistance of AID.
External Assistance
1.10      External assistance financed US$20.3 million (53%) of sector
investments between 1972-76. The major part of this assistance came from the
Inter-American Development Bank (55%), which financed urban water and sewerage
works by DENACAL. A Bank Loan of US$6.9 million and an IDA Credit of US$2.5
million (Managua Earthquake Reconstruction) helped finance Managua's waterworks.
The main source of assistance for small communities has been the Coooperative
for American Relief Everywhere, CARE, which has worked with DENACAL in
developing water supply systems for several towns below 3,000 inhabitants.
An AID loan, approved in 1976, is financing the training of personnel for
rural health programs improving rural health care (US$3 million) and providing
water and excreta disposal for rural communities (PLANSAR) in Regions II, IV
and V (US$2 million). The main projects under execution and their financing
sources are shown in Table 1.3.
Government Objectives
1.11      The Government's objectives are to extend, improve and integrate
sanitation services, particularly in rural areas, thereby improving the
living standards of low income groups. The target for 1981 is to serve 80%
of the urban population by water house connections and 70% with sewerage. In
the rural areas, the 1981 target is to serve 40% of the population with safe
water and to provide 48% with latrines. These targets are feasible if the
projects already prepared obtain foreign financing and PLANSAR's execution
capacity is increased.
1.12      The Government has given top priority to integrated rural develop-
ment, including education, sanitation, house improvement and support for
agricultural products. These efforts are expected to result in a decrease
in immigration to urban areas, an increase in life expectancy and a reduction
in child malnutrition, thereby increasing the income of the rural population
and improving the environmental and health conditions.
1.13      In order for the Government to continue its program in the sector
and achieve its targets for the country by 1981, it is estimated that public
investment in the sector would have to grow on average at about 10 percent per
year in real terms. Certain measures are being undertaken to help ease the
financial burden of investment in this sector. In urban areas, the Government
is trying to make DENACAL more self-sufficient by phasing out a program of
giving foreign loans to it as grants. It is also recognized that efforts
should be made to increase DENACAL's tariffs to cover operating costs in the
urban areas and revise its tariff structure, which now consists of more than

60 categories which are cumbersome to administer and are characterized
by little or no progressivity. Tariff improvements had been undertaken
by EAM as a condition of Board presentation for the proposed Managua
Water Supply III Project. In rural areas, the Government is emphasizing
the development of simple designs and the participation of the community,
in cash and labor, which will bring costs for construction, operation
and maintenance of the systems to levels which will enable the country
to readily duplicate the program in the future in additional communities.
Bank Objectives in the Sector
1.14      The proposed project would support government objectives by
increasing the service level in Managua, mainly in the poorer sections of
the city. Another project being presented separately would provide basic
sanitation 1/ to the rural population in 7 of the 16 provinces (not covered
by AID programs), to serve 250,000 additional persons by 1988, or 41% of
the rural population in these provinces.

in Managua among the Empresa Aguadora de Managua and DENACAL has not caused
particular problems in the past, but it might do so in the future if the
sewerage facilities lag much behind the water supply house connections.
Therefore, assurances were obtained from EAM that it will conduct a study
of the organizational arrangements for water and sewerage services in
Managua in order to obtimize the coordination of the different agencies in-
volved in providing these services. This study, to be made by consultants
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and coordinated with
DENACAL and such other agencies as the government may indicate, should be
presented to the Bank not later than June 30, 1979, and is estimated to cost
US$100,000. The study should analyze the financial needs for Managua water
and sewerage works and their solution through tariffs or a combination of
tariffs and an "environmental tax" which would distribute the cost of sewerage
among all the population benefiting from the works.
1/   The government program includes:  water, latrines, sanitary house
improvements (trash disposal, mosquito prevention, floor levelling,
etc.), health education, and immunization of children.

CHAPTER II
THE BORROWER
Introduction
2.01      This chapter discusses the Borrower's organization and the measures
proposed to strengthen it. The Borrower of the proposed loan would be the
Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM). The proposed loan would be guaranteed by
the Government.
Previous Operations
2.02      The proposed loan would be the fourth Bank Group lending operation
with the Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM). IDA Credit 26-NI (First Managua
Water Supply Project), of US$3 million in 1962 helped finance the US$6 million
(C$ 41 million) first-stage water supply project which was completed in 1966
and more than doubled the number of connections (from 15,300 before the start
of the project to 39,200 by 1972). Loan 808-NI (Managua Water Supply Project
II) of US$6.9 million in 1972 is 97.3% disbursed and is expected to be closed
before Board presentation of the proposed loan. Both projects have been
completed successfully and have helped to increase the population served by
connections from 110,000 in 1962 to 471,000 in mid-1977. The number of popu-
lation served would have been much higher, but the December 1972 earthquake,
which destroyed most of the city, and the subsequent emigration from the city
reduced its population from 448,000 in June 1972 to 213,000 by February 1973.
About 16,000 persons were killed, some 27 km2 of the capital's total 33 km2
were damaged and about 45% of the total housing units were destroyed with
total losses of around US$1.0 billion. The IDA Credit 389-NI (Managua Earth-
quake Reconstruction) of US$20 million (C$140 million) in 1973 helped to
reconstruct the city. From this credit, an amount of US$2.5 million was
assigned for reconstruction of water storage structures, leakage detection
and the financing of local costs incurred under Loan 808-NI. Experience with
previous lending operations has been good.
2.03      The investment program of Loan 808-NI was modified according to
post-earthquake needs (see Table 2.1), in particular, to provide water to
new areas which become suddenly populated. As a result of the earthquake
destruction a major part of the old city has since been considered "off-limits"
for new housing. EAM efforts have been fully successful: it was able to
find and repair thousands of broken pipes, reducing the unaccounted-for water
from 60% a few months after the earthquake to 19% by February 1977, and by
1976 it was serving 435,000 persons (90% of the population) by metered house
connections.

Organization and Personnel
2.04      The Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM) has been a government-owned
utility since 1932 and is tax exempt. Its present bylaws (Decreto Ley 292)
were enacted in February 1972. Although the Ministry of Public Works has de lure
authority over EAM, the Company operates with considerable independence, made
possible in good part through its sound financial policies.
2.05      The present manager, who joined EAM in 1974, has performed well
both in project execution and in administration: cost reduction measures are
being implemented, 30% of employees have received training at different levels,
budget control is well established and project 808-NI has been completed
satisfactorily. The General Manager (Gerente) is supported by two experienced
assistant managers who take responsibility for the two main sections into which
EAM is divided: Technical and Financial Administration (see EAM Organizational
Chart). Assurances were obtained from the Government that it would continue
to give the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange views on any appointments
to the post of General Manager.
2.06      The Planning Department is responsible for long-term financial and
technical planning. EAM's budget is appropriate and well-controlled. The
Planning Department will gradually start to take a more active role in engineer-
ing design so as to reduce the need for consultants.
2.07      EAM is adequately provided with qualified personnel for its manage-
ment and supervisory positions. However, some specialized technical assistance
and personnel training are considered necessary (para. 4.11.) The total
number of employees in 1976 was 541 or 10 per 1,000 connections, which is high
compared with the USA (3/1,000) but similar to other Latin American countries
(9/1,000). This is partially due to the number of production well fields,
the manual control of pumping stations, and the number of operating personnel
required to serve connections between altitudes of 50 to 550 meters.
Assurances were obtained from EAM during negotiations that the increase in
personnel should be moderate so as to achieve a employee/connections ratio
within limits to be agreed with the Bank and EAM from time to time. EAM has
indicated its intention to achieve a ratio of not more than 8.5 employees per
thousand connections by end-1979 and 8 per thousand by end-1981.
2.08      Low salary levels were affecting EAM's capacity to attract and
retain staff. In 1976 EAM approved considerable salary increases (60%) to
bring salaries to competitive levels which are expected to be maintained.
Accounts, Billing and Collecting
2.09      EAM accounting is satisfactory.  Reliable procedures are used for
billing, payroll, inventories and general accounting. New computer facilities
to be financed under this proposed project would eliminate the technical
constraints of program development, especially for engineering applications
(flow control, optimal pumping, long-term regulation of water sources) and
would allow the use of already existing computer programs which require a

larger equipment. The level of spare parts inventory is excessive (9% of
gross revalued fixed assets) and guarantees were obtained during negotia-
tions that this level will be maintained within limits to be agree between
the Bank and EAM from time to time. EAM has indicated that it intends to
lower the inventory level to 3% of the gross revalued fixed assets
by end-1979, and to 2% by end-1981.
2.10      Billing and collection from private users is satisfactory.  Bills
are processed and include charges for water and sewerage (which EAM collects
on behalf of DENACAL on a commission basis) and for connection fees. Customers
can make their payments to EAM or through commercial banks. There is a strict
policy of cuts in the water service for non-payment by private users. This
policy has been highly effective: only 1% of the bills to private customers
remain outstanding for more than three months. However, some accounts receiv-
able from Government entities have been long overdue and EAM management has
been exchanging these accounts due for EAM payments on government-granted
loans. The value of receivables from government water billing reached C$6.5
million by August 31, 1977. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that,
prior to effectiveness, these overdue accounts will be settled in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank. In addition, assurances were obtained that not
later than June 30, 1978 and at all times thereafter accounts due from public
entities will not be more than two months in arrears.
EAM Auditing
2.11      Commercial auditing has been performed since 1964 by external
auditors acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were obtained during loan
negotiations that this policy will be continued, and that a copy of the audit
annual report would be sent to the Bank not later than April 30 of the follow-
ing year. The Bank has recently recommended a series of measures to improve
EAM's audit reports.
EAM Insurance
2.12      EAM holds insurance giving reasonable coverage against risks of
theft of money and goods, fire, earthquake, and misappropriation by cashiers.
Supply and construction works are also adequately insured against loss or
damage. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that EAM will maintain
insurance coverage of all assets, acceptable to the Bank.

CHAPTER III
DEMAND
Introduction
3.01      This chapter analyzes the population trends in Managua and its water
demand.
Managua's Population
3.02      It is difficult to predict the increase of Managua's population.
Historically, Managua has been Nicaragua's center of economic activity. Its
annual population growth was 5.9% from 1950-1963 and 6.3% from 1950-1971,
almost twice the country's population growth as a whole, and by 1970 Managua
was seven times as large as Leon, the second largest city. The December 1972
earthquake killed about 16,000 persons, injured 20,000 more, destroyed or
damaged 53,000 houses and 95% of the commercial zone and forced about 200,000
inhabitants (50%) to abandon the city. Most of the displaced population went
to nearby cities (Masaya, Tipitapa, Granada and Leon) but continued to work in
Managua. The total metropolitan population of Managua (estimated at 448,000
persons in June 1972), which includes some rural settlements was reduced to
213,000 persons by February 1973, but recuperated to 310,000 by June 1973.
Managua's population is currently estimated (June 1977) at 521,000 persons
(88% of pre-earthquake forecasts) and it is estimated 1/ to reach 636,900
persons (90% of pre-earthquake forecasts) by 1980 (see Graph 3.1). The
population trend in the urban area in Managua is as follows:
Managua               % Annual Growth
Year                 Urban Population         between Years Shown

3.03      The population under EAM's jurisdiction includes Managua's urban
population plus about 50% of the rural population of the Managua Province
(40,000 persons), who live along access roads to Managua. For the proposed
project, the city's population has been forecast with decreasing rates of
growth (from 7% in 1978 to 4.0% after 1982). These rates are low by historical
standards and assume lower immigration and birth rates. Most capital cities
in Latin America had growth rates of between 4.1% and 11% in the seventies.
In 1975, 21% of Nicaragua's population lived in the capital (compared with 36%
in Argentina, 32% in Chile, 27% in Panama, 20% in Guatemala, and 28% in
Venezuela), and by 1985 an estimated 26% of Nicaragua's total population will
live in Managua, where the population will reach 782,000 inhabitants (see
Graph 3.1).
Demand Distribution by Zones
3.04      Managua's population is located at altitudes of between 50 and 550
meters; requiring several pumping stages for the water to reach them. After
the earthquake, the population moved to the higher altitude zones, making the
provision of water services more costly. The change in the demand distribu-
tion by altitude zones is shown below.
Percentage of Water Demand by Altitude Zones
Year                    Low            Medium      High-Very High

1980 (Forecast)          33              43             24
Water Demand
3.05      Managua's water demand is mainly residential (80%) and governmental
(11%). The percentage distribution among the different categories of con-
sumers has changed little since 1974:
1/   Population growth rates of 4.85% are forecasted for Managua (1980-1990)
by the Interamerican Development Bank paper, "Demographic Trends and
Urbanization in Nicaragua" by Robert W. Fox, and Jerold W. Huguet.

3.06      The population served by house connections was estimated at 84% of
Managua's total population in 1975 (8.5 persons per connection).  Due to the
high percentage already served, the distribution and consumption level per
connection are not expected to be modified substantially. Regression analysis
of monthly consumption data since 1968 shows a steady decrease of 1.5% per
year in unit consumption per connection (from 14.2 thousand gallons per
connection in 1968 to 13.2 by 1976). This was due to a change in customer
structure with a 30% increase in low-income connections and a tariff increase
of 20% (in constant prices) between 1972-1976. The forecasted tariff increase
from 1977-1980 is 47% in current prices or only 8.0% in constant prices. No
major reduction in consumption due to this tariff increase is foreseen. The
expected reduction to eight persons per connection would decrease She con-
sumption per connection per month to 12.7 thousand gallons (47.6 m ) by 1981.

3.07      Managua's demand is seasonal, with its highest demand between
February and June. Consumption is reduced in March due to the Holy Week vaca-
tion and is at its maximum during the dry season in April-May (10%-20% above
the annual average, see Graph 3.2). The 1972-1976 ratio of maximum daily
demand on the monthly average is 1.25 and the total maximum daily demand on
the yearly average is 1.45. Using these values, the average present produc-
tion capacity would be insufficient by the end of 1980, and it would not be
possible to satisfy the peak monthly demand after April 1980. The project
would supply an additional 6 MGD of safe yield capacity which, when combined
with increased Asososca pumping during the summer (after filling the lake
during the winter by reducing its pumping), would increase the production
capacity to 46.0 MGD, satisfying Managua's average water needs up to 1985.
Population Served
3.08      In 1976, 90% of Managua's population was served by house connections.
If production and distribution works were not expanded, the share of population
served would be reduced to 60% by 1985. The aim of the project is to increase
the proportion of the population served by house connections to 96% by 1982.
Two hundred and fifteen thousand additional persons, mostly the urban poor,
poor, would be served between 1979-1985 and the number of connections made in
the same period would be increased by 27,000 or 45%. These targets seem
feasible if EAM maintains its present revolving fund (US$1 million donated by
AID in 1976) which gives financial assistance to the urban poor (for a maximum
of eight years) for connection costs and for basic indoor piping (toilets,
showers, sinks, etc.). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
this revolving fund would be maintained to provide long-term financing to
urban poor 3/ house connections and basic indoor piping.
3.09      According to Managua's Sewerage Master Plan, 1/ only ten neighbor-
hoods lack public sewerage. 2/ Three of them (Satelite Asososca, La Gruta
and El Mirador) are high-income neighborhoods using appropriate septic tank
solutions. This leaves about 210 hectares, presently inhabited by about
40,000 persons, to be served by latrines until the Master Sewerage Plan is
implemented. To avoid the sanitation problems that could occur if appropriate
sewage disposal lags appreciably behind installation of water connections,
assurances were obtained from the Government that sewage disposal works will
be carried out or cause to be carried out by the Government, as and when needed
for project execution and that before Bank disbursements for transmission and
distribution works (para. 4.06(vi)) for a given neighborhood are made, EAM
will present a program acceptable to the Bank for sewage disposal in that area.

3/   The urban poor have an average income below C$800 per month (at December
1977 prices). The connection charges to low income houses recuperates
the connection costs (about C$560).

CHAPTER IV
THE PROJECT
Existing Facilities
4.01      The main water sources for Managua are Lake Asososca and the
Jose M. Moncada well field. Together, they provide 93% of the present
capacity. Lake Asososca is a volcanic crater which has been the main water
source for more than 50 years and has a reliable long-term yield of 20 MGD
(53% of total present capacity). The Jose M. Moncada well field (also called
Las Mercedes) has eight wells and its present reliable yield is 15 MGD.
Total permanent water production capacity, including other small wells, is
37.7 MGD. The maximum capacity usable for several weeks reaches 44 MGD
(17% higher). Water quality from both sources is excellent and chlorination
is the only treatment needed. Production capacity is shown below:

Total Capacity           37.7                     44.8
4.02      The distribution system is divided into four independent zones.
Each zone has different altitudes, with its own booster pumping and storage
tanks. The low zone (40-85 m) comprises downtown Managua, which has remained
virtually uninhabited since its destruction by the earthquake. The medium
zone (85-135 m) receives water pumped at Asososca and additional water from
the Moncada well field repumped at the Herrera pumping station. The high
zone (135-190 m) receives water from Asososca and water from the Moncada
field repumped at the Altamira station. The population located at the highest
altitude, between 190-550 meters (along the south and Masaya highways) obtain
water which requires additional pumping stations and storage tanks (see
Graph 4.1).
4.03      The total length of the transmission and distribution system is
931 kilometers with 55,460 house connections (1977), i.e. 17 meters per
connection. The maximum diameter of transmission mains is 36". All pipes of
14" diameter and greater are cast iron, while asbestos cement is used for
diameters 5-12". Smaller diameter pipes are made of galvanized iron and PVC.
The total length of the system is divided into: asbestos cement pipe --
544 km (58%); PVC pipe -- 213 km (23%); cast iron -- 120 km (13%); and
galvanized iron -- 53 km (6%). (See Table 4.1.) Earthquake damage (except
that in the downtown section to be rehabilitated under the project) has been
repaired and the network is in good condition. Unaccounted-for water (often
exceeding 30% in Latin America), was reduced to 19% by February 1977.

4.04      The storage system has 40 tanks in 27 locations (see Graph 4.1).
Most of them (73%) are steel tanks of 126,000 gallon Sapacity. The aggre-
gate storage capacity is 10 million gallons (37,800 m ) which covers 23%
of 1977 maximum demand.
Project Objectives
4.05      The objectives of the project are:
(i)  To provide safe potable water to Managua's population up to
1985 and provide for the peak summer water requirements up to
1983;
(ii)  To expand the transmission and distribution facilities
required to serve by 1985 by house connections an addi-
tional population of 215,000 persons (mainly urban poors),
and install most of these connections;
(iii) To improve the managerial and operation capabilities of
EAM;
(iv)  To determine future water supply sources; and
(v)  To determine the most suitable institutional arrange-
ments for the sector.
Project Description
4.06      The project components are:
(i)  Construction and equipment of six additional deep wells
(150 meters) with an aggregate yield of 6 MGD in the
Jose M. Moncada well field. This field has an estimated
safe yield of 26 MGD of which only 15 are presently being
used;
(ii)  Provision of additional pumping equipment for the Rafaela
Herrera (3,000 GPM) and Altamira (2,800 GPM) booster-pumping
stations and construction and equipment of three additional minor
pumping stations (500, 300 and 150 GPM) near the water tanks
described in paragraph 4.06 (iii);
(iii) Construction of three 0.5 million gallon water tanks and
one 0.126 million gallon tank south of Villa Fontana;
(iv)  Installation of 14 km of secondary distribution mains 6" to 16"
in the streets Momotombo, 5 Ave. Este, Colon and Bolivar, in
downtown Managua, to replace damaged pipes and valves and
provide the new water distribution system required for the
expansion and reconstruction of these streets;



- 27 -
(v) Network improvements in different parts of Managua,
replacing malfunctioning valves (200) and hydrants (70)
and eliminating about 10,000 abandoned house connections;
(vi)  Installation of 86.3 km (4-24" in diameter) of transmission
and distribution mains outside the downtown area of Managua;
(vii)  Installation of 20,000 house connections to provide domiciliary
services to 96% of the population by 1982;
(viii)  Acquisition of a new computer to replace the present one,
which has excessive maintenance problems and is no longer
adequate for company needs;
(ix)  Study for new water sources for the next expansion stage.
This study would select the least-cost alternative among
several possible water sources, such as Tipitapa, Tisma,
Nicaragua Lake, and Masaya Lake, and would make preliminary
design for the alternative selected and the expansions re-
quired up to year 2000.
(x) Technical assistance and personnel training in preventive
maintenance, pumping optimization, billing and inventory
control, long-term planning and management of the commer-
cial department;
(xi)  The study of the organizational arrangements for water and
sewerage services in Managua (paragraph 1.15) and;
(xii) Engineering and administration of the project.
4.07      Each major project component has been found to be the least-cost
alternative for interest rates up to 20%. Final design is scheduled to begin
at end 1977 and construction would start in 1978. The project would be
completed by the end of 1980 (see Graph 4.2).
4.08      Project component (iv) comprises the basic distribution works required
before these four downtown streets are reconstructed and expanded. These streets
are of high priority for the Government and for the first stage of Managua's
Urban Master Plan. They will interconnect suburban areas of Managua and are
needed for the construction of commercial and official buildings now planned
for the downtown area. As the water works are contingent on the street con-
struction no disbursement will be made for the distribution lines in each of
these streets unless satisfactory evidence is received by the Bank that the
construction of these streets has been undertaken by the Government.
Project Costs
4.09      Project costs were prepared using 1975 bid prices updated to
January 1977. Technical contingencies have been calculated at 15% for all

project components. Inflation in Nicaragua has traditionally been low (aver-
aging 2% between 1965-1972). Thus, after the years 1977 and 1978, for which
12% and 9% price increases are forecasted, the average worldwide inflation
rate of 7.5% is used for local price contingencies. Price contingencies for
foreign components are 7.5% p.a. for 1977-1979 and 7% for 1980. The total
project cost is estimated at US$13.8 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$10.1 million (73% - see Table 4.2 and investment summary).

4.10       The foreign exchange costs of the project (without interest) amount
to US$10.1 million, which is the amount proposed for financing by the Bank.
Commercial loans would finance US$1.9 million and the balance of local costs
and interest during construction would be financed by internal cash generation
(see para. 5.08).

Implementation
4.11      The project will be executed during the period 1978-80, according
to the construction schedule shown in Graph 4.2. The investment expenditure
schedule is given in Table 4.2.
4.12      EAM will carry out the project with the support of consultants.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, as a condition of effective-
ness, EAM will employ suitable qualified consultants acceptable to the Bank
to prepare final works designs, bidding documents and to assist EAM in
tender analysis, and construction supervision. Assurances were also obtained
that EAM will contract not later than June 30, 1978 the study for water
sources for future expansions, the organizational study for the Managua water
and sewerage sector, and appropriate technical assistance, acceptable to the
Bank, to make recommendations and train EAM personnel in preventive main-
tenance, pumping optimization, billing and inventory control, long-term plan-
ning and management of the commercial department. A summary of consulting
services, averaging 152 man-months, is shown in Annex 3. The average cost of
consultants is estimated at US$5,100 per man-month.
Procurement
4.13      All contracts will be awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. However, civil works contracts
under US$200,000 (excluding well construction), or equipment and materials
contracts under US$25,000, all up to an aggregate amount of US$1,000,000 may
be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory
to the Bank. Under the local bidding procedures foreign bidders are allowed
to compete. Suppliers from the Central American Common Market, including those
in Nicaragua, will be allowed a preference of either 15% of the CIF price, or 50%
of the import duties applicable to suppliers from non-member countries, whichever
is lower. It is expected that most civil works contracts would be won by Nicaraguan
firms and almost all the equipment and material supply contracts would be won
by foreign firms. EAM is familiar with Bank procurement practices and policies
and its procurement experience with former loans and credits has been satisfactory.
4.14      A draft of the general conditions for all ICB or local procurement
tender documents would be prepared for the first bid and, upon Bank approval,
would be used for subsequent bids.
4.15      The proposed major packages for civil works contracts and equipment
purchases are as follows:

CHAPTER V
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01      The rapidly-increasing demand for services in areas which had not
previously been served and the earthquake destruction of downtown areas which
had been served, taxed EAM's performance during recent years and still entail
additional efforts for EAM to keep pace with normal growth and the return
of displaced persons. Nicaragua's inflation has traditionally been low.
Consumer prices rose only by an average of 2% p.a. between 1965-1972, 1.9% in
1975, but by 6.2% in 1976. However, 12% and 9% increases are forecasted for
1977 and 1978. After 1978, consumer prices are not expected to exceed the
inflation rate in industrial countries.
Past Finances and Present Position
5.02      EAM's financial position was sound during the period 1972-1976,
although the 1972 earthquake destroyed or damaged many of its assets and
halved the number of its 1973 customers. To help alleviate the financial
burden resulting from lower sales, the Bank financed US$0.85 interest on the
Loan 808-NI for the Water Supply II Project and waived the rate of return
requirement through 1976. EAM was also requested to achieve an annual rate of
return of not less than 2% in 1977, not less than 5% in 1978, and not less
than 7% in 1979 and thereafter (based on unrevalued fixed assets). Neverthe-
less EAM had a rate of return of 5.1% in 1975 and 1.4% in 1976 (due to the
1975 adjustment of staff salaries to competitive levels).  EAM's inter-
nal contribution to investment during the period 1973-1976 was 32%. The
forecasted rate of return for 1977 is 1.6%, approaching the 2% of the present
covenant. EAM's past financial statements for selected years are summarized
below.

Water and Sewerage Tariffs
5.03      The water tariffs remained constant between 1963 and 1975.  The
population movement after the earthquake and its location in high altitude
zones where tariffs are higher resulted in ar increase in the average
tariff in current prices. In fact, the tariff in constant prices remained
steady. In 1975 the tariffs were increased 35%.
5.04      The water tariffs were modified in November 1977, in consultation with
the Bank. Under the new tariff structure, the number of categories into which
consumers were divided was reduced from 12 to 9, and the tariff progressivity
increased from 1.2-2.5  to 1.7-3.75.  These modifications were introduced in
order to bring down excess consumption, thus promoting water conservation; to
distribute the water charges more equitably (according to income); to reduce
water charges to the urban poor who consume less than the minimum by reducing
the minimum consumption from 8,000 to 5,000 gallons per month in all residential
categories. The effect of the new tariffs is to increase EAN's average charge
by 25%, without affecting the lower-income residents of MHanagua, who constitute
about 35% of its popu ation.  The new average water charge is C$4.78/1,000
US gallons (US$0.18/m ), which is within the range of the highest tasiffs in
Latin America.  The minimum charges are C$2 1,000 gallons (US$0.08/m ) and the
maximum charges C$9/1000 gallons (US$0.34/m ). EAM also collects additional
sewerage charges (for DENACAL) which equal 30% of the water bills of customers
served by sewerage.



- 37 -
5.05      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that these tariffs
would not be modified unless the Bank and EAM both agreed to such modifica-
tions. Assurances were also obtained that EAM will carry out a study, not
later than February 28, 1978, under terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank, of the water tariff structure to be used and rates to be charged by
EAM in order to achieve a 4% rate of return on revalued fixed assets in 1978.
This study should be sent to the Bank for comments promptly after its comple-
tion and should be the basis for further tariff changes that EAM has agreed
to implement not later than July 1, 1978.
5.06      The drilling of new wells in Managua is now controlled by EAM.
There are several industries using private wells, reducing the amount of
water available to the city. Assurances were obtained from the Government
and EAM that a system of charges for private well users, acceptable to the
Bank, should be implemented not later than December 31, 1978.
Future Finances
5.07      EAM's financial position will continue to be sound provided the
following basic conditions are met (Annex 1 - Financial Assumptions):
(i) A financial rate of return based on revalued assets of at
least 4% from 1978 to 1980. The initial tariff increase,
introduced in November 1977 would be about 25%, raising the
average charges to C$4.8/1,000 gallons. The additional
tariff increase scheduled for July 1, 1978, is about 10%,
which would raise the average tariff to C$5.3/1,000 gallons
for 1978;
(ii) A rate of return on revalued fixed assets of 6% after 1980;
(iii)  Assets would be revalued annually using 100% of the consumer
price increase, as reported in "Indicadores Economicos",
published by Nicaragua's Central Bank, or any such revalua-
tion method agreed upon between the Bank and EAM from time
to time;
(iv) Control its operating costs, within limits to be agreed be-
tween the Bank and EAM from time to time;
(v) A moderate increase in the present number of employees, so
as to achieve the employee/connection ratio described in
paragraph 2.07; and
(vi) Payment by the Government of its overdue water bills (amounting
to approximately C$6.5 million) as a condition of effectiveness,
and a reduction to two months or less of the government re-
ceivables for water billing by June 30, 1978 and at all times
thereafter.



- 38 -
Assurances were obtained duiring negotiations that: (i) these conditions
will be met; and (ii) in order to protect EAM's future financial viability,
EAM will not incur any new long-term debts, unless the net income before
interest and depreciation is at least 1.5 times the debt service of any
future year. In reliacion to thiie control of operating costs, EAM has in-
dicated that it intends to have a maximum average increase of three percent
over the percentage increase in consumer prices (3% in constant prices).
5.08       On this basis, during the construction period, EAM would achieve
an operating ratio below 66% and a debt on capitalization of between 35%
and 40% and would provide a contribution to investment from internally-
generated funds of 63% before and 25% after debt and working capital needs.
After 1980 EAM should be able to finance up to 30% of the maximum forecasted
investments (US$38 million) for 1981-1985 and to maintain an operating ratio
below 59% and a debt on capitalization ratio below 38%.
Financing Plan
5.09       The EAM financing plan for 1978-1980, summarized below, is based
on the following additional assumptions (see Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 for
complete financial projections):

(i) An internal contribution to investment of C$28.3 million,
or US$4.0 million (25.3%);
(ii) A Bank loan of C$70.7 millon (US$10.1 million), representing
63.1% of the total investment (7.9% interest, 17-year loan,
4 years grace). The Bank loan would cover the foreign
exchange component, excluding interest;
(iii) An additional loan of C$13.0 million (US$1.9 million, 11.6%)
from commercial sources (estimated to be repayable in seven
years with two years grace and 9% interest) which should be
signed before Bank loan effectiveness.
5.09      An analysis of EAM's financial conditions made under inflation
assumptions of up to 30% shows that if the proposed covenants are satisfied,
the financing plan would be viable.
Monitoring Indicators
5.10      The variables shown in Table 5.4 are considered important monitor-
ing indicators for EAM against which the actual values obtained, to be re-
ported quarterly to the Bank, would be compared to assess target accomplish-
ment and project execution. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that a system of monitoring indicators, acceptable to the Bank, would be
established not later than March 31, 1978.

CHAPTER VI
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
6.01      The measure of the economic benefits of a sanitation project is
necessarily underestimated. Most benefits are difficult to estimate in mone-
tary units even if we know that they result in the well-being of a population
through increased work productivity; reduction of medical and hospitalization
costs; increases in effective nutrition due to reduction of intestinal para-
sites (especially in children); land valorization after provision of water
services; and more equal distribution of access to services. It should also
be kept in mind that the project will provide the employment of 300 persons
during the project construction period.
Least-Cost Solution
6.02      The proposed project has three main components:  water supply
(wells, pumping station -- 18% of cost), distribution and house connections
(75% of cost), and computer facilities (4% of cost). The remaining parts
(3%) are technical assistance, engineering and studies for future water
supply development. The Jose M. Moncada well field is the only remaining
water source within the city, and all other alternatives are more than 26 km
away from downtown Managua and are more expensive both in initial investment
and in operating costs. They also require more power for pumping and some of
them need additional chemical treatment. This well field is the least-cost
solution to satisfy Managua's need at any positive discount rate.
Incremental Rate of Return
6.03      The incremental financial rate of return of the project based on the
water revenues only is 14% (see Table 6.1), which is satisfactory. The sensi-
tivity annalysis shows that if capital costs are 20% higher than estimated,
the incremental rate would be 12% and that if capital costs are 20% higher
and benefits are 10% lower, the incremental rate would be 10%. As this
incremental rate measures only some of the quantifiable benefits and EAM does
not pay taxes nor receives subsidies on its inputs, this is a minimum measure
of the economic rate of return.
6.04      The incremental financial rate does not include costs nor benefits

renting a computer were analyzed. Moreover, an analysis was made regarding
the sensitivity at various points in time against possible technological
improvements that could reduce the cost of future computers by between 20% and
40%. The results indicate that the purchase of the computer is justified for
an expected usable life of 10 years with a minimum return of 11%, even if
computers will cost up to 40% less in the future.
lMarginal Cost Analysis
6.06      The marginal cosi of water at a 10% discount rate is C$4.1 per
thousand gallons US$0.15/m at 1978 prices (see Table 6.3). The recently-
approved average tariff is 20% higher than the marginal cost. The preseet
tariff level for consumption in excess of 10,000 gallons per month (38 m ) is
between C$6 and 9.0, twice the marginal cost. With the future tariff levels
required under the proposed financial covenants, large users would pay almost
three times the marginal cost, and thereby subsidize low-income users.
6.07      The investment per connection is US$398, or US$50 per person, which
is below the average cost of about US$80 for Latin America. The project
would provide the capacity and most of the connections to serve 27,000
additional connections and 215,000 more people of which 60% (130,000) are
urban poor according to the relative poverty criterion. 1/
Risks
6.08      Based on the experience of earlier lending operations with EAM, no
particular risks connected with the project are foreseen. Managua is in an
earthquake zone and as the possibility of a repetition of the 1972 earthquake
cannot be excluded, special precautions will be taken in the design of project
works. Consequently, it is felt that the risk of not achieving the project
objectives is low.
Environmental Implications
6.09      The water and excreta disposal problems should be pursued simul-
taneously. Special assurances are therefore requested from the Government for
the execution of sewerage works (see para. 3.11). Sewage treatment in
Managua is being proposed in a project presented by DENACAL to the Inter-
American Development Bank. A sewage treatment project could lessen the
possibility of contamination. Nevertheless, assurances were obtained from
the Government that reasonable measures, satisfactory to the Bank, would
be taken to safeguard EAM's water sources from contamination; and that the
proposed water supply project would be carried out with due regard to ecolo-
gical and environmental factors.

CHAPTER VII
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from EAM
that:
(i) The increase in the number of personnel over the present
541 will be moderate, so as to achieve a ratio of
employees to thousand connections within limits to be
agreed upon from time to time between the Bank and EAM.
EAM has indicated its intention to achieve a ratio of not
more than 8.5 employees per thousand connections by end-
1979 and 8 per thousand by end-1981 (paragraphs 2.07 and
5.07(v));
(ii)  Inventory levels as a percentage of gross revalued fixed
assets should be maintained within limits to be agreed
upon from time to time between the Bank and EAM. EAM
has indicated its intention to lower the inventory levels
to 3% of gross revalued fixed assets by 1979, and to 2%
by 1981 (paragraph 2.09);
(iii)  It will continue engaging independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank to audit its financial statements, and one
copy of their certified statements will be sent to the
Bank not later than April 30 of the following year (paragraph
2.11);
(iv)  It will provide adequate insurance coverage for all its
assets (paragraph 2.12);
(v) It will maintain a revolving fund of at least US$1.0 million
equivalent to provide long-term financing facilities for house
connections for the urban poor, including basic indoor plumbing
(paragraph 3.08);
(vi)  It will revalue its fixed assets in service annually, in
accordance with the variation in the consumer price index
reported by the Nicaraguan Central Bank or such other re-
valuation method as the Bank and EAM shall determine from
time to time (paragraph 5.07 (iii));
(vii)  The water tariff structure and charges, fixed in consultation
with the Bank and put into effect in November 1977, will not
be changed unless both EAM and the Bank agree on further modi-
fications to such tariff structure (paragraph 5.05);



- 50 -
(viii)  Tariffs for the period 1978-1980 would be at least sufficient
to obtain a 4% rate of return, based on revalued fixed assets,
and a 6% rate of return thereafter (paragraph 5.07 (i) and
(ii));
(ix)  It will carry out a study, not later than February 28, 1978,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, of the water
tariff structure to be used and rates to be charged by EAM in
order to achieve a 4% rate of return on revalued fixed assets
in 1978. This study should be sent to the Bank for comments
promptly after its completion, and should be the basis for
further tariff changes that EAM agreed to implement not later
than July 1, 1978 (paragraph 5.05).
(x) It will maintain control over its operating costs, so that
they increase in relation to the percentage increase in con-
sumer prices within limits to be agreed upon from time to time
between the Bank and EAM. EAM has indicated its intention to
have a maximum average increase of 3% points over the percentage
increase in consumer prices (paragraph 5.07 (iv));
(xi)  It will establish not later than March 31, 1978 a system of
monitoring indicators acceptable to the Bank and EAM
(paragraph 5.11);
(xii)  It will contract, not later than June 30, 1978, the study for
new water sources, the organizational study for the Managua
water and sewerage sector, and appropriate technical assistance,
acceptable to the Bank, to make recommendations and train EAM
personnel in preventive maintenance, pumping optimization,
billing and inventory control, long-term planning and manage-
ment of the commercial department (paragraph 4.12);
(xiii)  It will conduct a study of the organizational arrangements for
water and sewerage services in Managua, which would make recom-
mendations in order to optimize the coordination of the different
agencies involved in providing these services. This study, to be
made by consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, should be coordinated with DENACAL and other agencies
the Government may indicate, and should include the analysis of
the financial needs for water and sewerage and its solution
through tariffs or tariffs plus an "environmental tax" for
sewerage works and should be presented to the Bank not later
than June 30, 1979 (para. 1.15);
(xiv)  It will not incur any new long-term debts unless the debt
service coverage is higher than 1.5 in any future year (paragraph
5.07);
(xv)  No disbursement will be made for the construction of distribution
mains in the streets of 5 ave. Este, Colon, and Bolivar in downtown
Managua unless satisfactory evidence is received that their con-
struction has been undertaken by the Government (paragraph 4.08);



- 51 -
(xvi)  Before Bank disbursements are made for project works to
supply water by house connections to a given neighborhood
which does not have sewerage, EAM will present a program,
satisfactory to the Bank, for sewage disposal in that area
(paragraph 3.09);
(xvii)  As a condition of effectiveness, it will employ consultants
acceptable to the Bank to assist in final design works, the
preparation of bidding documents tender analysis, and
construction supervision (paragraph 4.12); and
(xviii)  Before Bank loan effectiveness, a commercial loan of at least
US$1.9 million equivalent for the project will be signed
(paragraph 5.09 (iii)); and
(xix)  As a condition of effectiveness, about C$6.5 million due from
public entities to EAM for water supply charges will be
settled in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 2.10).
7.02      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that:
(i) Not later than June 30, 1978 and at all times thereafter
Government receivables will not be in arrears for more
than two months (paragraph 2.10);
(ii) It will carry out, or cause to be carried out, as and when
needed for the project, sewage disposal works satisfactory
to the Bank and EAM in those neighborhoods not already
served by sewerage (paragraph 3.09);
(iii) It will continue giving the Bank a reasonable opportunity
to exchange views on any appointment to the post of Gerente
General (paragraph 2.05); and
(iv) Reasonable measures, satisfactory to the Bank, will be taken
to safeguard EAM's water sources from contamination and that
the project would be carried out with due regard to ecological
and environmental factors (paragraph 6.09); and
(v) It will take and cause EAM to take not later than December 31,
1978, necessary to establish a system of water charges, accept-
able to the Bank, for users of private wells (paragraph 5.05).
7.03      Provided the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$10.1 million. The loan would be for
17 years, including a grace period of four years and US$50,000 retroactive
financing for consultant expenditures incurred after August 31, 1977.

EMPRESA AGUADORA DE MANAGUA
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Inflation
1.        Nicaragua's inflation has traditionally been low.  Consumer prices
were first recorded in December 1974 and show increases of 1.9% and 6.2% for
1975 and 1976 respectively. The GNP deflator 1/ shows increases of only 26.7%
between 1960-1972, equivalent to 2% per year but the inflation reached 19% in
1973-1974. The financial projections are based on an internal inflation rate
of 12% in 1977, 9% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% thereafter. Financial pro-
jections were made for the proposed covenant (para 5.06) using these inflation
rates. Alternative inflation projections of up to 30% show that this rate
covenant produces a sound financial position in any case, with a debt service
ratio higher than 1.5, debt on capitalization ratio lower than 41%, and some
cash reserves after the project is completed.
Exchange Rate
2.        It is assumed that the present exchange rate (US$1 = 7 Cordobas) will
be maintained.
Population and Demand
3.        Population and demand assumptions are explained in Chapter 3.
Operating Expenses
4.        Operating expenses up to 1975 are audited.  The 1977 figures are
budgeted values; forecasts for 1978-1983 were made as follows:
(i) Wages: Present salary levels are adequate and it is assumed
that they will be maintained in real terms 2/. A higher
productivity would reduce the additional number of
employees in order to achieve a ratio of not more than
8 employees per thousand connections by 1981. No major
increase in the number of employees between 1977-1979 is
forecasted.
(ii) Chemicals (mainly chlorine): Volume increased in proportion to
water production and its unit price increased according to inflation;
(iii)  Power:  unit costs increased according to ENALUF (Nicaragua
Power Company) projections. Total cost is in proportion to water
production;
1/   "Indicadores Economicos", Banco Central de Nicaragua.
2/   Salaries have normally been increased below inflation rate.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 5
(iv) Materials: increased in proportion to 40% of the increase
in number of connections and unit prices adjusted for
inflation;
(v) Administration: based on detailed projections of personnel
and salaries;
(vi) Bad Debts: 1% of billing.
Operating Revenues
5.        Operating revenues are forecasted as follows:
(i) The average water tariff is required to yield at least a 4%
rate of return on revalued fixed assets during the construction
period (1978-1980), and 6% thereafter. The tariff is explained
in Annex 2.
(ii) Other operating revenues: mainly connections rights (C$500
each) increased with the number of connections; miscellaneous
revenues (late payment charges, computer services) are fore-
casted to remain constant;
(iii)  Non-operating revenues:  installation charges (C$600 for each
new connection). Other small components (asset sales, interest,
etc.) are assumed to be nil.
Depreciation
6.        Annual depreciation rates, to be applied retroactively to 1970 are:
Land                                0%
Building                            4%
Distribution                         2.5%
Pumping stations                     5%
Storage plants                       2.5%
Treatment plant                      5%
Vehicles                             20%
Office equipment                     10%
Tools                                10%
Other equipment                      10%
Asset Revaluation
7.        The rate of return has been based on fixed assets valued at their
historical cost. The proposed covenant requires the fixed assets to be re-
valued annually according to the increase in consumer prices (as reported in
"Indicadores Economicos" of the Nicaragua Central Bank), or any other accept-
able index. Fixed assets, as described by the external auditors on
December 31, 1969, were revalued using the cumulative increase in GNP deflator



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 5
between 1965-1969 (5.75%). The GNP deflator was also used up to 1974 and the
Consumer Price Index thereafter. The asset revaluation summary is given in
Table 1.
Debt
8.        Present debt is given in Table 2.  The present project requires, in
addition to the Bank loan, a commercial loan of C$13.1 million (US$1.9 million)
for 7 years, 2 years of grace and 9% interest. Short-term debt for about
C$4 million was needed between 1976-1977, but it is assumed that it would be
repayed by 1978.
Other Balance Accounts
9.        Other assumptions for balance and cash flows are:
(i) Accounts Receivable: projected to decrease from 17% to 12%
of billing by 1981 due to the enforcement of interest charges
for delayed payment and water shut-off for payment delays of
more than one month;
(ii) Government Receivables: the overdue receivables are assumed
to be settled by the end of 1977 (about C$6.5 million) and
are assumed to be kept to two months or less of Government
billing after June 30, 1978;
(iii) Inventories for operation are assumed to be maintained at 30%
of the annual costs other than wages and power;
(iv)  The spare parts inventory, which includes the equipment
received for project construction, is assumed to be reduced
in 1977 due to the completion of the previous project.
Future equipment or parts should be included in "Work in
Progress";
(v) Accounts payable are assumed to be 20-25% of expenses other
than power and wages;
(vi) Government Payables: part of Government debt service is being
retained by EAM to compensate for past delays in paying
Government water billing;
(vii) Project Payables: payment to contractors and suppliers assumed
to be 1 to 1-1/2 months of investment.
Cash Flow
10.       Additional works during the period 1981-1985 are needed to satisfy
future demand. They are estimated on the basis of the prefeasibility analysis
(US$20 million, 1977 prices) and price adjusted up to 1981-1985.

2.      Sewerage charges, collected by EAM for DENACAL are equal to 30% of
the water billing.
3.      The tariff increases of November 1977 (prior to Board presentation
achieved the following objectives:
(i)   Simpler tariffs (categories reduced from 12 to 9);
(ii)  Higher progressivity, 1/ which is now 3.75 in the residential zones
and 1.5-1.7 in the high zones, in order to differentiate between
necessary, and merely convenient or luxury consumption;
(iii)  Avoidance of excessive unit tariffs charged to the urban poor
because minimum charges are too high in relation to their low
consumption levels (minimum consumption for most categories
was reduced to 5,000 gallons per month);
1/ Ratio of maximum to minimum charges per unit volume.



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 2 pages
(iv) A tariff increase acceptable to most of Managua's population
with distribution charges reflecting the income distribution
in the city (about 35% of the lowest income population will
not have a tariff increase); and
(v)   Marginal pricing to reflect the highest cost of pumping water
to areas 100 to 400 meters above the normal residential level.
4.       The present water tariff structure and charges fixed in consultation
with the Bank and put into effect in November 1977 should not be changed
unless EAM and the Bank agree on further changes to such tariff structure.
5.       EAM will carry out a study, not later than February 28, 1978 and
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, of the water tariff structure
to be used and rates to be charged by EAM to achieve a 4% rate of return on
revalued fixed assets in 1978. This study should be sent to the Bank for
comments promptly after its completion and the new tariffs should be implemented
not later than July 1, 1978. The additional increase is expected to be about 10%.
6.       Connection rights are charged according to the schedule below (to be
reviewed by the new tariff study) and represent the installation cost charged
to the consumer. Urban poor users may also request EAM to provide and install
basic water and sewerage facilities (one shower, one tap and one toilet).
EAM finances all these charges for urban poor for up to eight years,
maintaining a permanent revolving fund of about US$1 million.
