MANAGUA WATER SUPPLY III
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM)
Guarantor:                Republic of Nicaragua
Amount:                   US$10.1 million equivalent
Terms:                    17 years including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
Project Description:      The project would provide potable water require-
ments for the population of Managua up to 1985,
expand production, transmission and distribution
facilities and provide most of the house connections
to serve 215,000 additional persons (over half of
which are urban poor, defined as those persons
earning less than one-third of the national
average per capita income); strengthen EAM opera-
tional and administrative capacity; determine
future water supply sources; and determine the
most suitable institutional arrangements for
the sector. It comprises construction and equip-
ment of six deep wells, construction of three
water tanks, installation of distribution mains
and 20,000 house connections, acquisition of pumping
equipment and a new computer, and consulting
services. Since Managua is in an earthquake zone,
the project works have been designed to withstand
seismic effects.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
EMPRESA AGUADORA DE MANAGUA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
FOR THE MANAGUA WATER SUPPLY III PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$10.1 million to Empresa Aguadora de Managua, with
the guarantee of the Republic of Nicaragua, for a third water supply project.
The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 7.9 percent per annum. Co-financing for this project will be
provided by a commercial bank loan totalling US$1.9 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Economic Memorandunm of Nicaragua" (Report
No. 914-NI) was distributed to the Executive Directors in November 1975. An
updating economic mission visited Nicaragua in June 1977 and a new report is
now being prepared. The following discussion incorporates the main findings
of the 1977 economic mission.
3.        Nicaragua's major natural resource is its arable land, which is
suitable for a variety of products. Although the share of agricultural
production in total output has declined in recent years, agriculture con-
tinues to be the main source of economic expansion, and is responsible for
about 45-50 percent of employment and almost 70 percent of export earnings.
The country is divided into three distinct agricultural zones: The Pacific
Zone, where about 60 percent of the nation's 2 million population lives,
is marked by a dual structure of farming -- a large number of small farms
grow basic grains with conventional technology, and a few large farms
specialize in cotton and sugarcane using modern technology; the mountainous
Central District is devoted mainly to coffee and livestock; and the large
Atlanti- Plain holds a largely unutilized potential for forestry and live-
stock production.
4.        Nicaragua's economic growth prior to the 1972 earthquake was
impressive, although it was characterized by sharp cyclical changes. Real
income grew at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent (3.5 percent per capita)
during the 1946-1972 period. The strong upward trend'in income resulted from
the expansion of production for exports, primarily of cotton, coffee, and
beef, but also of simple manufactured goods. The substantial growth of the
economy, however, did not mitigate the highly skewed distribution of wealth
and income. Moreover, the rural sector is characterized by a dualistic



structure of agricultural production and the related, highly concentrated
pattern of land ownership. The poorest one-third of the rural population, for
example, holds only about 3.5 percent of the country's arable land.
5.        Progress in reducing disparities in income and consumption has been
delayed by the persistently low level of public expenditures. The slow growth
of current expenditures -- and a consequent shortage of important public
service facilities such as education and health -- largely reflects budgetary
stringency dictated by insufficient revenues. Outside the field of transport
and electricity, the process of project identification and preparation has
been very limited in the past. As discussed below, however, progress has been
made in both fiscal performance and project preparation in the last three
years.
6.        The earthquake which struck Managua on December 23, 1972 took a
toll of about 10,000 lives, and destroyed or rendered unusable practically all
the central zone of the city, including most government offices, hospitals
and schools, the financial and commercial buildings and perhaps 2,500 shops
engaged in small-scale manufacturing and retail trade. About 32,000 housing
units, or about 45 percent of the housing in the Managua area, were destroyed.
The impact of the earthquake on productive capacity, however, was considerably
lower than initially feared, and the economy has recovered at a much faster
pace than originally estimated. Growth in GDP was 4.2 percent in real terms
in 1973 and reached 13 percent in 1974. The impressive growth of the latter
year was mainly attributable to construction activity in Managua. Unemploy-
ment, which had increased very steeply in 1973, moved down to pre-earthquake
levels of about 6 percent in 1974. However, as a result of slackening recon-
struction activity, compounded by a weak external demand for some of Nicaragua's
industrial exports, 1/ GDP grew by less than 2 percent in 1975. During 1976,
improved world market conditions for Nicaraguan exports gave new impetus to
economic expansion and GDP is estimated to have grown by over 6 percent during
the year and by a somewhat higher rate in 1977. As far as the accomplishment
of physical reconstruction is concerned, most public service facilities were
back to, or exceeded, preearthquake levels by 1975, but much remains to be
done to rebuild housing and commercial outlets for the poorer segments of the
population.
7.        The emergency taxes introduced after the earthquake reflected a
major fiscal effort which resulted in the increase of the tax ratio to GDP
from 8.9 percent prior to the earthquake to almost 11 percent in 1973-74.
While new, permanent taxes were approved in late 1974 to replace the emergency
measures, the yield of the new taxes has fallen short of expectations, and the
tax ratio has declined slightly. The authorities are currently studying
a new program to increase fiscal revenues. These increased domestic revenues
are urgently required to finance the completion of reconstruction and the
projected levels of investment in the Government's development program.
1/ E.g., exports of metal manufactures and chemical products, which to-
gether accounted for 38 percent of manufactured exports in 1974,
declined in real terms by 13 percent and in nominal terms by almost
18 percent in 1975.



- 3 -
8.        Some progress in overall planning and project preparation has taken
place in recent years. The public investment plan prepared by the Government
for 1975-79 assigns priority to expanding agricultural production and improv-
ing health, education and housing facilities for the rural poor. While a major
effort is still required to improve project preparation in the fields of rural
and social development, several projects have been developed recently or are
in preparation in these fields; for example, in addition to the Bank's second
education project (Loan 1244, signed on June 15, 1976), the IDB recently
approved a loan for rural electrification. Also, the Government is proceed-
ing with the reorganization of public sector agricultural institutions with
financial and technical assistance from USAID. The main focus is on the
implementation of an integrated rural development program -- INVIERNO --
which is supplying credit and technical assistance to low income producers
in the Central Pacific and Central Interior regions and is also coordinating
public activities in education, health, housing and infrastructure for the
same target groups. The INVIERNO program became operational in 1976 and has
so far provided credit and technical assistance to over 5,000 rural families.
9.        In the years following the earthquake, cotton, coffee and beef have
continued to be the leading traditional exports and constituted on the average
29 percent, 13 percent and 9 percent respectively of total merchandise exports
over the period 1973-75. Relatively simple manufactured exports (e.g. tex-
tiles, animal feed, chemical and wood products) have been rising rapidly and
already represent over one-third of total exports. While imports averaged
less than 30 percent of GDP until 1972, the post-earthquake reconstruction
process, rapid credit expansion and higher import prices drove this figure up
to 45 percent in 1974. The value of imports increased by almost 150 percent
from 1972 to 1974, while earnings from exports increased by less than 60
percent; the resource balance changed from a surplus of US$23.0 million to a
deficit of US$200.0 million. This deficit was covered by heavy borrowing
during the period (much of it on commercial terms) and international reserves
remained unchanged. The balance of payments situation improved substantially
in 1975 when, largely as a result of slackening economic activity, imports
declined by 10 percent, while export proceeds remained virtually unchanged.
The resource gap declined from 14 percent of GDP in 1974 to 9 percent in 1975.
1/ A further improvement took place io 1976 and 1977 when the unusually
favorable prices for exports of coffee and cotton reduced the gap to
substantially lower levels.
10.       Since the earthquake, Nicaragua's external public debt outstanding
and disbursed has increased rapidly -- from about one-fourth of GDP in 1972
to over one-third in 1975. The average terms of the debt have hardened
considerably because of heavy borrowing from private commerciaL sources. In
the immediate future, because of high coffee prices, this may not result in
too high a debt service ratio (the ratio for 1976 is estimated at 12.6 percent).
However, as coffee and cotton prices decline from their present unusually high
1/   Derived from data at current prices.



- 4 -
levels, the debt service ratio will tend to increase. However, if the country
successfully undertakes a serious effort to further expand and diversify
exports while keeping to a minimum additional external borrowing on commercial
terms, the debt service ratio should not exceed 17 percent during the re-
mainder of the decade.
11.       The overall prospects for the country's future economic expansion
will thus depend heavily on movements in international prices of its major
exports (cotton, beef and coffee) and imports (especially petroleum and
fertilizers), as well as on the success of policies in the following fields:
(a) export diversification, which is most likely to be achieved through the
promotion of resource-based exports such as wood products, fruits and vege-
tables; (b) substitution of imports such as corn and some processed food
products which could be produced efficiently in the country; (c) holding
overall imports down to a reasonable level through appropriate domestic credit
management; and (d) restraining external borrowing on hard terms. If these
policies are implemented, the Nicaraguan economy may be expected to continue
to grow at a satisfactory pace.
External Finance
12.       External official finance is provided principally by the IDB, USAID,
the Bank and CABEI. Recently, the Venezuelan Investment Fund (VIF) has begun
providing assistance to Nicaragua through a US$16.1 million equivalent loan
for electric power. USAID has made loans for agriculture, highways, industry,
rural electrification, housing, education and health. In agriculture, it has
played an important promotional role in developing the INVIERNO program to
assist rural development in some of the more depressed areas of the country.
CABEI is financing projects with regional impact, principally in transpor-
tation, industry and power. In addition, CABEI has lent for housing and in
lesser amounts for education and agriculture. IDB is financing agriculture,
water supply and sewerage, industry, housing, transportation and higher
education. The lending of the principal external lending agencies from 1950
through 1976 is summarized below:

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       To date, Nicaragua has received 22 Bank loans and two IDA credits,
totalling US$171.9 million. As of September 30, 1977 a total of US$43.6 million
remained to be disbursed on six loans for education, power, agriculture and
ports, and on the 1973 Earthquake Reconstruction Credit. The most recent
operation was a loan for the equivalent of US$22.0 million for the Ninth Power
Project, signed April 22, 1977. In general, progress on most of these projects
has been satisfactory, although cost overruns in the past three and one-half
years have hampered execution of several projects, particularly ports and
electric power. With respect to the Earthquake Reconstruction Project: the
power and water supply components were implemented without significant problems;
a portion of the education component and the sites and services component were
delayed initially, largely because of difficulties in acquiring sites, but are
now nearing completion; and the industrial component suffered initial delays
in the submission of acceptable projects by sub-borrowers, but has now been
completely disbursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1977, as well as notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       In the past, Bank Group lending was heavily weighted towards
assisting Nicaragua develop basic infrastructure, through loans for electric
power, ports and highways. More recently, an increasing share of Bank lending
has been directed towards agriculture, water supply, education and earthquake
reconstruction. The Bank's current lending program is designed to respond to
Nicaragua's development requirements in several different ways. Given the
importance of efforts to strengthen the balance of payments, one objective



- 6 -
is to support Government programs for export diversification through loans
for agriculture and industrial credit; another is to help reduce the country's
dependence on imported fuel, possibly through a project for the development of
Nicaragua's geothermal energy resources. Another major objective is assisting
the Government to improve productivity and living conditions in the rural
sector, which would be supported by the proposed Rural Sanitation Project, and
by rural development projects designed to complement activities in progress
under the INVIERNO program. In this connection, the Bank has agreed to send
an FAO/CP mission to help identify and prepare a project for the first stage
of a program for the development of the Atlantic frontier; the program will
include feeder roads, land distribution, credit and technical assistance as
well as necessary social infrastructure. The Bank also intends to assist the
Government in improving living conditions in urban centers through a sites and
services, urban upgrading and small business credit project, as well as
through the proposed Managua Water Supply III Project.
15.       The Bank's share of total external public debt disbursed and out-
standing is likely to remain at about 10 percent on the average through 1981.
The Bank and IDA's share of debt service in 1974 was about 11 percent; it is
projected to decline during the remainder of the decade because of Nicaragua's
substantial increase in relatively hard-term commercial borrowing in the past
few years.
16.       In FY 1968, IFC made a loan and equity investment totalling
US$2.1 million equivalent to help establish a new cotton and synthetic fiber
textile company (FABRITEX). IFC's equity has since been sold to local
investors. FABRITEX was hampered in its early years by marketing problems
associated with the difficulties experienced by the Central American Common
Market, further aggravated by the 1972 earthquake in Managua. The company has
now reorganized its operations and financial structure. In FY1976, IFC made a
loan of US$6.5 million to Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited to help expand its
sugar production capacity, and a loan and equity investment totalling
US$900,000 equivalent to help finance construction and equipment of the Camino
Real Hotel in Managua.
PART III - THE SECTOR
Sector Background
17.       The improvement of Nicaragua's water supply system during the 1960s
contributed substantially to bettering health conditions in the country, but
serious problems still exist as evidenced by a high infant mortality rate (146
per thousand births), high percentage of deaths among young children caused
by enteritis and other diarrheal diseases (37 percent) and low life expectancy
(52 years) relative to other Latin American countries. Sewage and industrial
wastes are untreated and contaminate water resources, especially Lake Managua.
The Government is preparing, for IDB financing, a sewage treatment project to
resolve the lake's contamination problem. By 1975, about 100 percent of



Nicaragua's urban and 14 percent of its rural population had access to potable
water. Of the urban population, 72 percent had house connections for water
and 38 percent for sewerage; another 38 percent were served by latrines. Of
the rural population, only 24 percent had access to latrines.
Sector Organization
18.       Public water and sewerage services in Nicaragua are provided by
Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM), Departamento Nacional de Agua Potable y
Alcantarillado (DENACAL) and the Ministry of Public Health. Four municipali-
ties and some large industrial users have their own water sources.
19.       EAM (discussed in detail in Part IV) is the capital city's main
supplier of potable water. In 1976, it was serving 435,000 persons (90
percent of the city's population) with house connections; almost all others
had access to community standpipe services. DENACAL is a national agency,
dependent on the Ministry of Public Health, that operates sewerage systems in
all urban areas as well as all urban water systems throughout the country,
except in Managua and the four municipalities which have their own systems.
In 1976, it served 62,000 water and 48,000 sewer houLse connections, reaching
320,000 and 390,000 inhabitants respectively.   DENACAL has received financial
assistance from the IDB, to which it is now presenting a Managua sewerage
treatment project for financing.   In the Managua area, the separation of
responsibilities for water supply and sewerage between EAM and DENACAL has not
caused serious problems in the past, but contamination problems could arise if
the development of these two services is not coordinated and if the construc-
tion of sewerage facilities is allowed to lag much behind the water supply
house connections. This project, therefore, includes a study of the organi-
zational arrangements for the coordination of these services in Managua (see
paragraph 39).
20.       The Ministry of Public Health has responsibility for rural water
supply and excreta disposal.   To develop these services, it created a new
unit in 1976 called PLANSAR (Rural Health Program) responsible for planning
and constructing rural sanitation systems. PLANSAR has initiated an ambitious
program with AID assistance and would be the executing agency for the Bank's
proposed Rural Sanitation Project, which is being presented separately to the
Executive Directors.
Sector Development
21.       Investment for water and sewerage during the last six years (1971-76)
reached US$38.2 million, or 7.8 percent of public fixed investment, with
95 percent of this investment being concentrated in urban areas. The Govern-
ment now plans to extend, improve and integrate services, particularly in
rural areas, thereby improving the living standards of low-income groups. Its
target for 1981 is to serve 80 percent of the urban population by water house
connections and 70 percent with sewerage connections, and in the rural areas,
to serve 40 percent of the population with safe water and to provide 48 percent
with latrines. In rural areas, the Government is aiming at integrated



- 8 -
development, including education, sanitation and house improvements. These
efforts are expected to increase life expectancy, reduce child malnutrition,
increase productivity of the rural population, improve environmental and
health conditions and help slow migration to urban areas.
22.       External assistance has financed over half (53 percent) of urban
and rural water/sewerage investment over the past five years. The IDB, AID
and World Bank/IDA have supplied major aid for urban areas, while CARE has
been a source of assistance for small rural communities, working with DENACAL
to develop water supply for several towns below 3,000 inhabitants. An AID
loan, approved in 1976, is financing the training of personnel for rural
health, improving rural health care and providing water and excreta disposal
services for rural communities in three regions which will not be covered
under the Bank's proposed Rural Sanitation Project. In order for the Govern-
ment to continue its program in the sector and achieve its targets for the
country by 1981, it is estimated that public investment in the sector would
have to grow on average at about 10 percent per year in real terms. Certain
measures are being undertaken to help ease the financial burden of investment
in this sector. In urban areas, the Government is trying to make DENACAL
more self-sufficient by phasing out a program of giving foreign loans to it
as grants. It is also recognized that efforts should be made to increase
DENACAL's tariffs to cover operating costs in the urban areas and revise its
tariff structure, which now consists of more than 60 categories which are
cumbersome to administer and are characterized by little or no progressivity.
Tariff increases and structural improvements have already been undertaken by
EAM (see paragraph 32). In rural areas, the Government is emphasizing the
development of simple designs and the participation of the community, in cash
and labor, which will bring costs for construction, operation and maintenance
of the systems to levels which will enable the country to readily duplicate
the program in the future in additional communities.
23.       The proposed project would support Government objectives by increas-
ing the service level in Managua, mainly in the poorer sections of the city.
The Rural Sanitation Project being presented separately would provide basic
sanitation services (including water supply, latrines, sanitary house improve-
ments, health education and child immunization) to the rural population in 3
of the country's 8 regions, to serve 250,000 additional people by 1988. Both
would give strong impetus to the current Government policies of improving
sanitary conditions and living standards of the poor.
Prior Bank Projects
24.       Bank Group lending for water supply in Nicaragua has included one
loan, one IDA credit and a component of the 1973 Earthquake Reconstruction
Project, all for the Managua area.   The first operation in 1962 (First Managua
Water Supply Project, Credit 26-NI) for US$3 million helped finance a US$6
million water supply project, which was successfully completed in 1966. Under
this project, water supply capacity was expanded to allow an eventual increase
in the number of house connections from 15,300 to 39,200 by 1972. The second
operation in March 1972 (Managua Water Supply Project II, Loan 808-NI) for
US$6.9 million helped finance a US$10.0 million project designed to develop
and expand EAM's water sources, transmission and distribution facilities. It



- 9 -
also included the construction of a new administration building and the
provision of management consultant services. EAM was in the early stages of
this project when the earthquake struck, and the project was subsequently
modified to meet the new conditions in the service area resulting from the
shift of a substantial part of the population from downtown to suburban areas.
Because of earthquake damages to EAM's network, resulting in a loss of revenue,
and the increased unit operating costs caused by the greater dispersion of
Managua's population and their movement to higher areas on the outskirts of
town which were more expensive to serve, it was forecast that EAM's financial
situation would remain weak at least through 1978. To assist EAM under these
circumstances the Bank agreed to amend Loan 808-NI to use US$850,000 (which
were made available through deletion of certain project items no longer of
high priority due to the changed circumstances) to finance loan interest and
commitment charges, extend the closing and maturity dates by one year, waive
the rate of return requirement through 1976, and lower it for future years
(Board presentation R73-67, dated April 10, 1973). It is now estimated that
EAM will achieve a 1.6 percent rate on unrevalued assets for 1977, approaching
the 2 percent of the present covenant, and that tariff action to be taken in
connection with this project will assure a 4 percent rate on revalued assets
for 1978. Both the Second Managua Water Supply Project and the water supply
component of the Earthquake Reconstruction Project have been completed.
Bank/IDA experience with previous lending operations to EAM has been good, and
consequently no particular problems are expected with the proposed Managua
Water Supply III Project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Managua Water Supply III
Project" dated November 9, 1977 is being distributed separately. The project
was appraised in March/April 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington from
October 18 to October 19, 1977. The EAM Delegation was headed by Mr. Luis
Pereira Denueda, General Manager. The Government was represented by Mr. Raul
Chavez, Economic Adviser of the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington.
26.       The objectives of this project are to provide potable water require-
ments for the population of Managua up to 1985 (and peak summer requirements
up to 1983), expand production, transmission and distribution facilities and
provide most of the house connections to serve 215,000 additional persons
(over half of which are urban poor, defined as those persons earning less than
one-third of the national average per capita income), to strengthen the
managerial and operational capabilities of EAM, to determine future water
supply sources, and to determine the most suitable institutional arrangements
for the sector. Although 90 percent of the population is currently served by
house connections for water, Managua is growing rapidly and without this
project the percentage of population thus served would decrease to 60 percent
by 1985. The project aims to increase the proportion of the population served
by house connections to 95 percent by 1982.

Prolect Description
27.       The project comprises:
(1) construction and equipment of six deep wells (150 meters) with
an aggregate capacity averaging six million gallons per day
(Mgd);
(2) additional pumping equipment with 3,000 gallons per minute (GPM)
capacity for the Rafaela-Herrera, and 2,800 GPM for the Altamira,
booster-pumping stations, and construction and equipment of three
additional minor pumping stations;
(3) construction of three 0.5 million gallon water tanks and one
0.126 million gallon tank south of Villa Fontana;
(4) installation of 14.0 Km of secondary distribution mains (6" to 16"
in diameter) in the downtown streets - Momotombo, Sa Avenida Este,
Colon and Bolivar - to replace pipes and valves damaged by the 1972
earthquake and provide the new water distribution system required
for the expansion and reconstruction of the area to be served by
these streets;
(5) replacement of malfunctioning valves (200) and hydrants (70), and
elimination of 10,000 abandoned house connections;
(6) installation of 86.3 Km of distribution mains (4" to 24" in
diameter) outside the downtown area of Managua;
(7) installation of 20,000 house connections to provide domiciliary
services to cover 96 percent of the population by 1982;
(8) a new computer to replace the present rented one, which has excessive
maintenance problems and is no longer adequate for company needs;
(9) a study to identify new water sources for the next expansion stage;
(10) technical assistance and personnel training in preventive mainte-
nance, pumping optimization, billing and inventory control, long-
term planning and management of the commercial department;
(11) a study of the organizational arrangements for water and sewerage
services in Managua; and
(12) consulting services for engineering design and supervision of the
project.
The construction of water mains in the downtown area (component 4) is designed
to support Government plans to rebuild priority portions of this area (des-
troyed by the earthquake) following a new Master Plan prepared by the Vice



- 11 -
Ministry of Urban Planning. The Government is planning to reconstruct certain
streets in this area, beginning in 1978, in order to improve through traffic
in the center of Managua and to provide the required infrastructure for build-
ings already in this area as well as for new commercial and official construc-
tion being planned. The installation of water lines along these routes must
be coordinated with the street construction. It has been agreed that no dis-
bursement will be made for distribution mains in each of these streets until
satisfactory evidence is received by the Bank that the construction work on
that street has been undertaken (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 4(c)).
Project Cost
28.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$13.8 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$10.1 million. Interest on loans during
construction would add US$1.4 million, bringing total foreign financing re-
quirements to US$11.5 million. Physical contingencies have been calculated at
15 percent for all project components. Base costs have been estimated at
January 1977 prices, with an allowance for annual price increases of 7.5
percent during 1977-79 and 7 percent thereafter for foreign costs, and 12
percent in 1977, 9 percent in 1978 and 7.5 percent thereafter for local costs.
The average cost of consultants (about 152 man-months are required) is esti-
mated at US$5,100 per man-month (January 1977 prices). Details of project
costs are presented in the Loan and Project Summary at the beginning of this
report.
Financing Plan
29.       The proposed Bank loan of US$10.1 million would cover the foreign
exchange component of the project. A commercial bank would provide co-
financing for interest during construction and a portion of local costs of the
project in the amount of US$1.9 million equivalent. It would be a condition
of effectiveness that the commercial bank loan be signed (Loan Agreement,
Section 7.01(a)). Net internal cash generation would finance the remaining
US$3.2 million. Details of the financing plan are presented in the Loan
and Project Summary at the beginning of this report.
The Borrower
30.       EAM has been a government-owned utility since 1932 and is tax
exempt. Although the Ministry of Public Works has de Jure authority over it,
FAM operates with considerable independence. Its new by-laws, enacted in
February 1972, were developed in consultation with the Bank. Management is
entrusted to a General Manager appointed by the Government and two Assistant
Managers, one responsible for technical operations who replaces the General
Manager in his absence and the other handling financial and administrative
matters. As in previous projects, it has been agreed that the Government will
request Bank views on any future appointment to the post of General Manager
(Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.06). The present General Manager joined EAM
in this capacity in 1974 and has performed well, both in execution of earlier
projects and in administration. Reductions in operating costs are being



- 12 -
implemented; 30 percent of the employees have received training at different
levels; and budget control is well established. EAM bill collection is
effective, with only one percent of the bills to private customers in arrears.
However, there are some accounts overdue from Public Entities, and during
negotiations assurances were obtained that prior to effectiveness the approxi-
mately C$6.5 million owed by the Government to EAM as of August 31, 1977 would
be paid or set off against existing Government loans to EAM in a manner accept-
able to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 7.01(c)). In addition, it was
agreed that by June 30, 1978 and at all times thereafter accounts due from
Public Entities will not be more than two months in arrears (Guarantee Agree-
ment, Section 3.02). Although EAM's management has been generally satisfac-
tory, there is still need for further technical assistance and personnel
training in preventive maintenance, pumping optimization, billing and inventory
control, long-term planning and management of the commercial department. It
was agreed that this assistance, totalling 16 man/months, will be contracted
not later than June 30, 1978 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02(b)).
31.       EAM's level of spare parts inventory (9 percent of gross revalued
fixed assets) is excessive, and it has been agreed that this level will be
maintained within limits to be agreed between the Bank and EAM from time to
time (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01(c)). EAM has indicated that it intends
to lower the inventory level to 3 percent by December 31, 1979 and to 2 per-
cent by December 31, 1981. EAM has a staff of 541, or 10 employees per 1,000
connections, which is high compared with the USA (3/1,000) but similar to
other Latin American countries (average 9/1,000). This is in part due to the
large number of production well fields and pumping stations controlled manually.
EAM has agreed to maintain the employee/connections ratio within limits to be
agreed with the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01(c)), and has stated the
intention to achieve a ratio of not more than 8.5 employees per thousand con-
nections by December 31, 1979 and 8 per thousand by December 31, 1981.
Financial Position of the Borrower
32.       Despite the earthquake-related problems described in paragraph 24,
EAM's financial management has been sound and its financial position is
expected to improve in the future. It has been agreed that EAM will maintain
a rate of return of at least 4 percent on annually revalued average net fixed
assets in operation during project construction (through the end of 1980) and
6 percent thereafter (Loan Agreement, Section 5.05(a)). This rate of return
would enable EAM to finance 25 percent of its investment program for 1978-80
from internally-generated resources, and at least 30 percent of projected
investments during 1981-85. In order to obtain the 4 percent rate of return
through July of 1978, EAM raised its average tariff by about 25 percent in
November 1977. At the same time it instituted a number of structural changes
which provided for a reduction from 12 to 9 categories, for greater progres-
sivity (for most residential categories the ratio of maximum to minimum charges
per unit volume was increased from 2.5:1 to 3.75:1), and for a reduction of
the minimum consumption to 5,000 gallons for all categories (minimum consump-
tion for some residential categories had previously been 8,000 gallons), thus



- 13 -
easing the burden on low-income users who currently consume less than the
minimum amount. EAM has agreed not to change this structure except in agree-
ment with the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.07(a)). EAM is currently carry-
ing out a study of its tariff structure and rates, which is to be presented
to the Bank for review after its completion on February 28, 1978 (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 3.07(b)). This study will form the basis of discussions of
possible further structural changes. EAM has also agreed to implement a
second tariff increase no later than July 1, 1978 in order to achieve the
4 percent rate of return for the entire year (Loan Agreement, Section
5.05(b)). In addition, it has been agreed that EAM will (1) revalue its fixed
assets in service annually, using the consumer price index reported by the
Nicaraguan Central Bank or such other methods of revaluation as the Bank and
the Borrower shall determine from time to time (Loan Agreement, Section
5.05(a)), (2) obtain Bank concurrence before contracting further debt at any
time that its debt service coverage falls below 1.5 (Loan Agreement, Section
5.04), and (3) control its operating costs within limits to be agreed between
the Bank and EAM from time to time (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01(c)). On the
third point, EAM has indicated that it intends to limit the average increase
to no more than 3 percentage points over the percentage increase in consumer
prices.
33.       In order to assist its low-income customers, it has been agreed
that EAM will maintain a revolving fund of at least US$1.0 million equivalent,
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to provide long-term loans
to low-income households for financing water house connections (which for
low-income households amounts to about $80, the approximate installation cost
to EAM) (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03). Although the drilling of new wells in
Managua is now controlled by EAM, there are still several industries using
private wells which reduce the amount of water available to public service.
It has been agreed, therefore, that the Government will implement, and cause
EAM to implement, a system of water charges acceptable to the Bank for users
of private wells no later than December 31, 1978 (Guarantee Agreement,
Section 3.04).
Project Execution and Procurement
34.       The project will be carried out in three years.    As a condition of
effectiveness, EAM will contract consultants acceptable to the Bank, in accor-
dance with procedures agreed with the Bank, to provide technical assistance in
design, procurement and construction supervision of project works (Loan
Agreement, Sections 3.02(a)(i) and 7.01(b)). It has also been agreed that
consultants will be hired by June 30, 1978 to carry out the Water Sources
Study for future expansion (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02(b)).
35.       All contracts will be awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines, except that civil works contracts
under US$200,000 (other than for well construction) and contracts for purchase
of equipment and materials under US$25,000, all up to an aggregate amount of
US$1,000,000, may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding pro-
cedures satisfactory to the Bank. Interested foreign firms would be permitted
to participate. In accordance with the Central American Common Market (CACM)



- 14 -
Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development, manufacturers from
the CACM, including those in Nicaragua, will be allowed a preference of either
15 percent of the CIF price, or 50 percent of the tariff payable by non-CACM
manufacturers, whichever is lower. It is expected that most civil works con-
tracts will be won by Nicaraguan firms and almost all the equipment and
material supply contracts by foreign firms.
36.       It has been agreed that a system of monitoring indicators acceptable
to the Bank and the Borrower will be established by March 31, 1978 to assess
target accomplishment and project execution (Loan Agreement, Section 3.06).
Disbursements
37.       Disbursements would be made over a three and one-half year period
for the percentages of costs shown below:
(i) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment and materials and 62 percent of total expen-
ditures for civil works (representing the estimated foreign
cost) for pumps, wells and pumping stations;
(ii) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment and materials and 43 percent of total expendi-
tures for civil works (representing the estimated foreign
cost) for distribution and transmission lines and water
tanks;
(iii) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment and materials for house connections;
(iv) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the computer
equipment; and
(v) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consultants'
services.
38.       Retroactive financing up to US$50,000 would be allowed for
consultant expenditures incurred after August 31, 1977.
Environmental Effects
39.       As mentioned in paragraph 19, Managua's water and excreta disposal
problems should be pursued simultaneously. In general,the proposed DENACAL
sewerage treatment project for the city should lessen the possibility of
contamination, and help prevent any significant adverse effects on the environ-
ment. With particular reference to the areas to be served by the Managua
Water Supply III Project, ten neighborhoods with a population of about 40,000
have been identified as lacking appropriate sewerage (other than latrines).
While the IDB-financed project is expected to provide services to these
neighborhoods, it has been agreed that in any event the Government will carry



- 15 -
out, or cause to be carried out, sewage disposal works in these neighborhoods
under programs satisfactory to the Bank and EAM (Guarantee Agreement, Section
3.03). Before actual disbursement of funds for project works in any of these
neighborhoods, EAM would be required to furnish the Bank with a specific
sewage disposal program satisfactory to the Bank for the neighborhood (Loan
Agreement, Schedule 1.4(b)). In addition, it has been agreed that the Govern-
ment will take reasonable measures satisfactory to the Bank to ensure that
sewerage facilities are constructed in such a manner    as to avoid contamina-
tion of EAM's water sources and that the project will be carried out with due
regard to ecological and environmental factors (Guarantee Agreement, Section
3.05). In the longer term and in recognition of the fact that coordination of
water and sewerage services is difficult when handled by two separate entities,
it has been agreed that EAM will conduct a study of the organizational arrange-
ments for water and sewerage services in Managua in order to optimize the
coordination of the different agencies involved in providing these services.
This study is to be made by consultants under terms and conditions satisfac-
tory to the Bank and coordinated with DENACAL and such other agencies as the
Government may indicate. The consultants will develop recommendations for the
unification of the services in one company or for other appropriate arrange-
ment and include the analysis of the financing requirements for water and
sewerage and the meeting of these needs through tariffs or tariffs plus a
general "environmental tax" to be levied on the population and used to finance
some future sewerage works, especially those, like pollution control, which
benefit the whole population. It has been agreed that the consultants for
this study will be hired no later than June 30, 1978 (Loan Agreement, Section
3.02(b)), and that the study will be presented to the Bank for review not
later than June 30, 1979 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02(c)).
Project Risks
40.       Based on the experience of earlier lending operations with EAM,
no particular risks connected with project execution are foreseen. Managua
is in an earthquake zone and special precautions have therefore been taken
in the design of the project works to make them more able to withstand seismic
effects.   In general, it is felt that the risk of not achieving project
objectives is low.
Economic Justification
41.       This project is the least-cost solution for expanding Managua's
water supply needs at any discount rate above zero. The Jose M. Moncada
well field is the only remaining water source within the city, and all other
alternatives are more than 26 Km away from downtown lManagua and would be
more expensive in both initial investment and operating costs. The project's
internal rate of return (based on projected tariffs at January 1977 prices) is
14 percent. Sensitivity analyses show that if capital costs are 20 percent
higher than estimated, the rate of return would be 12 percent, and that if
capital costs are 20 percent higher and benefits 10 percent lower, the rate of
return would be 10 percent, which is still acceptable. Not included in these



- 16 -
calculations are the health and welfare benefits to be derived from the pro-
vision of safe water by house connections to Managua's growing population.
Mforeover, this project will provide employment for 300 people during the
project construction period.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between Empresa Aguadora de Managua and
the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of
the Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements
conform to the normal pattern of loans for water supply projects and their
more important features have been included in Part IV and summarized in Annex
III of this report. There are three special conditions of effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement: (i) that suitable engineering consultants satisfactory
to the Bank have been hired to provide technical assistance in design, pro-
curement and construction supervision; (ii) that a commercial bank loan of at
least US$1.9 million for the project has been signed; and (iii) that C$6.5
million owed by the Government to EAM will be paid or set off against Govern-
ment loans in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Disbursement of funds for
project works in certain neighborhoods would be contingent upon the Bank's
receipt and approval of a sewerage plan for those neighborhoods, and funds for
water development in the downtown areas would be disbursed only upon receipt
of satisfactory evidence that street construction in those areas has been
undertaken.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Risks
70.      The risks involved in lending to small scale enterprises, many of
them infant in nature, should not be underestimated. The main risks
are that KIE would be unable to hire the large number of qualified professionals
required for its expansion, and that KIE would be unable to achieve financial
autonomy. With regard to staffing, KIE is reviewing its salary structure to
enable it to attract qualified personnel and the large technical assistance
component also aims at strengthening KIE's operating procedures. On the
financial side, KIE has adopted a policy statement including financial policies
(para 63) that should provide KIE with reasonable prospectives of achieving
a sound financial position by 1.982 and the financial advisors to be engaged
by KIE should assist in keeping loan defaults to low levels and in establish-
ing sound financial practices within KIE.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
71.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Kenya and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and KIE, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section
l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the resolution approving
the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
72.      Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in Annex III of this report. Appointment of qualified and
experienced staff for the Industrial Promotion Areas and the Eldoret Estate
would be a condition of disbursement and the conversion of equity capital
of KSh 50 million would be a condition of effectiveness.
73.      I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
74.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. 532   Education Project; US$4.0 million of April 10, 1968; Effective Date:
June 25, 1968; Closing Date:   December 31, 1977.
This project is supporting government efforts to improve and expand
secondary education in major cities and upgrade primary teacher training.
Despite delays in implementation, related primarily to the 1972 earthquake in
Managua and some administrative problems, 19 of the 20 project schools are now
in operation and the remaining one will be completed by the end of 1977.
Ln. 840   Eighth Power Project; US$24.0 million of June 28, 1972; Effective
Date: March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 30, 1977.
The two main works of the project -- the steam power plant with
associated transmission lines, and the interconnection with Honduras--were
delayed about 14 months on average for several reasons: the need to make
repairs and install emergency facilities for power after the earthquake, late
deliveries of equipment by suppliers, and late loan effectiveness because of
delay in signing the interconnection contract with Honduras. The interconnec-
tion was placed in service in October 1976, and the project originally
appraised to cost US$34.7 million equivalent is now expected to be completed
in 1978, with a substantial cost overrun amounting to US$24.3 milion. ENALUF
raised tariffs 30 percent on average in February, 1975, in addition to a fuel
surcharge of about 50 percent which went into effect in late 1974. The

ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
Venezuelan Investment Fund has approved a US$16.1 million loan to assist
ENALUF in covering the financing requirements arising from the cost overrun.
An extension of the closing date by about one year will be required.
Ln. 943   Agricultural Credit Project; US$8.5 million of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 10, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
After an initial delay in loan effectiveness caused by (1) addi-
tional time required for the Borrower to sign a subsidiary loan agreement with
the first participating bank, and (2) difficulties in hiring a project director,
the rate of sub-loan approvals by the Project Unit and the participating
banks is satisfactory. However, considerable cost increases are expected
to reduce the number of sub-loans to be made under the project to below
appraisal estimates.
Cr. 389   Earthquake Reconstruction Project; US$20.0 million of June 6, 1973;
Effective Date: August 7, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
With the help of the US$5.0 million power component, the National
Power Company (ENALUF) has completed repairs to its damaged equipment and
is providing service to people displaced by the earthquake. The Water Supply
Company of Managua (EAM), assisted by the US$2.5 million water supply com-
ponent, has repaired all its storage reservoirs and all its main distri-
bution system. Production and distribution of water is back to normal.
No serious delays in project execution or cost overruns were experienced for
the power and water supply components. As for the US$2.0 million education
component, the four prefabricated schools built under Part I of this component
are in full operation. The multilateral secondary school and the technical
institute to be built under Part II are under construction. Because of
difficulties in acquiring sites, the construction of these two institutions
is expected to be completed by December 1977, one year behind schedule.
Project execution on the US$8.0 million sites and services component is
proceeding satisfactorily. The Managua I and II, the Masaya, Granada, Leon,
and Jinotepe projects have been completed. The remaining project is Managua
III where dwelling and sanitary cores are expected to be completed by December
1977. Design standards have been reduced for many of the sites in an effort
to offset the cost escalation which has taken place during the last two
years; however, the total number of serviced lots still has had to be reduced
from the originally planned 5,500, to a total of 4,453 units at present.
After some initial delays in the submission of acceptable sub-projects by
the implementing agency, the industrial financing component is fully disbursed.
An extension of the closing date may be required for complete disbursement of
project funds.

Ln. 879   Second Port of Corinto Project; US$11.0 million of February 2, 1973
and US$5.0 million Supplementary Loan of August 1, 1975; Effective
Date: March 23, 1973: Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project initially encountered substantial cost overruns pri-
marily due to world and domestic inflation and earthquake-related delays in
project execution. In order to help finance these overruns the Government
obtained supplementary financing from the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration and the World Bank. Progress on the project is now good. Of the
project components still in execution, the containers' wharf is nearly com-
pleted and should shortly become operational for general cargo shipments,
and the administration building will be ready by the end of the year. No
action has been taken, however, by the Government to improve the access road
to the port, and the Bank has expressed its concern about this delay. The
Government has already paid C$11 million of its overdue contribution to the
equity of the Port Authority, and has agreed to pay a total of C$35 million
by the end of the year.
Ln. 1244 Second Education Project; US$11.0 million of June 15, 1976;
Effective Date: August 17, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. Architec-
tural designs, selection of construction firms, in-service teacher training
courses and selection of an agency to manage the technical assistance compo-
nent of the project are proceeding in accordance with the appraisal schedule.
Ln. 1402 Ninth Power Project; US$22.0 million of April 22, 1977;
Effective Date: October 27. 1977: Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
This project has just become effective.

During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from EAM that:
(i) The increase in the number of personnel over the present 541
will be minimal, so as to maintain its employee/connections
ratio within limits to be agreed by the Bank and EAM from time
to time. EAM intends to achieve a ratio of not more than 8.5
employees per thousand connections by December 31, 1979 and
8 per thousand by December 31, 1981 (paragraph 31);
(ii) Inventory levels will be maintained within limits to be
agreed between the Bank and EAM from time to time. EAM
intends to lower these levels to no more than 3 percent of
gross revalued assets by December 31, 1979, and to 2 per-
cent by December 31, 1980 (paragraph 31);

(iii)  It will maintain a revolving fund of at least US$1 million
equivalent on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
to provide long-term financing facilities to the urban poor
for house connections (paragraph 33);
(iv)  It will revalue its fixed assets in service annually, using
the consumer price index reported by the Nicaraguan Central
Bank or such other methods of revaluation as the Bank and
EAM shall determine from time to time (paragraph 32);
(v) It will maintain the tariff structure instituted in November
1977, except as may be agreed between the Bank and EAM, and
will present the results of a study currently underway of its
tariff structure and rates to the Bank for review and comment

(vi)  Tariffs will be sufficient to at least yield a 4 percent rate
of return, based on revalued fixed assets, for 1978 through
1980 and a 6 percent rate of return thereafter; a tariff
increase will be undertaken no later than July 1, 1978 in
order to achieve the 4 percent rate for 1978 (paragraph 32);
(vii)  It will control operating costs within limits to be agreed
between the Bank and EAM from time to time. EAM intends to
limit the average increase to no more than 3 percentage points
over the percentage increase in consumer prices (paragraph 32);
(viii)  It will establish not later than March 31, 1978 a system of
Monitoring Indicators acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 36);
(ix)  It will obtain Bank concurrence before contracting further
debt at any time that its debt service coverage falls below

mendations and train EAM personnel in preventive maintenance,
pumping optimization, billing and inventory control, long-
term planning and management of the commercial department,
to carry out the Water Sources Study and to carry out the
sector organization study (paragraphs 30, 34 and 39);
(xi)  Before Bank disbursements are made for project works to
supply water by house connections to a given neighborhood
which lacks appropriate sewage disposal services, EAM will
present a program, acceptable to the Bank, for sewage disposal
in that area (paragraph 39);



ANNEX III
Page 3 of 4
(xii) It will conduct a study of the organizational arrangements
for water and sewerage services in Managua in order to
optimize the coordination of the different agencies involved
in providing these services. This study is to be made by
consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank and coordinated with DENACAL and such other agencies as
the Government may indicate. The consultants will develop
recommendations for the unification of services in one
company or for other appropriate arrangement and include the
analysis of the financing requirements for water and sewerage
and the meeting of these needs through tariffs or tariffs
plus a general "environmental tax" to be levied on the popu-
lation and used to finance some of future sewerage works,
especially those, like pollution control, which benefit the
whole population. This study should be presented to the
Bank for review not later than June 30, 1979 (paragraph 39);
(xiii) As a condition of effectiveness, it will employ suitable
consultants acceptable to the Bank to assist in final
design works, bidding document preparation, tender analysis
and construction supervision (paragraph 34);
(xiv) Before Bank loan effectiveness, a commercial loan for at
least US$1.9 million equivalent for the project will be
signed (paragraph 29); and
(xv) As a condition of effectiveness, the approximately C$6.5
million owed by the Government to EAM will be paid or set
off against Government loans in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank (paragraph 30).

needed for project component 6 (paragraph 27), sewage
disposal works under programs satisfactory to the Bank and
EAM (paragraph 39);
(ii) By June 30, 1978 and at all times thereafter, the Government
accounts receivable in EAM will not be in arrears for more
than two months (paragraph 30);
(iii) It will continue giving the Bank a reasonable opportunity
to exchange views on any future appointment to the post of
General Manager in EAM (paragraph 30);



ANNEX III
Page 4 of 4
(iv) Reasonable measures, satisfactory to the Bank, will be taken
to ensure that sewerage facilities are constructed in such a
manner as to avoid contamination of EAM's water sources
and that the project would be carried out with due regard to
ecological and environmental factors (paragraph 39);
(v) Before Bank disbursements are made for project works to install
water lines in each of the streets in the downtown area, the
Government will supply satisfactory evidence that the work
on that street has been undertaken (paragraph 27); and
(vi) It will establish, and cause EAM to establish, a system of
charges acceptable to the Bank for users of private wells
(paragraph 33).
