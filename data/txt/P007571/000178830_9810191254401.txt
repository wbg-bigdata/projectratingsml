I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
1.01      Mexico has shortages of skilled and technical workers which are
expected to become more acute as industrial development accelerates and
which could seriously impair economic growth. Skilled manpower requirements
are growing faster than overall employment requirements because of signifi-
cant labor shifts from agriculture to industry and because of the productivity
gains expected. While precise estimates of technical and skilled manpower
requirements are not available, the order of magnitude of these estimates
indicates that current requirements exceed the supply by ten-fold and the
shortfall is steadily increasing.
1.02      Mexico has a successful, long-term record of economic growth. From
1940 to the early 1970s, the economy grew at an average of 6% in real terms,
while inflation was kept below an annual rate of 5%. In the early 1970s,
economic disorders such as high inflation, large public deficits, extensive
unemployment coupled with shortages of skilled manpower, capital flight and
balance-of-payments problems, slowed down the growth of GDP and brought the
economy to virtual stagnation in 1975. Drastic economic measures in 1976 and
1977 quickly restored economic equilibrium. Subsequent oil discoveries have
helped to restore confidence and economic growth. In the last three years,
the economy has grown at more than 7% in real terms and employment at 4% or
more.
1.03      The 1980-82 Global Development Plan sets as targets a 4.2% annual
employment rate and 8% annual economic growth. These annual growth targets
reflect the different emphasis placed on each sector: 4.1% for the farming
and forestry sector, 10.8% for the industrial sector as a whole (with a 13.5%
for the production of capital goods), and 6.7% for the service sector.
Domestic investment, strongly supported by oil revenues, is growing rapidly.
Public investment is growing at an annual rate of 14% in real terms, and will
reach an estimated total of 1978-constant Mex$1,476 billion (i.e., US$65
billion) for the period 1977-82. The anticipated annual rates of expansion of
public investment by sector, in real terms and according to the 1980-82 Global
Development Plan, are 22% for the agricultural and rural development sector,
17% for the industrial sector (excluding oil industry, targetted to grow at an
annual rate of 13.9%), 18% for transport and communications, and 21% for
investments in social sectors. Private investment, mainly concentrated in
the industrial sector, is also expected to increase at an annual rate of 13%.
The Plan also introduced a long-term perspective. If short-term employment
and productivity challenges can be met, the real per capita income could
triple in the next 20 years. In addition, 20 million more people, double the
current number, would enter the labor force, and industry would represent 45%
of GDP.
1.04      The projected rates of economic growth would impose an accelerated
demand for skilled workers and technicians that far exceeds expected outputs
from the training system, thereby creating an acute shortage of skilled and
technical workers. The magnitude and momentum of this demand far exceeds
overall employment rates largely because of sectoral shifts. Table 1.1
records the sectoral patterns of the labor force from 1950 to 1980. While



-2 -
overall employment growth has been 4% per year over the last decade, employ-
ment in the primary sector has slightly diminished, and the industrial and
service sectors have expanded at the rate of 6.1 and 6.4%, respectively.
These shifts are important because while in 1970 there were about 2% of
skilled workers and technicians in agriculture, there were about 20% skilled
workers and technicians in the industrial sector. Since employment in the
industrial and service sectors is growing faster than the average, and the
proportion of technicians and skilled workers is much higher, the demand of
skilled manpower is growing faster than overall employment.

1.05      In addition, the demand of skilled workers and technicians is also
determined by expected productivity gains, which require a higher concentra-
tion of skills in the occupational profile of each particular industry or
sector targetted for gains. Taking these factors into consideration (Table
1.2), the economy would require about 2.7 million of skilled workers and tech-
nicians in 1985 and 3.6 million in 1990. Allowing for a 2% attrition rate in
the labor force, the average annual requirements would be over 145,000 skilled
workers and technicians to 1985, and an annual average of 176,000 from 1986
to 1990. These figures greatly surpass the output capacity of the regular
technical training system. From 1975 to 1978, output has been estimated at
less than 10,000 skilled workers and technicians per year (para 2.06). Thus,
the magnitude of the shortage of skilled workers and technicians in Mexico is
so great that it exceeds the actual supply by ten times and approaches 100,000
per annum.

-4-
1.06      The projected shortage of skilled workers and technicians would
have serious economic consequences if not alleviated. It would be difficult
for industry to meet the planned 10% annual increase in production and even
more difficult to remain competitive in international markets. Scarcity of
technicians and skilled workers has already been identified as a major contri-
buting factor to the current 30% inflation rate for 1980, which is about
double the international rate. It is unrealistic to expect agriculture to
grow even at the modest target rate of 4% per annum, without substantial
upgrading of its labor force, given that farm employment has remained almost
stationary and future growth would need to be based mainly on productivity
increases. Solutions to the current transport bottlenecks or the maintenance
of an efficient telecommunications network (targetted to grow at 9.5%) would
be difficult without adequate numbers of skilled workers and technicians.
Health and other basic services to people or industry cannot be provided, much
less expanded, without this integral component of the labor force. From this
perspective, reducing and eliminating the shortage of skilled workers and
technicians seems vital to economic growth and development.
II. MIDDLE-LEVEL TECHNICAL TRAINING
2.01      The Mexican general education system is well developed and reasonably
financed, but there are major deficiencies in technical training at the middle
level. Its output is numerically insufficient for the country's manpower
needs and is defective in quality.
Overview of the Education System
2.02      Mexico's system of general education is strong.  It has good co-
verage, relatively good efficiency and adequate numbers of students reach
higher levels. There are 2.2 million students enrolled in all the levels
of education, which are equivalent to more than 70% of 6-24 age bracket, an
unusually high percentage for Latin America. Trained teachers and textbooks
are plentiful. At the primary level (grades 1-6), the net enrollment rate
reached 98% in 1980, up from 78% ten years ago. Internal efficiency 1/ has
improved from less than 60% in 1971 to more than 75% in 1979. A free textbook
program is well developed; more than 86 million books were distributed in 1979.
Virtually all teachers are trained. At the lower secondary level (grades 7-9),
first year enrollment represents 86% of all those who finished the primary
level in 1980. Secondary enrollments tripled during 1970-80, growing at 11%
per year. Its internal efficiency has remained high at about 85% for the same
period.  The upper secondary level (grades 10-12) is heterogeneous, including
22 different kinds of schools (Table 2.1). General upper secondary, which
makes up two-thirds of the enrollments, has increased 400% in the last twelve
years (growing at a rate of 15% per year). The teacher training institutions
at this level are of good academic quality and efficient (i.e., as high as
1/   Internal efficiency is the ratio of the actual output, i.e., graduates,
measured in student years, to the maximum possible output, i.e., gra-
duates if there would not have been any wastage (due to repetition or
dropout) of the number of student-years financed.



-5-
90% internal efficiency). Higher education (grades 13-17) received 270,000
first-year students in 1980, or virtually all those who completed upper
secondary education the previous term. Higher education includes several
public and private universities of high quality such as the National Poly-
technic Institute (IPN) and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and have
grown at 12% per year. Enrollments in technical subjects represent 45%,
a reasonable balance. In 1980, about 28,000 graduates received higher degrees
in engineering, exact sciences and technological fields.
2.03      The Mexican Government also makes a reasonable effort to finance
education. In 1978, the Federal Government spent Mex$85 billion on education
and training, i.e., 17% of actual budget expenditures.  This amount was about
4% of the GDP in 1978, representing a substantial increase over the 3.3% in 1973.
State Governments and the private sector also spent significant amounts on
education, bringing total education expenditures to about 5% of the GDP in
1978.
2.04      In contrast with these accomplishments, Mexico's system of technical
and vocational education is inadequate, particularly at the middle level. For
instance, despite a strong need for additional output in 1978, the number of
applicants to terminal technical training from ninth-grade graduates dwindled
from 10% to 7.5%, i.e., its lowest point in ten years. Moreover, student
completion rates 1/ for middle-level technical education ranged from 34% to
12% in about two-thirds of the training centers. Middle-level technical
education absorbed less than 2% of the education budget in 1978. In compara-
tive terms, the output of technicians at the middle level is about one-third
of the output of engineers and techr.icians at higher levels, whereas the ratio
of selected skilled workers and technicians to engineers should be about 5 to 1.
Middle-level Technical Training
2.05      The middle level is that segment of the education and training
system which has grade nine as an entrance requirement and has a d'uration of
two to three years (grades 10-12). The middle-level segment comprises four
basic categories (Table 2.1): academic, teacher training, dual-purpose
technical 2/ and terminal technical.
1/   Student completion rate, also known as terminal efficiency in Mexico, is
the percentage of initial student entrants who eventually complete this
three-year level.
2/   Dual-purpose technical programs has a mix of academic and terminal
programs which are supposed to prepare students both for entering into
the labor market and into higher education.

d/   Estimated; entrance in next-level teacher training institutions in 1979
was 13.1; it is also assumed that another 4.0 continued higher education.
2.06      The 22 different kinds of schools in the 4 basic categories of this
level seem to offer a wide variety of choices. The choice is more apparent
than real, since there is no diversification effect. The final purpose of the
academic category is to gain access to higher education. Moreover, 90% of the
graduates of the dual-purpose technical category also gained access to higher
education in 1978 according to official estimates. In total, over 210,000



- 7 -
graduates continued to higher education and only about of 23,000 graduates
joined the labor force (Table 2.1). If teachers are excluded, the number of
graduates with technical and vocational training joining the labor force was
only 9,600.
2.07      Until 1978, the middle-level, exclusively terminal, technical pro-
gram was represented basically by the Centros de Estudios Tecnologicos (CETs).
The CET program was created in 1968 and, up to 1978, it had only 17 schools,
the majority (12) concentrated in Mexico City. Its 5,000 graduates were the
most important contribution to the supply of skilled workers and technicians.
There were also two minor programs to prepare technical instructors with
one single school each (ENAMACTI and ENAMACTA).
Major Issues in Middle-Level Technical Training
2.08      Substantial changes are needed to address the. following major issues
in the system of middle-level technical training:
(a)  Insufficient Output.  Excluding teachers, the effective number of
graduates joining the labor force in 1978 was 9,600; the estimated
demand for skilled workers and lower-level technicians that year was
about 130,000. 1/ Thus, the output of middle-level technical
training was less than 10% of the estimated demand. Four factors
contributed to this shortfall:
(i)  insufficient number of applicants to terminal and dual-
purpose tecniical training.  !Li 1978, for instance, out of
more than 500,000 ninth-grade graduates only about 39,000
applied for entry into these types of training. Moreover,
trends up to 1978 showed a steady decrease in this proportion
because most of the students sought admissions to academic
streams and higher levels;
(ii) low completion rates in terminal training. According to
a 1978 survey by the Ministry de Education, an average of
only 25% of the students out of every 100 entrants eventually
graduated in the two-thirds of the centers surveyed. This is
because many students used terminal education as a waiting bay
for transfer to academic or dual-purpose programs;
(iii) low proportion of graduates joining the labor force. It is
estimated that nearly 90% of the graduates of dual-purpose
training programs decided to proceed with higher studies
rather than join the labor force; and
(iv) insufficient training opportunities in several regions and
states, resulting in regional imbalances. For instance, the
proportion of vocational and technical training places in the
1/   The gap of middle-level skilled manpower was filled with (a) highly
trained technicians, who were over-qualified; and (b) insufficiently
trained technicians, who received only informal training.



-8 -
Central Northern and Central Western regions (14 million
people) is about half of the national average, while the
Federal District (9.4 million people) has proportionally
five times as many training places as those regions. Highly
industrialized areas, such as Monterrey, also lack middle-
level vocational training opportunities: for instance, the
State of Nuevo Leon, where Monterrey is located, has only
about 0.53 of the national average.
(b)  Poor quality.  The quality of middle-level technical training
tends to be poor because it is lacking in practical content.
Theory is generally well taught but there is insufficient emphasis
on practical applications and know-how (in 1978, only 10% of the
weekly schedule). Poor quality in training results from:
(i) academically qualified teachers, who lack experience in
business and industry, and are prone to lecture rather than
follow a practical approach to training;
(ii) frequently inadequate supply of materials for effective develop-
ment of practical skills. While equipment is generally not
lacking, it is inappropriate particularly in the dual-purpose
schools. This is because it has been selected without appro-
priate consultation with industry or equipment specialists,
and the academic bias is paramount;
(iii) an irrelevant curriculum that has been developed without appro-
priate consultation with the productive sectors. There are
too many training specialties (more than 80 in two particular
programs) which do not match skill profiles in industry.
Training content is not standardized among the different types
of schools; and
(iv) absence of student evaluation, placement services and follow-up.
(c) Unresponsiveness to development needs. The management of changes
in middle-level technical education has proved to be difficult.
This is because of the unwieldy fragmentation of programs (up to 12)
and authority (4 General Directors and 27 regional authorities). A
Coordinating Council was created in January 1979 to improve manage-
ment, but has little effect because of (a) lack of timely and
appropriate information and (b) administrative complexities of the
problem. For instance, the Teachers' Union has had the right to
appoint up to 50% of all teacher and school administrator vacancies
regardless of minimum qualifications.

III. THE CONALEP TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAM
Introduction
3.01      By the late 1970s, it was evident that the middle-level technical
training system was inadequate to deliver the quantity and quality of skilled
workers and technicians required by the rapidly changing economy. Moreover,
the prospects were poor for sufficient expansion and upgrading through the
traditional system. Therefore in 1978 the Government thoroughly studied
existing programs of training and concluded that it would be desirable to
create a new, independent program to provide terminal training for substantial
numbers of skilled workers and lower-level technicians. As a result of the
study, the President of the Republic issued a decree in December 1978 creating
a decentralized, semi-autonomous public agency named the Colegio Nacional de
Educacion Profesional y Tecnica (CONALEP). 1/
Definition and Distinguishing Features
3.02      The CONALEP program is designed to train skilled workers and lower-
level technicians through terminal programs at the upper secondary level
(grades 10-12) or equivalent, in close cooperation with the productive sector
and in a variety of agricultural, industrial and service training programs.
It differs from other middle-level technical training programs on the follow-
ing counts:
(a) It is semi-autonomous; this facilitates its responsiveness to
changing needs and participation of the productive sector, e.g.
it can receive donations from industry;
(b) its administration is decentralized so that operational decisions,
including curriculum adaptations, are delegated to local training
authorities and their advisory boards;
(c) its curriculum has a practical orientation and strong emphasis upon
evaluation, follow-up and feedback;
(d) its training programs are strictly terminal and job-market oriented;
(e) its unique student recruitment approach enhances the program's
public image and encourages the active support of the productive
sector;
(f) students pay a tuition proportional to their training costs; and
(g) its instructors are from industry, work only part-time and cannot
belong to the Teachers' Union because CONALEP is not their main
employer.
1/   In 1980, the Government took another important step by making it mandatory
for employers to provide on-the-job training, either directly or through
general training programs registered with the Ministry of Labor and
Social Welfare. CONALEP has met that registration requirement.

Objectives
3.03      The program objectives are:
(a) to expand the output of middle-level technical training by creating, in
close cooperation with the productive sectors and in the quantities
required by the economy, a large network of terminal training
centers;
(b) to improve the quality of middle-level technical training by
emphasizing a practical curriculum, relevant to changing regional
and sectoral needs; and
(c) to increase the efficiency of middle-level training by enhancing its
public image, achieving higher retention rates and decentralizing
training opportunities.
Program Description
3.04      Administration.  The CONALEP training program has three levels of
administration -central, regional and local. At the central level, the Board
of Governors determines policy. This Board comprises seven members from business
and industrial leaders who are appointed by the Minister of Education to serve
staggered terms.  The President of the Republic appoints the Director General of
CONALEP, who also chairs the Board. A committee consisting of other business
and industrial leaders from the various regions advises the Board. The
Director General who is also the chief administrative officer of CONALEP, can
serve a maximum of two four-year terms and is assisted by the seven directors
of planning, operations and teacher training, buildings and equipment, evalua-
tion and certification, administration and finance, legal affairs, and publ:ic
relations (Annex 3). Each directorate, with some exception for the planning
directorate, is well-staffed with qualified and experienced staff and support
personnel.
3.05      At the regional level, six regional coordinators who report directly
to the Director General, coordinate local training programs. These coordina-
tors are responsible for promoting and coordinating school-industry relations,
the continuous relevance of local training programs to manpower needs and the
identification of additional training needs for future development.
3.06      At the local level, the director of each training center is the
chief administrative officer. A committee comprised of local and regional
business, industry personnel and representatives of instructional staff and
students, advises the director on training matters. The center director is
assisted by coordinators of training programs and administrative services.
3.07      The CONALEP program is being advocated through radio, television,
national and local newspapers, and high-quality brochures. This promotion
campaign is successfully directed towards business, industry, parents, poten-
tial students, and the general public. It emphasizes the important role of
skilled workers and technicians in economic and social development, describes
the CONALEP training program (including details of available courses of



- 11 -
study), the employment opportunities and the job placement system. Eighty
percent of CONALEP students are enrolled in the program because of this
multimedia campaign. The large amount of assistance CONALEP receives from
business and industry also indicates the success of this innovative idea for
improving the public image of technical training.
3.08        Training Centers and Programs of Study.  CONALEP's training
programs are carried out in centers dispersed throughout the country. By
January 1981, 10 training centers had been completed and 52 additional centers,
ranging in size from 400-2,000 students in two shifts, were in various stages
of completion and partially operational in temporary facilities. The enroll-
ments, programs of study and location of centers are determined on the basis
of national, regional and local development plans. Current enrollments of
full and part-time students, in both day and evening shifts totals about
19,000 in the following broad fields of training:
Table 3.1: ENROLLMENTS BY MAJOR TRAINING FIELD
Enrollment
Field of Training                          October 1980
Agriculture and Food Processing                  770
Industry and Construction                    13,500
Textiles                                         360
Business and Commerce                         3,900
Health                                           390
Total Enrollments                       19,000
3.09      Enrollment is open to qualified students who have completed grade
nine. The evening shift is also open to employed youth and adults who are
considered to have an equivalent level of education. Because of the severe
lack of equipment, programs of instruction currently consist, in many in-
stances, of theory classes taught in the training centers and practical
activities conducted in nearby business and industrial facilities. This is
an unsatisfactory situation but one which is justifiable for the moment.
3.10      Experienced subject-matter specialists, assisted by specialists from
business and industry, develop all curricula and course syllabi. Thus far,
19 specific training programs have been developed in five broad fields with
supporting curricula and course materials, under the supervision of the
central directorate of operations and teacher training. Instructors and the
advisory members from local industry adapt the basic course syllabi to
regional requirements. The resulting curricula and course syllabi are well-
balanced, with an average distribution of 15% for general theory, 35% for
technical theory and 50% for technical practice.
3.11       Instructor Characteristics and Preparation.  Experienced and fully
qualified teachers teach all general subjects. Technicians and practical
engineers, having at least five years of experience, are recruited on a



- 12 -
part-time basis (10 hours/week) to teach the technical theory and work-shop
classes. They receive a higher hourly wage than those from institutions
under the Ministry of Education. Local industry has expressed its cooperation
in making such staff available as appropriately equipped training centers
become available. Preparation of these instructors is being carried out by
CONALEP through its own teacher training unit. Eight fultime, qualified
and experienced professional teacher trainers comprise the training unit,
which is assisted by qualified part-time trainers, on a contract basis.
3.12       The instructor training program consists of both regularly sche-
duled pre-service courses and ad-hoc in-service courses. Additionally, in
special instances, programmed courses are offered by correspondence. The
pre-service courses consist of 56 hours of pedagogical preparation, including
14 hours of practice teaching, and are conducted in either CONALEP's rented
(and poorly equipped) facilities in Mexico City or, at the regional level,
in temporary facilities in local training centers. The minimum in-service
training consists of 64 hours of human relations, instructional methodology,
modular curriculum preparation and shopwork organization and management.
Additional in-service course work of up to 130 hours is provided for the
upgrading of specialized technical skills. The curriculum and course syllabi
for the instructor training courses are well developed according to modern
pedagogical practice.
3.13       About 1,500 instructors (about 1,000 for industry and 500 for
business training) were employed during 1980-81 in the 62 training centers
partially operational at that time. About 2,000 instructors are currently
enrolled in pre-service courses and another 1,450 in in-service courses.
3.14       Student Evaluation and Placement.  Student evaluation, follow-up
and feedback are joint functions of the local training centers and the na-
tional Directorate of Evaluation and Certification. This directorate has a
well-qualified staff consisting of 10 professionals and adequate numbers of
support personnel. It is currently developing and distributing instruments
to evaluate instructor and student performance. Evaluation of instructors
includes formal self-evaluation, as well as evaluation by both students and
supervisors. As the existing centers have not yet graduated students, current
emphasis is on evaluation of instructor and student performance and in tracking
job placement of dropouts. However, follow-up instruments for assessing job
performance are being prepared for utilization with the first group of
students graduating in 1983. The Director is also assisting the local centers
in the proper use and evaluation of these instruments and in the feed-back of
relevant information into the curricula and the teaching-learning process.
Each training center, with the assistance of its local advisory committee and
the regional training coordinator, has the responsibility of assessing the
relevance of training as measured by the job performance of its graduates.
This information will be returned to the  local instructors and to the subject
matter specialists at the national level for use in improving curricula and
course syllabi.
3.15      In terms of qualitative abilities, graduates are expected to be able
to perform, after a short period of on-the-job orientation and training, as
medium-level skilled workers or as lower level technicians. Many of them



- 13 -
should be able to advance to the level of highly-skilled workers and medium-
level technicians after 3-5 years on the job. Job placement of all graduates
is the responsibility of the local center administration, with the assistance
of the local advisory committee and the regional training coordinator.
Financing
3.16      The allocation of the Federal Government to the CONALEP program for
1981 is Mex$1,171 million (US$50 million), or about 0.7% of the recurrent
budget for the Ministry of Education. The anticipated official allocation
for 1982 is Mex$1,854 million (US$79 million). In addition to federal funds,
CONALEP is empowered to receive funds from the productive sector. CONALEP
has made use of this capability and continues making contractual agreements
with state governments and various industries. Total contributions and
contracts from December 1979 to January 1981 amounted to an equivalent of
Mex$1,500 million (US$64 million). Most of these contributions are in kind:
i.e., in the form of construction sites, rent-free buildings and specialized
equipment donations. Finally, CONALEP's students also pay tuition and commit
themselves to a deferred payment upon graduation and employment. The tuition,
which is equivalent to one-tenth of the average training costs, is being paid
in ten monthly installments of about US$10 per month and the deferred commit-
ment, which carries no interest and has a five-year term, has a present value
of about US$725. In some cases, employees would pay this deferred tuition.
3.17      CONALEP's unit recurrent costs are reasonable.  Recurrent costs
in 1980 were Mex$23,900 (about US$1,000) per student-year; which is about
Mex$15,000 at 1978 constant prices. While technical training unit costs vary
widely in Mexico, the unweighted average for the upper middle level in 1978
was Mex$15,340 pesos per student-year, and the unit costs for basic training
were even higher: Mex$25,000 in 1978.
Assessment of Strengths and Weaknesses
3.18      Strengths.  Despite its relatively short existence, the CONALEP
technical training program has been established on a sound basis, appropriately
addresses the issues of the sub-sector, is well designed and is being rapidly
implemented. Among its more important strengths are those of:
(a)  a well organized and staffed administration, with a clear and
appropriate division of authority and responsiblity between the
national, regional and local administrative levels;
(b)  the practical orientation of its curriculum which is terminal
in nature and kept relevant to local, regional and national needs
through inputs from industrial advisory groups at the national and
local level;
(c)  the use of industrially experienced and pedagogically qualifed
instructors; and
(d)  a highly successful promotional program resulting in contributions
from industry and state governments and the attraction of 80% of the
students in the first year program.



- 14 -
3.19      Weakness.  The CONALEP program has a number of deficiences which
must be addressed. Its expansion program is proceeding at a rapid pace but it
is currently out-of-phase with other aspects of a successful program. Among
its more critical needs are those of:
(a) the physical consolidation of its national administration in a
central location to alleviate the constraints on communications,
coordination and administrative efficiency caused by the direc-
torates being currently housed in inadequate accommodations in five
separate areas of the city;
(b) adequately equipping the 62 training centers which are either
completed or under development;
(c) improving the retention rates of its first-year students over
the 35% dropout experienced during the first year of the program's
operation (1979-80). A major contributing factor to this high
desertion rate is the currently strong industrial demand for
employees with even minimal levels of skill training. It is also
due to the lack of sufficient and appropriate equipment, the
temporary nature of its workshops, the lack of sufficient industrial
instructors in some programs, the financial needs of students and,
perhaps, an unrefined student selection process;
(d) improving the recruitment and preparation of instructors, parti-
cularly for morning-shift classes which were problematic in the
first year of operation;
(e) improving the long-term planning capabilities of its planning
directorate and completing the 1983-88 plan for program expansion,;
and
(f) introducing flexible length of courses so as to respond quickly to
changes in labor market demands.
Development Plans
3.20      CONALEP's development plans are in a formative stage, but they
indicate two phases: 1979-83 and 1984-88. The broad dimensions of these
phases are as follows:
Table 3.2: CONALEP: DEVELOPMENT PLAN PARAMETERS a/
Phase I               Phase II

a/   All Phase II data are cummulative, except investment estimates.



- 15 -
3.21      The first phase program is well defined.  Planning has not yet
started on the second phase. CONALEP intends to upgrade the capabilities
of its Directorate of Planning in the areas of manpower needs assessment,
strategic policy analysis and cost analysis.
3.22      The top priority of Phase I is to establish a firm administrative
base for the effective management of the system. Strong staffing and orga-
nizational design have already been achieved (para. 3.17), but CONALEP's
Directorates are physically dispersed. Therefore, during Phase I a central
administrative and support complex will be established. The complex will also
include instructor training facilities, teaching materials development and
production, information and documentation system, and an auditorium. The
establishment of this complex will enable CONALEP to improve its administra-
tive efficiency, including better communications and coordination, expand and
improve teacher training activities and better support its production of
teaching materials.
3.23      Another immediate priority in the first phase is to equip the ten
training centers which are completed and the 52 currently under construction.
Additionally, plans call for expansion through the construction, furnishing,
and equipping of 36 new training centers and the equipping of a special
training center having combined enrollments of about 24,900 regular and 1,000
special students. This would increase total enrollment capacities in 99
training centers to about 70,000 by 1985-86. These training centers would be
located throughout the country in accordance with skilled manpower demand.
3.24      The large instructor requirements (Table 3.3) of the expanded
training system call for the expansion and improvement of the instructor
recruitment and training system.

a/   Estimated from enrolments in Table 4.3, para. 4.11.
The staffing of the 62 training centers currently under development and
the 37 new centers planned for 1983 (to be fully operational in 1985) requires
about 4,100 additional instructors, who need to be trained during the 1981-85
period. Instructor attrition will require that about 800 new instructors be



- 16 -
trained annually after the 99 first-phase training centers are fully opera-
tional. Plans call for the inclusion of accommodations and equipment for a
instructor training center within the central headquarters complex and improved
equipment for the regional ad-hoc instructor training program.
3.25      The above plans are expected to require capital outlays of about
US$220 million over the first phase (1979-83). Approximately US$27 million,
or 12%, has already been expended. The second phase is expected to require
capital outlays in the order of about US$400 million. Its size and shape is
contingent upon further refinement of manpower estimates.
IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The proposed project would help CONALEP to improve and complete
its first-phase training plan through 1983. The specific project objectives
are:
(a)  to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the central
administration by providing facilities for teacher training,
development of instructional materials, supervision of operations,
information and documentation, and central administrative support
services;
(b)  to increase the output of skilled workers and technicians by expanding
existing capacity by an additional 50,000 students and by providing
appropriate equipment for a total of about 70,000 students;
(c)  to improve the quality of instruction by upgrading and expanding
instructor training, emphasizing the practical approach,, evaluation,
follow-up and feedback; and
(d)  to improve the quality of its 1983-88 long-term plan by including
reliable manpower estimates, cost-reduction measures, and strategic
training alternatives.
Components and Description
4.02      The proposed project, in supporting the entire first phase of
CONALEP-s development program, would consist of the following components and
institutions, which are to be fully operational by December 1983:

Instructional and Administrative Support Complex
4.03      The eight administrative and supervisory directorates of CONALEP
are currently located in rented and inadequate facilities in five widely
dispersed locations in Mexico City (para. 3.18). Bringing all of the direc-
torates together with the general directorate in a central location, would
improve communications, coordination and administrative efficiency. The
complex would consist of centers for instructor training, instructional
materials production, information and documentation, and administrative
services. The project would finance the construction and equipping of this
complex comprising about 10,900 square meters of space. The government would
finance the furniture needs.
4.04       The additional space available would permit an expansion and
further development of the instructional and administrative services as
detailed in the following paragraphs. During negotiations CONALEP has
provided assurances that, at Bank's request, the annual work programs for
the instructor training center, the instructional materials production center,
and the information and documentation center would be sent to the Bank for
review and comment.

4.05      Instructor Training Center.  The proposed instructor training center
would enable CONALEP to prepare the 4,100 additional instructors needed before
1985. It would occupy about 1,500 square meters. It would include a small
reference library, offices, classrooms, projection rooms, a model industrial
shop and a model business office, and service facilities. Because of the
critical importance of the demonstration technique in skills training programs,
these model shop and office facilities would enhance the instructor training
program. The current instructor training staff (para. 3.11 to 3.13) is ade-
quate in quantity and quality for the operation of the proposed expanded
program. It includes part-time professional staff available on an ad-hoc
basis from other teacher training institutions.
4.06      Instructional Materials Production Center.  The instructional
materials production program, currently operating in inadequate rented faci-
lities, requires expanded facilities and more appropriate equipment. The
proposed instructional materials production center would provide about 1,500
square meters of space. This would include offices; photographic facilities;
art and composition rooms; print shop; and audio recording, service and
distribution facilities. The current technical and support staff-consists of
six members.  It would be increased to include sufficient numbers of printers,
technical illustrators, photographers, audio-visual specialists, and support
personnel to handle the required annual volume of materials. Based on re-
cruitment goals and total enrollments, its annual production would exceed
100,000 pieces of promotional literature, 200,000 shop job sheets, 70,000
laboratory manuals and other items. The basic materials for production would
be prepared by the public relations staff, subject-matter specialists, teacher
trainers, business and industry consultants, and training center instructors.
Appropriate inputs would also be made by the technical and production personlel
of the center. Distribution of instructional materials would be through the
local training centers.
4.07      Information and Documentation Center.  The major objective of this
center would be to provide an efficient system for the recording, analysis
and retrieval of relevant data on: labor market trends; student enrollment
and progression, training performance, job placement and follow-up; medium
and long-term program planning; inventory control; and financial management.
The proposed center would require about 3,330 square meters of total space.
It would consist of facilities and equipment for offices, conference rooms,
planning rooms, reference library, programming rooms, central computer
room, storage and services. A small business-type computer and peripheral
equipment would be installed. The center would be staffed by a center
director, a computer system analyst, one or more programmers, a computer
operator and support personnel. It would be administered by the office of
the general director and would be governed by a board consisting of the heads
of the respective directorates. Each of the directorates would have access to
the central computing center. Additionally, the project would provide access
to a small computer and appropriate peripheral equipment for each of the six
regional coordinators of the CONALEP program.
4.08      Administrative Services Center.  The proposed center would provide a
total of about 4,630 square meters of space and a small amount of equipment to
consolidate physically the widely dispersed staff (para. 3.19) of the central



- 19 -
administrative directorate and the seven directorates. In addition to the
administrative offices, meeting rooms, accounting rooms and services, this
center would contain the main technical library for the central complex and an
auditorium.
Technical Training Centers
4.09       The project would enable CONALEP to complete the first phase of
its technical training program, the project would finance the equipment
requirements for the 10 training centers now completed and partially opera-
tional, the 52 training centers currently in various stages of construction
(paras. 3.08, 3.09 and 3.23) and the 37 new training centers to be operational
in 1983-84. The 37 training centers would be constructed and furnished from
local funds.
4.10      The 99 training centers would be widely distributed throughout the
national territory. The distribution by natural regions is as follows:

1/   CONALEP's estimates, assuming a 20% dropout rate.
It is expected that about 30% of the training places would be held by women.,
4.12      The curricula, which are more fully discussed under paras. 3.08 to
3.10, are complete for the first 62 centers. Course syllabi for the first- and
second-year programs are complete for all programs of study and the third-year
syllabi are under development. The curricula for the 37 new centers would
be basically the same as for the first 62 centers and no major changes are
required.
4.13      When fully operational in 1985-86, the 99 training centers would
require a total of about 5,550 instructors, or about 4,100 additional ones
over those curtently employed (para. 3.23). It is not expected to be easy
to recruit and train this number over the four-year period of 1981-84, but
CONALEP is expanding and upgrading its instructor training programs and
recruitment procedures (paras. 3.11, 3.13 and 4.14) to facilitate the solution
of this problem.



- 21 -
4.14      Trained manpower for the highly skilled and advanced machinist
and tool and die-making trades are in very short supply for the more tech-
nologically advanced industries (para. 3.23). The project would finance the
equipment needs for a special training center for this purpose in Mexico City.
The center would have a capacity of 500 adults in each of two 24-week courses
each year. However, provision is made for courses of shorter lengths according
to individual needs. Entrance would be limited to experienced adults who can
demonstrate a high level of skill on regular machine tools. Course syllabi
and shop job-sheets would be mainly supplied by the manufacturers of the
specialized machine tools used in the program. An industrial advisory com-
mittee for the program would assist in the continuing adaptation of training
exercises to current manufacturing conditions. The 80 instructors required for
this specialized program would be recruited from industry under cooperative
arrangements on a part-time basis.
4.15      Criteria for the Creation of New Centers.  CONALEP has developed
criteria (Annex 4) concerning the eligibility requirements for the creation
of future training institutions to be developed under the project, and,
jointly with the Bank, has developed guidelines for the allocation of equip-
ment funds. New Centers would be established on the basis of economic need,
feasibility and economic efficiency. These criteria are reasonable and
acceptable to the Bank. They would serve to ensure timely and efficient
achievement of program objectives and provide for an equitable allocation of
loan funds between and within training institutions. During negotiations,
CONALEP has provided assurances that, unless otherwise agreed in advance
with the Bank, the expansion of existing training centers and the location of
new training centers financed under t'ie project would be in accordance with
the agreed criteria.
Further Development Plans
4.16      Planning the further development of CONALEP is critical to its
long-term success. During negotiations, CONALEP has agreed to provide to
the Bank, at Bank's request, a draft of its development plan to 1988 for
review and comment. This plan, which would be ready before March 31, 1983,
would include:
(a)  estimates of demand for skilled workers and technicians by industry,
occupation and geographical area;
(b)  an analysis of program policy recommendations, including shorter
training programs to respond quickly to changing needs;
(c)  CONALEP's expansion plans, including enrollments, outputs, and
instructor requirements by training program and geographical
distribution; and
(d)  facilities and capital investment requirements; and recurrent-
cost projections, including a timetable of measures to reduce the
high recurrent unit costs of small centers.

Preparation of Future Projects
4.17      The project would also include funds for preparation of a future
project for the further development of the CONALEP program and would utilize
to the extent necessary the technical assistance included in the project.

5.03      Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works and furniture costs
for the project are based upon unit prices derived from current contracts
in Mexico and detailed estimates of other projects of similar nature. They
are adjusted to reflect regional variations. Professional fees and site
development costs are not calculated separately. Construction would follow
detailed standard modular plans by size and type of training center. Equip-
ment costs are derived from preliminary and final lists. Cost estimates do
not include any identifiable duties or taxes.
5.04      Comparison of Unit Cost Estimates.  The unit area and unit capital
cost estimates are shown in Table 5.3. They are generally comparable to
similar projects in the Bank and in the Latin America and Caribbean Region.

d/   For similar projects in Argentina, El Salvador and Uruguay.
5.05      Contingency Allowances.  The program cost includes a physical
contingency allowance equal to 5% of the estimated baseline costs for all
construction and furniture of those buildings constructed after February
1981, and 10% for equipment. About 70% of the total costs of construction
would be done after February 1981 and physical and price increase calcula-
on construction and furniture are based upon this amount. Project costs
also include price increase contingencies on base costs plus physical
contingencies beginning in January 1981 for construction and furniture
and beginning July 1, 1981, for equipment. In view of differences in
prevailing rates of price escalation for local and international market
prices, price increases for civil works were calculated separately for
local and foreign costs. Expected price increases during implementation
are estimated as follows:

a/   It is assumed that price increases for equipment, to be effective,
will follow international price trends since they are to be
procured largely through ICB (para. 5.06(c)); i.e., local suppliers
will not be awarded contracts if their prices exceed international
competitive levels.
Accordingly, total price increases during the implementation period are
expected to be about 24% for construction and furniture and 13% for equip-
ment. Aggregated price increases are estimated at about 16.2% of baseline
costs plus physical contingencies and total contingencies are estimated to
be 22.4% of baseline costs.
5.06      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$104.6 million equivalent or about 49% of total program costs.
The calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the assumption
that (a) all construction and related professional services would be awarded
to local firms, (b) all furniture would be awarded to local suppliers, and
(c) all equipment, except for minimal amounts, would be awarded as a result
of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)
in which foreign suppliers participate. The resulting foreign content of each
category of expenditure was calculated at 18% for construction and furniture,
and 90% for equipment.
Recurrent Cost Implications
5.07      When fully operational in 1985-86, the recurrent costs of the
project are estimated in 1980-constant pesos at Mex$ 1,635 million (i.e.,
US$69.6 million), or only 40% higher than CONALEP's 1981 budget of Mex$1,171
million, capital expenditures excluded. CONALEP's future operating budget
represents about 1.1% of projected public recurrent expenditures on education
in 1983. Modifications under consideration by CONALEP, regarding the optimum
size 1/ of individual training centers could reduce the recurrent unit costs
of smaller centers by about 20%.  It is expected that these modifications
would be applied to a small number of the training centers operational in
1981-82 and about 75% of the number of new places added by 1983. In view of
the high priority of the proposed program, and the Government's strong commit-
ment to expanding output of technical manpower, it is expected that those
expenditures will be met.
1/   The analysis of the operational costs of different CONALEP centers
showed that per-student costs could be reduced 20% by replacing the
400-module center (two programs, two shifts) by the 600-module center
(three programs, two shifts).

Project Financing and Disbursement Plan
5.08      Financing.  The total project cost of US$215.1 million would be
financed as follows:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$90 million would finance about 42% of
total project costs, equivalent to about 86% of the foreign exchange
component; and
(b) the government would finance 58% of total project costs; equivalent
to 14% of the foreign costs plus all local costs.
To facilitate the early procurement of the equipment required for the training
centers to be operational in 1981-82, it is recommended that US$4.0 million of
retroactive financing be made available for equipment procured from February
1981 onwards.
5.09      Disbursements Plan.  The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed
over a period of about three years on the basis of:
(a) 100% of total expenditures for the construction of the
instructional and administrative support complex; and
(b) 100% of total costs for imported equipment, including cost of
installation where applicable; 100% of ex-factory costs for goods
locally produced, including cost of installation where applicable;
and 85% of local expenditures for off-the-shelf purchases.
These percentages would be adjusted as required, to assure continuing financing
for each category for the implementation period. -
5.10      The estimated schedule of disbursements by calendar and fiscal
years are:

Since this would be the first education project in Mexico,,there
is no specific disbursement profile with which to compare the above schedule.
The proposed disbursement schedule, however, exceeds substantially the
average disbursement performance of previous education projects in other
Latin American countries. This is justified by the advanced status of
preparation as indicated by the equipment bidding already in process
(Table 5.6).
Implementation, Procurement and Auditing
5.11      Project implementation would be managed effectively by the regular
CONALEP administration. The Director General would act as project director,
with the Director of Administration and Finance serving as project finance
officer, the Director of Buildings and Equipment handling all procurement, and
education and training matters being handled by the Director of Operations and
Teacher Training. No additional staffing would be required, except that
additional part-time help would be required during the equipment bid evalua-
tion periods. Budgetary arrangements have been made for this additional
staffing and no problem is expected in the recruitment of qualified assistants.
5.12      Standard modular plans, acceptable to the Bank, have been used
in constructing many of the existing centers and would be used for all the
planned centers. Civil works designs are complete for all extensions to
existing and new centers. Construction would be by competitive contracts.
Supervision of all new construction would be carried out by CAPFCE, a semi-
autonomous agency of the Government, which does all school building construc-
tion. CONALEP's construction will add only about 5% annually to the total
construction under CAPFCE; it is therefore not expected to strain the imple-
mentation capacity of CAPFCE. Sites for 24 of the 37 Centers to be inagurated
have been secured; no problems are expected for the remainder. The design for
the instructional and administrative support complex is underway and is expected
to be completed by August 1981 and would be sent to the Bank for review and
comment.
5.13      Implementation Schedule.  The construction, furnishing, and equipping
of all institutions is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1983 (Annex 7)
These schedules are considered to be reasonable, within the capacity of CONALEP
and CAPFCE, and would serve as the basis for monitoring program implementation.
Expected completion dates are listed in the following table for the critical
activities in program implementation. To allow sufficient time for submission
of final withdrawal applications, the Closing Date for the proposed loan would
be June 30, 1984.

* Activities already completed are in parenthesis.
5.14      Procurement.  Civil works total US$57 million (base line costs).
Work would be scattered over one hundred sites in the 31 states and the
Federal District. Except for the International and Administrativeb Support
Complex, none of the individual contract costs would be great enough to attract
foreign bidders. Mexico's construction industry is highly developed and capable
of executing works at costs competitive with international bidders. Construc-
tion contracts for the scattered training centers would be awarded on the
basis of LCB under normal government procedures. All new buildings are
constructed from standard modular plans acceptable to the Bank. Nearly all
sites have been acquired, and no problems are anticipated in this regard.
The contract for the Instructional and Administrative Support Complex (base
cost estimate of about US$5 million, paras. 4.03 and 4.08) would be awarded
on the basis of ICB procedures. On the basis of Bank experience, however,
it is unlikely that foreign construction firms would be interested in this
bidding.
5.15      Equipment costing about US$84 million would be procured mainly
through ICB. The lists, specifications and bidding documents for the first 62
training cente-rs have been developed with the assistance of induptry and have
been reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank. The remaining lists for the
other 37 schools would be nearly identical and need not be sent to the Bank
for prior approval. Because the first 62 training centers (40,000 students)
are to be fully or partially operational by October 1981, equi'pment procure-
ment under ICB and LCB (which are acceptable to the Bank) and in which foreign



- 30 -
firms would participate, needed to begin by April 1981. To help facilitate
early procurement for these schools, up to 15% of the total equipment costs
would be procured through LCB. The participation of sufficient numbers of
local and foreign suppliers (about 100 of which have offices in Mexico) is
expected to result in adequate competition to assure economic prices. Equip-
ment packages in excess of US$300,000 would be procured through ICB procedures.
Packages of between US$25,000 and US$300,000, not to exceed about US$13
million, would be procured through regular government procedures, which are
acceptable to the Bank. Small items or groups of items estimated to cost no
more than US$25,000, not to exceed a total of US$3.0 million, or items of a
specialized nature for which ICB or LCB would not be practical, would be
procured through local shopping. Under the above procedures it is expected
that about 82% of total value of equipment purchases would be procured through
ICB, 15% through LCB, and about 3% through local shopping.
5.16      Recommended contract awards for equipment would not be referred
to the Bank for prior review, but CONALEP would retain bid evaluations and
contracts for random ex post review by Bank staff during supervision missions.
These reviews would cover all contracts of more than US$300,000, which are
expected to comprise about 40% of the total value of all contracts. For the
purpose of comparing foreign and local bids, domestic manufacturers would be
allowed a margin of preference equal to the prevailing tariff or 15% of CIF
costs of imported goods, whichever is lower.
5.17      Auditing.  CONALEP has a Financial Directorate devoted to appropriate
recording and reporting of the program's financial transactions including
accounting and internal auditing control. It is adequately staffed with
experienced accounting personnel and its director has more than twenty years
of experience in this activity.  CONALEP is also to be audited by a private
firm, as required by the Mexican Government for all semi-autonomous agencies.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.18      Monitoring.  Efficient monitoring and careful supervision of
project implementation is essential for proper project implementation. As all
civil works would be the responsibility of CAPFCE, its own architects would
supervise the day to day design and construction of all buildings. CONALEP's
own architects would closely monitor actual progress in both design and
construction. Equipment and furniture procurement and installation is the
immediate responsibility of the Coordinator of Equipment and his staff, but is
closely monitored by the Director of Buildings and Equipment.  A well-designed
checklist for use in monitoring implementation of construction, furnishing and
equipping of each institution has been developed by CONALEP.
5.19        Evaluation.  The Directorate of Planning would coordinate the
activities of the directorates of evaluation and certification, buildings
and equipment, and operations and teacher training in evaluation of project
implementation and its impact on the manpower training system and socio-
economic development. This group would be assisted and advised by the
regional training coordinators and the industrial advisory committees.

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The proposed project would strengthen technical training at the
middle level. First, the proposed project would contribute to the institutional
development of CONALEP by bringing together widely dispersed directorates.
Thus, the agency's communication, coordination, and administrative efficiency
would be significantly advanced and its cooperative programs with the pro-
ductive sector reinforced. Second, the proposed project would enhance the
quality of training by: (a) providing the necessary equipment; (b) emphasizing
the practical aspects of training (50% of the weekly schedule); (c) furthering
CONALEP's instructor-training capability; and (d) expanding and improving the
production of instructional materials. The CONALEP program emphasizes an
effective evaluation and follow-up system, for which a special directorate has
been created. An active industrial advisory system at the national and local
levels would help assure the continuing relevance of the training programs.
Third, the output of skilled and technical workers from the 99 training centers
would help reduce the wide gap between supply and industrial demand.
6.02      The major quantifiable benefits of the program, when fully opera-
tional in 1985-86 would be an annual increase (or upgraded skills) of about:
(a) 20,000 skilled workers and lower-level technicians (of which 30% are
expected to be women); (b) 800 technical teachers; and (c) highly specialized
skills upgrading for about 1,000 employed workers and technicians. Assuming
that other formal training programs would increase their annual outputs to
20,000 by 1986, this would still leave an annual average requirement of
about 136,000 skilled workers to be met by further planned expansion of the
CONALEP and CET technical training programs, on-the-job training programs
and other sources of skilled workers.
Risks
6.03      The proposed loan entails some degree of risk, especially with
regard to the problems encountered in the recruitment of morning-shift
teachers and the high student desertion rate during the first year of
operation in 1980. A major contributing factor to this high desertion rate is
the currently strong industrial demand for employees with even minimal levels
of skill training.  However, the procurement and installation of appropriate
laboratory and shop equipment is expected to have a strong effect on both of
these problems. Additionally, the ability of CONALEP to pay higher salaries
than technical schools under the Ministry of Education should diminish the
problem of teacher recruitment. Therefore, a favorable student-teacher ratio
and the well-equipped facilities are expected to reduce these risks, and
result in appropriate levels of student retention (80% over the three years)
by the time the schools are fully operational. CONALEP intends to monitor
closely instructor and student retention, and to take prompt immediate action
should desertion levels remain high.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
and CONALEP that:
(a) the annual work programs for the instructor training center,
the instructional materials production center and the informa-
tion and documentation center would be sent to the Bank for
review and comment (para. 4.04);
(b) the expansion of existing training centers and the location
of new training centers financed under the project would be
in accordance with agreed criteria (para. 4.15); and
(c) the draft development plan to 1988 (para. 4.16) would be sent
to the Bank for review and comment.
7.02      Up to US$4.0 million of retroactive financing should be made avail-
able for equipment procured from February 1981 (para. 5.08).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Government of Mexico of US$90 million
equivalent, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of three years.

Criteria for Determining the Location and Size of New
Training Centers and Programs of Training
The Board of Governors of CONALEP would approve the establishment
of new training centers on the basis of their economic relevance, feasibility,
and economic efficiency. These criteria should be utilized in the feasibility
study of each new Center and should be the basis of the Board's decision.
The weight assigned to individual factors may vary to fit the Mexican situa-
tion. Detailed consideration of criteria is expected to include factors such
as:
(a) Economic Relevance Criteria. New training programs would be
established on the basis of the following factors:
(i) Economic Demand: Proposals for the establishment of new
training programs, or the expansion of existing ones, should
be based on an analysis of the relationship between national
employment needs and the output from current training programs;
(ii) Gainful Employment: The establishment of a Center in a
particular location where sustained employment opportunities
for skilled workers and technicians exist should have priority
over the locations where local employment opportunities do not
exist.
(b) Feasibility Criteria. The feasibility analysis would include the
following socioeconomic factors:
(i) Social Demand and Geo-Demographic Factors: Proposals for the
establishment of a Center in a given location should include
the availability of sufficient number of ninth-grade graduates
in the Center's area of influence and the lack of appropriate
training opportunities beyond such grade in the proposed area;
(ii) Instructor Availability: The proposal should also determine
whether a sufficient number of instructors are available
locally for the training specialties offered; otherwise, it
should include specific recommendations as to how the required
teachers could be obtained.
(iii) Cooperation of the Productive Sector: Explicit interest of
local authorities and leaders of the productive sector is a
determining factor in the success of the program. Thus,
offerings of a constructin site, building, equipment, partial
release of instructors, or any other physical or moral assistance
would be important factors in deciding on the establishment of
new Centers or training programs.

ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 2
(c) Economic Efficiency Criteria. In addition to the above criteria,
the analysis would include the following efficiency factors:
(i)  Economic Size:  Proposals for the opening or expansion of
training centers with less than 600 students should specify that
per-student recurrent costs would not be unreasonably high.
CONALEP's Board would fix the maximum acceptable ratio of these             t
costs in relation to CONALEP average unit costs.
(ii)  Minimum Class Size:  CONALEP should establish the minimum num-
ber of students allowed to run a program or course economically.
It would inquire periodically about the Centers' compliance
with this criterion and elicit remedial actions to avoid
excessive unit costs resulting from the operation of very
small classes.
(iii) Other Efficient Alternatives: Training unit costs could also
be reduced by establishing shorter training courses and by
expanding existing Centers with ad-hoc training activities as
required by the local productive sector. CONALEP would also
consider these alternatives periodically.
(d)  Transitional Criteria.  Project files contain a list of the 99 Cen-
ters that would be, or are, partially operational in accordance with
the above feasibility criteria, including agreements made with local
authorities and the productive sector. These 99 Centers, which
include 61 Centers with only 400 students, represent a total capacity
of 69,500 students in two shifts. For the purpose of the present
project:
(i)  the training centers with 400 students could be consolidated
into larger, more economically efficient units, as long as the
total capacity of the project is maintained at 69,500 students,
and new locations meet all the above criteria; and
(ii) the long-term plan (1984/88) would also address the means by
which the smaller Centers could be transformed into more
economically efficient units.
