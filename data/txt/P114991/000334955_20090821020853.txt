 Financing Data     IBRD Loan
                    Front end fee:         1.0 Yo
                    Maturity:              8.5 year final maturity
                    Interest rate:         LIBOR (Euribor) + 2.0 YO
                    Amount:                 1.O billion (US$ 1.4 billion equivalent)

                    Policy loan (DPL) consisting o f two tranches under a single loan.
                    Prepared as part of an international financial support package;
                    financing i s also being provided by the International Monetary Fund
                    and the European Commission. The Bank's assistance i s part o f a
                    joint IF1initiative, where the EBRD, the EIB, and the World Bank
                    Group have pledged to support banking sectors in Central and Eastern
                    Europe with up to 24.5 billion over a two year period.

I Main Policy       The loan supports reforms in four main policy areas: (a) fiscal reforms
                    including further reduction in the fiscal deficit, introduction o f legally
                    binding fiscal rules and structural measures; (b) a comprehensive
                    financial sector stability program; (c) pension reforms in the public
                    sector and privately funded pillar, and (d) health sector reforms.

 Key Outcome        - Restoration o f investor confidence and increased demand for
 Indicators         government securities evidenced by: lower government borrowing
                    spreads, lower interest swap spreads, and lower credit default swap
                    (CDS) spreads.
                    - Capital adequacy ratios for all banks at required levels after the
                    results o f in-depth supervisory examinations and stress tests.
                    - N o increase in the average share o f FX loans in household loans (at
                    constant exchange rates); reduction in the share o f FX denominated
                    loans in currencies other than the Euro.
                    - Reduction in average loaddeposit ratio.
                    - Increase in the effective retirement age.
                    - Reduction in the long term public pension deficit.
                    - Stability o f pharmaceutical expenditures in real terms.
                    - Reduction in number o f outpatient visits.
Program          The objectives are fourfold and include: (a) support to fiscal reforms
Development      designed to ensure long-run fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability
Objective( s)    and restore investor confidence, improving access o f the government,
                 banks and the corporate sector to external funding; (b) support to the
                 financial stability program, designed to ensure adequate levels o f
                 liquidity and healthy capital cushions, able to absorb the effects o f the
                 international crisis and the contraction o f economic activity, (c)
                 support to pension reforms designed to preserve adequate benefits
                 while tightening eligibility criteria and containing expenditures to
                 improve the sustainability o f the pension system; and (d) cost
                 containment and deficit prevention in the health sector while ensuring
                 access to care.

Risks and Risk   Further worsening of the external environment. The financial and
Mitigation       economic crisis has continued despite the activation and rescue
                 programs implemented in developed countries. There i s a risk that
                 money and credit markets will remain clogged and that the downturn
                 in the EU will be more severe and protracted than recently projected.
                 The access to foreign exchange finance will likely remain restricted
                 and the exchange rate uncertain. The contraction o f real GDP and the
                 increase in unemployment in 2009 could be more pronounced than
                 anticipated. This would strain the banks and the corporate sector, and
                 would also create difficulties for the achievement o f fiscal targets.

                 Mitigation measures. The multilateral package i s geared toward a
                 cautious scenario o f lack of external funding. With this program,
                 Hungary's financing requirements would be met, reducing the risk o f
                 further strains on the banks and the corporate sector, and reducing the
                 need for even more drastic fiscal adjustments beyond the new second
                 phase o f cuts recently implemented. The Program also mitigates risks
                 in the banking system through in-depth intensified examinations and
                 the strengthening o f supervisory powers. Finally, the fiscal program
                 includes a new fiscal responsibility law that should restore investor
                 confidence, by imposing strict indebtedness limits and ensuring a
                 steady decline in the ratio o f debt to GDP in the long-run.

                 Potential change in policies following the 2010 elections. The
                 Program contains a robust set o f measures in the banking, fiscal and
                 social sectors. However, the Program approaches an election period in
                 2010 and thus there i s the potential for changes in government
                 policies, toward Program objectives.

                 Mitigation measures. Many reforms supported by the Program are to
                 be implemented under newly enacted laws. The provisions most at
                 risk would be those approved annually under the budget law. Even
                 with a reversal, this i s unlikely to impact fiscal trends significantly
                 since other measures in place (e.g.: the Fiscal Responsibility Law)
                 would constrain the room for reckless spending without revenue
                 financing and IMF/Multilateral financing i s contingent on maintaining
                                          . . I

               the fiscal measures.

               Insufficient institutional autonomy and capacity. The reforms in
               the banking system require an increase in autonomy and substantial
               capacity o f the supervisory agency for anticipating deteriorating trends
               and undertaking the necessary corrective actions.

               Mitigation measures. To mitigate the risk o f inadequate
               implementation, the Bank i s expected as part o f loan supervision work,
               to provide technical support on request, to the supervisory agency
               during the Program period, and the government i s committed to
               modifying the relevant legislation to provide increased powers and
               flexibility to the agency.

               Need to ensure a strengthened toolkit for early supervisory
               intervention. In line with international practice, it i s important to
               update the early intervention powers o f the supervisory authorities in
               order to make them capable o f acting early (sometimes based on ex
               ante risk assessments), and not only after a potential default.

               Mitigation measures. The Program includes a sufficiently broad
               range o f policy tools that would allow the financial authorities to
               intervene, if necessary in a forceful manner, if a systemically important
               institution i s weakening but does not wish to avail i t s e l f o f government
               capital support measures. The features o f the program not only specify
               triggers where the government can intervene in such cases, but also
               contain the afore-mentioned forward looking measures to allow strong
               early corrective actions to mandate self-capitalization measures. As
               well, the intensified inspections will include an examination o f
               consolidated bank group risks which will better assess the liquidity
               versus solvency issues in vulnerable banks.

         PROPOSED FINANCIAL SECTOR AND MACRO STABILITY LOAN
                     TO THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY


                                       I.INTRODUCTION

1.      The financial crisis that originated in mature markets continues to generate adverse
                                                                                  S
economic effects, despite the rescue packages that have been introduced in the U and the
EU. The crisis became global, being transmitted worldwide through financial and trade
channels. I t has affected emerging countries, disrupting financial intermediation, reducing
exports, and contributing to a sharp contraction o f output and increases in unemployment.
The countries that are more open and financially integrated have been more substantially
affected.

2.         Hungary was one o f the first emerging economies affected by the financial crisis. In
the past two years (2007 and 2008) the government made an impressive effort to address the
serious fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances generated in the first half o f the decade and
restore investor confidence. However, the crisis reduced overall risk tolerance, and Hungary
was s t i l l perceived as a high risk country due to the large deficits and liabilities that had been
accumulated in the first half o f the decade. Hungary eventually lost access to foreign
exchange (FX) funding in the second half o f 2008 and was forced to request a 5 billion
repurchase-based (repo) facility from the European Central Bank (ECB) for short term FX
funds.

3.      To demonstrate i t s commitment to fiscal and financial stability, the government
launched a reform program that includes further fiscal reforms and a financial stability
program, and requested support for this program from the IMF, the European Commission
and the World Bank, notwithstanding the fact that Hungary had "graduated" from IBRD in
2007. The requested financial rescue package amounts to 19.8 billion, including 12.3
billion from the IMF, 6.5 billion from the European Union, and 1 billion from the World
Bank. The IMF and the EU operations were approved in October 2008 and November 2008,
respectively, and 14.1 billion have been disbursed, o f which 5.5 billion from EU funds.

4.      This program document proposes a two-tranche Financial Sector and Macro Stability
Loan to the Republic o f Hungary. The proposed loan would amount to 1 billion, equally
distributed in two tranches. The program supported under the proposed operation would be
implementedby the Ministry o f Finance, with collaboration from the National Bank o f
Hungary and the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority.

5.       The loan will support reforms for a continued reduction in the fiscal deficit, a solid
financial sector architecture to mitigate the impacts o f the global crisis and ensure banking
stability, and reforms in the pension and health sectors to increase cost efficiency and improve
the targeting o f fiscal resources in these areas. The loan will be a euro denominated fixed
spread loan o f LIBOR plus 2 percent, a front end fee o f 1 percent, with a maturity o f 8.5 years.

A. Hungary's Economic Performance Before the 2008 Financial Crisis

6.       Hungary was at the forefront o f economic reforms in the 1990s and started the new
millennium with a strong economic performance, as indicated by high GDP growth, a stable
fiscal framework, and declining debt levels. However, in the early 2000s economic
performance started faltering due to reform reversals and poor macroeconomic policies,
illustrated by large fiscal deficits averaging 8 percent o f GDP in 2002-2006. As shown in
Figure 1 and Table 1, the fiscal deficits contributed to large current account deficits and rising
debt ratios. Macroeconomic imbalances peaked in mid-2006, raising significant concerns
about the sustainability o f Hungary's economic policies.

7.       In mid-2006, the government initiated a reform program designed to restore investor
confidence and secure external financing. The program included strong fiscal measures with
immediate impact on the deficit combined with structural reforms aimed at putting public
finances on a sustainable path. These measures reduced the deficit from 9.3 percent o f GDP
in 2006 to 4.9 percent o f GDP in 2007.' This outcome was achieved both through spending
restraint and increased revenue collection. The reduction in expenditures included a reduction
in the wage bill (a nominal wage freeze and a fall in public sector employment) and reduced
subsidies (housing, transportation, gas and heating). Among key expenditure items, only
social transfers (mainly pensions) and interest spending increased.

8.      This fiscal austerity program came at the cost o f a contraction o f private consumption
and a significant slowdown in real output growth to 1.2 percent in 2007. The economy started
to recover slowly in the first half o f 2008, but these positive trends were interrupted by the
global financial crisis. The drawback was broad based, with negative consumption growth, a
drop in investment, and weak net exports. On the production side, all major sectors went into
recession.

9.      Despite the impressive fiscal adjustment in 2007 and 2008, the country remained
vulnerable, as the current account deficit and debt ratios stayed high. The persistence o f large
current account deficits was partially due to an increasing deficit o f the income balance,2 as
shown in Figure 1. The country's vulnerability was mitigated by the fact that a large share o f
external liabilities entailed direct corporate borrowing from foreign parent companies and
bank borrowing from foreign parent banks.

 10.    However, Hungary's dependence on foreign finance s t i l l remained substantial, and
both non-financial parent companies and parent banks proved to be themselves vulnerable to
the financial crisis that unfolded in 2008. A large share o f bank lending was in foreign
currency, which made Hungarian banks vulnerable to exchange rate movements. These
exposures were hedged by foreign exchange swaps, but exposed the banks to significant
rollover risk in the foreign exchange swap market.

B. The Impact o f the International Financial Crisis

 1 1,   The international financial crisis first started affecting Hungary and other emerging
countries in mid-2007, with the suspension o f redemptions from several investment funds in
the US. The outflows from the Hungarian equity market and their impact on equity prices

were pronounced and sustained, as shown in Figure 2. The second major shock happened in
                                                 S
early 2008, when several negative news in the U (e.g., large bank losses, downgrading o f
instruments and bond insurers) led to additional contractions o f international capital flows,
affecting for the first time the Hungarian bond market. As shown in Figure 2, foreign
holdings o f government bonds declined substantially, sovereign CDS spreads increased, and
government bond yields increased significantly above interbank swap rates with the same
maturity.

12.    The third major shock happened in September 2008, with the collapse o f Lehman
Brothers. Hungary experienced massive outflows from the government bond market and
sovereign CDS spreads increased dramatically. The government debt market eventually
became illiquid, as indicated by the high interest swap spreads. During this period, Hungarian
banks also experienced net reductions in funding from third party institutions (foreign banks
and other investors excluding parent banks), including restricted access to the F X swap
market. The lack o f access to foreign exchange resulted in a sharp depreciation o f the
exchange rate and eventually led the MNB to request a 5 billion facility from the European
Central Bank. In October, the government requested an international rescue package from the
IMF and including the European Commission and the World Bank, in order to restore investor
confidence and stabilize financial markets.

13.     After moderating at the end o f 2008, following the announcement o f the IMF-led
financial package, financial market stress increased again in the first quarter o f 2009 reflecting
worse than expected news on the economy, and similar capital flow movements in the region.
The depreciation continued until end-March (19 percent decline from end-December to end-
March), and the yield o f the five year bills in the secondary market and the CDS spread rose
quickly in February and March, exceeding their October levels while bond market liquidity
deteriorated somewhat (as shown by the higher interest swap spreads, Figure 2). Though
parent bank funding o f their Hungarian bank subsidiaries remained fairly stable, the non-
resident holdings o f forint-denominated government securities declined in Q 1 2009.

C. Recent Developments and Macroeconomic Outlook

 14.    Financial market stress appears to have subsided recently thanks to improved global
sentiment, sound fiscal policies, combined with the central bank's readiness to maintain
interest rate levels and support foreign currency liquidity. The debt management agency
(AKK) re-started auctions o f the government bonds in April 2009, and in July managed to
place a five-year 1 billion euro bond, priced at 395 bps spread above euro mid-swaps. The
yield on the benchmark 5-year bond fell from about 13 '/? percent in March to about 9%
percent in July and the CDS spread fell from more than 600 bps in March to about 300 bps in
recent weeks (Figure 2). Conditions in the FX swap market, which banks use to match the
currency structure o f their liabilities with that o f their assets, have also improved.
Nonresidents sold about 1 billion o f local-currency government securities in 4 2 2009, but
have become net buyers in recent weeks. The forint appreciated nearly 14 percent by mid-July
from an all time low o f HuF3 16/ earlier in March. Yet, it s t i l l remains 15 percent weaker
than a year before.

15.     Economic activity has contracted significantly since the IMF led program was initially
designed, reflecting mostly a larger deterioration o f the external environment and tighter
lending conditions. Real GDP fell by 6.4 percent year-on-year in Q1 2009 and preliminary
data suggest that output continued to contract during the second quarter. Exports, industrial
production, and retail sales continue falling, though year-on-year rates o f decline have
stabilized. Credit growth keeps on slowing sharply, especially due to a marked reduction in
new FX lending (mainly Swiss francs, but also Euros) given recent FX risks.

16.     The labor market started to react more deeply to the worsening economic conditions
than earlier anticipated. The unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent in the three months to
May, compared to 7.7 percent a year ago. Slack demand notwithstanding, rising prices for
food and fuel helped increase 12-month headline inflation to 3.7 percent by May 2009 from
3.5 percent in December. Core inflation slowed, however, from 3.8 to 3.2 percent over the
same period, as the effects o f weak demand more than offset those o f forint weakness.

 17.    The current account has improved dramatically, with the collapse in domestic demand
offsetting the effect o f weaker growth in partner countries. Sharply smaller income payments
to foreign direct investors, stepped-up EU transfers and a decline in import volumes that has
been sharper than that o f export volumes, has limited the current account deficit to 3 percent
o f GDP as compared to 8.4 percent for last year. External financing in Q1 2009 was stronger
than expected thanks to higher rollover rates for private sector external debt, in particular
parent banks, and lesser reductions in other net external flows. Overall, international reserves
have increased substantially, leading to an increase in reserve coverage o f 89 percent o f short
term debt by end-March, 2009.
                                                6
18.     The fiscal deficit in the first half o f the year was larger than projected. Although fiscal
policy has remained geared toward the policy conditions set forth under the IMF program, the
sharper than envisaged contraction in economic activity led to some widening o f the central
government deficit to 3.1 percent o f GDP during January to June, 2009, from 2.7 percent a
year earlier. O n the revenue side, the income tax and social security contribution shortfalls
were only partial offset with higher non-tax revenues. At the same time, some mandatory
spending (mainly interest payments, unemployment benefits) exceeded expectations.

19.     The outlook for 2009 and 2010 i s uncertain, as it depends on global events and,
crucially, the extent to which investor confidence in Hungary can be restored and maintained.
In the baseline scenario, global financial market stresses will gradually abate, which over time
should reduce pressures in financial markets in Hungary. However, the global deleveraging
may further reduce net capital inflows, slowing down further credit growth in Hungary.
Coupled with projected weak EU demand and pro-cyclical fiscal tightening, this will put
significant stresses on the domestic economy. After dropping close to 7 percent this year, real
GDP looks set to decline another 1 percent next year.

20.     Over the medium term, growth i s anticipated to recover, and public and external debt
to decline, but risks are large. Economic growth i s projected to slowly recover starting in
201 1 but looks unlikely to be higher than 4 percent a year over the medium term, even
assuming a cyclical upturn in Europe. Output prospects have already slipped to about 1
percent, and it is not expected to pick up to 2.5 percent until 2014. Exports should benefit
from the increased import demand growth from trading partners, the reduced tax wedge on
labor and the net depreciation. Private consumption i s expected to resume i t s growth in 201 1,
in line with the improvements on the labor market. The moderation o f the global financial
market stress should support private investment, while fiscal measures under the program
support expenditure sustainability. The main risks to Hungary's outlook stem from (i)    global
developments and (ii)   uncertainties about fiscal policy in the future.

21.     Although medium t e r m fiscal deficit targets were revised upward, longer-term
spending cuts were enacted by the government, with a view toward strengthening fiscal
sustainability and helping to contain increasingly adverse government debt dynamics. Deficit
targets for this year under the IMF program have been revised from an initial 2.6 percent o f
GDP, first to 2.9 percent and then to 3.9 percent, offsetting roughly half the reduction in
revenues due to weaker activity with measures to trim spending (see Section 111). For 2010, a
modest reduction o f the fiscal deficit as a share o f GDP i s planned. This would s t i l l imply a
substantial improvement o f the cyclically-adjusted deficit (Table 1). At the same time the
authorities have strengthened their commitment to medium-term fiscal sustainability, by
introducing a number o f structural measures that yield reduction in government spending in
the medium-term (Section 111).

22.     The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio i s expected to peak at 80 percent by 2010 before
declining gradually to 67 percent o f GDP in 2014. However, a steady rise in the primary
surplus i s essential to keep the government debt-to-GDP ratio firmly o n a declining path under
a broad range o f adverse shocks (Table 3). The Fiscal Responsibility Law, approved by the
Parliament in at the end o f 2008 (introducing, inter alia, a cap on real public debt levels) will
certainly help to ensure the steady decline in the ratio o f debt to GDP in the medium- and
long-term.

payments to direct investors are expected to halve the current account deficit in 2009.
Subdued domestic demand should keep the deficit modest next year as well.

24,      External Debt: The gross external debt (public plus private) i s expected to peak at 139
percent o f GDP at end-2009 - higher than envisaged in the program in November 2008,
mainly due to a weaker exchange rate and lower nominal GDP. N e t external debt (derived as
the difference between debt-related external liabilities and debt related external assets o f
residents, as well as end-period derivative positions with negative net present value) i s
considerably lower than gross debt and i s estimated to be 79 percent o f GDP in 2009 (up from
54 percent o f GDP in 2008). O f this amount, private external debt accounts for around 75
percent o f the total (59% o f GDP) and public debt only 25 percent o f the total (20% o f GDP).
The external debt ratio i s expected to decline over the next few years, as economic growth
resumes and the exchange rate mildly appreciates and stabilizes.

25.     Total Public Debt: Government gross debt (both domestic and external, combined) i s
expected to peak at 80 percent o f GDP in 20 10 and decline thereafter. In the short to medium
term, prior to this debt level declining, external financing requirements w i l l remain larger in
order to fill the gaps that cannot count on full market access, and to increase the international
reserves to levels covering short term debt obligations.

26.    Projections for funding forecast an external financing gap o f about 1 8.5 billion
through end-2009 (Table 4) to be covered by the IMF/EC/WB package and consistent with the
original program's size. The government's recent bond issue i s expected to be used to build
up reserves which are likely to be raised beyond that, thus the financing gap may be slightly
increased under a prudentially sound scenario. The overall projections remain subject to
changes due to the difficulty to forecast current account movements and financial flows with
extreme accuracy, including the roll-over ratios o f credits from the private sector which had
                                                9
increased since the start o f the crisis and s t i l l remain at levels above the September 2008
period prior to the manifestation o f financial stresses.

27.     Risks to external financing are expected to remain substantial over 2010-1 1 although
recent investor receptivity o f the euro market bond issuance in 2009, provides some comfort
that the program i s favorably impacting external investor confidence levels and future market
financing prospects. Based on cautious assumptions, the Bank estimates additional increases
in international reserves to levels allowing coverage o f 100 percent o f maturing short-term
debt by end-201 1. A further economic downturn i s always possible, given the newly revised
estimates o f close to 7 percent GDP contraction as the basis for the fiscal, debt and financing
projections. With signs o f an upturn and favorable investor sentiment, a further downside risk
appears less likely than perhaps 4-5 months earlier. Hungary's external position and earlier
devaluation effects, provide elements o f reactivation once external market financing i s
stabilized.

                   111.    THE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAM

A. The Overall Reform Program

28.     As mentioned previously, the Government had already initiated a substantial reform
program in 2006, in order to address the imbalances accumulated in previous years and restore
investor confidence. However, the financial crisis reduced the overall risk tolerance o f foreign
investors, and Hungary was s t i l l perceived as a high risk country, despite the impressive fiscal
adjustment, because o f the large foreign and domestic liabilities that had been accumulated.

29.    As the financial crisis unfolded and affected Hungary, the Government realized the
need to deepen and broaden the reform program, strengthening the fiscal reforms and
implementing a financial stability program. The measures that have already been
implemented in 2007-2008 and that will be implemented in 2009, can be grouped into four
major areas: (i) Consolidation o f the fiscal adjustment, combined with structural measures
designed to ensure fiscal sustainability in the medium- and long-runs; (ii) comprehensive
                                                                            a
financial stability program, designed to address financial risks and ensure a resilient banking
system; (iii)pension reforms, designed to stabilize public pension expenditures and prepare
the payout phase o f the young private system; (iv) health reforms, designed to control health
expenditures and reduce the health deficit while ensuring access to health care.

B. Fiscal Reforms

Further Fiscal Adjustments in 2009 and 2010

30.    As described in Section 11, the Government implemented a fiscal program that reduced
the general government deficit from 9.3 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 3.3 percent o f GDP in
2008. The budget for 2009 i s now estimated to result in a budget deficit 3.9 percent o f GDP
mainly as a result o f the sharp downturn in growth. In contrast to previous years, when the
adjustment involved expenditure reductions and revenue increases, the adjustment in the 2009
budget relies primarily on expenditure reductions while remaining revenue neutral (Table 5).

3 1.     Consecutive Fiscal Adjustments. Specific measures initially included in the 2009
Budget bill covered: (i) nominal wage freeze and the elimination o f the 13th monthly salary
                         a
for all public employees; (ii) elimination o f the 13th monthly pension for early retirees and
                              the
a cap o f the 13th monthly pension to HuF 80,000 (the average pension) for other pensioners;
(iii)postponement or elimination o f indexation o f selected social benefits; (iv) cuts in the
public transport subsidy and (iv) across-the-board cuts in other spending allocations to
ministries. A second set o f measures undertaken during early 2009 have included revenue-
neutral tax reforms to reduce the tax wedge on labor and bolster potential growth, including
lowering social security contributions, cutting the overall personal income tax, and increasing
consumption and wealth taxes.

32.                                                                 1
         Deteriorating Growth Prospects. As mentioned in Section 1 , the contraction o f GDP
i s proving much more severe than projected at the time the 2009 budget was submitted and
approved by Parliament. This will imply lower than projected revenues and a larger nominal
deficit, given the now projected 6.7 percent contraction in GDP. The nominal deficit would
remain somewhat constant moving to 3.8 percent o f GDP in 20 10, but the cyclically-adjusted

                                                11
deficit would s t i l l decline. These growth and deficit projections, however, imply additional
expenditure cuts to be implemented.

33.     Incremental Expenditure Reductions. To adjust to the above conditions, the
government will implement additional cuts including a freeze in the expenditures o f budgetary
chapters, not spending funds received from the sale o f carbon credits, elimination o f subsidies
for farmers above EU agricultural support payments, reductions in subsidies for gas and
heating costs as well as pharmaceuticals and the media, an absolute elimination o f the 13th
monthly salary for all public servants and the 13th monthly pension payment for pensioners,
further postponement o f the pension correction and planned increases in family allowances
and disability pensions, and cancellation o f subsidies for new housing purchases. The
government also has decided to freeze the public sector wage bill, along with family
allowances and social benefits linked to the minimum old-age pension during 2010 and 201 1.

34.     Despite the substantial consolidation total expenditures will remain high, at about 50
percent o f GDP. Social spending has increased during the decade, both as a share o f GDP and
as a share o f total expenditures (Table 5). Social spending i s high by comparison with other
new EU members (Figure 3), suggesting the scope for further reforms in this areas3The
government has started to address this issue through specific reforms in the pension and health
areas (examined in greater detail below). The government has also committed and
implemented various measures intended to improve the financial sustainability o f the social
support system (including the tightening o f eligibility criteria and improved targeting o f
benefits) and providing more incentives for work and employment.




 The differences between social spending figures in Table 5 and Figure 3 are due to different definitions used in ESA 95 and
ESSPROS.

Structural Reforms in the Fiscal Area

35.     The Fiscal Responsibility Law. In November 2008, the Hungarian Parliament
approved a key piece o f legislation - the Fiscal Responsibility L a w (FRL). The FRL includes
a number o f institutional mechanisms designed to ensure long-run fiscal sustainability. The
policy rules set for the central government include: (i)from 2012, a basic r u l e establishing that
public debt cannot increase in real terms; (ii)during a transitory period (20 10- 1l),rule
                                                                                       a
establishing that the growth in real primary expenditures cannot exceed h a l f the projected
growth o f real GDP; (iii) safeguards assuring that expenditure increases can be only be
proposed if their `worsening effects' can be offset by cutting other expenditures or increasing
revenues.

36.    A Fiscal Council. The FRL also establishes a fiscal council, consisting o f three
experts4and a secretariat with a mandate t o report directly to the Parliament providing an
independent view on budget projections and forecasts. The Council, which should be fully
operational by the end o f 2009, will prepare macroeconomic forecasts and projections o f
budgetary aggregates, assess the budgetary impact o f draft legislation, and make
recommendations o n corrective measures. The government has committed to ensuring an
adequate budgetary allocation during the first year o f the establishment o f the Council after
which subsequent allocations will be decided by the Parliament directly based on Council
proposals.

37.     Debt Dynamics under the new Law. The FRL i s expected to strengthen fiscal
discipline in a fundamental way and ensure that public finances are put on a sustainable path.
The most important component o f the L a w i s arguably the rule that stipulates that real public
debt cannot increase. This will ensure that the ratio o f debt to GDP declinesat the rate o f real
GDP growth. Assuming that real GDP will increase at 3 percent p.a. from 2012 on, this rule
implies that the ratio o f debt to GDP will decline from about 80 percent in 20 10-20 11 to at
least 60 percent o f GDP in 20 16.

38.   The Law on the Legal Status and Management o Budgetary Institutions. In
                                                     f
December 2008, the Hungarian Parliament approved another important piece o f legislation -

` I t s members have been nominated by the President o f the Republic, the Governor o f the central bank and the head o f the
State Audit Office, and are expected to be appointed by Parliament.
                                                               13
the Law on the Legal Status o f Budgetary Institutions. The new Law w i l l strengthen public
sector efficiency by providing increased management autonomy for budget-dependent units,
agencies and institutions as part o f their charters, while stressing performance and efficiency
in operational performance and financial management. Differentiated regulatory frameworks
may be approved, and institutions w i l l be differentiated by the nature o f their activities. For
instance, agencies responsible for public services (hospitals, universities, museums) would
have regulations closer to those o f the private sector.

39.      Norms and Controls under the Legal Status Law. The increased autonomy awarded
under the Legal Status Law would allow greater independence in operational strategy and
budgetary decisions (including generation o f own fee-based revenues for enhanced or
expanded services) and lead to increased public sector productivity and higher quality
provision o f public services. However, for public sector agencies wishing to become more
autonomous in their operations and funding, they will require review and approval o f their
business plans at the Ministerial levels and w i l l be subject to monitoring as part o f the budget
execution process, particularly in those cases where reductions o f debts or contingent
liabilities constitute a pre-requisite for institutional reforms. The government in addition, for
all public sector entities being allocated budgets, will issue a new Decree specifying the rules
for budgeting and results measurement as part o f the implementation o f the law, and the
quantitative objectives for attaining more efficient and cost effective management o f public
sector institutions.

C. The Financial Sector Stability Program

               f
The Situation o the Banking System before the Crisis

40.     The Hungarian banking sector comprises 3 1 commercial banks and 5 specialized
banks. The sector grew very rapidly during the decade, and total assets exceed 100 percent o f
GDP, as shown in Table 6. The banking sector's market share has remained relatively stable
and dominates the financial sector, accounting for 70 percent o f total financial institution
assets. Common with many other CEE countries, the banking sector i s concentrated, with the
8 largest banks controlling more than 75 percent o f total banking assets. Due to extensive
privatization in the 1990s, the banking sector i s dominated by subsidiaries o f large
multinational banks based in EU states. However, the largest bank (OTP), accounting for
more than 20 percent o f banking assets, i s considered a domestic bank despite being owned
primarily by foreign investors since it does not have any majority strategic foreign investor.

41.    As shown in Table 6 below, the balance sheet o f the banking system i s characterized
by six major features:

0   High loan'to deposit ratios (exceeding 150 percent) and high ratios o f borrowings to total
    liabilities (45 percent). These ratios reflect a pattern consistent with other CEE countries,

    Given the rapid growth o f the system over the past five years, unusually low levels o f
    classified assets with only 3.3 percent o f loans adversely classified.

42.      The rapid growth o f credit and past high levels o f profitability are not surprising given
that banks expanded their new business lines (mortgage, consumer, SME lending) from a low
initial base. However, the levels o f classified assets (and corresponding provisions) appear
low given the rapid credit growth and the resulting accumulation o f risks. The high
proportion o f F X loans has been an element o f concern for some time. While banks have
substantially closed their F X exposure through the swap market, the credit risk created
through extending FX loans to households and SMEs with little or no hedging capacity,
remains.

43.    Recent years have seen lending standards increasingly relaxed in the face o f escalated
competition for volume and yield. Although such trends appear to have recently slowed or
stopped, they embedded themselves in higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, declining customer
creditworthiness, and the use o f lending through bank agents. Many retail customers in recent
years emanated from the lower income category, and therefore, possess a thinner cushion to
absorb escalating loan payments as a result o f FX movements.

44.     Furthermore, mortgage loan sales through broker-intermediated channels escalated
with approximately 55 per cent o f mortgage based loans sold by brokers in 2007, up from 30
percent in 2005. Credit distributed through such channels has historically performed
significantly worse than that distributed through traditional branch network^.^ Finally, banks
are exposed to a downturn in the economy and i t s implications for debt repayment capacity.
These and other weaknesses became apparent in 2008-09, with the unfolding o f the
international financial crisis.

Impact o the Financial Crisis on the Banking Sector and Initial Responses
        f

45.     Hungary started being affected by the crisis in mid-2007, with large outflows from the
equity market and a sharp drop in stock prices. However, the banking system was not
significantly affected in these initial stages. The exchange rate at first remained broadly
stable, banks retained access to FX funding (including FX swaps), and the domestic markets
remained reasonably liquid, including the domestic government debt market.

46.     However, during late 2008 the banking system was progressively affected by the crisis.
The massive outflows from the government debt market and the resulting lack o f liquidity
impacted banks significantly given the size o f their securities portfolios and the importance o f
these for liquidity management. Non-deposit funding substantially reduced in tenor or exited,
and most importantly, banks experienced increasing difficulty in accessing FX funding from
external third party financial institutions, including the FX swap market. The foreign-owned
subsidiaries began to rely more heavily on their European parents, while the domestic banks
experienced greater difficulties given their greater dependence on wholesale funding.

47.      In response to the increasingly tight F X availability that the banking sector was
experiencing, the Hungarian authorities took steps to restore systemic liquidity with additional
facilities. To illustrate, from mid August to early November, for example, spot market trading
                                                                     16
o f FX used by Hungarian banks to fwnd loans, decreased by over U S $ 6.0 billion equivalent
while during the same period the F X swap market supported by the MNB as a last resort
supplier, increased by about U S $ 8 billion (Figure 4).6 After a small decline, the FX swap
needs rose again in April 2009.

48.      In addition to the provision o f FX, the Government and the MNB also offered
additional funds through the overnight deposit facility which increased by almost US$3
billion equivalent. MNB's short t e r m credit facilities increased lending to the banking sector
by US$1.4 billion equivalent (Figure 5).

 A similar FX shock (though slightly less pronounced) had already occurred during March 2008, coinciding with the Bear
Stearns bail-out in the U.S.
                                                           17
49.     Additional actions taken by the MNB to increase bank liquidity included decreasing
deposit reserve requirements by an overall US$1.7 billion equivalent to provide immediate
cash liquidity. The MNB also increased liquidity through monetary operations by purchasing
some US$l.2 billion equivalent in government bonds. However, the volatility and funding
scarcity generated worries that the global crisis would continue disrupting FX funding. To
prevent such a scenario, the MNB entered into an agreement with the ECB to avail i t s e l f o f a
5 billion FX liquidity line, based on a collateralized rep0 facility, to ensure access to foreign
exchange by domestic banks.

The Government Reform Programfor the Banking System

50.      The measures taken by the authorities have been consistent with crisis responses seen
in other EU countries but with added elements. The full package o f measures including those
developed by the Bank with the authorities under the proposed loan, are shown in Table 7 .
These include: (i)  measures to assure access to short term liquidity both in foreign and
domestic currency; (ii)  increased deposit insurance protection; (iii) debt guarantee fund
                                                                      a
facilitating access to longer term debt based (non deposit) funding; (iv) a capital enhancement
fund for strengthening the levels o f bank capital; and (v) strengthened forward-looking
supervisory powers and sector diagnostic tools.

5 1.    Some o f these measures have already been introduced through new legislation,
including the Financial Stability Law, approved by Parliament in December 2008 that
introduced the debt guarantee and capital enhancement funds (items iiiand ivyabove).
Foreign exchange liquidity access (item i)was arranged through agreement with the ECB
establishing a collateralized repurchase (repo) facility with the MNB.

                                          slowdown, and financial risks.



52.    Provision o Liquidity. Given the increasing tightness witnessed in the local currency
                  f
HuF interbank and deposit markets, the MNB increased the availability o f HuF liquidity
through a new two week term lending window and a six month auction-based lending facility.

                                                        19
These were assisted by broadening the types o f acceptable collateral instruments, to include
securities such as covered mortgage bonds. In addition, an agreement with the ECB was
entered into for the ECB to provide the MNB with foreign exchange arrangements o f up to  5
billion (US$7 billion), backed by a collateralized rep0 facility, to support foreign exchange
demand from domestic banks using F X to fund their balance sheet assets given the drying up
o f the offered supply in the market.

53.     Deposit Insurance. Deposit insurance coverage was more than doubled in the fourth
quarter o f 2008, in line with EU standards, and a broad blanket guarantee for all deposits was
announced. The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) increased the premium from 0.9 to 2 basis
points to increase the level o f reserves in line with the increase in the insured deposit base.

54.    Guarantees o New Bank Debt. The Debt Guarantee Fund (GF) was established by
                      f
the new Financial Stability Law to provide guarantees o f third party funding given to banks,
such as interbank credits or bank-issued securities used for rolling over or refinancing
domestic banks' funding needs, or new funding (mainly to complement short t e r m funding,
with medium and longer term funding). This measure i s meant to assure ongoing, more
sustainable liquidity sources for banks' liabilities given the current market uncertainties.

55.     Capital Support. The Capital Base Enhancement Fund (CBEF) was established by the
new Financial Stability Act to inject new equity into banks that may need a stronger capital
cushion. The government would be a shareholder o f the new capital and in some cases would
have special powers (see table above). Banks may voluntarily apply for capital assistance or
capitalization may be initiated by the State based on the authorities' assessment o f risks and
capital condition. The Financial Stability Law sets forth the conditions which trigger the
government's exit as shareholder o f an institution.

56.      Decisions on bank applications to use CBEF funds are made by a tri-partite financial
stability committee represented by the MoF, MNB, and the HFSA, using criteria related to
systemic impact. Specific bank indicators and parameters will be detailed within individual
agreements between the government and participating banks. The GF w i l l be available for
banks without a need to apply for a capital injection. Any portion o f unused funds from the
CBEF not committed by December 2009 will be transferred to the GF. The government has
the option o f returning to Parliament for authorization to provide additional funds to the GF
should they be needed.

57.     Agreements for Continued Foreign Parent Bank Funding. In addition to the above
measures, a non-binding but written confirmation from foreign bank parents o f domestic
banks was provided to the government and central bank via letters o f comfort, stqting that
parent banks w i l l continue to provide inter-company funding to their Hungarian subsidiaries.
Similar agreements have also been established at the regional level via the IF1 representatives'
meeting in Vienna during March 2009 establishing this protocol. While the government has
established new liquidity facilities in case o f funding shortages, the agreement with parent
banks i s essential to maintain stability, given that a withdrawal o f parent bank funding (in the
form o f loans or deposits to Hungarian subsidiaries) would imply large funding gaps in the
entire system.

58.    Assessment o Parent Bank Funding Risks. The main western European parent
                    f
banks, however, besides the letters o f comfort submitted to the authorities, appear fully
committed to support the Hungarian market in which their subsidiaries operate. Not only does
                                               20
the Hungarian market represent a significant portfolio o f their financial group assets, but a
withdrawal from this relatively high end market would send adverse signals toward other
neighboring countries with greater or lesser financial problems and could accelerate a
contagion process through the region. While Hungary's economic issues were initially
fiscally driven, besides the expected GDP contraction, Hungary's banking sector had not
experienced a credit boom as in other countries, and therefore over-extension o f credit
exposure does not represent a fundamental issue in the banking asset structure. In this sense,
maintenance o f parent bank investment and funding makes sense, particular in light o f the
supporting multilateral program that provides the additional funding cushions.

59.     Initiatives to Alleviate Borrower Stress. To address the potential impact o f a
depreciation o f the exchange rate on households who only have domestic currency income, the
government also sponsored an agreement with the banking sector, whereby the banks may
convert FX-denominated loans to borrowers into HuF loans without a penalty, and capitalize
the increase in mortgage payments arising from the conversion for creditworthy borrowers.

60.     Strengthening Bank Regulation and Supervisory Powers. In collaboration with the
Bank, the Government i s taking steps to ensure the long term stability.of the banking system
by strengthening bank regulation and supervision. A key feature o f this effort i s to provide the
HFSA enhanced tools and authority (while using powers necessary to apply pillar 2 o f the
Base1 I1 Capital Accord) to identify and act promptly on deteriorating developments in bank
conditions and proactively address systemic risks.

61,     To put into effect these new measures, the Government included as part o f the
Financial Stability Law initial discretionary measures allowing the HFSA to require more
extraordinary financial reporting from banks being closely monitored, as well as allowing
examinations o f such banks to be extended for up to one year, if needed to more closely
monitor potential effects on stability. As well, these amendments permit the HFSA to
contract qualified auditors to accompany inspections under such cases, in order to critically
assess or detect risky bank practices.

62.     The Government will also submit to Parliament amendments to the HFSA Law
(currently being drafted) to enhance the capacity o f the HFSA to take preventive action. As
per the table above, the reforms include:

0     Allowing the HFSA to take proactive action to preempt financial distress at the systemic
      level by mandating actions applicable to all affected financial institutions.

0     Granting the HFSA new powers under i t s Law to take supervisory actions to ensure that
      corrective actions are taken by banks where risks are increasing (e.g.: as related to
      solvency, portfolio quality, business lines, liquidity, credit assessment procedures, risk
      management systems, and other).' This includes the authority to issue cease and desist
      orders and require strengthening plans to be undertaken by banks.




'For example, wile Hungary's exchange rate has stabilized recently, during the recent short period o f depreciation, worries
were also raised about banks' high shares o f lending in foreign currencies (75 percent o f all loans) to domestic borrowers,
and the borrowers' abilities to repay in the event o f a sharp and permanent depreciation.
                                                             21
0   Modifying a Government Decree for accounting reporting purposes, on the classification
    and corresponding loss provisions, regading the treatment o f restructured, rescheduled or
    renegotiated loans so as to better reflect underlying portfolio risks loan expected values.

63.     Enhanced Supervisory Monitoring and Intensified Examinations. In order to
effectively apply supervisory corrective actions, the HFSA requires an in depth understanding
o f banks' condition, particularly o f their underlying credit quality. For this purpose, a 2009
Supervisory Plan for the HFSA was prepared with a special focus on the on-site verification
o f banks' safety and soundness and enumerates the assumptions used to drive internal risk
models. The Plan requires intensified on-site inspections for the eight largest banks, and i s
based on comprehensive TORSagreed with, in collaboration with the Bank. This commenced
in the second quarter o f 2009.

64.        The above inspections w i l l evaluate, on a consolidated basis, the asset quality,
adequacy o f loan loss provisions and reserves, collateral values, intercompany transactions,
solvency capital, and governance, and calculate required adjustments to capital and provisions
as needed. Following completion o f the exercise, and by end o f the third quarter, the HFSA
w i l l require banks to adjust their financial statements, provisions and capital, in line with the
results o f such inspections or mandate corrective actions for such purpose.

65.     Stress Testing Exercise. An additional tool to be implemented by the MNB with
collaboration o f the HFSA w i l l include conducting stress test "scenario analyses" for
individual banks in order to project future balance sheet strength. This will be using
economic and financial projections such as Hungarian and EU GDP growth figures,
employment and disposable income projections (e.g.: for debt servicing purposes), as well as '
foreign exchange and interest rate movements affecting borrower capacities to repay. Such
analyses w i l l be used to estimate potential impacts on banks' credit portfolios with a view to
establishing under what scenarios banks w i l l need to adjust their provisioning and capital
requirements. These and the above measures will permit the government to address financial
system risks before they become problematic, and thus improve financial stability.

66.     Additional Mechanisms for the Resolution o Troubled Banks. The Government has
                                                       f
also begun an initiative to tackle legal amendments dealing with the treatment o f troubled
bank assets and liabilities in a pre-bankruptcy, but unstable situation. The objective i s to
reduce major bank losses and minimize the financial outflows from the State or the Deposit
Insurance Agency under bank failure cases. This involves the potential use o f supervisory
authority powers to transfer viable assets with matching deposits and liabilities, to sound
banks with an interest and capital capacity to absorb such. Other mechanisms may include
creating a new "clean" bank to achieve improved solvency or a bridge bank whose new
balance sheet can later be converted or sold to an existing institution. These issues are legally
complex in the Hungarian legislative and constitutional framework where private property
rights need to be fully protected under any such process. The Ministry o f Finance w i l l submit
a legislative proposal to the Government Cabinet on this matter for approval as a new legal
amendment to the HFSA Law and/or related financial sector laws.

D. Pension Reforms

Development o the Public Pension Scheme after the 1997 Reform
             f

67.      The Hungarian pension system underwent a structural reform in 1997, when the public
pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system was subjected to substantial parametric reforms and the second
pillar was introduced. The reform greatly contributed to a more balanced pension system, but
i t was clear at the time o f the reform that demographic developments would reintroduce
pressures on the pension system in the longer-run. The relatively benign demographic
environment o f the first two decades was expected to be used to reform further the PAYG
pillar, so as to absorb future demographic shocks and enable some reduction in contribution
rates, which were high at 3 1 percent o f gross wages.'

68.      The actual evolution o f pension system finances after the reform i s presented in Figure
5. The ratio o f pension expenditures to GDP initially declined in line with projections made
at the time o f the reform, but increased again as result o f the failure to substantially raise the
effective retirement age, and several benefit increases. These included an extra 3 percent
increase in pensions in 200 1; an extra permanent increase in pensions by HUF 19,000 in
2002; and one extra week o f benefit added in each year between 2003 and 2006, culminating
in a 13'h pension worth 4 weeks o f benefits; and some additional targeted benefit increases for
retirees unfairly treated by the pension system in the past.

69.     While expenditures increased, revenues declined due to cuts in contribution rates not
planned at the time o f the reform - from 3 1 percent o f wages in 1997 to 26 percent in 2002.
As a result, pension deficits grew steadily to 3 percent o f GDP in 2007 and the demographic
dividend o f the last decade never materialized in pension finances. As fiscal pressures started
to build, contribution rates were raised to 29.5 percent in 2006 and 33.5 percent in 2008
(although this last increase was due to the transfer o f health contributions to the pension
scheme). The increase in revenues was not sufficient to halt the increase in deficits until 2007
(Figure 6), prompting the government to initiate a number o f reforms in 2007 and 2008.

                                                                       23
Ongoing Reforms to the Public Pension System

70.     By the time financial crisis had hit Hungary at the end o f 2008 the government had
already started addressing the imbalances o f the pension system generated in recent years.
The major areas o f reform included efforts to restrict early retirement in order to increase
effective retirement ages and a set o f other measures directed to control expenditures like
levying contributions on working pensioners, reducing newly awarded pensions, and limiting
spending related to the 13'h pension. In addition, the government also started preparing the
regulation o f the payout phase o f the new second pillar, which i s scheduled to start in 20 13.

7 1.     Facing strong fiscal pressures generated by the financial crisis, and realizing that pre-
crisis reforms were not sufficient to put the pension system on the fiscally sustainable path the
government passed another strong package o f pension reforms in the first half o f 2009. They
included increase in statutory retirement age, permanent abolition o f 13th pension, and new
indexation rules that tie the pension indexation parameter to GDP growth resulting in slower
increase in benefits when GDP growth i s subdued.

72.    Increasing the effective retirement age. The 1997 reform included a gradual
increase in the statutory retirement age from 57 and 60 for women and men, respectively, to a
universal retirement age o f 62. As shown in Figure 7, the statutory retirement age o f men
reached this level in 2000, and that o f women in 2009.

73.      However, early retirement eligibility rules remained the same during this period
(minimum career length o f 33 and 38 years for reduced and regular early retirement pensions,
respectively), which greatly decreased the effect o f the reform on effective retirement ages,
Figure 7 shows that the gap between statutory and effective retirement ages has remained the
same for men, and has actually widened in the case o f women, as more and more women have
retired through the early retirement program.

74.    To discourage early retirement, the government amended the pension law with the
following measures legislated over the 2007-2008 period:

0   suspension o f pension payments for employed pensioners aged under 62 except for
    minimum wage workers (applies to new retirees from January 2008 and will apply to
    existing retirees from January 20 10);
0   tighter eligibility requirements: from 38 and 33 years o f service for regular and reduced

                                               24
    early retirement pensions, to 40 and 37 years o f service, respectively (will apply from
    January 20 10);
0   increasing penalties for early retirement and bonuses for postponed retirement (penalties
    w i l l apply from 2011 in the case o f men and from 2013 in the case o f women).'
0   In addition, statutory retirement age was again set to gradually increase starting in year
    2012 and reaching age 65 by the year 2021.

75.    Other tightening measures. To further address fiscal pressures in the pension fund
the government has implementedthe following additional measures:

0   reduction in newly awarded pensions by about 8 percent through changes in net wage base
    calculations (applies from January 2008);
0   levying o f pension contributions on wages o f working pensioners (applies from January
    2008);
0   immediate elimination o f the 13`h pension for all retirees starting from July 1, 2009;
0   switching to price indexation o f benefits in low growth environments (GDP growth below
    3%) while gradually increasing indexation generosity until it reaches the more generous
    "Swiss" indexation rule at GDP growth rates above 5%.'O

76.     The reduction in newly awarded pensions i s justified from both fiscal and equity
perspectives, as the cohorts that started to retire in the last 4 years have retired with markedly
higher pensions compared to older retiree cohorts. This one time shift to higher pensions w i l l
be partly reversed by the new policy, resulting in comparable pensions o f older and younger
retirees.

77.      Levying contributions on working pensioners i s also justified. Many countries go even
further and exclude the possibility o f collecting pensions and wages at the same time. The
policy i s based on the principle that a pension i s a compensation for the lost capacity to earn
income, rather than entitlement to a benefit stream at a certain age.

78.     From the very beginning the 13`h pension represented a departure from the social
insurance principle upon which the 1997 reform was built. It constituted effectively an
unfunded bonus that has benefitted all pensioners, regardless o f income and need and has
constituted an especially heavy fiscal burden for the pension system. I t s elimination i s
expected to generate immediate annual savings o f about 0.7 percent o f GDP.

79.     Finally, changes in pension indexation rules present a reasonable compromise between
protecting fiscal sustainability o f the pension scheme and providing an opportunity for the
pensioners to partially benefit from fast economic growth when it occurs. Even under the new
rules, purchasing power o f pensioners remains fully protected while the gap between wage
and pension growth i s prevented from increasing drastically.




 As expected, the reform provoked a wave o f early retirement in 2007 temporarily boosting pension
expenditures, but the number o f pension applicants dropped to trend levels in 2008, ensuring future fiscal gains.
loUnder "Swiss" indexation rule pensions are increased to the average o f price and wage growth.

Projected Expenditures and Balances o the Pension System
                                     f

80.      The lower solid line in Figure 8 represents the projected path o f pension deficits o f the
public P A Y G component o f the pension system." Although these projections are less than
one year old, a drastically different macroeconomic environment and important pension
reforms in 2009 have made them dated now. New projections are expected to be prepared in
the fall o f 2009 and meanwhile approximate calculations by Bank staff based on the recent
parametric reforms, are available to adjust these original calculations to the new realities
which are presented as dotted lines in the figure.

8 1.    In October 2008 it was expected that the increase in the effective retirement age due to
the changes in early retirement rules and demographic tail winds would allow pension deficits
to decrease slightly by 2015, to stabilize at around 2 percent o f GDP until 2030 and later start
rising again due to demographic developments. These projections show that the pension
system was expected to be stable for the next two decades, although s t i l l requiring budget
transfers and high contribution rates that generate inefficiencies and contribute to informality.

82.     However, the financial crisis i s expected to deliver a shock to the pension system,
mainly due to the rapidly falling revenues. The deficit i s projected to increase by more over 4
percent o f GDP in the short term before it decreases again to a 3 percent deficit in 2015; as
shown by the lowest dotted line before rising again in 2030 as with the original forecast before
the new reforms. Although pension reforms are usually slow to deliver desired savings, in
this case, the combined package o f strong 2009 pension reforms i s now estimated to be able to
cover the shortfall generated by the crisis, by 2010. It is further projected to deliver longer
term gains and almost balance the system until 2030. New sets o f reforms are likely to be
needed before then to prepare the system for future demographic shocks while also enabling a
reduction in contribution rates.

83.     In the figure below, the effect o f each reform as recently enacted (lines 2, 3 and 4)
show their cumulative effect. Line 2 showing the elimination o f the 13th month pension
benefit i s the first effect which demonstrates the positive impact on the pension deficit.
Adding in the reform on increasing the retirement age, on top o f the 13'h month pension
reform, one obtains the next line (line 3) with the cumulative effect o f both these measures as
well as their effect in counteracting the economic crisis impact on fiscal finance o f the pension
system. Finally, when the reform on the change o f indexation (line 4) i s added cumulatively
to the other reforms, the total cumulative impact o f the combined factors i s shown in line 4,
where near balance in the system i s reached between 2020 and 2030.

84.      Designing the Payout Phase o the Secund Pillar. The government has introduced a
                                          f
number o f institutional and regulatory improvements to the young private pension system,
including a centralized collection system, regulations designed to curb the high fees, and
lifestyle pension portfolios. The performance o f the pension system has been affected by the
current crisis, but there i s an expectation that pension funds will have time to recover the
losses incurred in 2008 (a negative return o f 26 percent on the balanced portfolio), as the first
cohorts in the second pillar will only begin retiring in 2013. However, the government s t i l l
needs to prepare the framework for the payout phase, including the menu o f retirement
products (annuities, phased withdrawals, other), marketing rules, and solvency regulations. In
2009, the government w i l l complete draft amendments to the pension law that would address
these elements. I t also plans to introduce a strategy for issuing inflation-indexed bonds which
would be essential to allow private annuity providers to hedge the inflation risk o f their
indexed liabilities.

E. The Health Sector

Main Challenges

85.      Total health expenditures (THEs) increased from 7.0 to 8.3 percent o f GDP from 2000
to 2006, driven by increases in both public and private spending, and are rather high by EU-8
standards, as shown in Figures 9 and 10. The Health Insurance Fund (HIF) reported deficits in
the first half o f the decade, but a surplus was achieved in 2007 with mandatory transfers from
the state budget to the HIF on behalf o f pensioners and other non-contributing persons,'2
coupled with formal co-payments by patients, strict expenditure controls, and a reduction in

''Including persons receiving social allowances, children, students, beneficiaries of maternity leave, prisoners and others. In
2008, the transfer amount i s approximately HuF 4,500 (about $22.5) per person per month.
                                                                  27
hospital beds. But the situation in the health sector s t i l l looks precarious, considering the
negative effects o f the crisis on the revenues o f the HIF, and the difficult financial situation o f
hospitals - hospitals have accumulated debts and arrears with suppliers up to 0.4 percent o f
GDP, putting additional financial pressure on the municipalities who are the owners o f the
hospitals.

86.     The government faces the challenge o f improving the health status o f the Hungarian
population which i s poor by comparison with other EU states," while avoiding large deficits
in the HIF. The scope for enhancing health revenues looks limited, as the contribution rate i s
relatively high at 12.5 percent o f wages. A recent effort to introduce co-payments by patients
had to be abolished in April 2008 following a popular r e f e r e n d ~ m . Moreover, the growing
                                                                            '~
unemployment resulting from the crisis and the wage freeze recently implemented will reduce
contribution revenues in the foreseeable future and increase the pressures on the HIF.

Ongoing Reform Efforts

87.    The government and the HIF have responded to these pressures through a number o f
measures designed to contain expenditures while generating efficiency gains. The package o f
measures include: (i)  strengthening the purchasing power o f the HIF; (ii)    containing
pharmaceutical expenditures through administrative and legislative measures; (iii)      reducing
the overcapacity o f hospitals; (iv) strengthening the role o f general practitioners (GPs) to
reduce overutilization o f health care; and (v) ensuring an adequate number o f GPs.

88.     Measures to strengthen the purchasingpower o the HIF. Health insurance reforms
                                                          f
have been focused towards strengthening the purchasing power o f the HIF. To this end, the
19 county level branches o f the HIF are being consolidated into 7 regional offices responsible
for selective contracting based on explicit performance criteria. The provider payment reform
will reward providers for better efficiency and quality and for serving population groups in
low-income areas. The HIF has started substantive investment in independent data collection,
analysis and simulations to estimate the financial impact o f these purchasing reforms, and to
implement cost containment measures.

89.     Containment o pharmaceutical expenditures. In 2006, about 30 percent o f total
                       f
health expenditures were related to pharmaceuticals and Hungary reported pharmaceutical
expenditures per capita above the OECD average. As a result, the HIF introduced strict
expenditure management and prescription controls, such as the introduction o f generics,
contributing to a reduction in pharmaceutical expenditures from 1.65 percent o f GDP in 2006
to 1.2 percent o f GDP in 2008. An important step was taken in 2008, when Parliament passed
the pharmaceutical law to sustain these measures and outcomes. The government's plan to
centralize pharmaceutical procurement at the county level for all hospitals based on the public
procurement law i s expected to further decrease health expenses.




l3Hungary's poor health outcomes are illustrated by the highest rates o f cancer and cardiovascular disease in the EU. The
recent OECD Health Report (OECD (2008)) provides detailed cross-country comparisons.
l 4 The co-payment was implemented in February 2007 but abolished in April 2008.

90.         Reduction o overcapacity in hospitals. There are substantial overcapacities in the
                         f
hospital sector which have contributed to the sector's indebtedness. In 2006, Parliament
passed the hospital network act to restructure hospitals and reduce the number o f beds. In
April 2007, the M O H closed hospital beds reducing the bed/population ratio to 7.2, which i s
s t i l l substantially above European best practice o f less than 5 beds per 100 persons. The M O H
has taken steps to further consolidate overcapacities by issuing a Ministerial order to
implement the procurement law and centralize procurement o f goods and services in hospitals
at a county level.

91.     The recently passed Status L a w (section 1II.A) will allow the M O H and the local
governments to move hospitals o n a selective basis, toward more corporatized management,
which will open more possibilities for dealing with hospital inefficiencies. The MOH expects
to issue Ministerial Guidelines during 2009 o n norms for implementing the Status Law. In
order to prepare the ground for corporatization, the M O H i s already proceeding with the
clearing o f hospital debts and arrears, defining borrowing restrictions, and introducing annual
independent hospital audits.

overutilization o f care as indicated by highest utilization rates for outpatient care (10.8 visits
per capita per year) and second highest hospitalization rates" (20.8 discharges per 100

moderate over-utilization in hospital care. (See OECD (2008).
                                                                       29
population) in Europe in 2007.16 This situation has been caused by restricted treatment and
prescription authorities for GPs, resulting in high referral rates to specialists, hospital
overcapacities, and the financial incentives set by the fee-for-service payment to specialists
and case-based payments (DRGs) to hospitals. A Governmental decree i s being drafted to
strengthen the role o f GPs with the objective o f reducing the number o f costlier visits to
specialists and hospital admissions, and to be enacted during 2009.

93,    Ensuring an adequate number o GPs. Although migration o f medical personnel to
                                         f
Western Europe i s estimated to be high, this has not yet resulted in a shortage o f staff. In
2006, Hungary reported similar ratios for GPs and nurses per population as other European
~ountries.'~However, demographic surveys show that most GPs are approaching the
retirement age. A draft GP Law currently in discussion in Parliament, aims to facilitate GP
market entry, handover practice rights to younger physicians, and increase future availability.


          IV.       BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A. LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

94.     The World Bank has been working with Hungary since 1982. The last Country
Assistance Strategy was dated 1998, for which a progress report was discussed at the Board in
2002. At that point, Hungary had already discontinued new Bank lending and the focus had
shifted to analytical and advisory support. The last investment project in the portfolio closed
in December 2008.

95.     In 2007, Hungary graduated from World Bank financing but has maintained an active
dialogue and engagement with the Bank since then, making full use o f the limited free
technical assistance available to graduates, which expired at the end o f fiscal year 2009. Post-
graduation collaboration includes several technical cooperation projects to promote Hungary's
energy and climate change objectives, as well as work on reducing undeclared employment
and introduction o f cost-sharing in health and education.

96.     The global financial crisis has led to an exceptional request by the Government o f
Hungary for renewed access to World Bank resources. The crisis has exposed underlying
macro-vulnerabilities, and the deep economic contraction that followed left Hungary with
significant borrowing needs and constrained access to external financing on reasonable terms.
As part o f international efforts to stabilize Hungary's economy, the Bank i s proposing a two-
tranche development policy loan totaling EUR 1 billion (US$ 1.4 billion equivalent). The
DPL i s a part o f the EUR 20 billion package which also includes contributions from the IMF
and the EU.

97.     The proposed operation i s consistent with the Bank's Articles o f Agreement. Pursuant
to Article 111, Section 4 (ii), Bank may make loans if "[it] it satisfied that in the prevailing
                               the
market conditions the borrower would be unable otherwise to obtain the loan under conditions
which in the opinion o f the Bank are reasonable for the borrower." In this case, the Bank i s
satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions, Hungary would have been unable to
otherwise borrow under reasonable terms, given the volatility in the sovereign bond market

l6 Modern health care systems report considerably lower utilization rates: Finland for instance reports 4.3 outpatient visits
and 19 hospital discharges.

                                                              30
and the withdrawal o f non resident investor holdings. While in July 2009, Hungary did
manage to issue a Eurobond on the market, i t s market spread for that, was high in comparison
with similar neighboring central European countries. During the stabilization program,
continued policy dialogue i s envisaged between the Bank and the Hungarian authorities
combined with analytical and advisory activities to support the implementation o f ongoing
structural reforms.

98.      The Bank's involvement in this operation i s also crucial given that, starting during the
crisis in Asia in 1989, Bank technical teams were seen as having a comparative advantage and
specialized skills in issues o f financial sector resolution and restructuring, which were applied
in Asia, and subsequently in Latin America and other regions. Since then, the mechanisms
used for supervisory assessment and enforcement as well as the financial mechanisms for
handling potentially weak or insolvent institutions have been increasingly refined in the Bank,
updated in line with regulatory reforms (e.g.: Basel), and now constitute one o f the core
financial sector policy design products in the Regions and the Network. Such mechanisms
and knowledge are particularly apt in the Hungarian context and in the development o f
measures that imply averting major bank asset or funding losses via the application o f a
variety o f preventive forward looking actions and regulatory powers.

99.     The importance o f the Bank's involvement, given the above, i s also key to ensure that
policies promoting financial stability, along with the IMF and the EU roles, are implemented
in depth considering all scenarios, and providing confidence for the return o f external capital
to the Hungarian economy. The policy actions under the operation are also meant to ensure an
orderly transition out o f a crisis-inducedenvironment and to avoid adverse developments that
could have a contagion effect and a including investor and funding withdrawals from
neighboring countries in Eastern Europe. In this context, the operation provides a
demonstration effect, which, along with the multilateral partners, would show the
effectiveness o f a well designed macro and financial stability program in restoring confidence.

B. COLLABORATION W I T H THE IMF AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

 100. The Bank's assistance i s part o f a joint IF1initiative, where the EBRD, the EIB, and
the World Bank Group have pledged to support banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe
with up to 24.5 billion over a two year period. The Bank program supports and complements
an overall multilateral policy package involving the IMF and the European Union which it i s a
part of. The entire policy reform package amounts to 19.8 billion o f which the Fund has
committed 12.3 billion to Hungary and the European Union 6.5 billion. However, the loan
proposed by the Bank i s a Development Policy Loan with differentiated terms offered by the
Bank in response to the tightening financial markets caused by the global financial crisis and
economic recession.

101, The proposed loan represents the Bank's share o f 1 .O billion in the package. The
Bank team has collaborated closely with the Fund team and discussed the complementarity
and mutually supportive measures covered under the respective institutions' parts. The Bank
has also discussed the measures under the loan with the European Commission
representatives, where there are mutually supporting measures in the social and fiscal sectors
as well as the banking system. In the fiscal sector in particular, the program i s fully consistent


                                                31
with EU Convergence Program targets which the government has committed itself to reaching
in the medium term.

102. The proposed loan supports the overall reform package but also adds a number o f
regulatory and supervisory reforms designed to strengthen the government's ability to mitigate
ongoing and future risks. While the IMF/EU focus i s primarily on support for bank-liability
funding continuity and liquidity management (as well as targeted short term capitalization),
the Bank's focus i s on medium and forward looking measures and credit portfolio risks which
are o f particular concern given latest GDP forecasts.

 103. The proposed loan goes beyond support for immediate banking liquidity needs and
needed fiscal adjustment to regain market confidence; and addresses bank asset quality issues.
This includes, inter alia, having HFSA, the supervisory authority, conduct special intensified-
supervision diagnostics o f ongoing and future solvency prospects o f Hungary's financial
institutions - the new Stability Law will permit the use o f HFSA-funded special auditors for
this purpose. The loan also includes new regulatory and supervisory tools needed to correct
the course o f negative trends in financial institutions in a preventive manner with powers to
halt potential systemic problems and resolve problem banks expeditiously. Additional
structural fiscal measures and social sector reforms in the pension and health sectors ensure
fiscal sustainability while maintaining a level o f basic social expenditures and social
protection.

C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

104. There have not been any recent related Bank operations to which this loan may be
directly linked. Nevertheless, there are early precedents on Bank involvement in the banking
and pensions sector which have a bearing on this operation and where analytical work and
staff continuity exists. The Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (4141-0 HU)
approved in 1997 and which closed in 1998 had components o f banking regulation and
supervision strengthening as well as bank restructuring and privatization. The Public Sector
Adjustment Loan (4275-0 HU), approved in 1998 and which closed in 1999 dealt with the
systemic pension reform which included parametric reforms to the pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
system and the introduction o f a privately funded pillar.

 105. Besides operations, there has also been work on major ESW pieces covering the
banking system. In particular, for the financial system, this includes the last Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) Update conducted in 2005, and the original FSAP conducted in
2001. More recently the Bank has conducted technical assistance activities in 2008 related to
the pay-out phase o f the young privately funded pillar introduced in the 1997 reform.

D. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

 106. Besides a policy loan, other options considered and discussed with the authorities,
included a policy-based guarantee operation. This would have involved the same policy
conditions but using a Bank partial credit (policy-based) guarantee o f new government issued
sovereign debt, given the difficulties with market access that the government was
experiencing. However, since the government recently successfully issued a sovereign
Eurobond in the market, it may wish to keep on monitoring the market first to determine if
access i s maintained, and during the interim, a guarantee option would likely be less critical.

                                               32
 107.    Another option in the policy based guarantee area considered, involved a guarantee
under the Government's safety net liquidity guarantee facility for bank debt (e.g.: interbank
loans provided to banks, bonds issues by banks to fund their liquidity). This option would
have added an additional layer o f credit enhancement to the government's own guarantee o f
bank debt, and which might have been useful for external investors that might have not
considered the government's own guarantee solid enough. This was not pursued as most o f
the banks' liquidity needs were met by foreign parent banks, and in the case o f domestic
banks, the funding needs were provided via available government loans.

E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

108. The knowledge o f the structure and regulatory issues in the financial system are'based
on the last FSAP update report as well as recent updating based on mission work, market
sources and official analysis. The FSAP covered a wide range o f issues from the overall
macro environment and banking sector, to pensions, capital markets and insurance. The
report provided a detailed overview o f the structure o f the financial system and emerging
issues regarding ownership configurations o f financial institutions as well as lending portfolio
growth and composition. It also flagged key issues in the non bank sectors, and recommended
actions for regulatory and supervisory development. Some, but not all o f the issues remain
pertinent for the proposed loan described in this document.

109. The preparation for this operation has also included an assessment o f the risks in the
banking sector and their potential impact on balance sheets. This assessment indicated the
need to deepen diagnostics o f the banks via a new program o f on-site examinations and
forward-looking scenario testing, supported by the loan. Such analysis w i l l incorporate
projected downturns in economic growth, which coupled with less credit availability to
smaller and medium sized enterprises, and potential exchange rate or interest rate changes,
could put a strain on the repayment capacity o f certain borrowers.

110. The analysis o f the above factors, which are primarily forward looking, will take into
account, besides the recent banking stresses caused by lack o f overseas funding sources, the
additional stresses that might materialize for banks, if loans require reclassifications and
additional loss provisioning and possibly incremental capital requirements. Such diagnostics
would form the basis to support supervisory corrective actions needed to stem deteriorating
trends before they become amplified, either at the individual bank - or systemic level.

111. On the macroeconomic front, the Bank has remained engaged through the periodic
production o f the Regular Economic Reports (RERs) for the EU New Member States in which
each country's economic prospects and fiscal trends i s reported and assessed. During
implementation o f this loan a Public Expenditure Review focused on social expenditures w i l l
also be conducted, enabling the continuation o f the policy dialogue in a key area, ensuring a
sustainable fiscal path while maintaining an adequate social safety net.

1 12. In the health and education sectors, the Bank has remained engaged through a variety
o f A A A and technical assistance well received by the authorities on topical issues, In the
pension area, Bank teams started a substantive dialogue with the authorities in early 2008
regarding issues and design o f the post-retirement payout (including annuities) phase o f the
private pension pillar. This work will continue during loan implementation and as part o f
other regional work initiatives in Central Europe.

                                               33
F. LESSONS LEARNED

 113. The FSAP Update conducted in 2005 had identified issues that were not sufficiently
addressed in recent years, but are now incorporated into this proposed operation. These issues
included the risks associated with the growth o f lending in foreign exchange (FX), and the
lack o f supervisory powers o f the HFSA to deal with this and with other issues. This
proposed loan addresses these issues through a variety o f components. For example, the
diagnostic work that will be conducted through the on-site examinations and the stress tests
will identify the need to implement corrective actions at the level o f individual institutions'
risks, as mentioned above. The amendments to the HFSA L a w will provide the supervisor
with forward looking preemptive powers that should prevent unsustainable risks from
emerging in the first place. The lack o f progress in recent years reflects the general failure o f
the Bank to provide sufficient follow-up technical assistance after the FSAPs, not only in
Hungary, but also in most other member countries.

 114. In the area o f pension reform, the past operation also yields valuable lessons for future
reforms and Bank involvement. The 1997 pension reform, supported by the earlier Public
Sector Adjustment Loan, suffered from the lack o f further institutional build-up (e.g. revenue
collection, regulatory capacity) and also from some reform reversals (e.g. post-reform
increases in benefits). Some o f these problems could have been addressed earlier and more
effectively if the Bank had remained engaged. The current loan follows up on the unfinished
agenda items from that reform, in particular the additional parametric changes required in the
public pillar, as well development o f the pay-out phase o f the young privately funded pillar.

            V. THE PROPOSED HUNGARY FINANCIAL SECTOR AND MACRO
                              STABILITY LOAN

A. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE

 115. The objective o f the proposed operation is to support the Government's fiscal reform
and financial stability programs, aimed at ensuring fiscal sustainability and a sound banking
system, thereby restoring investor confidence and Hungary's full access to international
financial markets. These are also pre-conditions for improved growth performance, which i s
the ultimate objective o f the Government's program. The proposed operation would achieve
these targets by contributing to the international financial support package, initiated by the
IMF and the EU and under the objectives o f the Joint IF1 Initiative to support banking sectors
in Central and Eastern Europe, affected by the crisis.

116. The direct financial contribution o f the operation i s relatively modest - 1 billion in an
overall package o f almost 20 billion. However, the overall contribution o f the operation i s
significant, considering the additional reform measures that it supports including institutional
implementation aspects, and that have increased the depth and the breadth o f the
government's programs, as well as the enhancement o f the international seal o f approval to
Hungary's reforms, implicit in the Bank's participation in the international support package.

 1 17. The unfolding international financial crisis provides a strong rationale for the
operation. The crisis was initiated in mature markets, but has been transmitted to Hungary
and other emerging countries through financial and trade channels. While Hungary graduated
from IBRD borrowing in the Spring o f 2007, the government continued an ongoing program
o f analytical and technical assistance work with the Bank, and requested Bank support when
the crisis curtailed the country's access to external finance. The operation i s consistent with
the Bank's mandate in i t s Articles o f Agreement to provide funding to members in the event
they are unable under prevailing market conditions to obtain a loan under reasonable terms.
This was effectively manifested after the sharp rise in government bond spreads and the flight
o f external investors from both the government and the equity markets.

1 18. While it i s true that Hungary had accumulated many macroeconomic imbalances
during the first half o f the decade, the government had already made a substantial effort to
address these imbalances by the time the country was affected by the crisis. Moreover, by
supporting the restoration o f fiscal and financial stability in Hungary, the operation also
generates positive externalities by reducing the risk o f contagion effects to other countries in
Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Finally, the experience gained by Bank staff in dealing
with this early crisis case can be usefully applied to other CEE countries and in other regions.

B. OPERATION DESCRIPTION AND POLICY AREAS

119. The proposed operation supports the government's fiscal reforms and financial
stability program, designed to restore fiscal sustainability and ensure financial stability. The
operation also supports reforms in specific social areas (pensions and health) that aim at
protecting basic social benefits while also contributing to fiscal sustainability. B o x 1 further
below shows the main policy actions supported by the operation, grouped in the four policy
areas. The first column shows the policy actions already met prior to Board approval, while

                                                35
the second column depicts the policy actions required before disbursement o f the second
tranche.

 120. As indicated previously, the operation has been prepared in coordination with the IMF
and the EU. Under the four sectoral areas o f policy actions listed, the IMF/EU components o f
the conditionality as compared with the Bank initiated components contained the following
focus: (a) in the Fiscal area, the IMF and EU primarily engaged on the deficit and debt
reduction measures, while the Bank worked primarily on the legal status law, social program
expenditures and revenue, and the fiscal council; (b) in the banking area, the I M F / E U program
primarily supported the crisis architecture involving the liquidity and capitalization
mechanisms - while the Bank engaged mainly in the development o f the supervisory
framework, loan classification, enhanced on-site inspections, scenario stress analyses, and
supervisory corrective actions.

121, In the Pensions section, the first reforms included an IMF/EU supported component
(pension expenditure reductions) while the Bank initiated the dialogue on pension system
projections and reducing the 13'h pension and i t s ceiling more permanently - in the second
area (the private pension pillar) the Bank has had an ongoing policy dialogue with the
government. In the Health area, the Bank mainly focused on these reforms and engagement
with the government.

Fiscal Reforms (first and second tranche conditions)

 122. Revenue Neutral Growth Bolstering Measures. For the first tranche, the operation
supports the government enactment o f a revenue-neutral tax reform which together with
reforms to trim and better target social benefits, are intended to support growth potential and
encourage work and employment. The main measures, resulting in lowering the labor tax
wedge (from 54.1% in 2008 to below 46% by 2010), include a 5-percentage-point reduction in
the social contribution rate paid by employers, cuts in the 18 and 36 percent rates to 17 and 32
percent, respectively, a higher placement o f the tax brackets, and redefinition o f taxable
income to expand the tax base, along with the gradual withdrawal o f deductions and
allowances. Ninety percent o f the taxpayers will be liable for a lower rate, and for mid-
income earners the marginal tax rate will be significantly lower.

123, Operation o the Independent Fiscal Council. The first tranche o f the operation
                     f
supports the establishment under the FRL law o f an independent budget analysis body
reporting directly to the Parliament, named the Fiscal Council, and providing an autonomous
assessment o f budget, revenue and macroeconomic projections including a view o f the
Administration prepared budget. Under the second tranche, the initial budget and resource
allocation to allow for the operation o f the Fiscal Council, would be assured, and it will have
been verified that the Council will have begun i t s operations under i t s defined mandate.

 124. Approval and Regulation o the Legal Status Law. As a first tranche policy action,
                                  f
the proposed operation supports the Parliamentary approval o f the Legal Status L a w and
Management o f Budgetary Institutions. As 'explained in Section 111, this law aims to reform
the regulatory and operating framework o f public budget-funded institutions and increase
public sector budgetary performance and service delivery. By the second tranche, the
government will have issued the necessary Decrees specifying the operational requirements

                                               36
for public institutions to begin implementing budget and performance monitoring reports, and
business plan proposals to meet the objectives o f the law.

125. Expenditure Measuresfor Sustainability in the Social Support System. For the
second tranche, the operation will support the implementation o f reforms in the fiscal sector
particularly covering health services, child-care benefits, family allowances, housing subsidies
household gas consumption and district heating. Implementation o f these reforms and
allocation o f corresponding budgets will ensure improvement in the financial sustainability o f
the social support system, including the tightening o f eligibility criteria and improved
targeting o f benefits, allowing the necessary fiscal adjustment required to reach the deficit
target o f 3.9 percent o f GDP, as well as the inclusion o f incentives toward work and
employment to achieve savings in the social benefits system, for employable able workers.

126. Consolidation o the Fiscal Adjustment (IMFEU conditions). The proposed
                         f
operation supports the deepening o f the fiscal adjustment and structural measures designed to
ensure long-run fiscal sustainability. As shown in Box 1, as a prior action under the
multilateral package, Parliament approved the 2009 Budget Bill that includes further reduction
in the deficit. For the second tranche, the verification o f broad compliance with the fiscal
program through verification o f a reduction o f the cyclically adjusted deficit, would constitute
a key condition.

127. Approval and Implementation o the Fiscal Responsibility Law (IMFEU
                                          f
conditions). Parliamentary approval o f the new Fiscal Responsibility L a w (FRL) in
December 2008 is a key structural measure, and while initiated under the I M F / E U discussion
it constitutes a core basis for the Bank program conditions. As noted in Section 111, the law
introduces critical rules ensuring fiscal discipline and constitutes a major reform in the
conduct o f public finances. Under the FRL, a fiscal/budgetary council has been nominated.
The operation will verify that the FRL rules have been met in 2009 and that a fiscal council
has been appointed by Parliament and i s well resourced.

The Financial Sector Stability Program (first and second tranche conditions)

128. The proposed operation supports the Government's financial sector stability program
addressing a number o f elements, both immediate and forward looking. Immediate measures
were tackled in the IMF/EU package, addressing bank funding and liquidity shortages
generated from the worldwide contraction o f credit. As the financial crisis unfolded, and
economic activity in the EU continues to contract, additional forward looking measures are
being put in place to ensure that banks have sufficient capital cushions, an area where the
Bank has contributed in formulating policy measures.

 129. Intensified On-Site Inspections o Banks. A key component o f the operation i s the
                                             f
initiation under the first tranche, via an HFSA resolution, o f intensified on-site supervision
examinations and diagnostic procedures in order to assess banks' portfolio quality, reserves,
provisions, capital levels, consolidated group risks, credit assessment procedures, institutional
governance and other factors. These on-site inspection and diagnostic processes will be
crucial for taking a snapshot o f banks' balances sheet assets, sampling o f credit portfolios, and
other diagnostics to measure vulnerabilities, so as to identify embedded risks. I t will be used
to assess the current state o f the financial system in Hungary, and conducted for the at least the
banks covering 75 percent o f banking system assets, or the 8 largest systemically important
                                                37
banks. The Bank has assisted the supervisory authorities in crafting terms o f reference for the
exercise and provided inputs in risk elements to address. Under the second tranche, the
authorities will have completed these intensified inspections and undertaken the necessary
regulatory and supervisory corrective measures toward subject banks, to preempt deterioration
in bank capital, financial condition and lending or other business practices.

130. Scenario Stress Test Analyses. Given the adverse macroeconomic scenario projected
for the next 2 years, under the operation's first tranche, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Central
Bank or MNB) will conduct a stress test using estimates o f economic projections (GDP
growth, unemployment, interest and exchange rates, loan repayment capacities, other factors)
to assess the stresses on bank balance sheets and the potential need for forward looking
provisioning or recapitalization to confront upcoming risks. This exercise (expected to be
completed prior to the second tranche) will cover banks representing at least 75 percent o f
assets in the system, and serve as input to the MNB, HFSA and the government to carry out
any needed proactive supervisory actions that should be applied to maintain the sector fully
solvent and protected.

13 1. Supervisory Corrective Programs. By the second tranche, as per above, both the
scenario stress test analyses and the intensified inspections program, will have been completed
and used as diagnostic inputs for the financial authorities to issue corrective actions to banks,
to initiate and implement financial improvement plans to assure adequate capitalization.

132. Protection o Depositors. T o avoid further liquidity pressures via depositor
                     f
withdrawals, the government, in line with EU wide directives, increased depositor coverage
from 20,000 to approximately 50,000 per depositor for each bank and introduced a blanket
guarantee. Under the operation's first tranche, the governing Board o f the Deposit Insurance
Fund (DIF) will have increased the premium charged to banks to better fund the expanded
potential obligations o f the DIF in line with the increased coverage. The premium (as a
percentage o f the insured deposits) i s to be increased from 0.9 to 2.0 basis points o f such
deposits.

 133, Increased Supervisory Options under Situations o Instability. The government will
                                                               f
provide additional flexibility and ability o f the H F S A to work effectively within a potential
unstable financial sector situation. In order to ensure a quicker and more adequate "on-time"
flow o f information and diagnosis o f banks in such environment, under the first tranche, the
Financial Stability Law will provide the supervisory authorities powers to require ad hoc
extraordinary financial reporting from banks to assess their quickly evolving financial
situation, as well as to permit inspections to be extended for up to one year under such
scenarios. As well, the law will also allow the supervisory authority to appoint a qualified
forensic auditor to assist in critical diagnoses during the course o f an examination.

134. Strengthened Supervisory Powers for Prompt Action. The current pressures on the
financial system demand proactive and preventive supervisory functions and strengthened
regulation. Under the second tranche, the operation directly supports the submission to
Parliament o f amended legislation to strengthen supervisory powers. The legal amendments
will permit authorities to take systemic actions applied to the sector as a whole upon the
manifestation o f risks that affect all banks. Another feature o f the amendment under the
second tranche, i s providing authorities powers to issue forward looking corrective actions to
individual banks if their risks are rising, even if they are not legally contravening codified
                                               38
banking regulations. Such powers will be crucial as banks' portfolio quality may be affected
with the economic downturn.

 135. Restructured Loan Classification Regulations. For the second tranche, the operation
supports the implementation o f stricter rules on rescheduled, refinanced or renegotiated loans
for accounting purposes, to ensure that such loans and their classification, take into account
the inherent borrower risks that prompted such modifications and any projected losses on such
loans. As part o f the operation, the government w i l l prepare a modified regulatory Decree
specifying the criteria and loan valuation norms for restructured/rescheduledloans, and the
appropriate loan classification and related loss provisioning requirements.

136. Liquidity Facilities (IMFEU conditions). Facilities aimed for both the foreign
exchange and domestic currency markets are a critical part o f the financial architecture.
Foreign exchange (FX) availability i s supported through an FX facility agreed with the ECB.
For domestic currency, beyond overnight funding, MNB established a 2-week t e r m lending
window with expanded eligible collateral instruments such as highly rated covered mortgage
bonds," and a six-month t e r m variable priced loan window.

137. Bank Debt Guarantee Facility (IMFBU conditions). Besides short t e r m liquidity
needs, banks require access to longer t e r m funding particularly for banks without foreign
`parents.' The Financial Stability Law introduced a new Guarantee Facility, where the
government, for a fee, guarantees repayment o f funds from third parties that provide credit to
banks (bond investors, interbank creditors, other creditors).

138. Bank Capital Support (IMFBU conditions). The Financial Stability Law also
created a Capital Base Enhancement Fund (CBEF) to provide capital injections for
systemically important banks. The CBEF provides clear government exit mechanisms based
on the maintenance o f capital levels and earnings o f a subject bank.

Pension Reforms (first and second tranche conditions)

 139. Parametric Reforms for the Sustainability o the Public Pension Pillar. Under the
                                                          f
first tranche, the operation will support a major reform to ensure the funding sustainability o f
the publicly funded pension system. This includes a number o f new reforms which also have
a positive fiscal impact. The reforms, reflected in amendments to the Pension Law, include:
(a) a phased increase in the retirement age from 62 to 65, starting from 2012, (b) introduction
o f penalties to discourage early retirement, (c) elimination o f the 13th month pension, (d)
tightening o f pension disability criteria, and (e) introduction o f a new pension indexation r u l e
leaning towards price versus wage indexation and which would weight the indexation by both,
according to GDP growth levels as follows: (i) GDP growth lower than 3%, the price
                                                    For
(inflation) index would have a 100% weight; (ii) GDP growth between 3% and 4%, index
                                                      for
weights would be 80% for prices and 20% wages; (iii) GDP between 4% and 5%, a 60%
                                                            for
weight for prices would apply and 40% for wages, and (iv) for growth above 5%, the index
weights would be divided on a 50/50 basis.

secondpillar. The new private pillar introduced in 1997 accumulated a substantial volume o f
assets, and the first cohorts enrolled in this pillar will start retiring in 20 13. The institutional
and regulatory framework for a well managed, market-based payout phase has not yet been
prepared, however. To ensure progress in this key area, the second tranche o f the operation
would support the submission to cabinet o f draft proposals to the pension law regulating the
payout phase, including the menu o f retirement products, annuities, indexation rules, the
institutional framework for providers, solvency rules, as well as marketing rules. The Bank i s
expected to provide technical and policy input for this task.

14 1. Budget Reforms to the PA YG System ( I M F / E U conditions). The operation supports
Parliamentary approval o f amendments to the Pension L a w under the multilateral package,
and which constitute an important step towards greater pension sustainability. This package
o f measures (being implemented over the 2008-2010 period) which were implemented at the
start o f the IMF led program, restrict early retirement, eliminate the 13'h pension bonus for
early retirees, and introduce a ceiling (equal to the average pension) for other retirees.

Health Reforms (first and second tranche conditions)

142. Efficiencies in Health Services Management. Under the first tranche, following
Parliamentary approval o f the Pharmaceutical Law, the containment o f pharmaceutical
expenditures will be implemented through the approval o f regulations by the Ministry o f
Health (MoH), promoting cost containment in medical appliances and expenditures.

143. Implementation o Legal Status Law Provisions. By the second tranche MoH
                          f
Guidelines will be issued to support improved financial and debt management, and efficient
organizational and cost structures for hospitals, to more closely approach corporate practices,
as contemplated under the Legal Status L a w for public institutions.

144. Role o General Practitioners (GP) in the Provision o Health Care. Under the
             f                                                    f
second tranche, a M o H Decree will be issued, increasing the role o f the GP practice, allowing
GPs more authority to issue prescriptions for special conditions, thus reducing, for example,
medical costs o f specialist visits, solely for prescription renewals.

                             Box 2. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
There i s ownership commitment at the executive, parliamentary and industry level as evidenced by a number o f
policy actions taken under the multilateral package. The government had already embarked on a macroeconomic
and fiscal adjustment path prior to the events that gave rise to the need for the multilateral support package. The
Bank's contribution i s based on analysis conducted during preparation and accepted by the authorities as the
basis for further policy actions to add to and strengthen the set of reforms underway. The Bank team includes
experts with lengthy field experience in the country and knowledge o f the executive, parliamentary, and other
consultative and consensus building procedures.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The accountability framework delineated in the policy matrix contains very specific actions with associated
indicators for measuring results to gauge success o f the program. The program i s very closely coordinated with
the other collaborating donors/partners, namely, the IMF and the EU with mutually supporting measures..

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o Bank support to country
                                                                    f
circumstances
The financing package and associated policy measures are specifically geared to both the government's funding
(and contingency) needs as well as to mitigate future risks generated by the global financial turmoil. As such, the
measures are tailored directly to Hungary's situation and the funding i s earmarked for specific or potential gaps,
with a view to ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability while external economic effects fully roll out.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
The policy actions are maintained at a modest number but with sufficient critical mass, focusing on those that are
considered crucial toward strengthening the banking, fiscal and social package. The actions are those which
contain key added value features as contributions from the Bank to the policy agenda. Other actions, already
agreed with the other donors/partners, are essential to the overall basis of the program and listed supporting
measures to be maintained during the execution of the program, and which complement the policy measures
developed by the Government in collaboration with the Bank.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable andperformance-basedfinancial
support
Monitoring o f the program will take place during loan implementation as a second tranche i s embedded within
the implementation period. Key fiscal conditions are aligned with the government's budget cycle and monitoring
indicators will include measures included and approved during the government's future year budget program.
The banking diagnostic indicators are built into the financial supervisory authorities' inspection cycle, and the
results emerging from such will form part of the monitorable actions to be taken under the program to provide in-
course feedback mechanisms and ensure the financial health of the banking system.




C. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE OPERATION

145. The main long-run objectives o f the operation include the achievement o f overall
fiscal sustainability and the restoration o f financial stability and efficient markets as evidenced
by the improvement in economic, financial and market indicators. In the pension and health
areas the long-run objective i s to generate adequate outcomes (adequate pensions, improved
health status o f the population) while avoiding chronic large deficits. The long-run objectives
in these two latter areas include a strong fiscal component that also contributes to the
objective o f fiscal sustainability.

                                                        42
146. Fiscal sustainability would be reflected in a significant decline in the ratio o f public
debt to GDP, down from the high ratio o f close to 80 percent in 2009. The debt rule
introduced by the Fiscal Responsibility L a w (preventing an increase in real debt) will ensure a
sustained decline in the ratio o f debt to GDP in the medium- and long-run, but this r u l e will
only apply from 20 12 onwards. In the intermediate years, the ratio i s actually expected to
increase slightly, due to the contraction o f GDP and high real interest rates. Therefore, the
effectiveness o f the program will be assessed by monitoring intermediate outcomes.

147. As shown in Table 8 the expected outcomes in the fiscal area would include an
improvement in the government primary surplus by 2010 to no less than 0.5 percent o f GDP.
If the fiscal program i s able to improve investor confidence, this improvement should be
reflected in reductions in the credit default swap (CDS) spreads in absolute terms and relative
to peer countries, reductions in borrowing spreads relative to EU treasury securities, and
reduced interest rate swap spreads. The latter indicator would also be used to assess
improvements in market liquidity; notwithstanding that some o f the outcome indicators are
beyond the direct control o f government.

148. The financial stability program i s expected to ensure a resilient and well capitalized
banking system, able to compete and intermediate efficiently. By the end o f the program, all
the banks should have robust capital adequacy ratios, considering the results o f the assisted
on-site examinations and stress tests. The program should also lead to lower and safer
loaddeposit ratios and lower shares o f FX loans within total household loans. The ratio o f
private credit to GDP (a celebrated indicator o f financial depth) would not be used as a
benchmark o f program effectiveness, mainly because this ratio may decline during the
program period given economic contraction, and due to funding restrictions and ongoing
balance sheet adjustments (which should result inter alia in the lower loan to deposit ratios).

 149. The expected outcomes in the pension area would include an increase in the effective
retirement age and stabilizing o f pension expenditures - aggregate fiscal expenditures under
the public pillar should be reduced by the end o f the program. If all the measures designed to
restrict early retirement are effectively implemented, the average retirement age should
increase and approach the statutory age, improving the sustainability o f the pension system.
As well, the penalties for early retirement and the elimination o f the 13'h pension will generate
more cost reductions. The impact o f the program on pension expenditures would be assessed
by monitoring the trend o f the pension deficit, or the gap between contribution revenues and
pension payments which should decline or remain constant in the medium term. If
expenditures increase at lower rates, considering all the above factors, this would be evidence
that the elements o f the reform are producing an effect. The ratio o f pension expenditures to
GDP would not be monitored, because it could increase in a period when GDP i s contracting.

 150. Some o f the reforms in the health area may not produce sizable effects by the end o f
the program. For example, it may take time to reduce the overcapacity in hospitals, as this
will s t i l l require the implementation o f restructuring plans and the completion o f
corporatization o f hospitals. However, the approval o f the pharmaceutical law in 2008, and
regulations on cost containment o f drugs and medical appliances should stabilize real
expenditures in pharmaceuticals and hospital equipment at the 2008 levels. The enactment o f
the Government Decree enhancing the role o f General Practitioners should reduce overall visit
rates for outpatient care, and prescription renewals, versus costlier visits to specialists.

                                    VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
 15 1. The global financial crisis will continue to pose potentially serious economic risks
to poverty and vulnerability in Hungary. The EC has forecast a more than 4 percent GDP
contraction in 2009 and unemployment rates, a lagging indicator, have increased sharply in
the first quarter o f 2009 to 9.7 percent from 8 percent a year earlier. The rapid worsening in
labor market conditions i s particularly pronounced among the youth, where more than one in
four 15-24 year olds i s unemployed, a rise from 20.2 percent a year earlier. Job losses have
been more concentrated among unskilled labor and for the first time male unemployment rates
exceed female unemployment rate^.'^ The strain on the labor market i s also demonstrated by
the rise in part-time employment, which rose by 13 percent in Q 1 2009 relative to a year
earlier.



l9   Unlike in the recent past, job losses are leading to increased unemployment rather than to increased inactivity.
                                                               44
152. The loan promotes measures that would facilitate growth and thus mitigate
worsening secondary effects from the global crisis. Despite the adverse external factors
surrounding this operation, the policies included in the loan have been designed to protect the
funding o f basic needs and services for low income segments. Any directly negative
socioeconomic impacts o f the program, are within acceptable limits given Hungary's
comprehensive and extensive welfare system and in view o f the need to adopt austerity
measures to ensure sustainability and promote economic growth.

153. Poverty rates in Hungary are low relative to other ECA countries (which in
aggregate, i s the region with the lowest poverty rate) but certain segments are
vulnerable to poverty. Eight percent o f the population lived below the poverty line (PPP
US$Slday) in 2005, down from 10.3 percent in 2002. While poverty and human development
indicators are generally better than regional averages, there s t i l l remain issues o f economic
integration o f minority groups (e.g. the Roma) who can easily fall into poverty. Extreme
poverty rates, however, are very low, with two percent o f the population living on less than
PPP US$2/day.

 154. Hungary, like other Central European countries, inherited an extensive social
protection system designed to complement low wages and redistribute income. Although
the system helped to cushion the impact o f the transition and subsequent economic downturns,
social transfers have imposed an enormous burden on public expenditures. Hungary spends
2 1.4% o f GDP on social protection, which i s one o f the highest rates in the EU and i s second
only to Slovenia o f the EU-8 countries. Benefits as a share o f disposable incomes are also
very high at 33 percent (Figure 11). A t 2.8 percent o f GDP, spending on social assistance i s
high relative to other countries in ECA, largely due to universal family and child benefits,
where however, relatively greater subsidies are paid to younger, poorer, and single-parent
households. In addition to the fiscal burden, the relatively generous (by ECA standards) social
assistance has, along with the pension system, triggered work disincentives - Hungary has the
second lowest activity rate in the OECD. In addition, Hungary i s the only country in the EU-
 10 where unemployment rates have steadily climbed since 200 1.

                                                     45
155. T o improve the sustainability o f the public pensions system, the Government has
introduced parametric reforms with limited negative impact on the poor. From a
distributional point o f view, abolishing the 13'h pension payment i s likely to impose the
biggest direct short run impact. In order to cushion the impact on the poor, a portion o f the
13thpayment will continue until 2010 for lower income recipients. From 2010, the 13th
payment will be eliminated for all pension recipients. However, the distributional analysis
conducted by M o F shows that less that 1 percent o f the population will fall below the poverty
line as a consequence o f eliminating the 13'h payment, which i s consistent with the finding
that households receiving pensions are clusters in the middle o f the income distribution.20 The
relatively small poverty impact can be mitigated by ensuring that regular social assistance be
made available to elderly people who qualify, and that the work requirements are exempt for
elderly people.

156. The distributional impacts o f the increase in the effective retirement age i s yet
unclear.2' Women will be affected more since they tend to take advantage o f early retirement
provisions more often. However, to the extent that the affected older population i s
employable, their incomes will actually rise because o f this measure (they will receive a wage
instead o f the pension for a few years, and the subsequent pension will be higher). The effect
on vulnerable people i s mitigated by following factors:

0    unemployment, disability and/or social assistance programs are available;
     the most vulnerable population, namely those people in the informal sector, are not
     covered by the social security scheme and hence are not affected. The exception might be
     old unemployed people who may have qualified for early retirement pension under current
     rules, but will have to spend more time drawing from unemployment and/or social
     assistance programs under the new rules. However, the chronically unemployed likely do
     not qualify for the early retirement benefit since they lack the required length o f service;
0    the reform will be implemented in 2010, and hence, will allow individuals to plan their
     strategy to deal with the change.

157.     T o improve the financial sustainability of social assistance and to increase the
employment rate in the country, a work requirement has been instituted. The work
requirement, which applies to people who are capable o f work, demands at least 90 days per
year o f public works participation. T o ease the difficulties o f this work requirement on some
groups, the Government has included exemptions from this work requirement for people
under 35 who have not completed the Sth class o f primary school, health impaired, elderly (55
years and older), and persons who bring up a child under 14. Besides the community asset
creatiodmaintenance benefit o f public works, the work requirement is likely to dissuade some
people from exiting the labor force. This incentive to remain in the labor force is crucial
because, as mentioned earlier, Hungary has the 2ndlowest activity rate among OECD
countries. 57 percent o f the population aged 15 to 64 years are employed, while the average

income, which i s also the Laeken poverty measure. The pre- and post-reform poverty rates are calculated assuming that the
poverty threshold remains constant before and after the 13'h payment i s eliminated. If however, relative poverty measures are
used in both pre- and post-reform periods, then the change in the poverty rate i s negligible.
*'This reform can also be interpreted as a removal of unfair subsidy in the early retirement provision, rather than as a
reduction of the benefit.
                                                             46
employment rate i s 64 percent in the EU-27 and only Poland has a lower employment rate
among the former socialist EU members.2z

158. T o reduce the tax wedge on labor, the Government has adopted tax reforms but
static simulations show that these reforms may hurt the poor. M o F simulations using the
TARSZIM micro-simulation model reveals that changes in the VAT will reduce the after tax
position o f households in quintile 1 by about 5.3 percent, while reductions in the personal
income taxes will increase the after tax position o f the poorest households by 0.32 percent.
However, available simulations do not incorporate expected behavioral changes, which are
crucial to evaluating the distributional impact. As a result, changes in consumption patterns
and changes in employment rates are not simulated in the T A R S Z I M micro-simulation model.

159. The basic health benefits package i s maintained at existing levels and i s not part
of adjustment policies, to ensure that basic service needs continue to be met despite
expenditure cuts in the public sector and other programs. Hungary currently has the
highest service use rate for outpatient and inpatient care in Europe. Reforms are expected to
reduce the number o f outpatient visits and lead to efficiency gains. As there i s no co-payment
for health care services i t i s not likely that this expected reduction would lead to inequality in
service use.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

160. The specific country policies supported by the operation are not likely to cause
significant effects on the country's environment and natural resources. Moreover, Hungary
has adequate environmental controls in place. Hungary's environmental legislation and
regulation i s reinforced by EU environmental directives, including the EU's guidelines on
adoption o f environmental assessments at the planning and programming level (June 2001)
and the EU' s Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for damage to properties
and natural resources (April 2007). None o f the sectors included in the operation are expected
to have any significant link to the environment.

C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

 16 1. Implementation o f the loan will require close coordination among the Bank and the
respective institutions responsible for implementation. These include the Ministry o f Finance,
the Central Bank (MNB), the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority, and the Ministry o f
Health, all o f which have provided the requisite baseline data from which to measure
outcomes by the end o f the program. The Ministry o f Finance will assist in the coordination
o f information reporting on the program's monitoring indicators which will be assessed and
discussed among the Bank team and the implementing agencies during field visits between the
first and the second tranches, and supplemented by periodic electronic communications and
exchange o f information.

162. The implementation actions which are set forth in the policy matrix (Annex 2) as prior
actions for each tranche, require careful institutional interventions which will be areas o f
discussion and technical exchange among the implementing institutions and the Bank. In this


22Research has shown that Hungary,'s welfare system i s too generous and i s leading to low employment rates.

Working Paper No. 17, Budapest, Hungary.

respect, technical cooperation during the monitoring and implementation i s expected to be
significant, with the Bank providing, in some cases, examples o f best practices which can
serve as models for certain institutional actions (e.g.: carrying out the terms o f reference for
special bank diagnostics methodologies, and generating the needed supervisory actions based
on the portfolio quality and loan provisioning for specific cases).

163. At the overall program level, including the signals that the adjustment effort i s sending
to the investor market, external monitoring indicators will also be used. These include market
spreads on credit default swaps for sovereign bonds, as well as emerging market bond index
(EMBI) reported spreads. Independent o f the macroeconomic and banking sector adjustment
actions being taken, these monitoring indicators will serve as useful market benchmarks to
determine if the overall actions under the operation are generating the desired market
responses and fully restoring Hungary's access to the capital markets.

164. At the banking sector level, several sectoral indicators w i l l be used to monitor progress
in fully implementing policy reforms and achieving desired program outcomes. The Bank, in
collaboration with the Hungarian financial authorities w i l l continue to monitor the non-
deposit funding sources for domestic banks (parent funding, third party funding, wholesale
funding, other sources) and assess the terms o f such funding (maturities and rates) to
determine if such resources are being maintained or increased thus assuring more stable bank
funding. Likewise, the trends in deposits at banks will continue to be monitored, and there i s
already evidence that these have begun,to increase, partly due to the broader more inclusive
guarantee on deposits that the government has given.

165. At a measurable level, a key indicator o f banking strength w i l l be determined through
the evaluation o f overall capital levels and financial condition o f credit institutions. B y
implementing the policy actions related to special diagnostics and stress tests, as well as the
regulatory actions requiring the adequate provisioning for potential loan losses, foreign
exchange, or other risks, which would be followed by implementation o f adequate overall
solvency capital levels, the monitoring process under the operation will allow an overall
evaluation o f the capital position o f banks, profitability, and capacity for new lending. These
indicators will be crucial for evaluating the impact o f the operation's policy changes and for
ensuring that the financial system i s ready to emerge from the global and regional economic
downturn from a position o f strength.

166. At the institutional level, results reflecting institutional change and capacity will be
assessed primarily through the application o f the newly approved laws and regulations. The
evidence o f supervisory prompt enforcement action regarding both forward looking risks as
well as corrective measures applied,to financial institutions where necessary, will be key
determinants regarding the efficacy o f the supervisory agency in applying preemptive actions.
While such information may be o f a confidential nature for specific banking institutions, the
Bank team will nevertheless agree with the government on sharing information demonstrating
that the application o f new powers and corrective actions (or special resolution procedures)
meant to address deteriorating financial trends at a very early state, and minimizing further
losses, have indeed been applied and in what number and type. At a qualitative level, the
flexibility in redeploying resources and applying regulatory actions based on new diagnostics
w i l l also be assessed as part o f the institutional readiness for reform under the program.

167. In other areas o f the operation, such as the fiscal program, indicators will be based
mainly on the macroeconomic and fiscal expenditure reporting. In conjunction with IMF
                                              48
monitoring o f the same, the Bank w i l l liaise with the Ministry o f Finance in order to receive
government reports on fiscal expenditures against program targets and debt levels
commensurate with the policy changes incorporated in the implementation o f the new Fiscal
Responsibility Law and specific expenditure reduction measures. At the institutional level,
besides the enactment o f the Law on the Legal Status o f Budget Institutions, monitoring o f the
law's adoption and application by samples o f public institutions w i l l be conducted with a view
toward determining the success and results o f i t s implementation (e.g.: reform plans for
institutions wishing to raise own-revenue sources, reduce their debts, and overall budgetary
efficiency goals and achievements).

168. Within the social sector aspect o f the operation, the monitoring o f results w i l l include
both quantitative and qualitative measures. Progress in streamlining public pillar pension
expenditures and targeting benefits for the basic pension segments, will be monitored via MoF
reporting on adherence to the pension spending targets and maintenance o f the parametric
reforms introduced. For the private pillar, the main evaluation will be qualitative and based
on the proposed pay-out/annuities design o f the system (to be a joint effort by the MoF and the
HFSA) which w i l l be assessed based on i t s effectiveness in addressing the market risks,
actuarial risks, burden sharing aspects (among beneficiaries, the industry and government),
retiree/consumer protection issues, and other market and benefit options included in the
second pillar pension pay-out design.

169. In the health sector, assessments o f the implementation o f institutional changes. w i l l be
conducted throughout the program. Measurable indicators will be used for assessing the cost
efficiency, quality, and savings achieved via the new consolidated procurement procedures for
the purchase o f medical supplies and drugs. Monitoring o f other reforms will be conducted
through assessing the Health Ministry's progress in promoting more efficient expenditure and
contract management procedures, for example, o f the Health Insurance Fund, as well as
progress in the reforms towards corporatizing and making health agencies and hospitals more
cost effective and fiscally s e l f sufficient.

D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System and Budgetary

170. The Hungarian Public Financial Management (PFM) system i s supported by a robust
legal and institutional framework. Although the PFM system had been fairly well performing,
Hungary introduced a series o f PFM reforms during the 2006-2008, after joining the European
Union. Most important was the introduction o f a medium term framework to improve fiscal
discipline and providing greater budgetary transparency and predictability.

171. In addition, the Fiscal Responsibility Law, passed by the Parliament on November 17,
2008, introduced further significant reforms. They include the preparation o f the budget for a
two year period with a primary surplus target, and state debt maintained at a constant real
level. Based on the two year budget the government shall issue a decree with planned revenue
and expenditure limits o f the budget program categories (chapters). More extensive budgetary


23AsHungary joined EU in 2004 and graduated from the World Bank financial assistance in 2007, no recent analytical work
on PFM had been conducted by the Bank in Hungary. Therefore, the assessment and adequacy o f the PFM system to support
this operation were derived from the ongoing monitoring by the Bank, o f PFM reforms and previous diagnostic work
conducted by the Bank and external organizations.
                                                         49
oversight w i l l also be performed by the three-member Budget Council, nominated by the
president, the central bank governor and the head o f the State Audit Office.

172. The Budget Council will have the mandate to make macroeconomic forecasts, monitor
the performance o f the budget, and evaluate the budget impact o f the proposed legislation.
Additional enforcement mechanisms will be introduced including inter alia setting limits on
primary central state spending, and treatment o f unplanned surpluses. The new set o f fiscal
reforms aims at restricting budget policy and i s a long awaited measure to bring down the
country's debt to a sustainable level and curb budget spending in the long term.

173. The key strengths o f the PFM system in Hungary include integration o f expenditures
and special funds within the budget, centralized cash management within a single treasury
account structure, timely preparation and audit o f government financial statements, and a
strong audit capacity o f the State Audit Office. Key weaknesses, including the budgetary
framework being exposed to fiscal slippages, weak multi-annual planning, inadequate
budgetary enforcement, and lack o f institutional checks and balances, are addressed by the
2008 reforms that w i l l start implementation during the 2009 fiscal year.

 174. Notwithstanding the ongoing reforms and a series o f other actions required to improve
the financial accountability framework in Hungary, the fiduciary risk to Bank funds and other
donor funds managed through the mainstream government system remains minimal.

Foreign Exchange Environment

175. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB or central bank o f Hungary) i s legally independent
and has no role in the financing o f the fiscal deficit. The MNB i s a member o f the European
System o f Central Banks, and i t s legal independence i s granted by the Act o f the MNB. The
Act prohibits MNB financing o f the government fiscal deficit, describes i t s responsibilities
regarding management o f the single treasury account and other government accounts held at      ,


MNB, and regulates profit transfers to the budget. The MNB has full operational autonomy in
setting monetary policy. It holds and manages the foreign exchange reserves o f the country.
The government and the MNB mutually decide on the parameters o f the exchange rate regime
in accordance with the Act which makes exchange rate policy a shared responsibility.

 176. A n I M F Safeguards Assessment o f MNB i s being completed. A review o f external
audit reports o f the central bank was performed by the World Bank. The MNB's financial
management and operations are transparently disclosed and presented on i t s website. The
MNB annual financial statements are regularly audited by reputable independent auditors and
the most recent audit reports for 2005-07 have unqualified audit opinions.

E. DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS

177. The proposed loan will follow the World Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy lending. Loan proceeds w i l l be disbursed in two tranches to the foreign
currency account at the MNB. Disbursement w i l l be made upon declaration o f loan
effectiveness, meeting tranche conditions, and submission o f a withdrawal application to
IBRD. At the request o f the MOF, IBRD w i l l deposit the proceeds o f the loan into the
designated account at the MNB - this forming part o f the country's official foreign exchange
reserves.

                                              50
     178. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Loan into said account, an
    equivalent amount i s credited in local currency24to the Single Treasury Account also kept at
    MNB and available to finance budgeted expenditures. Disbursements will not be linked to
    specific purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The Government
    shall maintain accounts and records with respect to the deposit o f loan proceeds in MNB. If
    the loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD will
    require the borrower to refund the amount directly to IBRD.

    179. The Bank will not require an audit o f the designated account, but will require the
    Government to provide a confirmation to the Bank in the form o f an official letter from the
    Ministry o f Finance on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to
    the budget management system (Single Treasury Account) within 30 days o f receiving the
    funds.

    F. R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

     180. Further worsening o f the external and macroeconomic environment. The
    financial crisis continues to generate effects, despite the rescue programs implemented in
    many developed countries. There i s a risk that money and credit markets will remain clogged
    and that the downturn in the EU will be more severe and protracted than currently projected.
    The access to foreign exchange finance would remain restricted and the exchange rate could
    remain volatile. The contraction o f real GDP and the increase in unemployment in 2009 and
    20 10 could be more pronounced than anticipated. Parent banks could potentially reduce their
    funding if their own balance sheets became constrained. This would further strain banks and
    the corporate sector, and could also create difficulties for the achievement o f fiscal targets.

    18 1. The multilateral package i s geared toward a worse case scenario o f a significant
    shortage o f external funding, in order to mitigate these risks. Hungary's financing
    requirements would be met, reducing the risk o f further strains on the banks and the corporate
    sector, and reducing the need for even more drastic fiscal adjustments. Nevertheless, recent
    signs o f the external environment (despite further contraction domestically) show that external
    lenders are now increasingly willing to fund Hungary via the market. The fiscal adjustment
    has been very sharp, but credible, and backed by the multilateral package. The Program also
    mitigates risks in the banking system through the in-depth assisted examinations and the
    substantial strengthening o f supervisory powers with options for prompt action to avert
    contagion effects. Parent banks would likely avoid withdrawal (and in the past months their
    funding has increased to Hungary) given the regional contagion effects this could produce and
    affect their own profitability. Finally, the fiscal program includes the new fiscal responsibility
-   law coupled with a substantial cost cutting adjustment measures that should restore investor
    confidence, by imposing strict indebtedness limits and ensuring a steady decline in the ratio o f
    debt to GDP.

    182. Potential change in government policies following 2010 election. The Program
    contains a robust set o f measures in the banking, fiscal and social sectors. However, the
    Program approaches an election period in 2010 and thus there i s the potential for changes in
    government policies toward Program objectives. This risk i s mitigated by the fact that many

    24The Bank can also agree that the proceeds o f the loan will remain in the loan currency (Euro) which should be reflected in
    the loan document.
                                                                 51
reforms supported by the Program are being implemented by new laws already enacted, as
prior actions for the first tranche, and additional laws by the second tranche. The provisions
most at risk would be those approved annually under the budget law which can be modified
the following year. Even with a reversal, this i s unlikely to impact fiscal trends significantly
since other measures in place (e.g.: major expenditure and revenue reforms, FRL law ceilings)
would constrain the room for reckless spending without additional available funding. The
Government recently gained access to the external capital markets again by issuing a
Eurobond in July 2009, and this provides a potential signal o f increased investor confidence in
the Government's program and i t s adjustment efforts.

 183. Insufficient institutional autonomy and capacity. The reforms in the banking
system require an increase in autonomy and capacity o f the supervisory agency for
anticipating deteriorating trends and undertaking the necessary corrective actions. To mitigate
the risk o f inadequate implementation, the Bank expects to provide continuous technical
cooperation with the supervisory agency as part o f loan supervision during the Program
period, and continue the dialogue with the Ministry o f Finance and the Central Bank to ensure
the tri-partite collaboration needed to address financial imbalances, if they occur. On the
fiscal expenditure side, to ensure a socially sustainable program, the Bank intends to also
conduct a Public Expenditure Review focused on social expenditures. The report will be an
important vehicle o f policy dialogue and will also provide inputs for further reforms in key
areas while maintain adequate safety nets for the most vulnerable segments o f the population.

184. Need to strengthen the toolkit o f early supervisory intervention. In line with
international practice, it i s important to update the early intervention powers o f supervisory
authorities in order to make them capable o f acting early (sometimes based on ex ante risk
assessments) and not only after a potential default. The menu o f instruments, policies and
measures contemplated in the operation should suffice to resolve any banking weaknesses, but
there i s a risk that large domestically owned banks may attempt to prolong periods o f potential
financial weakness without government support, and risk negative investor sentiment that may
affect other parts o f the system. To mitigate this risk, the Program includes a sufficiently
broad range o f policy tools that would allow the financial authorities to intervene, if
necessary, if a systemically important institution i s weakening and does not avail itself o f
government capital support measures. Contagion, however, would be unlikely to affect other
large banks as parent companies have committed to maintaining or increasing funding to their
subsidiaries. The features o f the program, as mentioned, also contain forward looking
discretionary measures to allow strong intervention and resolution actions to complement any
capitalization measures. As well, within the available funding allocations in the fiscal
envelope and the multilateral package, the government has already provided lending to banks
facing liquidity shortages in order to tide over the period o f reduced access to external third
party markets which have shown some signs o f improvement recently.

                           Letter o f Sectoral Policy from the Republic of Hungary


 Mr. Robert Zoellick
 President
 World Bank
 1818 H Street NW
 Washington, D.C. 20433
 U.S.A.

                                                                                       August 17,2009

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

        Developments in Hungary's sovereign bond market and banking sector starting late
last year, coupled with the economic and financial developments in the US. and Western
Europe impacted Hungary's financial sector and macroeconomic prospects. These
developments generated higher sovereign spreads and lack o f sufficient capital market access
as well as uncertainties regarding fhding sources, pricing, and maturities in the domestic
banking sector. For these reasons, and to assure a smooth path toward increased equilibrium,
complemented with a host o f Government adjustment measures described in this Letter, the
Government of Hungary i s seeking a  1.0 billion loan from the World Bank as part o f the
multilateral funding package agreed with the IMF and the European Commission.

        The funding would assure resources to finance potential gaps and meet OUT external
obligations, while ensuring adequate capital and liquidity in our financial system, if needed.
The measures which the Government will support as part o f a Word Bank policy loan are
elaborated below. The main objectives o f our policy measures are to: (i) meet government
financing and balance o f payments needs, (ii)reduce fiscal spending and long term
indebtedness, (iii)maintain adequate liquidity, capitalization and stability in the domestic
banking system, and (iv) undertake additional measures in the pensions and health sectors to
not only reduce spending but ensure that the necessary social services and support are
maintained and are well targeted.

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policies

       The fiscal consolidation that began over two years ago narrowed the general
goveniment deficit by 6 percent o f GDP to 3.4 percent in 2008. Despite a solid fiscal
adjustment, the external current account deficit increased by nearly 2 percentage points in
2008 to 8.4 percent o f GDP. The fiscal austerity program has resulted in a contraction o f
domestic demand and a significant slowdown in real GDP in 2008. Domestic demand
weakness has persisted during 2009, as a result o f the combined effects o f labor market
adjustments, the government's tightening measures, and reduced access to' bank credit; and
exports have declined sharply. Headline inflation slowed to very near the central bank's 3

                                                   53
 percent target as the effects o f slack demand more than offset those o f forint weakness. With
 domestic demand collapsing, the current account improved dramatically in early 2009.

         Periodic forint selling pressures and the need to sustain demand for local currency-
 denominated government bonds prevented the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (cental bank of
 Hungary or MNB) from cutting interest rates despite the intensified economic downturn,
 tightened bank liquidity and sizable rate cuts abroad. The MNB's key policy interest rate was
 left unchanged at 9.5 percent since late January, followed by a l-percentage-point cut at the
 end of July. The forint appreciated nearly 14 percent by June from an all time low o f forint
 3 16/euro earlier in March. However, it s t i l l remains 15 percent weaker than a year before.

         The outlook for 2009 and 2010 i s uncertain, as i t depends on global events and,
 crucially, the extent to which investor confidence in Hungary can be maintained. In our
 baseline scenario, global financial market stress will gradualIy abate, which over time should
 reduce pressures in financial markets in Hungary. However, the global deleveraging that i s
 already under way may further reduce net capital inflows, slowing down credit growth.
 Coupled with projected negative euro zone growth in 2009 and further fiscal tightening, this
 will put stresses on the domestic economy. After falling close to 7 percent this year, GDP
 looks set to decline another 0.9 percent next year. Larger EU transfers, falling imports and
 smaller income payments to direct investors will help halve the current account deficit in
 2009.
         The targeted fiscal deficit was revised to 3.9 percent, with projected reductions in
revenues due to weaker activity, addressed with new spending measures. The main measures
on the spending side, additional to those incorporated in the 2009 budget, include: (i) freeze
                                                                                        a
in the expenditures o f budgetary chapters, (ii) decision not to spend funds received from sale
                                                a
o f carbon credits, (iii)elimination o f subsidies for farmers, above EU agriculturaI support
payments, (iv) reductions in subsidies for gas and heating costs, and pharmaceuticals, (v)
elimination o f the 13th monthly salary for public servants earning 149,000 HUF/month or
more, and gradual decrease the amount o f the 13'h monthly salary to zero for those who earn
more than 13 1,000 but less than 149,000 HUF/month and the 13th monthly pension payment
for pensioners, (vi) postponement o f corrective type increases o f pensions and planned
increases in family allowances, and (vii) cancellation o f subsidies for new housing purchases.
The government also decided to freeze the public sector wage bill, along with family
allowances and social benefits linked to the minimum old-age pension, for 2010-1 1.

         In addition, the government enacted a revenue-neutral tax reform, Together with
trimming and better targeting o f social benefits, it i s intended to support growth potential.
M a i n measures resulting in lowering the labor tax wedge, include a 5-percentage-point
reduction in employer paid social security contributions, cuts in certain tax rates, raising o f
tax brackets, elimination of the 4 percent solidarity tax, redefinition o f taxable income to
expand the tax base, and gradual withdrawal o f deductions and allowances. With these, 90
percent o f taxpayers will have a lower rate. For mid-income earners, the marginal tax rate
will be significantly lower.

        The government is committed to maintaining fiscal discipline in the long-term,
recognizing that this i s a key element in retaining investor confidence. To put fiscal
sustainability on a permanent footing, a Fiscal Responsibility Law was approved, which
establishes fiscal rules on public debt limits and the primary deficit, strengthens the medium-
term expenditure framework (rolling three-year expenditure ceilings) and creates a Fiscal
Council reporting to Parliament to provide independent scrutiny. Additionally a law on the



                                            54
     LegaI Status of Budgetary Institutions was approved, aimed at providing more budgetary and
     institutional autonomy in exchange for efficiency gains and higher accountability.

              For the second phase of the Bank-supported program, in the fiscal sector we intend to
      reach the government budget deficit target o f 3.9 percent in 2009. We will apply the
      expenditure provisions based on legal reforms undertaken, to cover health services, child-care
     benefits, family allowances, housing subsidies household gas consumption and district
     heating. Implementation of these reforms will ensure improvement in the financial
     sustainability of the social support system, including the tightening of eIigibiIity criteria and
     improved targeting o f benefits, as well as better incentives toward work and employment
     within the social benefits system. Funding for the Fiscal Council will be put in place, and the
     Government will issue a Decree to implement provisions o f the Legal Status Law to specify
     the new rules for budgeting, performance monitoring and service delivery.

     Reform Program for the Financial Sector

            The frnancial stress experienced late last year was mainly due to external factors.
    Investors' extreme risk aversion, which spilled over from difficulties in global financial
    markets, negatively affected the foreign exchange markets, government securities, and equity
    markets in Hungary. The effect in Hungary may have been more pronounced than elsewhere
    in the region because underlying vulnerabilities (public and external debts) remained high,
    and financial markets are deeply integrated with EU markets.

             Since the last quarter of 2008, in response to increased stress in domestic financial
    markets, we took a number of measures to improve liquidity. The MNB established a foreign
    exchange swap facility, supported by a repo facility with the ECB, for up to 5 billion. W    e
    established an auction facility to purchase government bonds from market makers of these
    securities, intended to improve liquidity in the secondary market. The MNB also created t w o
    new facilities to inject forint liquidity into the banking system: a two-week refinancing
    window at a fixed price, and a six-month bid-based fimding facility with no fixed price.
    Supporting these facilities, the expansion of collateral instruments was instituted, including
    allowance for the use of covered mortgage bonds, among other collateral types.

             We developed a comprehensive package o f support measures available to all qualified
    domestic banks. The domestic banks entered the period of market stress with strong solvency
    positions, which they have been able to preserve in spite o f the turmoil. We approved,
    through the new Financial Stability Law, a banking sector package with provisions for added
    capital, and resources,for a guarantee fund for interbank lending and the issuance of new bank
    securities for funding. A total allocation o f approximately 2.2 billion i s divided between a
    Capital Base Enhancement Fund (CBEF) to strengthen bank capitalization, and a Guarantee
    Fund to back-up bank funding lines. The CBEF was sized to raise eligible banks' capital
    adequacy ratios (CARS) to provide a cushion against risks, and would operate through the
    participation o f government preferred shares and special classes o f shareholding powers
    allowing government board representation, veto powers over key decisions, and management
I   changes if necessary. The Guarantee Fund was designed to bring comfort to the providers of
    wholesale funding and secure the refinancing of the eligible banks. In addition, the
    Government more recently approved direct loans to domestic banks without parent
    organizations, but that continue to face constrains in raisingnew funding in the markets.

          As per above, liquidity availability in the banking system, particularly foreign
    exchange funding, declined substantially following the unfolding o f the global crisis.


                                                  55
  However, most external liquidity funding i s sourced from parent banks in the euro area, which
  now have access to liquidity through ECB facilities and which pledged their continuous
  support o f their subsidiaries in Hungary, as reaffirmed in the statement o f leading foreign-
 owned banks in Hungary. The MNB and the Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) have
 been monitoring this commitment closely. As well, the government not only increased the
 level o f deposit insurance coverage o f retail deposits in line with EU agreements, but also
 pledged to provide a blanket guarantee on all deposits. Given the increase in the deposit
 insurance coverage, the Board o f the Deposit Insurance Agency also approved an increase in
 the premium contribution by banks commensurate with the higher coverage requirements and
 the long term funding target.

         The stability o f banking functions needs to be preserved and in this context, we have
 begun to strengthen the HFSA's and MNB's ability to assess and address solvency and
 liquidity concerns o f banks in a timely manner, As part o f supervisory strengthening, an
exercise o f intensified on-site inspections has begun to be carried out by the HFSA for the
systemically important banks to ensure detailed diagnostics o f banks' portfolio asset quality
and classification, adequacy o f loss provisions and collateral, solvency positions and capital,
and other financial risk indicators including overall group positions and contingent obligations
vis-a-vis domestic subsidiaries abroad. This information will be used in the second phase of
the program, to determine if corrective actions, capitalization or other measures are needed to
maintain a healthy solvency o f financial institutions. In parallel, according to the Concluding
Statement o f the European Banking Group Coordination Meeting held on 20 May, 2009 in
Brussels, the MNB initiated an exercise o f scenario analyses (stress tests) o f banks portfolios
and assets against economic developments to assess the solvency o f banks comprising at least
75 percent o f system assets. In the second phase of the program, based on the results o f the
stress tests, MNB will, along with the other financial authorities, take the appropriate
regulatory actions if cases arise where deficiencies are identified.

       Mechanisms for early remedial actions, including well-defined supervisory powers for
the HFSA to act in the case o f systemic problems or before substantial deterioration o f an
institution is observed; have been initiated and will be expanded as part o f proposed new
amendments to the HFSA Act to be implemented in the second phase. Amendments to the
Stability Act and the HFSA Act give powers to the HFSA allowing it to require extraordinary
reporting from a respective bank, inspections lasting up to one year, and/or appointing a
qualified forensic auditor during the course o f an inspection. Under the second phase, we
plan to present HFSA Act amendments to Parliament to enrich the powers for HFSA to
require prompt preventive actions by banks where risks and deteriorating trends are observed,
so as to ensure that preemptive measures take place before conditions worsen. Such measures
will complement the existing measures in our Banking Act. In addition, the new supervisory
powers would aIlow the appointed authority to issue orders at the system-wide level
applicable to all institutions, to prevent practices or developments that might increase
instability.

        In the second phase if the Ministry o f Justice agrees we also intend to present to the
Government Cabinet, a legal amendment to the HFSA Act to allow the HFSA to undertake
bank resolution procedures involving the partial balance sheet transfer o f bank assets and
liabilities to sounder institutions or to a newly created institution, in order to promptly resolve
insolvent banks and save potential fiscal outlays to repay depositors or to provide other types
o f bank support. We expect to eventually submit this amendment to the Parliament provided
that some o f the constitutional issues regarding the protection o f private property rights
(equity holders and creditors) can be resolved satisfactorily within the framework o f this new


                                             56
proposed legislative amendment. In the second phase, we will also issue new accounting
regulations o n loan classification and the prudent treatment, for accounting purposes, of
restructured, refinanced or renegotiated loans, as well as associated provisioning requirements
to ensure that such loans are properly classified according to their assessed repayment
prospects, present values, and risks.

Social Sector Policies

         As part of the Government efforts to identify longer term structural and institutional
actions to ensure fiscal sustainability, and at the same time providing sufficient space for
social safety net expenditures in a period o f negative growth, the government has identified a
number of reform areas covering the pensions and health sectors. Hungary has one of the
highest levels o f social protection spending in the EU's New Member States, and covers
benefits for housing, famiiy, children, unemployment, sicknesshealth care, old age, and
disability. A par! o f these subsidies are based on means-tested criteria and the other part can
be claimed by the poorest households. Expenditure reductions in the social sectors are not
directed at minimum benefits that are targeted to the poorest households.

        in the pension area, under the publicly funded pillar, the government took a first set o f
actions in 2008, to reduce fiscal outlays. Changes to the Pension Law approved by the
Parliament included: (a) requiring payment o f pension contributions on wages o f pensioners
working on new jobs, (b) reducing newly awarded pensions by 7-8 percent through changes in
the net wage base calculation, (c) restricting early retirement by raising the years o f service
requirement from 38 to 40 for regular pensions and from 33 to 37 for reduced pensions, (d)
suspension o f pension payments under age 62 if the earnings are exceeding the yearly
minimum wages, and (e) improving incentives to delay retirement by increasing early
retirement penalties and late retirement bonuses.

        More recently in 2009, Parliament approved a new set o f measures presented by the
Government, modifying the Pension Law and which introduced: (a) a gradual increase in the
statutory retirement age from 62 to 65, beginning in 2012, (b) introduction o f penalties for
early retirement, for men beginning in 201 1, and for women beginning in 2013, (c) a new
pension indexation rule implying a move from wage to price indexation, depending on GDP
growth, with under 3% growth impIying a 100% weight for price indexation, and with growth
above 5% implying 50/50 weights for prices and wages, respectively, with weighting
graduations in between such range o f growth rates; (d) an elimination o f the 13Ih monthly
pension benefit beginning July 2009, and (e) other measures including the tightening of
disability pension criteria.

         In the private pensions area, the Government earlier implemented a centralized
contribution collections system via the tax authorities, to increase efficiencies; and authorized
a more flexible investment regime for pension funds, based on the need for lifecycle portfolio
planning. For the second phase, the Ministry o f Finance in collaboration with the HFSA, i s
committed to developing a draft legislative design o f the payout phase o f the private pension
pillar including the design o f retirement products such as annuities, their indexation rules, and
the menu o f options for pension payout products.

        In the health sector, the Government has maintained the basic heaIth package to
citizens while implementing a number o f institutional measures to increase the efficiency and
accountability in the provision o f health services. In line with the provisions o f the Act on the
safe and efficient supply o f pharmaceuticals and medical appliances as well as on the general


                                               57
rules o f distribution o f pharmaceuticals, the Government with the Ministry o f Health has
approved regulations which are expected to yield further budget savings based o n cost
containment measures undertaken,

       In the second phase o f the program, the Ministry of Health intends to issue guidelines
concerning the corporatization processes for hospitals, in line with the provisions o f the Legal
Status Law (discussed above under the fiscal section). Coupled with this, the implementation
o f cost reducing measures will be carried out via a government decree that strengthens the
role o f General Practitioners. The Government will maintain the basic health package for
citizens and does not intend to reduce basic benefits in this upcoming period. However, the
above institutional reforms w i l l help to increase transparency in the sector's operations and
promote efficiency.

Conclusion

        The above package of multi-sectoral policy measures i s intended to address both the
priority issues affecting our financial system and access to global markets, as well as the
elements o f fiscal discipline needed to provide markets the confidence that Hungary continues
its adjustment o n a sustainable reform path. At the same time medium and longer term
reforms are contemplated in the fiscal and financial spheres to ensure respectively,
sustainability and stability, as well as in the social sector spheres. In the latter areas, the
Government's approach involves maintaining a reasonable level of benefits to ensure that
social safety net requirements are met during the economic downturn, while improving
targeting o f benefits to the most vulnerable, and reducing excess outlays in line with the
necessary fiscal tightening and debt reduction measures.



                                           Sincerely,

                        Statement by IMF Staff Mission to Hungary
                      (Reference.: 12.3 Billion Stand-By Arrangement)


       The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
second review of Hungary's economic performance under a program supported by a 17-month
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The completion o f the review enables the immediate
disbursement o f SDR 1.26 billion (about 1.4 billion or US$1.9 billion), bringing total
disbursements under the program to SDR 7.58 billion (about 8.4 billion or US$11.7 billion).

       The SBA was approved on November 6, 2008 (see Press Release No. 08/275) for
SDR 10.53 billion (about 1 1.7 billion or US$16.2 billion). The arrangement entails
exceptional access to I M F resources, amounting to 1,O 15 percent o f Hungary's quota.

      Following the Executive Board's discussion on Hungary, Mr. John Lipsky, First
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:

        Weaker than expected external demand and tighter external financing conditions
exacerbated the recession in Hungary. In these circumstances, policy settings have been
revised to strengthen fiscal sustainability and preserve financial stability. More ambitious
structural spending and tax reforms are under way to strengthen fiscal sustainability, allowing
the partial accommodation o f automatic stabilizers and an increase in the fiscal deficit target
in 2009. The authorities' commitment to the firm and timely implementation o f appropriate
policies i s reassuring.

        Fiscal sustainability i s being strengthened through structural spending reforms, while
allowing an increase in the fiscal deficit in 2009, owing to the partial operation o f automatic
fiscal stabilizers. The permanent budgetary savings from expanded reforms to the pension
system, social transfers, and subsidies are encouraging. These reforms, together with tax
reform that w i l l shift the tax burden from labor to consumption and wealth should boost labor
participation and potential growth over the medium-term.

         The prompt implementation o f the authorities' revised program to preserve financial
stability, including the careful monitoring o f banks that receive government financial support
and strengthening bank supervision, are important steps. It i s recommended that the
authorities explore institutional arrangements that would provide the financial supervisory

                                               65
agency with the necessary regulatory powers, and that remedial action and bank resolution
frameworks be quickly strengthened.

        Monetary and exchange rate policy will continue to target inflation over the medium
term, while being prepared to act as needed to mitigate risks to financial stability and avoid
risks to destabilizing the exchange rate. Looking ahead, a further strengthening o f investor
confidence and a corresponding easing o f financial strains would create room for interest rate
cuts, Mr. Lipsky stated.
