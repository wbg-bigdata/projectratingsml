F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

    The focus of the project was to build upon and anchor more deeply the institutional reforms
    started under the first Export Development Project (EDP I) with the intention of creating a
    conducive export environment and encouraging trade. The project's development objectives
    were to improve access to export markets and finance, and enhance the efficiency and
    performance of trade clearance processes including customs operations and technical
    controls, thereby making trade logistics more efficient. By building on the lessons and
    achievements of the EDP I, the implementation of the Second Export Development Project
    (EDP II) was expected to strengthen market institutions for export development, enhance
    competitiveness of Tunisian exporters, and strengthen public-private interface to administer
    and promote exports.


Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)


    The components were not revised during implementation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. The project was developed during a period in which Tunisia’s commendable export
   performance was coming under increasing pressure due to changing economic, competitive,
   and structural conditions. The phasing out of the MFA (Multi-fiber Agreements) in 2004-2005
   caused increased competition for Tunisia’s primary export articles (subcontracted apparel exports
   from the offshore sector) from countries such as India, China, Bangladesh and Eastern Europe.
   Tunisia encountered a more competitive environment following the dismantling of trade barriers
   with the EU through the Association Agreement with the European Union (AAEU). In 2008, the
   agreement was fully implemented with trade barriers being reduced completely for industrialized
   goods.

2. In addition, Tunisia’s past impressive export performance was no longer sustainable
   because of a number of structural vulnerabilities. Tunisian exporters were often sub-
   contractors for large foreign companies rather than arms-length exporters. Export growth had
   been led almost exclusively by the off-shore garment firms (composed of firms exporting more
   than 80 percent of their production) that had benefited from preferential export incentives. These
   firms established little linkage to domestic firms. As a result, Tunisian exporters generally
   produced relatively simple goods (mainly garments) that could be easily replaced with similar
   products from lower cost locations. Structural vulnerabilities were further exacerbated by the fact
   most on-shore firms remained largely unprepared for the international competition arising from
   Tunisia’s international agreements (AAEU and MFA).

3. Inefficient procedures and institutional structures made conducting trade in Tunisia time
   intensive and costly. For example, Tunisia's procedures for external trade required that
   documents be processed by multiple entities including the Ministry of Commerce, banks, the port
   authority, and the customs agency, as well as the usual professional organizations such as
   customs brokers, shipping agents, and freight forwarders. Documents were exchanged manually.
   Hard copies of documents had to be delivered and in some cases picked up again (after several
   days) for processing. 19 distinct steps were required for import transactions and 15 steps were
   required for export transactions. These cumbersome processes severely impeded the ability of
   Tunisian companies to respond to or accept short-notice orders, further undermining their
   competitiveness.

Rationale for Bank involvement

4. The proposed project built on an already strong dialogue on competitiveness (e.g., ECAL I,
   II, III, EDP I, Trade Strategy Note) with the Tunisian authorities and the private sector. In
   addition, it was expected that the Bank would bring a multi-dimensional cross-country
   perspective and experience with the design and implementation of matching grant schemes, e-
   government solutions and trade facilitation mechanisms. The Government of Tunisia had been
   very selective in accessing IBRD financial assistance and had determined that export
   development continued to be a high priority where Bank assistance has proved to be beneficial.
   Through EDP II, Tunisia leveraged the ability of the Bank to assist in creating market oriented
   institutions for trade promotion and finance, as it has also done with EDP I.




                                                                                                    1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as outlined on page 3 of
PAD)

5. The focus of the project was to build upon and anchor more deeply the institutional reforms
   started under the first Export Development Project (EDP I) with the intention of creating a
   conducive export environment and encouraging trade. The project's development objectives were
   to improve access to export markets and finance, and enhance the efficiency and performance of
   trade clearance processes, including customs operations and technical controls, thereby making
   trade logistics more efficient. By building on the lessons and achievements of the EDP I, the
   implementation of the Second Export Development Project (EDP II) was expected to strengthen
   market institutions for export development, enhance competitiveness of Tunisian exporters, and
   strengthen public-private interface to administer and promote exports.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6. The PDO was not revised during project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7. The main beneficiaries were private-sector firms and trade associations as well as
   Government ministries and agencies involved in the Tunisian trading system. The Second
   Export Market Access Fund (EMAF II) was intended to benefit firms and professional trade
   organizations including export associations, chambers of commerce, and professional consulting
   organizations. Beneficiaries also included Government agencies who received technical
   assistance related to market access, technical controls, and trade facilitation. For example, the
   Tunisian Standards and Intellectual Property Institute (INNORPI) received technical assistance
   for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of standards material. The Tunisian Ministry of
   Commerce received financing for the implementation of an automated work flow system across
   seven technical control agencies. The Tunisian Customs Agency received financing to streamline
   customs clearance procedures in order to reduce border clearance delays while simultaneously
   strengthening internal control processes. In addition the unit in charge of trade facilitation and
   logistics received financing to support a data collection program on supply chain barriers in
   transportation and logistics.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8. Component 1: Second Export Market Access Fund (EMAF II) – (total cost was US$37.6
   million of which IBRD was to finance US$21.1 million);
    Provide non-reimbursable co-financing of 50 percent for individual firms and 70 percent for
       professional associations on a demand-driven basis to help implement investments in market
       research and pre-competitive programs that increase export market access and
       competitiveness, with the remaining 50 to 30 percent mobilized from participating private
       sector firms and professional organizations.

9. Component 2: Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantees (PEFG) Facility – (total cost is
   US$1.0 million of which IBRD was to finance US$ 0.8 million);
    Strengthen the management of PEFG program that was set up under the EDP I, with the aim
      of further encouraging financial institutions to provide pre-shipment working capital
      financing to emerging exporters with viable export contracts. Eligible sub-loans financed by

                                                                                                    2
        the PEFG facility (see Annex 4) was guaranteed for up to 90 percent of the outstanding
        principal amount, which represents nonperformance risks of SMEs and emerging exporters
        which the participating financial institutions bared for up to 180 days (and in cases where the
        period of production is high, up to 300 days).

10. Component 3 – WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Enquiry Point – (total cost is US$1.0
    million of which IBRD was to finance US$1.0 million);
     Strengthen the capability of the Standards and Intellectual Property Institute (INNORPI) for
        collection, analysis and dissemination of standards information. As such, it supported both
        the efforts of Tunisian firms in meeting voluntary standards critical to export expansion, and
        Tunisia’s efforts to meet multilateral trade obligations and prepare for regional and bilateral
        Free Trade Agreements (European Union and others). This assistance also helped enhance
        transparency of technical regulatory control requirements in Tunisia for importers by
        providing more rapid access to these regulations. This assistance was particularly important
        given the strategic trade policy objectives of the Government shaped, in part, by on-going
        negotiations in the Doha Development Agenda of the WTO. Specifically this component
        included:

            a. Assistance to the Ministry of Industry (INNORPI) to strengthen its capacity related to
               the WTO Enquiry Point for TBT Agreement.
            b. Procurement of computerized systems to strengthen WTO Enquiry Point, including
               creation of a new digital database of Tunisia technical control regulations, developed
               jointly with the Ministry of Commerce.
            c. Training of INNORPI and Ministry staff in best practice management of information
               on standards and technical control regulations to meet WTO obligations in the TBT
               Agreement, drawing on best practice in other countries.
            d. Technical assistance for dissemination in the following areas:

                   Activities to disseminate information to private firms on voluntary, de-facto
                    international standards, such as those of the International Standards Organization,
                    International Electro-technical Commission, CODEX, ANSI, and others;
                   Publications and dissemination of a manual of international standards (CODEX,
                    ISO, IEC, and others); and
                   Assistance to expand web-based information dissemination on standards, through
                    the new INNORPI website.

11. Component 4: Trade Logistics: Extends the trade facilitation component of the EDP I and
    consisted of a set of actions aimed at: (i) rationalizing technical control regulations, (ii)
    disseminating of information on standards and technical control regulations to emerging
    exporters, (iii) increasing efficiency, timeliness and effectiveness of customs control procedures,
    and (iv) providing technical assistance to generate comprehensive logistics indicators.

12. Sub-component 4.1 - Enhanced integration of technical control procedures and
    strengthened risk management protocols – (total cost is US$1.41 million of which IBRD was
    to finance US$1.13 million). This sub-component consisted of the following activities:
     Automation of workflow and decision making processes of technical control agencies
     Implementation of an integrated risk management system at the level of each of the technical
         control agencies
     Implementation of the technical control digital dataset



                                                                                                          3
   13. Sub-component 4.2 - Streamlining and Strengthening of Customs Procedures – (total cost is
       US$12.9 million of which IBRD was to finance US$10.32 million). This sub-component
       consisted of the following activities:
        Further streamline customs clearance procedures in order to reduce border clearance delays
          while at the same time strengthening control processes. This would be achieved by a
          comprehensive set of complementary customs procedures and capacity building.

          Technical assistance for the implementation of the risk analysis, management and selectivity
           techniques to customs control and administration. This included developing a risk
           management information system that responds to and streamlines inspection and monitoring
           requirements of both technical control agencies and customs.

          Techniques for deferred control and post event audit within Tunisian customs. These
           procedures acted as a safety net for facilitation by providing a range of control mechanisms
           (documentary, physical, and accounts verification) that also acted as strong deterrents to
           customs fraud and smuggling.

          Improving the management information system of Tunisia Customs by adding database
           definitions for collection of data within SINDA (Tunisia Customs Information System) which
           enabled regular analysis of customs operations effectiveness, productivity measures, fraud
           cases, detection rate, and other management indicators. This also enabled the automated
           collection of data for performance indicators for this component.

          Strengthen technology infrastructure to support these changes; procurement was to consist of
           scanners, computer hardware and other equipment.

14. Sub-component 4.3 - Trade Logistics Performance Indicators. (total cost is US$1.25 million of
    which IBRD was to finance US$1.0 million. This sub-component consisted of the following
    activities:
         A detailed assessment and data collection program on supply chain barriers in transportation
             and logistics

15. Component 5: Project Management – (total cost is US$310,000 of which IBRD was to finance
    US$250,000)
        Training in procurement and modern techniques of financial management, as required by
          Bank Guidelines.
        Training and consulting services to enable the PSCU to effectively perform the following
          functions:
              a. the coordination of executing agencies and monitoring the performance indicators of
                  the project;
              b. the preparation of the progress reports and working documents required by the
                  supervision missions;
              c. the provision of information and reports to the Steering Committee and the Bank; the
                  monitoring and consolidation of the project's financial management, and assistance to
                  the executing agencies in procurement and financial management and in meeting the
                  reporting requirements of the Bank;
              d. Computer and office equipment;




                                                                                                          4

1.6 Revised Components

16. The components were not revised during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

17. There were no significant changes to the design of the project or the implementing arrangements.

18. Regarding scale of the project, output indicators were revised upwards to reflect strong
    demand for the matching grant program (component 1; EMAF II). The original output called for
    500 firms and 40 association assisted through EMAF II funding by year 5. As of 30 September 2006,
    FAMEX 2 approved 500 individual export plans (representing a total value of $ 18.33 million). Six
    million in additional financing became effective in March 2008 specifically to finance the scaled-up
    activities associated with increased demand for EMAF II. The intended target for number of firms
    assisted was increased from 500 to 800 in early 2008 and later to 1,000 after additional financing
    from the Government was put into the project in January 2009. At project closing (September 30
    2012) 1239 firms and 93 associations had been services by EMAF II.

19. The project was extended three times to reflect changes in project performance and the
    external environment. An initial extension from March 2010-March 2011 was designed to ramp up

                                                                                                        5
    highly successful components, particularly EMAF II and reforms within the customs administration,
    as well as allow more time to complete activities that were not going to be completed in the given
    time frame, for example, technical control procedures. In March 2011 the Government requested a 12
    month extension because of delays in implementing IT equipment and staff training related to
    enhancing technical controls (sub-component 4.1). In addition, EMAF II and the PEFG facility
    needed to be given more time to complete remaining activities (completion of export plans and
    awareness campaigns). Uncertainty created by the Tunisian revolution created delays in completing
    remaining tasks, including training, procurement, and institutional capacity building given high
    turnover of key personnel during this period.

20. The project was extended a third time for six months from March until September 2012 to complete
    wrap up activities under EMAF II (finalizing last batch of export plans and database management),
    ensure administrative and other follow-up to consultant work, under the EMAF II component; (ii)
    completing procurement procedures for the installation of new equipment for the Customs
    Administration; (iii) installing and testing equipment for the technical control component.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20 The project’s preparation, design, and quality at entry are considered satisfactory and
   comprehensive.

21 The QEA7 assessment determined the project’s overall quality at entry to be satisfactory. The
   assessment was based on review of key project documents and a lengthy interview with several
   members of the task team and two representatives from the Government executing agencies. The
   report cites staff continuity from EDP I, effective use of experience from the first project, and the
   project being part of a robust framework of overall assistance for Tunisia by the Bank. The
   assessment also assigned a Satisfactory rating to the eight quality dimension and to the Bank’s Inputs
   and Processes. These ratings reflected the panel’s judgment on the good use made during project
   design of internal experience with export development and the experience gained under EDPI I, as
   well as the team’s careful selection of components that have a high likelihood of being implemented
   successfully.

22 The QEA7 assessment found that it was likely the project would be sustainable given project
   design and past experience given the first EDP. The panel also found that the lessons learnt in the
   ICR for EDPI I was fully reflected in the design of EDP II. In addition, the assessment notes that the
   overall arrangement for monitoring implementation and evaluating impact was appropriate given
   sound indicators outlined in the PAD and the extensive M&E system developed under the first
   project. The assessment stated the M&E system was strengthened by the sub-component related to
   logistics performance indicators that was included within the project design.

23 With regards to preparation, the project built on past work completed on export
   competitiveness by the Bank and the Government, specifically EDP I (2000-2004) and four
   economic competitiveness development policy loans (ECAL I, II, III, and IV). The project was
   closely aligned with the FY2005-2008 CAS which called for the strengthening of the business
   environment to support the development of a more competitive, internationally integrated private




                                                                                                       6
    sector, and to improve the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy.1 The CAS also called for
    improvements to the education system and improved linkages between research, higher education,
    and     the    marketplace   to     achieve    greater   innovation   and     competitiveness.

24 The project design reflected lessons learnt from export development projects in other emerging
   markets. PEFG schemes have played a pivotal role in exploiting export potential: about half of the
   export value added has been generated by SME exporters in successful economies (World Bank
   2005). PEFG was structured on schemes developed in Korea and Taiwan, China. With regard to
   customs and efficient border crossings, the project drew on international experiences such as
   ADEMAR, which is an electronic logistics network in France that interfaces customs computer
   systems with container terminal operators, the port authority and market players in the transport
   business (shipping agents, freight forwarders, haulers).

25 The project design reflected the economic, sectoral (trade), and political-economic context of
   Tunisia during project preparation. Institutional settings at that time were seen as “rigid? with
   options for institutional reorganization and addressing public-sector inefficiencies limited. There was
   little flexibility within public agencies in terms of finding ways to improve services to enterprises.
   The Government would not consider any type of activities that involved a change of the existing
   institutional context of public agencies. This included measures affecting the incentive structure of
   public agencies. As a result, EMAF II relied on staff composed of consultants and managed based on
   volume targets. This was not an option considered feasible within a public institution such as CEPEX,
   the public agency responsible for export promotion in Tunisia. Connected, international experience
   with export promotion demonstrated that independent entities were largely more effective from a
   financial and managerial standpoint.

26 Project preparation was further strengthened by incorporating lessons from the first EDP
   project. Important lessons that were incorporated from EDP I included incorporating a public-private
   approach to export promotion, which is more effective and sustainable than purely public and
   centralized support on a demand-driven basis without targeting. Similarly, EMAF II reinforced
   market creation benefits of the matching grant schemes through providing assistance to business
   associations as well as firms, increasing substantially the number of firms assisted by the program,
   and focusing on a broad cross-sectional set of sectors targeted. Because of the multiplicity of actors
   involved in trade and export transactions, the project incorporated structures to help promote
   collaboration amongst Government entities and market players. This included a steering committee
   and a technical committee composed of key stakeholders at early stages of the process. Project
   management also underlined the importance for strong Government commitment and strong PCMU
   management.

27 With regards to export financing guarantees (component 2), the project incorporated the key
   lessons from EDP I that export finance schemes should not be managed as export credit
   insurance schemes, but rather require a strong and credible management team focused on
   cultivating strong relations with financial institutions. This is particularly true given many banks
   are risk averse in Tunisia and are reluctant to finance exporting firms.

28 The project also incorporated leading research on the importance of trade facilitation reform
   on export development into project design. Leading research2 demonstrated that trade facilitation
   reforms do improve the export performance of developing countries. This is particularly true with
   investment in physical infrastructure and regulatory reform to improve the business environment.
   Research showed that activities seeking to enhance export activities must be coupled with important
   trade facilitation reforms including customs efficiency reform, standards harmonization, and
   streamlined border and technical control procedures. Component 4 (trade logistics) sought to
   operationalize this research through reform of customs, integration of the technical controls database,
   and the development of trade logistics indicators.

Risk Identification and Mitigation:

Foreseeable risks were well outlined in project documents and mitigation strategies were built into project
design as well as the monitoring and evaluation framework.

28 Three critical risks were identified upon entry:
      i) external market dynamics and the demand for Tunisian exports;
      ii) inefficiency of the PEFG management team (as experienced under EDP I);
      iii) risk of agencies involved in trade transactions continuing with their manual processing of
           trade documents and existing inefficient clearance procedures.

29 The first risk was deemed manageable because of the country’s commendable export
   performance leading up to EDP II and the strong institutional history Tunisia possessed with
   regards to export performance given EDP I. Tunisia’s growth and development successes over the
   past decades have largely been fuelled by export of goods. The export sector grew at an average
   yearly rate of about 5.3 percent between 1997 and 20103. Over the years, Tunisia had initiated two
   waves of economic structural changes in its export sector. The first wave of transformation entailed a
   diversification away from oil toward light manufacturing and tourism. This was done by the creation
   by the Government of an “offshore? sector with generous fiscal and financial incentives to attract
   foreign direct investments (FDI) and boost exports. In the second, major shifts occurred with the
   manufacturing sector. Within the manufacturing sector, electrical and mechanical products emerged
   as important exporting sub-sectors. The sectors have been able to attract investment, raise factor
   productivity and boost job creation. Overall, Tunisia was seen as a regional leader with regards to
   export promotion. Similarly, under EDP II the Government was addressing export competitiveness
   directly. The risk of export demand was considered moderate, however, because of the overall high
   trade transaction costs imposed on Tunisian firms and increased competitive pressures (see section
   1.1 for greater detail).

30 The second risk was also seen as moderate given project design of PEFG, strong project
   oversight by the project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU), and the institutional
   commitment to the project shown by the Tunisian Company for the Insurance of Export Credit
   (COTUNACE) – the institution that managed PEFG. The project team studied the limited success
   of the export guarantee scheme under EDP I and built lessons learnt into project design moving into
   EDP II. These lessons included the need for a strong and credible management team and the need to
   develop strategies to overcome the challenging relations between banks and firms in Tunisia. Under
   EDP II PEFG was designed with the use of expert consultants that were allowed to operate relatively
   independently from COTUNACE management. This included developing appropriate terms of

  - This rate is however slightly below the growth rate of world exports in goods and services which stood at 7 percent over the period.

                                                                                                                                            8
    reference and incentives for management. Similarly, banks were made aware of the scheme as early
    as possible through consistent marketing and education. COTUNACE management had dedicated
    personnel to outreach to Banks in order to overcome risk aversion that prevented participation of the
    program under EDP I. All of these measures helped promote Bank commitment in the program,
    moderated the risk of inefficiencies in PEFG management, and helped increase the chances of
    program success.

31 The third risk was mitigated through the requirement for electronic processing of trade
   clearances by key agencies within the project. A core section of the project was the requirement of
   technical control agencies to process their clearances on line as well the modernization of customs
   processing that would contribute to enhanced transparency, efficiency, and electronic processing of
   exports. The project also included the development of trade facilitation indicators to track progress
   amongst customs and other Government ministries involved in automation of trade processes. These
   measures were also meant to act as risk mitigators and encourage the use of information technology
   and selectivity in customs clearance and efficient border crossings.

32 At the project level, the World Bank had strong confidence in the institutional capacity of the
   Government in light of EDP I, as well as the overall commitment of the Government to achieve
   project objectives. The benefits of automatic processing of trading procedures to enhance the overall
   efficiency of trade were well understood by Government ministries and discussed at lengths during
   project preparation. Earlier experience from EDP I reinforced this dialogue. These factors as a whole
   helped mitigate the risk of continued manual processing of documents amongst Government
   ministries.

2.2 Implementation

33 The strong capacity of the executing agencies and high level of ownership at the onset of EDPII
   were key factors in the successful implementation of the project objectives. The PCMU was set
   up within the Ministry of Commerce and was responsible for project management and timing,
   reporting to Government and to the Bank, and coordination amongst implementing agencies. The
   PCMU was in charge of ensuring that budgetary, procurement, contracting, disbursement,
   administrative, accounting, auditing, and reporting arrangements were undertaken according to
   Bank’s procedures. The PCMU was very effective at program management, consistently overseeing
   component implementation, reporting to the Bank in a timely manner, identifying challenges and
   opportunities within various components as they came up, and encouraging synergies through
   dialogue between executing agencies and the steering committee. When the PCMU did encounter
   challenges, for example difficulties surrounding understanding the day-to-day progress of particular
   components given the project complexity, they responded accordingly with action plans to overcome
   such challenges. For example, in March 2011 when the PCMU was assessed as lacking the required
   personnel and capacity, it promptly hired a new program coordinator which helped refocus the PCMU
   and successfully carry out needed activities prior to the project’s closing in March 2012.

34 The structure of the PCMU was designed to maximize organization and coordination while
   minimizing decision-making authority over the implementing agencies of specific components.
   This design was structured to minimize bureaucracy and allow implementing agencies to apply their
   expertise and complete project components. The various components had a relatively high level of
   independence from each other as well as from the PCMU within the Ministry of Commerce. The
   autonomy helped ensure effective implementation, as each implementing agency was able to focus on
   their specific component. This autonomy also helped World Bank staff identifies critical
   implementation issues early on within specific components and act accordingly. Similarly, the use of
   independent consultants to manage certain components (PEFG, EMAF II) provided an experienced

                                                                                                       9
   set of personnel to manage the project, which also enhanced efficiency, transparency, and a focus on
   results.

35 The implementation of these structures allowed for a high degree of independence and did
   contribute to the project component achieving their goals, often ahead of schedule. Similarly, the
   use of consultants throughout EMAF II and PEFG helped reinforce the capacity of executing agencies
   and enhanced efficiency of the project. Particularly towards the end of the project, however, the
   scheme did suffer from a lack of coordination that prevented synergies from fully emerging. The
   leadership of the PCMU changed three times throughout the project. Each leadership change brought
   administrative and coordination challenges and often delays. The PMCU made serious efforts over
   the last 6 months of 2010 to ensure procurement procedures were being followed according to Bank
   standards and that delayed financial management audits had been completed. In March 2012,
   however, a new head was appointed which helped refocus the project and used the remaining six
   month to finish necessary tasks and keep the project on course. Coordination issues must be
   analyzed, however, within the context of both the financial crisis and the December 2010 revolution
   which caused significant changes to Government personnel and social and economic instability that
   made project progression more difficult.

36 At the level of the individual executing agencies, the project was largely satisfactorily
   implemented, with key personnel demonstrating strong commitment and in many cases
   delivering ahead of schedule. This is particularly true of EMAF II (component 1) and INNORPI
   (component 3), who were successful in attaining results targets (serving firms with matching grants
   and developing a system of WTO notifications of trade respectively) well ahead of schedule.
   Executing agencies that did experience challenges in implementation were often successful at
   listening to Bank suggestions and implementing strategies to overcome roadblocks and deliver. For
   example, the automation and harmonization of technical control procedures was significantly delayed
   because of coordination delays between Government ministries and consultant non-performance. The
   primary executing agency DQPC accelerated their work schedule significantly in 2010 and was able
   to successful complete procurement, purchase, testing, and installation of the system by September
   30, 2012. Similarly, administrative procedures and strong aversion of banks and firms to work
   together made initial performance of PEFG slow. However, COTUNACE showed strong
   commitment to overcoming bank risk aversion by expanding synergies with banks and other
   executing agencies in EDP II and engaging in extensive education and marketing outreach to banks.

37 With regards to scope and scale, output indicators were revised upwards to reflect the fact that
   targets for the EMAF II matching grant facility had been achieved relatively early in the
   project lifecycle. The original output called for 500 firms and 40 associations assisted through EMAF
   II funding by year 5. As of 30 September 2006, FAMEX 2 approved 500 individual export plans
   (representing a total value of $ 18.33 million). By March 31, 2007 FAMEX approved 529 export
   plans (representing a total value of $ 18.46 million). Six million in additional financing became
   effective in March 2008 specifically to finance the scaled-up activities associated with increased
   demand for EMAF II. The intended target for number of firms assisted was increased from 500 to 800
   in early 2008 and later to 1,000 after additional financing from the government was put into the
   project in January 2009. At project closing (September 30 2012) 1239 firms and 93 associations had
   been serviced by EMAF II.

38 The project was extended three times to reflect changes in project performance and the
   external environment. An initial extension from March 2010-March 2011 was designed to a)
   complete specific projects that were not going to be completed within the given time frame; and b)
   ramp up highly successful parts of the project that needed to be reinforced, particularly EMAF II and
   reforms within the customs administration.

                                                                                                     10
39 In addition, EMAF II and the PEFG facility needed to be given more time to complete
   remaining activities (completion of export plans and awareness campaigns). Uncertainty created
   by the Tunisian revolution created delays in completing remaining tasks, including training,
   procurement, and institutional capacity building given high turnover of key personnel during this
   period. Disbursement in 2011 (post-revolutionary period) was US$2.13 million, decreasing from
   US$6.22 million in 2010.
.
40 In March 2011 the Government re quested a 12 month extension because of delays in
   implementing IT equipment and staff training related to enhancing technical controls (sub-
   component 4.1). In addition, EMAF II and the PEFG facility needed to be given more time to
   complete remaining activities (completion of export plans and awareness campaigns). Uncertainty
   created by the Tunisian revolution created delays in completing remaining tasks, including training,
   procurement, and institutional capacity building given high turnover of key personnel during this
   period. Disbursement in 2011 (post-revolutionary period) was US$2.13 million, decreasing from
   US$6.22 million in 2010.

41 The project was extended a third time for six months from March until September 2012 due to
   delays and uncertainty associated with the political transition in the country and the formation
   of a new Government. The six month extension was used to address four outstanding issues: (i)
   ensuring administrative and other follow-up to consultant work, under the EMAF II component; (ii)
   completing procurement procedures for the installation of new equipment for the Customs
   Administration; (iii) installing and testing equipment for the technical control component; and (iv)
   addressing the weakened capacity of the Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) to
   monitor the project sub-components in a timely and effective manner. The project closed on
   September 30, 2012.

    Environmental and Institutional Context Affecting Implementation:

42 At the onset of EDP II the country and economic context was favorable. There was strong
   support from the Tunisian Government (Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of International
   Cooperation) as well as from World Bank management. The institutional setting was stable with
   an effective and hierarchical bureaucracy considered capable of implementing the project. Further,
   there was historically in Tunisia little turnover among heads of agencies and director level positions.
   The strong implementation structure put in place - whereby implementing agencies were given
   significant autonomy and the operation was overseen by the PCMU, steering committee, and
   oversight committee – reinforced the successful implementation of the project.

43 The December 2010 revolution caused significant change to the environmental and institutional
   context. The revolution made project implementation more difficult because it saw a high level of
   turnover within the Ministry of Commerce, CEPEX, and INNORPI, among others. It created a
   context where implementing sensitive measures became more challenging. For example, a measure
   that would be unpopular among employees - such as the installation of a more transparent information
   system within Customs - was now made significantly more difficult. The revolution caused
   significant political upheaval, which meant Government policy was often unclear for months at a time
   as the Government moved from revolution to elections. Disbursement rates dropped slightly during
   and after the 2010 revolution because of institutional and environmental instability. For example
   registered payments slowed from 9TND in 2010 to 3.4 TND for the first 9 months of 2011.

44 The Government demonstrated strong commitment to maintaining sound project management
   during period of high political and environmental volatility. For example, noticing management

                                                                                                       11
    lag in the PCMU due to staff turnover associated with the administrative changes due to the
    revolution, the Government appointed a new project coordinator and redoubled efforts to make
    progress on remaining activities. Because the project’s main implementation role was left largely to
    the agencies in charge (INNORPI, CEPEX for FAMEX) project implementation continued to
    progress. For example, average delays at Rades port (sub-component 4.2) increased only slightly
    between 2010-2011. For example, average delays from boat cargo increased 3.55 days to 3.65 day
    from 2010 to October 2011. With regards to technical controls (sub-component 4.1), the DQPC
    completed significant work in 2010 and 2011 (at the height of institutional instability) with regards to
    digitizing technical control procedures (road-map development and follow up software procurement
    and implementation).

45 The project effectively used the final six month extension (March 2012-September 2012) to
   complete remaining activities, some of which were delayed significantly. For example, the last
   batch of FAMEX export plans were completed, the technical import control software was installed
   and tested, and the export guarantee application component was finalized for the PEFG (sub-
   component 2). Finalizing acquisition and installation of customs equipment was delayed due to
   changes in the Government procurement policy adopted after the revolution. Overall, project
   implementation from 2010-2012 should be commended given that despite high levels of institutional
   and political uncertainty, implementing agencies were for the most part able to complete remaining
   tasks and in some instances (e.g. technical controls) advance activities that were significantly delayed.
   Personnel within implementing agencies demonstrated strong commitment to the project despite
   acting often with high levels of information asymmetry.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

46 The M&E of the project was considered robust and worked well throughout project
   implementation. The project had a good monitoring and evaluation framework design, with the
   original set of PAD indicators tracking performance at all stages of the project implementation. M&E
   was completed by supervision missions and mid-term reviews, supported by the PCMU which
   provided semi-annual reports to the Bank on project achievements, issues, and performance
   indicators. The original PAD tracked indicators for the project’s major components and sub-
   components on an annual basis. The PCMU effectively compiled performance updates from the
   specific implementing agencies on a quarterly basis. The PCMU also acted as a point of reference for
   Bank staff in the event they had additional questions regarding performance management of a
   particular implementing agency. EMAF II developed a well-documented data base on SMEs and their
   export patterns which was particularly useful for tracking progress and analyzing project
   effectiveness.

47 Indicators were effectively monitored, with the PCMU providing timely quarterly reports on
   progress of the project components in accordance with the outcome indicators. Aide memoires
   provided qualitative analysis in addition to tracking those indicators outlined in the PAD. Indicators
   were updated in response to progress implementation. For example, the intended target for number of
   firms assisted through EMAF II increased from 500 to 800 in early 2008 and later to 1,000 after
   additional financing from the Government was put into the project in January 2009. At points
   throughout the project, delays in reporting and evaluation were noted. The results monitoring
   framework did not always adequately capture implementation complexities amongst sub-components.
   For example, the results monitoring arrangements (annex 3 of the PAD) did not include specific
   outcome indicators for sub-component 4.3 – Trade Logistics Performance Indicators. While
   interviews with relevant government counterparts indicate the sub-component was successful initially
   in constructing data sets and assessing performance related to customs and border clearance times,
   additional M&E could have better integrated this sub-component.

                                                                                                         12
48 Results for the project further benefited from two impact evaluations conducted on EMAF II
   (see section 3.2 for an analysis of the full results). The impact evaluations assessed changes in
   export performance that can be directly attributable to EMAF II by comparing what would have
   happened without EMAF II assistance by using treatment and control groups. The impact evaluations
   add statistical causality to the results captured in the M&E system.

49 The first evaluation was conducted in 2011 by outside academics with Bank assistance.4 The
   evaluation compared changes in relevant outcome before and after across firms that had EMAF II
   support with firms but did not receive EMAF II support. Given that the authors did not have an ideal
   ex-ante identical control group, they randomly selected similar Tunisian firms as a control group, and
   then compared the ‘treatment’ and the ‘control’ groups after controlling for differences along
   observable dimensions such as size, age, sector, and prior exporting status. The second impact
   evaluation5 was conducted by economists within the World Bank Development Economic Research
   Group Trade and International Integration Unit (DECTI). It used PSM and weighted least squares
   (including difference-in-differences combined with propensity-score matching (PSM-DID) and
   difference-in-differences weighted by propensity scores) to evaluate the effects of EMAF II on the
   performance of beneficiary firms. The evaluation looked at both short and long-term effects of the
   program.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50 Procurement, financial management practices, and the environmental review process for the
   operation were supported by the operational manual with guidance for the PCMU and
   implementing agencies. The well-developed operational manual and a diligent PCMU helped ensure
   effective implementation of these issues. There were no social and environmental safeguards applied
   to the project. Procurement was satisfactory, with each of the executing agencies carrying out their
   procurement in line with the applicable procedures given their respective procurement plans. This
   was particularly true during the transitional period of the project closing.

51 The adequacy of the project's financial management system was initially assessed, as required
   by the Bank (OP/BP10.02), based on interviews with the project’s executing agencies (CEPEX,
   COTUNACE, the Tunisian Customs, and the Ministry of Commerce). The analysis found that
   management and rules of financial management and accounting in the private sector and the public
   finance systems did not represent major risks. All financial management aspects related to
   implementation were satisfactory. The ministry of commerce had worked with the World Bank before
   (Export Development Project (EDP), Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL) I, II, III,
   and IV) and was very familiar with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements related to procurement,
   disbursements and applicable safeguards. There were minor concerns regarding financial
   management brought up through audit reports of the project. For example, a 2009 audit exercise
   revealed certain internal control weaknesses and non-eligible expenses by COTUNACE and the
   Ministry of Commerce due to an application error in the financing rate of transferred funds. All issues
   related to ineligible expenses identified, however, had been resolved by the project closure dates.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52 Post-completion operations are robust and comprehensive. They are supported in three ways.
   First, there are a number of components of the project where systems launched during the
   project’s lifecycle are fully operational and continue to contribute to efficiency gains with
   regards to export promotion. For example, with respect to information on WTO technical barriers
   to trade (component 3), the electronic information service “Export-Alert? setup by INNORPI in
   collaboration with the Canadian Council on Norms (CCN) continues to be operational and well used
   by the private sector (currently close to 600 firms are registered). Procedural reform related to
   customs processing (sub-component 4.2) have resulted in an average reduction of 40.2% (10.1 days to
   6.04 days on average based on October 2011 estimates). Meetings with customs in December 2012
   during ICR preparation suggest that these times have been maintained. Customs operations have also
   benefited from the development of indicators related to customs and border clearance times
   developed by the Ministry of Commerce and adopted into periodic reporting (sub-component 4.3).

53 Second, there are significant market creation benefits related to EMAF II that provide post-
   completion sustainability. The project demonstrated that a public-private system of export assistance
   can be very successful at boosting exports amongst firms and associations through a targeted cost
   sharing demand driven technical assistance scheme. It demonstrated that firms were willing to pay for
   such services using market-based principles with the added advantage of increasing accountability
   and result driven incentives not seen under purely public schemes. In addition to the direct export
   benefits, the project led to the creation of a private consulting industry of over 80 firms that help
   Tunisian companies bring their goods to foreign markets. In addition 115 firms successfully installed
   a branch in foreign markets.

54 EMAF II was successful at getting firms to think strategically about market opportunities
   abroad. The program provided firms the skills and experience necessary to capitalize on these market
   opportunities. Assistance provided would force participating firms to identify their strengths and
   weaknesses and develop plans to incorporate these points into an export promotion strategy.

55 The project has helped position Tunisia as a regional leader with regards to trade facilitation
   infrastructure. This is particularly important given the country’s limited natural resources and the
   ongoing political transition that is continuing to cause economic challenges (particularly
   unemployment) for the country. The project has helped Tunisia develop firms engaged in strategic
   trade activities that contribute to the development of a value-added economy. Tunisia enjoyed a 4.8
   percent average annual growth in GDP over most of the 2000’s, placing the country among the
   leading performers in the group of emerging economies. The export sector grew at an average yearly
   rate of about 5.3 percent between 1997 and 20106. The ratio of export value to GDP is 47%.

56 At the project design level, sustainability of the project is reinforced by the fact the project is
   being replicated in Bank projects in EAP region (e.g. Laos – P085071; Cambodia – P106736).
   Other components of EDPII, notably customs reform (sub-component 4.2) have been replicated in
   other Bank projects (e.g. Vietnam; P085071). The impact evaluations done on the project are well
   referenced around the world and act as important documents for policy debate on export
   competitiveness.

57 A third export development project is currently being prepared and seeks to deepen progress
   made within specific components as well as address deficiencies in continuity and project
   design. For example, the EMAF II scheme will be managed within CEPEX as opposed to an

6
    This rate is however slightly below the growth rate of world exports in goods and services which stood at 7 percent over the period.

                                                                                                                                           14
    independent entity populated with consultants. The project would further anchor the gains made
    under EDP II with a particular focus on innovation, competitiveness, and strengthening Government
    institutions for long-term sustainability. The project is in appraisal stage with Board approval planned
    for spring 2013. Although there is no direct post-completion program with regards to EMAF II or
    PEFG, institutional history exists within both CEPEX and COTUNACE that will be applied to the
    third export development project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

58 The objective, design and implementation of the project remain highly relevant to the
   development of Tunisia, particularly with regards to private-sector led growth, productivity
   enhancement, and structural transformation towards a high value-added services based economy.

59 With regards to objectives, the project built on past work completed on export competitiveness
   by the Bank and the Government, specifically EDP I (2000-2004) and four preceding economic
   competitiveness development policy loans (ECAL I, II, III, and IV). The project was closely
   aligned with the FY2005-2008 CAS which called for the strengthening of the business environment
   to support the development of a more competitive, internationally integrated private sector, and to
   improve the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy.

60 The 2008 financial crisis followed by the December 2010 revolution have further underscored
   the importance of an efficient trading system and export support as a part of broader economic
   stability. Following the revolution, unemployment increased to 19 percent in 2011, a 6 point increase
   over the previous year. Fortunately, the unemployment rate in 2012 declined to 17.6 percent but this
   is not enough to reduce the stock of largely unemployed young educated job seekers. Due to the
   deterioration of the trade balance, tourism and FDI receipts, the current account deficit widened
   considerably to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2011. A new Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Tunisia covering
   FY13-14 was endorsed by the Board in early July 2012. The ISN outlines a program focused on
   contributing to the Constituent Assembly Government’s short and medium-term employment creation
   objective. The program aims at promoting private-sector led recovery and job creation, with a focus
   on openness, opportunity and accountability. This focus is congruent with the core objectives of EDP
   II. The fact that the team has nearly completed preparing a third export development project further
   underscores the continued relevance of the project.

61 The design of the project remains highly relevant to Tunisia, the broader MENA region, as well
   as Bank operations in other regions. EDP II was one of the first projects within the Bank to use a
   large-scale matching grant scheme to promote export development. The matching grant was highly
   successful and exceeded its goals in terms of export volume and number of firms and businesses
   associations assisted (see section 3.2 for a full description of results). This model has since been
   applied to Bank projects in EAP region (e.g. Laos – P085071; Cambodia – P106736). The matching
   grant mechanism has been applied within regional FPD project in complementary sectors, for
   example with SME upgrading in Yemen (P128161). The export finance guarantee facility
   (component 2-PEFG) was an innovative mechanism for Tunisia to address a critical challenge in
   developing the country’s financial sector, specifically overcoming the risk aversion of Tunisian banks
   to lending to exporting companies. Other components of EDPII, notably customs reform (sub-
   component 4.2) have been replicated in other Bank projects (e.g. Vietnan; P08507). The fact the
   Government has prioritized the preparation of a third project that includes both a matching grant and



                                                                                                         15
    export financing guarantee facility underscores the continued relevance and effectiveness of the
    project design.

62 The project has been used as an important demonstration piece for further study and analysis
   on the benefits of matching grant schemes in private sector development. The project benefited
   from two impact evaluations that established with statistical certainty the effectiveness of the scheme
   at enhancing export growth amongst recipient firms (see annex 10 for full description of impact
   evaluations). Thus, the project is a great example where the Bank’s research and operations
   departments working together to come to a better understanding of how effective particular
   interventions can be. Furthermore, the incorporation of trade facilitation components into the project
   operationalized contemporary research arguing for a comprehensive approach to export development
   that combined subsidy with broader institutional reforms. Trade facilitation has become an
   increasingly central component of the global trading regime. Research and policy development on
   trade facilitation has been prioritized by the WTO and leading research institutions such as the OECD
   and DECTI within the World Bank. EDP II provided a successful early example of how trade
   facilitation reform can be operationalized.

63 The implementation experience further underscores the relevance of the project to the broader
   development agenda of Tunisia and the region. The project’s design - structured on providing a
   high degree of autonomy amongst implementing agencies, heavy use of consultants, and a central
   PCMU and steering committee –allowed for efficient implementation of project activities, often
   ahead of schedule (see section 3.2 for full results analysis). The design encouraged effective central
   reporting, a particularly difficult task given the multiple components and the high level of overall
   project complexity. Implementation brought significant learning on how to best manage complex
   projects. Particularly towards the end of the project, however, the scheme did suffer from a lack of
   coordination and prevented synergies from fully emerging. The leadership of the PCMU changed
   three times throughout the project. Each leadership change brought administrative and coordination
   challenges and often delays.

64 The project effectively identified coordination and operational issues throughout
   implementation and modified operations accordingly. For example, output indicators were revised
   upwards to reflect the fact targets for the EMAF II matching grant facility had been achieved
   relatively early in the project lifecycle. Six million in additional financing became effective in March
   2008 specifically to finance the scaled-up activities associated with increased demand for EMAF II.
   Project extensions were used to complete outstanding project components, to accelerate delayed work
   (e.g. technical control agencies component 4.1). These extensions also allowed the project to adapt
   given the change in personnel due to the revolution and the associated economic uncertainty given the
   global economic slowdown beginning in 2008. Delays, for example with customs procurement of
   new IT equipment or finalizing applications with respect to EMAF II or PEFG, were well outlined in
   supervision missions and as a result the Government and Bank were able to develop strategies to
   move                    forward                  the                  project                accordingly.

65 Despite challenges caused by the political and economic instability associated with the
   December 2010 revolution, EDP II continued implementing key sections of the project between
   2010-2012. This was largely a function of commitment to the projects within implementing agencies
   and amongst Bank staff. For example, with regards to technical controls (sub-component 4.1), the
   DQPC completed significant work was completed in 2010 and 2011 (at the height of institutional
   instability) with regards to digitizing technical control procedures (road-map development and follow
   up software procurement and implementation). Similarly, despite a slowdown in applications
   processed, export plans payments were finalized under EMAF II and PEFG. The project effectively
   used the two extensions to complete remaining activities and address key challenge areas. The

                                                                                                         16
    additional financing was also effectively used to meet demand for EMAF II. Unfortunately
    acquisition and installation of new IT equipment for the customs administration (component 4.2) was
    delayed due to significant staff changeover after the revolution and to new procurement procedures.

66 Project implementation from 2010-2012 should be commended given that implementing
   agencies were able to complete remaining tasks and in some instances (e.g. technical controls)
   advance activities that were significantly delayed, despite high levels of institutional and
   political uncertainty. Personnel within implementing agencies demonstrated strong commitment to
   the project despite having to adjust quickly to changing conditions (both economically and politically)
   that made it more difficult to complete remaining tasks. Weaknesses were reported in the PCMU
   during 2011 because the head of the unit, sitting in the Ministry of Commerce, was unable to dedicate
   full time to the project due to the political situation. In March 2012, however, a new head was
   appointed which helped refocus the project and used the remaining six month to finish necessary
   tasks and keep the project on course. The fact the PCMU made serious efforts over the last 6 months
   of 2010 to ensure better coordination and preparation of procurement documents also helped ensure
   sound project management.

67 The fact that project implementation went largely according to plan, with project components
   having met their deadlines and targets (with the exception of the procurement of new IT
   equipment for the customs component), is a significant accomplishment given the challenging
   external environment the project faced. The project was thus particularly relevant as a learning tool
   for how to manage projects given dramatically deteriorating external environments, in this case due to
   the drastic change in the political situation as well as the slowdown in the global economy.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

68 The PDOs were satisfactorily achieved.

69 Analysis of Achievements by Development Objectives outlined in PDO:

    a. Improve access to export markets and finance

    b. Enhance the efficiency and performance of trade clearance processes including customs
       operations and technical controls, thereby making trade logistics more efficient

a) Improve Access to Export Markets and Finance: This objective is rated satisfactory.

70 The program was highly successful in addressing market deficiencies and knowledge gaps
   preventing Tunisian firms from reaching their export potential. Because of sound project
   management and the effective promotion of the program to both exporters and buyers in foreign
   markets abroad, the component was successful in attracting a significantly higher level of demand
   than initially envisioned. EMAF II was initially slated to serve 500 firms and 40 associations (as
   outlined in the PAD) by year 5 of the project. By the mid-term review in March of 2007 424 firms has
   received FAMEX assistance and completed marketing plans while an additional 188 were in the
   process of finalizing plans. At project closing EMAF II processed 1239 firms and 94 export
   associations, representing an estimated $374 million in additional exports. 870 export plans were
   finalized. The results indicators were twice updated (from 500 to 800 in early 2008 and later to 1,000
   after additional financing from the Government was put into the project in January 2009) to reflect
   the success of EMAF II of reaching targets early. EMAF II management was highly efficient in



                                                                                                       17
    reviewing proposals and processing payment and services, taking on average only 10 days for
    reimbursement. In addition 115 firms successfully installed a branch in foreign markets.

71 The 2011 impact evaluation found that annual export growth was 38.9% higher for assisted
   firms compared to control firms in 2004-2008. Similarly, annual growth in destination markets
   reached was 4% higher for firms assisted by EMAF II.

72 EMAF II was successful at targeting firms who had little capacity in export development. 75%
   of firms served had fewer than 100 employees. 350 plans (28%) were of new exporters. 651 (53%)
   reached new markets, while 238 plans (19%) engaged in new activities. The number of firms and
   export associations assisted far superseded the number original intended in the PAD (500 firms and
   40 business associations). EMAF II also promoted foreign market penetration. Out of 273 firms
   applying for support to open a foreign branch, 115 succeeded mainly in newer non-traditional markets
   (Maghreb and other parts of Europe). 52% of those were seeking new export markets, indicating the
   correct anticipation that Tunisian export increasingly sought new markets and product to diversify.
   Firms receiving assistance were found in relatively diverse industries (see figure 1).

Increased Sustainable Export Capacity at the Business Association Level:

73 In addition to directly assisting firms with technical assistance related to export promotion, EMAF II
   was successful at getting firms to think strategically about market opportunities abroad. The
   program provided firms the skills and experience necessary to capitalize on these market
   opportunities. Assistance provided forced participating firms to identify their strengths and
   weaknesses and develop plans to incorporate these points into an export promotion strategy. It also
   proved that technical assistance could be provided to firms on a competitive commercial basis and as
   such, helped in the creation of an associated consulting industry.

74 Minor shortcomings included the fact that certain firms expected assistance to continue long-
   term. The question of whether matching grant assistance should have been provided for longer was
   raised by certain stakeholders as well as in both impact evaluations completed (see section 2.3 and
   Annex 10 for additional information). Similarly, certain stakeholders felt the program could have
   been more strategic about which sectors to target to maximize development impact. As demonstrated
   in figure 1, the program provided assistance broadly across sectors. Similarly, certain CEPEX

                                                                                                      18
     representatives felt the program could have placed more attention on assisting first time exporters.
     Out of the 1232 firms assisted, 350 firms were first time exporters. This could be easily modified with
     eligibility criteria designed to support smaller first time exporters. A third export development
     project currently being prepared focused on a small number of sectors of strategic importance to
     Tunisia.

75 A number of additional outcomes help ensure the sustainability of EMAF II. First the project
   contributed to supporting and developing a local consulting industry which provides expertise
   in developing export plans and facilitating export finance. Today in Tunisia there are some 80
   export consultants that have become more specialized under EDP II. Second, the technical assistance
   received under EMAF II coupled with a number of training activities have allowed firms to develop a
   strategic approach to export operations. Beneficiary firms now have enhanced knowledge of the
   technical, competitive and technical market environment in which they operate. These firms are
   conscious of the importance of knowledge over direct financial assistance, as evidence by the strong
   demand for cost sharing technical assistance throughout the project and even after its closure.

Impact Evaluations Conducted on EMAF II:

76 The project further benefited from two impact evaluations conducted on EMAF II. The impact
   evaluations assessed changes in export performance that can be directly attributable to EMAF II by
   comparing what would have happened without EMAF II assistance by using treatment and control
   groups. The impact evaluations establish with statistical certainty EMAF II was successful at
   promoting export growth, particularly in the short to medium term.

77 The first evaluation was conducted in 2011 by outside academics with Bank assistance.7 The
   evaluation compared changes in relevant outcome before and after across firms that had EMAF II
   support with firms but did not receive EMAF II support. Given that the authors did not have an ideal
   ex-ante identical control group, they randomly selected similar Tunisian firms as a control group, and
   then compared the ‘treatment’ and the ‘control’ groups after controlling for differences along
   observable dimensions such as size, age, sector, and prior exporting status. The treatment and control
   groups were compared with respect for export promotion after controlling for size, age, sector, and
   prior exporting status of the firms. Using propensity score matching (PSM), the study found that
   annual export growth was 38.9% higher for assisted firms compared to control firms in 2004-
   2008 (see chart 1). Similarly, annual growth in destination markets reached is 4% higher for
   firms assisted by EMAF II. The evaluation also found that EMAF II has a positive effect on the
   number of products exported, although this finding was not statistically significant.

78 The same dataset was also used to assess the employment impact of EMAF II. Although not a direct
   objective of EMAF II, the employment impact is important given Tunisia’s persistent
   unemployment and ongoing economic and social uncertainty due to the December 2010
   revolution. The PSM approach yields similar results though the gap is larger: annual growth of
   10.2 % for EMAF II firms against 5.1 % for the control group. This suggests EMAF II had a
   positive impact on employment, though it must be noted that the small sample size implies results are
   sensitive to the specification used and not always statistically significant.

79 In addition to firm-level data, Gourdon et al completed the impact evaluation exercise on a larger
   sample of customs data. Transaction-level export data with exporter ID, transaction value, country of
   destination, and produce code were obtained from Tunisian Customs for 2000-2008 for 3000 firms,
   including 400 EMAF II firms. The sample represents approximately 55% of export of goods
   (excluding oil) in Tunisia.

80 Using PSM on this customs data, the authors found that EMAF II support had increased the
   difference in growth rate in the two years of treatment for export outcomes, specifically the
   volume, number of destinations and number of products. Increase in growth was slightly higher
   than with the firm level survey data. The customs data, however, had limitations because it did
   not take into account firms in the services sector, which represent approximately 30% of
   EMAF II firms. Using customs data the authors found that over the long-term, outcomes do not
   differ much from random non-EMAF II firms (see chart 2).

81 Conclusion: Although the short duration of the impact and limited additionally for a specific class of
   manufacturing firms joins earlier criticisms of matching grants, overall results using PSM based on
   two different data sources suggest the EMAF II was successful. It had a statistically significant,
   positive impact on firm performance along targeted dimensions of total exports, number of export
   product and export destinations. It is also likely to have a positive impact on employment.

82 The second impact evaluation8 was conducted by economists within the World Bank Development
   Economic Research Group Trade and International Integration Unit (DECTI). It used PSM and
   weighted least squares (including difference-in-differences combined with propensity-score matching
   (PSM-DID) and difference-in-differences weighted by propensity scores) to evaluate the effects of
   EMAF II on the performance of beneficiary firms.

83 The evaluation looked at both short and long-term effects of the program. The evaluation found
   that beneficiaries initially saw faster export growth and greater diversification across destination
   markets and products. However, longer-term effects surpassing three years are moderate as export
   growth rates were not found to be significantly different from those of non-beneficiary firms.
   However exports of beneficiaries did remain more diversified. The evaluation also found no evidence
   that the program produced spillover benefits for non-beneficiary firms. The evaluation suggests that
   EMAF II may have been most useful for diversifying exports over the long-term with limited impact
   on increases in volume on exports.

84 The authors suggest that the results must also be understood in the context of the global economic
   recession. Similarly, there may be a bias in that firms participating in FAMEX may have
   ventured into riskier markets. Their evidence demonstrates that the increased diversification of
   beneficiary firms did not result in reduced volatility of exports. Given that exports were not
   sustained and that effects did not spillover to non-treated firms, the authors suggest that matching

    grants programs alone may not be the best use of public funds for long-term sustained export
    development.

85 The authors conclude that their research adds to the small existing literature by taking a longer view
   of impact of interventions. They find that EMAF II had a durable impact in terms of export
   destinations and products but provided only a temporary boost to exports. The results are statistically
   robust.

86 See Annex 10 for more information regarding both impact evaluations of EMAF II.

87 Overall, the impact evaluation are noteworthy because they establish with statistical certainty the
   effects of EMAF II, confirming that the project was successful at boosting export and
   establishing export diversification, at least in the short to medium term. Key personnel within the
   World Bank that prepared EDP II as well as key stakeholders within the Government underscored
   that they welcomed and accepted the results of the impact evaluations completed. They stressed,
   however, that EMAF II was at its core a short-term intervention designed to create market linkages
   and boost exports for those firms assisted. EMAF II would be complemented by other measures
   designed to promote trade such as the pre export finance guarantee and continuing the improvements
   on trade facilitation undertaken under EDP I. These stakeholders encouraged readers to analyze the
   results of the impact evaluation keeping in mind the short-term nature of the EMAF II intervention.

Facilitate access to pre-shipment export finance:

88 Overall COTUNACE was successful in implementing an export finance guarantee program
   targeted to Tunisian SMEs both in the capital and regionally. COTUNACE guaranteed $54
   million in working capital for exporters, generating an additional $115 million dollars in exports for
   approximately 225 exporters (see figure 2 below).

89 In 2007 the project achieved the objective outlined in the operations manual of having
   applications processed in 13 days. Average application processing was down to 6 days in 2011. The
   project was successful at extending the scheme to regional economic centers. As of October 2011,
   approximately 78% of credit guaranteed and 77% of exports realized occurred outside of Tunis
   (see exhibit 5 below). The guarantee facility was able to develop strong links with Banks through a
   communication campaign and subsequent workshops designed to capture the adherence of bankers. In
   terms of operational effectiveness COTUNACE was able to reduce its processing time from 12 days
   in 2007 to 8 days in 2012.

90 COTUNACE reported challenges working successfully with commercial banks given their
   insistence on real collateral in addition to the export financing guarantee itself to cover the non-
   performance risk of guaranteed firms. The risk of firms not repaying can even in isolated cases can
   significantly disincentivize participation from the banking sector. This is a long-term problem in
   financial sectors in many developing countries. The PEFG scheme is an important step in overcoming
   this risk aversion problem by incentivizing banks to finance exporting firms through guaranteeing
   losses. The COTUNACE management team should be commended for consistent outreach to the
   Banks during the project life cycle. COTUNACE engaged heavily in marketing and educational
   initiatives to ensure Banks were familiar with the program’s benefits. This was a major improvement
   from EDP I where a lack of communication prevented bank participation in the program.

91 PEFG was also hampered by the global financial crisis and subsequent recession. The European
   Union (EU) accounts for over 70 percent of Tunisia’s exports in 2010 (mostly France, Italy and
   Germany which alone accounted for 56 percent of all exports in 2010 (IMF World Economic

                                                                                                        22
    Outlook). Tunisian trade was thus directly affected by the deterioration of economic conditions in the
    EU. The amount of credit guaranteed under PEFG fell nearly 48% between October 2009 and
    December 2010 (see figure 2 and 3 below). COTUNACE also found it difficult to extend the credit
    guarantee scheme beyond the planned closing date of March 2011 (the project was extended
    ultimately until September 2012). COTUNACE stopped pre-shipment financing in July 2011 given
    the intricate nature of export finance, the time taken to complete due diligence, and communications
    challenges due to the number of partners involved. Given the intricate nature of the scheme, the early
    stopping of the program is understandable.

92 Following the revolution, more attention was devoted to address the need of firms outside the Tunis
   region. As a result about 78 % all credit guarantees for 2011 benefited firms located outside the Tunis
   area (see figure 4 below).

93 Overall, the project succeeded in implementing an export finance guarantee scheme for SMEs across
   Tunisia. Among its indirect outcomes, PEFG has raised awareness among participating bankers that
   the guarantee provided by COTUNACE could replace collateral that often exporters lacked to
   conduct their operation, particularly for first time exporters.

B) Enhance the Efficiency and Performance of Trade Clearance Process Including Customs
Operations and Technical Controls, Thereby Making Trade Logistics More Efficient: This objective is
rated satisfactory.

Enhanced interactions and compliance with WTO:

94 Strengthening the capacity of INNORPI to collect, analyze, and disseminate information
   resulted in significant enhancements to interaction and compliance with the WTO. Since 2006,
   the notification delay to the WTO TBT committee of draft mandatory technical control requirements
   was reduced to the objective outlined in the PAD of 2 months. In 2005 these delays averaged 5-6
   months. Similarly the delay for accessing texts on WTO notification of technical controls for export
   was reduced to the objective outlined in the PAD of 2 months since 2006. In 2004 these delays were
   5-12 months on average. Tunisian norms related to ISO 15,000 were numerised and put on
   INNORPI’s website in 2008. The electronic information service “Export-Alert? setup by INNORPI in
   collaboration with the Canadian Council on Norms (CCN) continues to be operational since May
   2009 and has over 500 firms who are members. The Export-Alert system created an electronic
   platform for fast and efficient dissemination of changes with regards to TBT or associated norms and
   technical specifications. The Export-Alert electronic platform has enhanced coordination amongst
   suppliers and government agencies involved in trade, improved the ability of firms to access
   information on TBT, and overall simplified and made more efficient trade activity in the country. The
   system is sustainable in that it remains functional and well used by firms after project closing.

95 A communications strategy was developed in the last two years of the project. An educational
   seminar targeted to firms and Government stakeholders on INNORPI services and tools developed
   throughout the project took place in July 2011. Regional seminars were planned for outside of Tunis
   but were not completed due to administrative delays.

96 INNORPI successfully collaborated bilaterally (across governments) and multilaterally via
   international institutions involved in technical barriers to trade policy. INNORPI’s management
   successfully completed study tours in China and Thailand (2009) and Turkey (2010) of
   complementary public institution involved in standards and intellectual property. INNORPI received
   training from the Canadian Council on Norms (CCN) on the implementation of the Export Alerte
   system and associated back office support. Similarly, the team worked with the European
   Commission’s committee on technical barriers to trade (TBT) for further harmonization of Tunisia’s

                                                                                                     24
   TBT procedures with EU policy. Overall, the level of international cooperation was extensive on the
   project and helped ensure INNORPI’s activities were congruent with international norms.

97 The project continued progressing satisfactorily despite leadership changes within INNORPI. A
   new Director General was appointed as the head of INNORPI in September 2011. Bank staff
   commended INNORPI for their commitment to the project despite these leadership changes and a
   deterioration operational and economic environment associated with the December 2010 revolution.
   Bank staff encouraged INNORPI to highlight results of the project through sector workshops after the
   project closes as a way to encourage sustainability of project results.

Enhanced Efficiency of Technical Control Clearance:

98 This sub component sought to build on reforms started under EDP I to streamline the workflow of
   technical control procedures, specifically the back-office procedures carried out by Government
   employees and agencies. Through this streamlining, which would be done through the automated
   trading system (Tunisia Trade Net – TTN) setup under EDP I, processing times would be reduced for
   technical control requests for goods placed in warehouses (autorisation provisoire d’enlèvement –
   APE) and goods allowed to be placed on the market (autorisation mise a la consummation - AMC).

99 The Directorate of Quality and Consumer Protection (DQPC) was the technical control institution that
   realized the largest number of processing efficiency gains throughout the project. The DQPC had
   been able to decrease time needed for processing technical requests for goods to leave the
   customs sites and be placed in a warehouse (autorisation provisoire d’enlèvement – APE) from
   2 days to 2.75 hours. Processing times for goods to clear customs and be placed on the market
   (autorisation mise à la consummation- AMC) was reduced from 11 days to 3 hours as of
   November 2007. There is no evidence that may not have been maintained.

100 Processing times amongst other agencies within the Tunisian Government vary significantly.
    The average processing times for all other agencies is 24.96 hours, making aggregate (including the
    DQPC) average delays across all institutions to be 9.84 hours. While DQPC automated their
    processes in 2008 and CERT in 2008, other agencies involved in technical control procedures
    continue to complete procedures manually.

101 Figures for technical request processes were produced through a study on the Radis Port dating
    from November 2007. The Bank had requested more updated figures specifically with regards to
    APE and APC although none were produced prior to the closing of the project. The project was
    unable to connect all agencies to a new web-based information system, citing administrative and
    project management delays amongst certain ministries. This contributed to an inability to quantify
    recent progress forcing Bank staff to rely on the November 2007 figures.

102 Work on the technical controls database accelerated significantly from 2009-2011. The project
    used the final six month extension to successfully i) install the IT equipment; ii)
    test/operationalize the system; and iii) settle supplier contracts. The team should be commended
    for achieving the installation of the automated customs clearance database despite early challenges
    including administrative delays, departure of consultants, and difficulty at achieving the full
    commitment and organization from various ministries contributed to such delays. The project
    provided important insight into the challenges of working with multiple different Government
    Agencies on a single automation system (see section 6 – lessons learned for more information).

103 Significant diagnostic and preparatory work was completed on designing the integrated risk
    management system at the level of each technical control agency. A consultant completed

                                                                                                    25
    diagnostic work regarding the system structure and approach to be taken, which was described in
    outlined in a technical specification document. Developing the risk management system was delayed
    by nearly two years. This delay made it significantly more difficult to get the risk management system
    developed, tested, and operational across all technical control agencies by the project’s closing. This
    process was completed in March 2012.

Reduced transactions and trade logistics costs by improving and streamlining customs clearance and
border crossing procedures:

104 The project was successful is developing robust performance indicators measuring trade
    logistic performance (sub-component 4.3). The team adopted methodologies from the World Bank
    (Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southern Europe (TTFSE) and the World Customs Organization
    (Time Release Study) to analyze different time segments in the customs clearance process. A number
    of studies evaluating customs and supply-chain procedures were completed throughout the project,
    providing empirical estimates to trade facilitation delays. The unit, however, was not able to sustain
    this early effort and was unfortunately unable to continue coordinating with customs and sharing
    logistics data throughout the project lifecycle.

105 With regards to customs procedures (sub-component 4.2) the project was successful in reducing
    average delay times for customs process (reduction of approximately 40.2%; delay decrease
    from 10.1 to 5.95 days). Processing time due to customs (between declaration and release) passed
    from three days in December 2005 to half a day in October 2011. The percentage of customs
    declarations in the green channel was 50% as of October 2011, against a PAD objective of 80%.

106 The transition from the current customs information system (SYNDA) to a modern and more
    transparent information system was not completed. One option was the UNCTAD supported
    system (ASYCUDA) but the Tunisian authorities decided against because of they had built up
    institutional knowledge of the existing system. Activities to improve the risk management function of
    customs were also not completed as was the acquisition of computer equipment for customs due to
    new approval guidelines by the National Procurement Office. Customs decided that the
    procurement process needed to be re-launched to comply with new public procurement
    guidelines adopted after the revolution. In general administrative and strategic changes due to
    the revolution have significant impacts on team formation of the Customs Administration. This
    has helped explain delays in the final two years of the project. During ICR preparation it was difficult
    to get updated data and a summary of activities for the last two years of the project.


3.3 Efficiency

107 The project can be considered efficient in terms of its overall PDO which was to generate exports in
    relation to the amount of matching grant fund allocated. Both the economic analysis and EMAF data
    show that every $1 of grant money allocated under EMAF II generated over $8 in additional
    exports. Peer reviewers and trade specialists noted this is an excellent return, particularly given the
    challenging domestic and international environment Tunisian firms faced during that period. For
    PEFG for every dollar used in the guarantee, the facility generated close to $3 in additional
    exports. The project estimated net present value (NPV) is around $485.7 US millions with
    approximately $665 US Millions ($550 US + $115 US) millions in additional exports generated.
    Furthermore additional value added from salaries generated, financing cost, and profits are estimated
    to be around income from fiscal receipt are estimated to be around $215 US millions for EMAF II.
    Annex 3 provides full details on the economic analysis used to derive this figure.


                                                                                                         26
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(Combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

108 Based on the relevance of the project, achievement of the PDO, and efficiency, the project is
    rated satisfactory. The development objectives of the project remain highly relevant for the
    Government of Tunisia as well as the Bank at the time of ICR preparation. The GoT’s strong
    commitment to developing a third export competitiveness project deepening gains and addressing
    shortcoming of EDP II further reinforces the project’s relevance to the country. The project was
    effectively implemented. Its major achievements included contributing to increased export
    activity (both volume and diversity) amongst firms through EMAF II and PEFG II, and more
    strategically creating a commercial industry for export development services. Two independent
    impact evaluations established with statistical certainty that firms that participated in EMAF II saw
    increased export growth (in the short term) and greater diversification amongst markets and products.
    The project also provided the skills and experience necessary to firms to think strategically about
    export opportunities and implement appropriate associated policies. The project also created a market
    for business consulting services with regards to export promotion. Base on available estimates the
    project was efficient (see paragraph 106 just above).

109 The project led to improvements in the enabling environment for trade. This was done through
    policy reform which caused significant decreases in the time and cost of customs processing,
    increased coordination amongst technical control agencies, enhanced use of trade facilitation
    performance indicators, and greater use of modern information systems amongst key stakeholders
    (Government ministries, firms) that enhanced efficiency and transparency. In certain instances the
    project was successfully at coordinating and bringing market actors together who traditionally did not
    work together. For example, the PEFG facility was able to encourage greater banking sector
    involvement in facilitating finance for exporting firms across Tunisia, a significant achievement given
    banks in Tunisia are risk adverse and generally do not serve first time exporters.

110 The December 2010 revolution led to a deterioration of macro-level economic stability and
    public-sector stability. This often translated into changes in key personnel and procedures within
    Government ministries as well as the PCMU that contributed to project delays. For example, the
    acquisition of computer equipment for customs was delayed due to a new approval guideline by the
    National Procurement Office adopted after the revolution. Administrative hurdles, particularly with
    regards to procurement and decision-making through the PCMU, also contributed to operational
    delays that affected project implementation. Despite these delays, a significant majority of outcome
    indicators were met, a testament to the resilience, adaptability, and commitment of both the
    Government and key personnel within executing agencies.

111 The project also acted as a model for export development strategies within the MENA region,
    within the Bank, and to a broader set of policymakers and researchers. The project is notable not
    only for the successful implementation of a large-scale matching grant scheme to expand exports, but
    an integrated project that combined a diverse set of activities related to trade. For example, matching
    grants were combined with export finance guarantees, and a broad set of trade facilitation measures
    designed to decrease the cost and time of trading. The project has helped position Tunisia as a
    regional leader with regards to trade facilitation infrastructure. This is particularly important given the
    country’s limited natural resources and the ongoing political transition that is continuing to cause
    economic challenges (particularly unemployment) for the country. The project has helped Tunisia
    develop firms engaged in strategic trade activities that contribute to the development of a value-added
    economy.


                                                                                                            27
112 The project was successful at getting research and operational communities (both within and
    outside of the Bank) to dialogue, at both the project design stage and at the impact evaluation
    completion stage. An essential difficulty in preparing and managing a matching grant scheme is
    demonstrating the counter-factual. The team deserves recognition for the fact the project has been
    subject to some significant impact evaluation work that genuinely tries to assess the counter factual.
    The impact evaluations establish with statistical certainty that firms receiving EMAF II assistance
    were successful at boosting export growth, export diversification, and in many instance employment
    across the period of the project. While the long-term results of the second impact evaluation are
    noted, it is important to keep in mind the methodological limitations of these impact evaluations,
    particularly the fact the control group was randomly selected ex-post. Few projects are able to match
    this level of rigor in terms of establishing not only achievement of results indicators but also
    effectiveness of PDO based on empirical rigor.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

113 The project’s impact on poverty was indirect as it helped export and enhanced trade logistics to
    minimize the cost and time associated with trading goods. These outcomes are associated with
    economic growth and job creation, both of which can decrease poverty. At the macroeconomic level,
    the project supported expanding export activity, which contributes to economic growth and social
    development. Connected, within both EMAF II and PEFG activities significant efforts were made by
    implementing agencies to expand into underserved regions within Tunisia. For example, within
    PEFG’s operation, 78% of credit guaranteed and 77% of exports realized occurred outside of Tunis
    (see figure 4 for further detail).

114 The project supported gender indirectly. Although women may have benefited through additional
    job opportunities and increased income from expanding exporting firms and an improved overall
    trading environment, gender disaggregated indicators were not included as part of the M&E
    framework of the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

115 The project has clear and significant benefits in terms of institutional strengthening. All
    Government institutions involved in the project (from CEPEX to Customs) stated in ICR preparation
    qualitative interviews that they are far more aware of the importance of export promotion to overall
    economic development. Coordination and integration of activities was an important component of
    their individual work plans. For example, technical control agencies are now much more aligned with
    each other on standardized steps needed to enhance efficiency and coordination of goods. The partial
    automation of workflow through TTN and through the diagnostic development of an integrated risk
    management reinforces this coordination. CEPEX is looking to replicate the successes of FAMEX in
    current operational settings. This institutional strengthening and awareness is a significant
    achievement for the project and remains an important component of enhancing overall export
    competitiveness in Tunisia.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

116 In addition to export growth and diversification supported directly through PEFG and EMAF
    II or indirectly through strengthening trade logistics, the project has important market


                                                                                                       28
    demonstration effects. EMAF II demonstrated that firms are willing to pay on a commercial basis
    for export promotion services and technical assistance. Demand far exceeded intended targets for
    EMAF II. Many firms continue to ask for associated technical assistance after project closure. The
    project also led to the development of a commercial consulting industry for export assistance.
    Today there are 80 export consultants providing such services (according to qualitative interviews
    with project managers). In addition to the market demonstration effects, an enhanced knowledge of
    reaching export markets has helped develop a culture of value-added entrepreneurship in the country.
    This will enhance Tunisia’s competitiveness moving forward. Finally, the EMAF II concept is
    currently being replicated in other developing/emerging economies. For example, Malaysia – a
    country with significantly higher income and institutional complexity than Tunisia – is studying the
    semi-commercial matching grant model put forth through EMAF II.

117 The project also had unintended positive outcomes on employment. The 2011 impact evaluation
    found that employment in EMAF II firms grew annually by 5.5 % in 2004-2008 and by 4.6 % for
    firms in the control group. Although not a stated objective of the EMAF II matching grant program,
    the employment impact is important given Tunisia’s persistent unemployment and ongoing economic
    and social uncertainty due to the 2010 revolution. It is important to note that the small sample size
    implies results are sensitive to the specification used and not always statistically significant.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

118 Risks to the project outcomes encompass general country risks, risks to macroeconomic
    stability and export competitiveness, and project specific risks.

119 EDP II was prepared and began implementation well before the events of the Tunisian revolution.
    The political situation in Tunisia has changed dramatically since 2005. The revolution has affected
    key ministries, administrative procedures, Government priorities, and overall public-sector capacity.
    These events were outside the control of the project yet had significant impacts on project
    completion. In many cases the heads of implementing agencies were replaced (three times in the case
    of the technical controls component) and as a result institutional memory was fractured. The
    revolution and the 2011 general elections caused daily economic and political uncertainty,
    which made implementing complex project components more challenging. For example, new
    procurement rules adopted after the revolution caused delays in the finalizing acquisition and
    installation of equipment for the Customs Administration. Despite these political-economy
    challenges, the project was successful in moving forward activities, for example maintaining
    levels of assistance to exporters and pushing through trade logistics reforms, in part due to
    multiple project extensions. The long-term benefits of the project, including enhanced ability of
    firms to access markets and enhanced knowledge of trade logistics amongst Government ministries,
    have remained and are in many ways are now more important given Tunisia is squarely focused on
    maintaining growth and competitiveness and addressing the country’s unemployment issue.

120 Another key risk to sustained project outcomes is the macroeconomic situation. Following the
    revolution, growth fell to -1.1% for fiscal year 2011, largely because of downturns in tourism and
    foreign direct investments, decreased in trade remittances from both neighboring countries (also in
    political transition) and from recessionary conditions in Europe. Growth started to recover in 2012
    and is expected to increase to approximately 3.7 percent in 2013 and 4.9 percent in 2014 as a result of
    the sustained recovery in exports, tourism and FDI, the continuation of major public investments, and
    reform measures adopted by the Government. The state of the economy impacts significantly export



                                                                                                        29
    demand. Similarly, a deteriorating economic situation generally strains public budgets making it more
    difficult for reforms under EDP II to be maintained.

121 With regard to project specific risks, the largest risk relates to implementation capacity and long-term
    follow through of trade facilitation reforms as governments ministries continue to change personnel
    and procedures. This risk is mitigated by extensive documentation of reforms related to trade
    facilitation and by the institutional memory within the Ministry of Commerce. The
    Government can play a coordination and strategic planning role post project to ensure
    implemented reforms continue. Similarly, the Bank is currently preparing a third competitiveness
    project which seeks to further anchor the reforms begun under EDP II and ensure development
    outcomes are maintained. Under the third competitiveness project the matching grant portion will be
    housed within CEPEX (a permanent Government structure) and the focus will be on capacity building
    of CEPEX stand to ensure long-term implementation of the matching grant scheme.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

122 The quality at entry assessment determined the project’s overall quality at entry to be
    satisfactory. The assessment was based on review of key project documents and a lengthy interview
    with several member of the task team and two representatives from the Government executing
    agencies. The report cites staff continuity from EDP I, effective use of experience from the first
    project, and the project being part of a robust framework of overall assistance for Tunisia by the
    Bank. The assessment also assigned a Satisfactory rating to the eight quality dimension and to the
    Bank’s Inputs and Processes. These ratings reflect the panel’s judgment on the good use made during
    project design of internal experience with export development and the experience gained under EDPI
    I, as well as the team’s careful selection of components that have a high likelihood of being
    implemented                                                                             successfully.

123 The project’s identification and design were compatible with the CAS, the project built on the
    lessons learned under the first EDP, and it was consistent with the Government’s development
    strategy for the sector as also noted in section 2.1. Importantly, the project had the benefit of
    learning from a predecessor operation, the first EDP, and it was able to refine the project to ensure a
    successful implementation. Learning from EDP resulted in innovation in project design including a
    greater focus on technical control harmonization to enhance overall trade facilitation, ambitious
    volume targets for PEFG and EMAF II components, and integration of Government and private
    agencies involved in trading through online platforms. A particular strength was the development of
    a detailed operational manual, which helped ensure that the project was implemented effectively and
    that the PCMU was following bank procedures and effectively coordinating between the many
    implementing agencies.

124 While outcome indicators in the PAD generally reflected project objectives and associated
    activities well, certain indicators could have been more fully developed during project
    preparation to capture project complexity. For example, clearer outcome indicators related to sub-
    component 4.3 (trade logistics performance indicators) in the results framework could have a) better
    guided the client during project implementation, b) provided clarity for how the expected results with
    regards to developing trade logistics indicators for Tunisia and for the customs administration, and c)


                                                                                                         30
    provided better insight into how sub-component 4.3 linked with larger components. Similarly,
    outcome indicators for component 2 (PEFG; export financing guarantee) were too ambitious given
    structural complexities of implementing a pre-shipment financing guarantee scheme in an emerging
    market where bank are highly risk adverse.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

125 The Bank was proactive in the identification of opportunities and resolution of problems.
    Throughout project implementation, the focus remained on development impact, and the task team
    did not shy away from changing project elements to reflect project design, for example working
    through the $6 million in additional finance to meet market demand for EMAF II, or extending the
    project twice to maximize the possibility of project activities being met, particularly with respect to
    procurement and other administrative delays. Similarly, the Bank encouraged high performing
    components to achieve stretch targets. EMAF II indicators were twice increased and both EMAF II
    and PEFG were encouraged to serve firms outside of Tunis towards more underdeveloped geographic
    locations. Similarly, the Bank provided constructive feedback to executing agencies encountering
    difficulties and developed strategies to overcome bottlenecks (e.g. sub-component 4.1 (technical
    controls and sub-component 4.2 customs).

126 Bank supervision remained strong despite changing TTLs three times. Issues related to external
    and market volatility after 2010 were highlighted in aide mémoires. Mitigation measures were well
    outlined. The Bank supervision team was successful at coordinating with many different Government
    agencies given the large number of components and complex structure of the project. Mitigation plans
    were made with appropriate implementing agencies to complete or accelerate remaining tasks and to
    address bottlenecks- often surrounding procurement and launching of new systems – preventing full
    completion of sub-components. Similarly, Bank staff and the Government pursued project extensions
    to allow components to be completed given the challenging external environment (see paragraph 19
    for summary of extensions). Bank staff should be particularly commended for outlining key issues
    and liaising with client counterparts effectively given the high turnover in staff following the
    December 2010 revolution.

127 While project supervision was generally satisfactory, Bank supervision documents were not
    systematically updated. The ISRs were not always fully completed. Particularly with regards to
    customs and technical control components, aide memoires and ISRs repeated positive achievements
    from past years while failing to provide adequate attention to problem areas (institutional capacity,
    willingness to complete project activities) that prevented effective completion of all components.
    Similarly, the accuracy of performance indicators used can be questioned as data was at times out of
    date or would change depending on which document was being referenced (e.g. aide memoir versus
    ISR versus Government quarterly report). While aide-memoires were well written, and reflected
    accurately key issues (as determined by stakeholder interviews conducted for ICR preparation), they
    at times had to rely on old performance indicators (in the case of technical control indicators –
    although this was outlined as an issue) and had a tendency to be repetitive in their outlining of issues
    from one mission to the next.

128 Particularly in the final two years of the project, World Bank staff could have been more
    proactive regarding delays in activity completion. They also could have paid more attention to
    operational changes, modifications to Government policy, and administrative turnover that
    contributed to project delays. Between 2010-2012 additional attention and possibly resources could
    have been given to implementing agencies in order to ensure project deliverables above that of a
    project extension. This could have taken the form of additional technical assistance or even just

                                                                                                         31
   enhanced reporting on project advancement to better understand how the political situation was
   affecting the project and what (if anything) the Bank could have done to support the project during
   this time. Given the challenging domestic environment from 2010 onwards, supervision mission
   could have been increased to twice a year during the 2010-2012 period in response to deteriorating
   market and internal conditions in the country (see section 6 lessons learnt for more on this).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

129 Based on the above analysis, the overall Bank performance can be considered moderately
    satisfactory. While the Bank’s performance is commendable given the changing economic and
    administrative conditions due to the December 2010 revolution and given the project was highly
    complex, additional attention to outcome indicators in project preparation and closer
    monitoring of project delays during the last two years was needed. The Bank could have provided
    more direct support to the PCMU and struggling executing agencies during this time. Overall, while
    the team responded to the changing project conditions, the Bank could have gone further to maximize
    the conditions for success for each project component.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

130 The Government’s performance in creating an enabling environment for project success during
    both preparation and implementation was satisfactory. Government ownership and involvement
    remained high following the completion of EDP I. This was demonstrated by the relatively quick
    transition to EDP II (six months between closing and effectiveness of second project). This helped
    ensure the continuation of the current consultants (for both EMAF and PEFG) which helped minimize
    disruptions in project activities and sent a positive signal to private operators. The Government
    endorsed the project at the highest level and facilitated the communication campaign for key
    components of the project such as EMAF II as well as for the PEFG.

131 The fact that many agencies were involved in project implementation made coordination and
    stakeholder commitment critical. The Government played a significant role in coordinating the
    implementing agencies through project preparation, specifically through diagnostic work related to
    how to best deepen EDP I reforms, determining implementing arrangements amongst the sub-
    components, and acting as an interlocutor between the implementing agencies and the Bank. This
    work was often complex. For example, sub-component 4.1 (technical control enhancement) had over
    7 different Government agencies involved in migrating to a central operating system and information
    sharing platform. Managing the administrative and operational structures within each agency to move
    forward outputs for the entire project was very challenging for the PCMU.

132 Similarly the Government rightly anticipated strong demand for EMAF II and asked, shortly
    into the second year of the project, for additional financing from the Bank. This additional
    financing was crucial in ensuring demand was met for EMAF II components and market creation
    benefits were realized.

133 Government ownership throughout project supervision was also satisfactory. Regardless of
    significant economic and political changes associated with the revolution, the Government kept EDP
    II a priority, as evidenced by the multiple project extensions asked for and consistent reporting on
    project deliverables through quarterly reports. Personnel within implementation agencies should
    be commended for maintaining (to the best of their ability) their commitment to accomplishing

                                                                                                     32
    project deliverables despite changes in senior management and uncertainty regarding basic
    Government structure during the last two years of the project. The government’s commitment to
    the project is also evidence by the ongoing negotiations over a third EDP project that incorporates
    much of the lessons learned from this project.

134 The PCMU, thorough quick follow-up and early involvement with corrective actions,
    contributed to a satisfactory implementation of the project. The PCMU made serious efforts over
    the last 6 months of 2010 to ensure better coordination and preparation of procurement documents
    and to complete back-logged financial management audits. This helped ensure sound project
    management. The PCMU’s effectiveness has however declined slightly towards the end of the project
    – specifically following the events of the revolutions. The change in project managers (3 during the
    course of the project) caused certain administrative delays. Implementing agencies cited delays from
    the Ministry of Commerce (often directed through the PCMU) as an occasional impediment to
    accomplishing objectives. In March 2012, however, a new head was appointed which helped refocus
    the project and used the remaining six month to finish necessary tasks and keep the project on course.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

135 EMAF II implementation performance has been commendable. Starting early on with effective
    management and a smooth transition, existing EMAF II staff played an important role in the design
    and implementation of the project. EMAF II team also demonstrated a good capacity of adaptation to
    a changing environment. Following additional financing and the global financial crisis and revolution,
    the management team was able to respond to increased demand and reduced its response time to firms
    while remaining focus on client requirements. EMAF II management provided timely reports of
    progress to date to the PCMU and was able to increase the efficiency with which it processed firm
    applications throughout the course of the project. EMAF II staff could have had a broader
    geographical representation within Tunisia. There was no EMAF II staff members located in regional
    offices a directive outlined in the original approved PAD (page 30).

136 COTUNACE has made good progress by significantly improving its management from EDP I.
    It ensured adequate implementation in terms of required resources and capacity needed, as well as
    working on the participation of banks early on. Its activities decreased following successive project
    extensions due to uncertainty in future commitments among operators (banks and firms alike). This
    decrease in activities is more due to the intricate nature of export financing guarantees rather than
    management performance. COTUNACE also encountered challenges working with participating
    banks on certain guarantee cases, specifically because of Bank often insisted on collateral in addition
    to export financing and the general non-performance risk of firms. This is an endemic long-term
    challenge to financial sectors in many developing and emerging markets. COTUNACE should be
    commended for showing strong commitment to overcome the risk aversion of banks through
    educational outreach throughout project implementation. COTUNACE should be commended for
    using EDP II as a launching pad for related endeavors. After assessing feedback from
    participating firms in the PEFG program, they are currently designing plans to expand
    investment insurance to help Tunisia firms move into African markets.

137 INNORPI’s management team ensured satisfactory implementation of all sub components
    through thorough and systematic follow up of activities. Most targets had been met ahead of
    project closure. There were instances where the implementation of some activities with respect to
    procurement and acquisition were delayed because of lack of coordination with the PCMU. INNORPI
    continued activities largely uninterrupted despite changes in the director general of the institutions in


                                                                                                          33
    September 2011. Despite stated plans, INNORPI was unable to hold a seminar for private sector firms
    and Government representatives on INNORPI services in regions outside of Tunis.

138 Customs made significant strides toward implementing the project activities, particularly in
    terms of reduction of processing time (from 9 days to half a day by 2010 ), adopting a new code
    des douanes aligned on international standards, working toward a single windows at the Port of
    Rades, and improving the access to green channel for merchandise. Processing times increased
    somewhat in 2011, although this was largely understandable given administrative changes associated
    with the December 2010 revolution and subsequent political changes. Certain reforms included in the
    work program were not realized, such as modernizing the custom’s information system and finalizing
    the risk management system. This was due to a variety of administrative and strategic delays that
    were prolonged over the second half of the project. Similarly, there were procurement delays with
    respect to upgrading to an internationally recognized management information systems (ASYCUDA).

139 The Unit in charge of Trade facilitation and Logistics (Unité de Facilitation du Commerce
    International et de la Logistique) was successful at delivering performance indicators measuring
    trade logistic performance. A number of studies evaluating customs and supply-chain procedures
    were completed throughout the project, providing empirical estimates to connectivity and trade
    facilitation delays. The DQPC and other technical control agencies were successful at reinforcing
    information infrastructure, developing a new database on technical controls, and increasing
    coordination amongst technical control ministries. The unit faced operational challenges at the
    beginning of the project because they had a relatively undefined PDO and little instruction from the
    Ministry of Commerce. While coordination was strong with the Customs administration during the
    first three years of the project, it was unable to sustain this early effort and unfortunately was unable
    to continue coordinating with customs and sharing logistics data throughout the project lifecycle.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

140 Overall the Borrower showed a high level of commitment and ownership despite significant
    challenges the financial crisis in Europe, the Tunisian revolution, and the high staff turnover on
    both sides (Bank and government). Two project extensions enabled some of the project component
    that were delayed to further project activities (EMAF, DQPC, and Customs). Project delays did,
    however, create some operational uncertainties (particularly for EMAF II and COTUNACE) and
    prevented a smooth transition to a third project. World Bank staff and the PCMU reported that
    implementing agencies were occasionally reluctant to share information in a timely manner, which
    resulted in isolated cases of reporting delays. The coordination unit managed to carry on despite
    significant lack of human and financial resource during the last year of the project. The remaining
    implementing agencies demonstrated resourcefulness and creativity in ensuring the completion
    of their activities.

6. Lessons Learned

    The Importance of Coordination, Clearly Defined Procedures, and Mitigation Measures in
    the Event of Unanticipated Changes

141 Due to the multiplicity of Government agencies, projects such as EDP II require strong and
    effective coordination. Almost all implementing agencies reported administrative delays and
    difficulties because of the need to directly correspond with to the World Bank through the PCMU.
    Similarly, leadership changes within the PCMU (3 changes to project manager) and with key Bank

                                                                                                          34
    staff (3 TTLs) throughout the project lifecycle contributed to administrative delays. This was a major
    point of discussion in qualitative interviews held during ICR preparation. It is understandable the
    EDPII would encounter administrative challenges, particularly given the complexity of the project
    components (5 components and 3 sub-components) and the country-specific challenges (Tunisian
    revolution, political and economic instability). From the Bank and PCMU perspective, the lack of
    information sharing from implementing agencies made effective reporting and integration a
    significant challenge through the project.

142 The main lesson to retain is striving to find a balance between the need to improve synergies
    among project components and coordination particularly with regards to the flow of
    information and administrative duties between project components and the coordination unit.


    Key lessons to draw include:

       Importance of clear procedures with regards to reporting and administrative management;
        ensuring these procedures are followed through strong supervision from project management and
        Bank supervision teams
       Need for constant communication between project stakeholders to minimize administrative delays
       Need for back-up reporting procedures in the event of change in PCMU leadership and other
        managerial changes
       Importance of documentation in order to ensure that during the event of a change in management
        within the PCMU, reporting procedures remain in place and transitions become less troublesome.

    Program Complexity:

143 EDP II was a very complex program, with five major components, 3 sub-components, and 6 different
    implementing agencies. The technical controls component involved migrating 7 different Government
    agencies to a common information platform. Effectively supervising, tracking progress, and
    identifying problem areas were made more difficult because of this complexity. While issues were
    raised during World Bank supervision missions, the mere number of components made
    effective identification of core problems and tracking associated resolutions difficult given
    competing priorities. Project complexity was further increased after 2010 when key Government
    personnel changed and in many cases (for example EMAF II and customs) operational priorities were
    modified.

144 Future projects must balance the benefits with the challenges of project complexity. Although
    multiple components provides an opportunity for greater development impact, managing this
    complexity is a challenge even for high performing PCMUs and experienced TTLs, both of whom
    have many competing priorities in project implementation and supervision. This project demonstrates
    that simplifying projects to focus on core deliverables should be further considered, particularly given
    the MENA region’s current volatility.

    Developing Synergies between Components to Ensure Maximum Development Impact:

145 Implementing units reported a lack of integration with other project components, noting they
    often had limited contact with other project components despite the significant cross-over in the
    work being pursued. A steering committee comprised of management from each implementing
    agency was launched although the frequency with which it met was limited. For example, while there
    were natural synergies in the firms receiving EMAF II assistance with the firm profile receiving

                                                                                                         35
    PEFG assistance, there were no direct integrated efforts to cross-market. COTUNACE officials were
    present at all FAMEX events, but there was nothing in the project design that integrated these
    components to truly leverage synergies. While many of the project components were successful at
    achieving outcome indicators, a heightened focus on component integration may have helped increase
    development impact.

    Efficiency versus Sustainability in Project Design

146 Within project design, there is a trade-off between efficiency and sustainability. The project
    relied extensively on consultants throughout implementation, particularly for management of
    FAMEX and COTUNACE, as well as systems development and capacity building for the trade
    facilitation components. In many cases consultants were highly successful at project implementation.
    For example, FAMEX had achieved its outcome indicators by late 2007 and demand outweighed
    supply throughout the project’s lifecycle. FAMEX was considered an island of excellence within
    CEPEX. There was nothing in the project’s design to integrate FAMEX into CEPEX, which may
    have helped ensure efficiency in the short-run while placing much less emphasis on overall
    sustainability.

147 Future export development projects should recognize the importance of striving for both
    efficiency and sustainability. Consultants and independent entities may be recruited by Government
    to help achieve outcomes more efficiently, however, without building public sector capacity, long-
    term sustainability may be sacrificed if Government is unable to implement activities once the project
    is closes. At the time of writing, a third EDP project is being prepared that will seek to achieve greater
    sustainability by integrating matching grant activities within CEPEX structures.

    Importance of Strong and Complete Monitoring and Evaluation:

148 EDP II demonstrates that the Bank team will have to pay close attention to monitoring the
    achievement of the intermediate targets, and if necessary amend Annex 1 of the PAD
    throughout the project life cycle. Outcome indicators in the PAD were inconsistent and incomplete
    for certain project components. In a number of cases targets were set too low or too high. For
    example, the original indicators listed for FAMEX (assisting 500 firms and 40 professional
    associations) were accomplished in 2007, while outcome indicators for COTUNACE were never
    achieved, despite the project being run in a satisfactory manner. Similarly there are no outcome
    indicators for sub-component 4.3 (trade logistics performance indicators) included directly in the
    PAD and subsequent aide memoires.

149 As a result we suggest additional analysis was needed in drafting key components of the results
    framework. There is a strong need for robust analysis within project preparation documents and
    outcome indicators to ensure effective indicators exist to capture the complexities of development
    objectives we are looking to achieve. The project could have benefited from revisiting outcome
    indicators during project implementation to reflect changes in operational and environmental
    performance (this was done for FAMEX component 1 but not for other components).

    Responsiveness to Changing Market Conditions Reduces Implementation Delays:

150 The revolution coupled with economic deterioration due to the global economic recession had a
    profound impact on this project. Certain implementing agencies were able to mitigate these risks
    through repositioning key staff, effectively communicating with the PCMU regarding changes in key
    personnel, and changing operational priorities (for example in the case of customs). The need for

                                                                                                           36
    effective project management and Bank supervision is critical in such changing market conditions.
    The components that were less successful at weathering these changes could have been more
    proactive on implementing response strategies. Similarly, the Bank could have been more proactive at
    monitoring and providing implementation support.

    Communication and Ownership:

151 Mechanism such as EMAF II and PEFG require effective but also sustained communication
    campaigns. In the case of PEFG the participation of banks would have added benefit to the project
    had it been sustained.

    Impact Evaluations:

152 Projects such as EPD II that contain matching grants can benefit significantly from impact
    evaluation studies built into the project’s design. Both impact evaluations completed for EDP II
    pointed to the need for generating information early on through surveys that include real control
    groups as opposed to simulated control groups. The third export competitiveness project for Tunisia –
    currently being prepared – will incorporate an impact evaluation explicitly into its project design.
    Similarly, impact evaluations must be backed by a coordinated dissemination strategy for
    policymakers inside and outside of the Bank, as well as the Government counterparts. The
    methodology and results of the impact evaluations for EDP II continue to be regularly debates. It is
    important to accurately understand their results as to ensure the results are not taken out of context.

    Supervision Missions:

153 Given the complexity of multi agencies projects in order to follow the project targets and goals more
    closely, increasing the number of supervision mission accordingly may be warranted .

    Gender:

154 We cannot provide an adequate assessment on gender outcomes for EDP II because indicators were
    not included in annex III of the PAD and subsequently not tracked during project implementation. An
    export development project such as EDP II can benefit greatly from tracking gender
    disaggregated indicators as well as dedicating project resources and activities specifically to
    targeting women beneficiaries. PREM Trade has done significant analytical and sectoral work
    regarding gender and trade. Future export development projects should incorporate this work into
    project design.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Second Export Market Access Fund (EMAF II)

EMAF II processed 1239 firms and 94 business associations, largely exceeding the initial objectives of
500 firms and 40 associations served by the end of the project. EMAF II finalized projects with 1,232
firms. This resulted in successful export operations for 870 firms and 54 business associations.
Furthermore additional financing of $6 million was provided in 2008 by the World Bank in order to
respond to greater demand for assistance to enable firms to enter export markets and to maintain the
momentum EMAF II had created. Through EMAF II beneficiaries firms generated incremental exports of
$550 million thus exceeding its development target of $528 mn in additional exports. 30% of those firms
were new exporters, 52% targeted new markets and 19% of firms exported new products. Extending the
project from March 31-September 30 2012 allowed the completion of the remaining marketing plans as
well as to finalize pending administrative transactions related to remaining export plans.

Beneficiaries firms operated in a diverse set of sectors (see figure below) with a more significant share of
services (28%) compared to EMAF I, which focused on manufacturing. EMAF II also promoted foreign
market implementation. Out of 273 firms applying for support to open a foreign branch, 115 succeeded
mainly in newer non-traditional markets (Maghreb and other parts of Europe). 52% of those were seeking
new export markets, indicating the correct anticipation that Tunisian export increasingly sought new
markets and product diversification.

In addition a number of consortia and business associations were assisted through EMAF II. 38 firms
formed consortia to realize export operations, resulting in 54 export plans. It remains unclear, however,
whether the business association had been formed with the goals of benefiting from EMAF II assistance.

                                                                                                         41
Component          2:       Pre-Shipment          Finance         Guarantees         (PEFG)          Facility

The Pre Export Finance Guarantee scheme generated around $115 mn of additional exports and allocated
$54 mn in working capital guarantees. 225 firms benefited from the guarantees through the participation
of 18 banks in the scheme. Particularly in the initial years of the project the guaranty facility was able to
develop strong links with Banks through a communication campaign and workshop designed to capture
the adherence of bankers. In terms of operational effectiveness PEFG was able to reduce its processing
time from 12 days in 2007 to 8 days in 2012.

The total export generated through assisted firms (EMAF II + PEFG) amounted to $665 Million,
representing 84% of the initial target of $787 million, which represents the total additional export
generated by both components (FAMEX and PEFG). This is the case despite EMAF II exceeding its
targets of by $16.8 mn (550-528) and is due to the ambition PEFG target of $259 million additional firms
supported by EMMAF.

Component         3:     WTO         Technical         Barriers     to      Trade       Enquiry         Point

Strengthening the capacity of INNORPI to collect, analyze, and disseminate information resulted in
significant enhancements to the interaction and compliance with the WTO. Since 2006, the notification
delay to the WTO TBT committee of draft mandatory technical control requirements was reduced to 2
months (PAD objective, against 5-6 months on average in 2005-2006). The delay for accessing texts on
WTO notification of technical controls for export has been 2 months since 2006 (PAD objective, against
5-12 months on average in 2004). The electronic information service “Export-Alert? setup by INNORPI
in collaboration with the Canadian Council on Norms (CCN) continues to be operational since May 2009
2008 and has over 500 firms who are members. Tunisian norms related to ISO 15,000 were numerised
and put on INNORPI’s website in 2008.

Component 4: Trade Logistics

Sub-Component 4.1: Enhanced Integration of Technical Control Procedures and Strengthened
Risk Management Protocols:

The Directorate of Quality and Consumer Protection (DQPC) was the technical control institution that
realized the largest number of processing efficiency gains throughout the project. The DQPC had been
able to decrease time needed for processing technical requests for goods to leave the customs sites and be
placed in a warehouse (autorisation provisoire d’enlèvement – APE) from 2 days to 2.75 hours.
Processing times for goods to clear customs and be placed on the market (autorisation mise à la
consummation- AMC) was reduced from 11 days to 3 hours. These figures, however, were measured in
November 2007. Bank staff repeatedly called for these figures to be updated using more recent data,
however this never occurred.

Processing times amongst other agencies within the Tunisian Government vary significantly. The average
processing times for all other agencies is 24.96 hours, making aggregate (including the DQPC) average
delays across all institutions to be 9.84 hours. While DQPC automated their processes in 2008 and CERT
in 2008, other agencies involved in technical control procedures continue to complete procedures
manually. A risk management system designed to improve efficiencies across technical control agencies
was delayed by nearly two years. The system was eventually developed and tested but full
implementation was not achieved before project closing. See section 3.2 for full analysis of managerial
and administrative delays related to technical controls component.

With regards to customs procedures (sub-component 4.2) the project was successful in reducing average
delay times for customs process (reduction of approximately 40.2%; delay decrease from 10.1 to 5.95
days). During that period, processing time due to customs (between declaration and release) passed from
three days in December 2005 to half a day in October 2011. The % of customs declarations in the green
was 50% as of October 2011, against a PAD objective of 80%.

Outputs procured within sub-component 4.2 include the following:

Project objectives were largely achieved regarding the development of robust performance indicators
measuring trade logistic performance (sub-component 4.3). The team adopted methodologies from the
World Bank (Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southern Europe (TTFSE) and the World Customs
Organization (Time Release Study) to analyze different time segments in the customs clearance process.
A number of studies evaluating customs and supply-chain procedures were completed throughout the
project, providing empirical estimates to connectivity and trade facilitation delays.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

At appraisal, the Bank team undertook a socio- economic assessment of EDP II. The design of the project
which contains multiple components and sub components as well as a significant institution and capacity
building dimension made it challenging to capture its overall social and economic impact. Spillover
benefits such as the development of an export consulting industry, the opportunity costs resulting from
goods manufactured by beneficiaries firms that would otherwise have been imported, jobs created and
added fiscal revenues could not be adequately quantified.

Using estimated and real actual figures allows us to test the robustness of the initial model design. In both
cases we find that the design and the mechanics of the model used for projections are adequate in terms of
projections if used with more conservatives’ assumptions ( see summary result table below)

EMAF II Economic impact

EMAF II economic impact was estimated based on a total of 540 beneficiaries with a grant of US$34
million. The following assumptions were used:

    -   Benefits for the business associations (40) and the firms (500) were grouped because it was
        believed that the number of trade association would remain modest and therefore did not justify
        using a different trade ratio multiplier for the associations.

    -   The EMAF II grant would be disbursed over a four year period plus two additional years to
        measure the benefits through year six. The number of beneficiaries would be spread over the four
        years of disbursement. The trade ratio multiplier increased form 2 during the first year to 4 , 6 and
        8 for the last year.

    -   The discount rate used was 8%

    -   The value added distribution of the export stream was based on EDP I which was inspired from
        countries with similar trade profiles (Ecuador, Mauritius)

    -   Taxes on export were based on average fiscal recovery, with 17.5% for payroll and 20% for
        income corporate tax. Likewise for employees of exporters with 9.3% on salaries and 3% on
        VAT paid up salaries.

According to Table 1 and 2 the initial projected figures of EMAF II show significant gains in incremental
or additional exports as well as on total value9. The initial assumptions attempted to account for a number
of factors. It was therefore estimated at appraisal that EFAM II would yield approximately US$528
million in accumulated export over 6 years with a Net Present Value of US$367 million for a total value
added of 215 (see table 1). We attempt to replicate the model using the same initial model design and
assumption which shows that EMAF II yields total incremental exports of US$952 million. Under the
hypotheses used at appraisal, the model overestimates the actual number realized (US$ 550 million).

Lessons learned

A number of challenges presented themselves in order to replicate the models. The EMF II accounts had
not been finalized at the time this ICR was written10 so the annual actual numbers for disbursement and
beneficiaries were not readily available especially for the last year which was estimated.11

The initial model used at appraisal for EMAF II generates optimistic figures. The assumptions that the
exports effects will accrue over 2 years after the life of the project seems to be reasonable but the
magnitude of the effect accrued is in our view was too large. In addition the trade ratio multipliers was
also large as it based on an overall average and in reality can vary significantly. It would be more realistic
to be conservative with this ratio. In fact it has been observed that it tends to diminish with time instead of
increase. A potential future model should attempt to present scenarios (sensitivity analysis) based on
different disbursement rates, revised export growth rates of past beneficiaries and diminishing trade
ratios.

    The fact that the final Financial management audit had not yet been conducted for EMAF II because the consultants left at project closing
illustrates some of the sustainability challenges that confronted the project.
11
    In addition the economic impact analysis was designed for a four year period but EDP II was extended and EMAF II benefited from added
financing from both the bank and the Tunisian government. The initial planned total grant of US$34 Million was exceeded (EMAF II total grant
was approximately US$44. million over a 7 year period).

PEFG economic impact

The initial analysis was based on fund of shows an estimate based on an initial fund of US$5 million with
improved management compared to EDP I and the following assumptions

       The guarantee coverage fund ratio will gradually increase from 2 in the first year to 4 in the
        second and third year to 5 and 6 respectively for year 4 and 5. Representing a more conservative
        estimate over EDP I.

       The average yearly turnover of pre-shipment export finance is equal to 2, with a maximum
        maturity of 6-months.

       For an export order of US$1 the PEFG covers US$0.81, which is 90 percent loan share times 90
        percent guarantee share.

       The net default rates decline from 3% in the first year to 2.5% in the second year 2% and 1.5 %
        for the third and fourth year and 1% for the last year. These rates reflect the technical assistance
        supplied to SMEs.

       Additional annual exports of US$1 million generate 100 jobs.

       The administrative costs would initially represent 1.7% of the guarantee outstanding and decrease
        to 1% in the final year.

       The annual premium fate applied to the guarantee outstanding is 1.8%.

       The fund’s annual interest earnings are 4%.

It was estimated that US$1 would covers US$2.47 on annual exports with a PEFG coverage ratio of 1
(1/90%*90%) * 2 =2.4. This meant that with a coverage ratio of 6 at the end of the 5th year, one dollar of
fund would cover 2.47*6= 14.8 Therefore a US$5 million fund had the potential to cover US$74.1


                                                                                                          50
million of exports. The NPV of the benefits would represent US$200 million for the first 5 years; while
the NPV of net social benefits represented US$92 million for the same period.

We obtain these figures by using the same model and actual figures12 Again we find that some of the
assumptions seemed slightly overly optimistic, particularly with regard to the guarantee coverage ratio
which was the main driver of export generated, and the percent guarantee share – set at 90%. Our results
show that the total export generated over 7 years was US$149.4 million with a NPV of additional export
of US$118.78 million compared to an initial estimated gain of NPV US$200 million and total exports of
US$259 million. The actual export generated was around US$115 million thereby showing the model to
overestimate.
We revise assumptions as follow:
    - On average the actual annual of pre shipment export coverage ration should not exceed 3. loan
        maturity revolved around 160 to 147 and 196 but varied across industries so it is reasonable to
        keep it at 180 days

       -   The percent guarantee share varied between manufacturing and services with around 20% in
           services to 80: max in industries. An estimated average rate should be around 45%

Using these assumptions and going back to the original formula the model estimates US$1 covers US$
6.3 of annual exports with a PEFG coverage ratio of 1 (1/40%*90%) * 2=4.5 Therefore according to the
model US$5 million could cover 22.5 million of additional exports in year 1 as opposed to US$74
millions as originally estimated.

Overall we find that the assumptions could be revised as per the result mentioned. The assumption that
the $US 5 million capital of the fund could be available every year to generate exports (based on the 5
million fund capital being exhausted annually) is unlikely and therefore exports and NVPO could be
overestimated , along with overly optimist coverage ratio and credit outstanding explain the discrepancies
between projected and actual. Readjusting the coverage ratio and credit outstanding assumption could
generate more realistic projections.

Method:

The authors evaluated EMAF II by comparing changes in relevant outcomes (such as exporting) before
and after EMAF II across firms that got EMAF II support (the “Treatment? group) and firms that are
similar but did not get EMAF II support (the “Control? group). Ideally, these groups should have been
‘identical’ prior to EMAF II, so that it can be safely assumed that changes in the relevant outcomes during
this period would have been the same across the treatment and control groups, had it not been for EMAF
II. One way to ensure that such ideal treatment and control groups existed would have been a randomized
acceptance of applicants to EMAF II. Unfortunately this best-case strategy was not possible, since
acceptance into the program was not random, and that the most promising applicants are systematically
more likely to have been accepted. Keeping this is mind, the author’s designed a strategy that attempted
to come as close to the idealized approach as possible. The authors wanted to identify a control group
which is the most similar to the treatment group, so that it can be argued that changes in outcomes across
this control group is a good measure of what would have happened to EMAF II firms during this period
had they not received EMAF II support.

Given that the authors did not have an ideal ex-ante identical control group, they randomly selected
similar Tunisian firms as a control group, and then compared the ‘treatment’ and the ‘control’ groups
after controlling for differences along observable dimensions such as size, age, sector, and prior exporting
status. They controlled for observable differences using Propensity Score Matching (PSM), a statistical
matching technique that attempts to estimate the effect of a policy or program by accounting for the
covariates that predict receiving the treatment. The logic behind this approach is that once these
observables are controlled for, all other differences across these two groups of firms in outcomes before
and after EMAF II are due to their different EMAF II status. This approach was applied to two datasets.
One is an in-depth survey of 196 EMAF II firms and 232 similar control firms while the second dataset is
based on detailed customs data and compares 400 EMAF II firms to 2600 Tunisians firms.

Results:

In contrast with the raw comparison (without PSM), PSM gave higher and statistically significant
differences for growth in export volume and growth in number of destinations (light shades mean no
significant differences in Chart 1 below). Estimates suggest that participation in EMAF II is associated
with an increased growth in firms’ total exports. The annual export growth is 38.9 % higher for EMAF II
assisted firms compared to controls firm with similar propensity scores in 2004-2008. Similarly, annual
growth in destination markets reached is 4 % higher for firms assisted by EMAF II. Finally, the impact of
EMAF II is positive but not significant on another output that captures the extensive margins in exports:
the number of products.

The same dataset was also used assess the employment impact of EMAF II. Although not a stated
objective of the EMAF II matching grant program, the employment impact is important given Tunisia’s
persistent unemployment and ongoing economic and social uncertainty due to the 2010 revolution.
Employment in EMAF II firms grew annually by 5.5 % in 2004-2008 and by 4.6 % for firms in the

for EMAF II firms against 5.1 % for the control group. This suggests EMAF II had a positive impact on

specification used and not always statistically significant.

Customs Data:

In addition to firm-level data, another ex-post impact evaluation exercise was completed based on a larger
sample of customs data. Transaction-level export data with exporter ID, transaction value, country of
destination, and produce code were obtained from Tunisian Customs for 2000-2008 for 3000 firms,
including 400 EMAF II firms. The sample represents approximately 55% of export of goods (excluding
oil) in Tunisia.

Using PSM on this customs data, the authors found that EMAF II support had increased the difference in
growth rate in the two years of treatment for export outcomes, ie volume, number of destinations and
number of products. Increase in growth is slightly higher than with the firm level survey data. The impact
is for two years instead of the four years and the impact on extensive margins is higher.

The limitation with customs data used is that firms in services, which represent approximately 30% of
EMAF II firms, are not taken into account as they are not reported in custom’s data. This, however,
allows for i) a more robust matching and disaggregation of results by types of treated firms and ii) to test
for the duration of impact of EMAF II. The authors consider here that the impact of EMAF II for a firm
receiving support in 2005 should be measurable on export transactions in 2005 and 2006.

Over the long-term, outcomes do not differ much from random non-EMAF II firms (see chart 2). The
authors suggest that perhaps the duration of support by EMAF II was not sufficient to allow managers to
be on their own in export markets. Similarly, the results suggest that limits to production expansion may
have been reached after a first large increase.

Conclusion: Although the short duration of the impact and limited additionally for a specific class of
manufacturing firms joins earlier criticisms of matching grants, overall results from the PSM based on
two different data sources suggest the EMAF II was successful. It had a statistically significant, positive
impact on firm performance along targeted dimensions of total exports, number of export product and
export destinations and is likely to have a positive impact on employment.


Summary of: Cadot, Olivier, Ana M. Fernandes, Julien Gourdon, and Aaditya Mattoo. Are the Benefits
of Export Support Durable? Evidence from Tunisia. Report. Policy Research Working Paper.
Washington: World Bank, 2012


This paper evaluates the effects of the FAMEX export promotion program in Tunisia on the performance
of beneficiary firms. While much of the literature assesses only the short term impact of such programs,
the paper also considers longer term impact. using a menu of estimation methods, including difference-in-
differences combined with propensity-score matching (PSM-DID) and difference-in-differences weighted
by propensity scores, designated henceforth as weighted least squares regressions (WLS).

The author’s find that, compared to a control group, FAMEX beneficiaries successfully diversify in terms
of export destination markets and products, and durably so. However, the beneficiary firms‘ total exports
diverges only temporarily from the control group‘s total exports. See Chart 1 for graphical representation.
One year after treatment, the differential in growth rates of total exports is not significant anymore. Three
years after treatment, even export levels are no longer significantly different. Even though export
destination and product counts remain significantly different throughout the sample period, the treatment
group‘s diversification does not seem to translate into reduced export volatility. These results suggest that
FAMEX has a stronger and more durable effect on firms’ exports at the extensive margin (destination and
product growth) than at the intensive margin (total export growth).



                                                                                                          60
The authors also examine the existence of program spillovers by estimating FAMEX‘s indirect impact on
the performance of control firms. This is an important—although typically underexplored—part of
program impact evaluation, because in the presence of spillovers, the absence of a positive measured
treatment effect could reflect a positive true treatment effect transmitted to the control group through
positive externalities, which is precisely the combination that would justify Government intervention.

In the case of FAMEX, the central result- the lack of persistence of treatment effects on export values –
might reflect catching up by control firms rather than vanishing benefits for treated firms, although
catching up through imitation should apply equally – perhaps even more – to the extensive margin for
which there is observable permanent divergence. For instance, FAMEX beneficiaries’ actions, such as
participating in trade fairs or hiring export-marketing consultants, could have been visible to and easily
imitable by other firms in their sector or location. Regressing firm outcomes on exposure to FAMEX
beneficiaries, the results fail to suggest any positive externalities. The only instance of significant
coefficients for total exports and for the number of products is negative, which would certainly not
suggest spillover benefits occurred.

Finally, the authors study heterogeneity in treatment effects as a function of the beneficiaries‘ objectives
and use of assistance. When applying to FAMEX firms had to state an objective, whether they wanted to:
(i) become a significant exporter, (ii) export to a new destination markets, or (iii) export a new product.
Given the way FAMEX application packages were structures, firms could state only one of these three
objectives.

The authors re-estimate cumulative treatment effects of FAMEX allowing for these effects to differ across
objectives. Firms seeking to expand into new markets or to develop new export products benefit more
than firms seeking to become more substantive exporters. Also, market prospection and promotion
activities correlate more significantly with export outcomes than other components of FAMEX, like firm
or product development, suggesting that informational barriers are the most amenable to effective
government assistance. These findings support the broad view that firms seeking and using assistance to
expand along the extensive margin are less likely to be disappointed with the longer-term outcome than

                                                                                                         61
those seeking and using assistance to expand along the intensive margin. Together, these results suggest
that export promotion is most effective in helping firms break into new markets and new products.

Concluding Remarks:

The authors conclude that their research adds to the small existing literature by taking a longer view of
impact of interventions. They find FAMEX had a durable impact along the extensive margin in terms of
export destinations and products but provided along a temporary boost to exports along the intensive
margin. The results are robust.

The authors suggest that the results must also be understood in the context of the global economic
recession. Similarly, there may be a bias in that firms participating in FAMEX may have ventured into
riskier markets. Their evidence demonstrates that the increased diversification of beneficiary firms did not
result in reduced volatility of exports. Given that exports were not sustained and that effects did not
spillover to non-treated firms, the authors suggest that matching grants programs alone may not be the
best use of public funds for long-term sustained export development.
