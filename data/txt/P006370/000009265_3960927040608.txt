MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE JAIBA IRMIGATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
irrigation loan for US$71.0 million equivalent to Brazil is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, and'would help finance an irrigation project.
2.       Background.  In the 1970s, agricultural growth in Brazil averaged
6Z per annum, based largely on the expansion of export crops (soybeans,
citrus, tobacco, coffee and cocoa) and sugar cane for the alcohol program.
In the early 1980s, the sector entered a period of relative stagnation,
caused in part by overall macroeconomic difficulties, limitations in the
availability of rural credit, consumer price controls and falling world
commodity prices. Agricultural exports have leveled off at around US$8
billion, per capita food production has declined and food imports have
increased (from around US$1 billion in 1981 and 1982 to US$2 billion in
1986).  As a consequence, and faced with falling commodity prices, the
Government J1 promoting c'ost-effective investments to increase
produs--ivirty, and hence returns to farmers, and shift production towards
dortstic consumption needs.  One of the principal elements of this strategy
'.rt the promotion of accelerated investment by farmers and the Government in
irrigation.
3.       Presently, there are an estimated 360,000 hectares of irrigated
farm land in the Northeast of Brazil. About 70,000 hectares have been
developed under public irrigation schemes managed by the two Federal
agencies responsible for Northeast irrigation development, the National
Department of Drought Works (DNOCS) and the Sfto Francisco River Valley
Development Company (CODEVASF). Past public irrigation development has
been slow, although some projects have been successful. A major difficulty
has been excessive involvement of the Government, leading to insufficient
participation of water users and delays in setting up appropriate
organizations. The Government's strategy has now been reoriented toward
increased participation of the private sector, including the beneficiaries
themselves, in public irrigation operations. The success of future
irrigation expansion will depend on improved irrigation planning,
appropriate water management practices and irrigated crop technologies, and
sustainable institutional arrangements for the management, operation and
maintenance of medium and large-scale projects.
4.       Major infrastructure works for the Jaiba project, located in the
Northeastern region of the State of Minas Gerais, were built in the 1970s
for a command area of about 100,000 ha. Further development was stopped
because of financial difficulties, and no settlement of the area took
place. In the early 1980s, FAO identified a proposed first phase of 23,6b0
ha as a priority, and today, both the Federal Government and the State of
Minas Gerais consider the proposed project to be of high priority.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Brazil is
to support macroeconomic adjustment and economic growth, while' helping to



-2-
increase the efficiency of invest.ments and services for the poor.
Irrigation development, because of its ability to intensify use of
agricultural lands and to increase production end productivity, is
potentially one of the most cost-effective (.trategies for achieving sector
efficiency and growth. In the Northeast, however, technical and
institutional constraints are more severe than In other parts of the
country. The Bank, through its support for a ftnw selective interventions
designed to remove these constraints and to demonstrate irrigation's
potential, is contributing towards more efficient and rapid subsector
development.  The proposed project incorporates the experiences from the
Northeast Technical Assistance and Engineering Project (Loan 2680-BR) and
the Upper and Middle Sao Francisco Irrigation Project (Loan 2719-BR), as
well as two earlier efforts in the Sao Francisco Valley, particularly with
regard to the need for the increased participation of the private sector in
project service delivery and management.
6.       ProJect Objectives.  The proposed project has the objectives of
increasing agricultural production, improving small- and medium-size
farmers' incomes, and creating employment opportunities in the Northeastern
portion of the State of Minas Gerais. In addition, a fundamental objective
is to further irrigation institutional development: improved project
management and operation and maintenance arrangements would be tested
through the creation of a private irrigation district, the first of its
kind in Brazil.
7.       Project Description.  The project would develop irrigated
agriculture on some 23,600 hectares and would benefit some 2,000 small
farmers (5 ha farms), 350 medium-size farmers (twenty to fifty ha farms),
and two large farms already operating in the area. An environmental impact
study has been prepared and is satisfactory. The project would support:
(a) construction of the Jaiba sprinkler irrigation scheme, using existing
main infrastructure works to be complemented by irrigation and electrical
works, a road network, and administration and social services facilities;
small farmers would receive 6 lot ready for irrigation operation whereas
medium-size farmers wouid have to construct their on-farm irrigation works
(572 of project coets); (b) initial operation of the Jaiba Irrigation
District (JID) over the implementation period of the project, which would
involve: (i) the settlement of farmers who would he selected according to
criteria which are satisfactory to the Bank (experience in irrigation,
permanent residence in the region, availability of family labor);
(ii) provision of support services to project beneficiaries (extension,
training, market information and orientation, and social services); and
(iii) operation and maintenance of project works (322); (c) applied                     4
research, to provide concrete recommendations for water management and
irrigated agricultural practices (32); and (d) technical assistance,
training and studies to assist project execution, monitor effects of the
project on the environment, and prepare a second phase project (82).
CODEVASF, in close cooperation with the State of Minas Gerais, through the
Foundation for Settlement and Rural Development of Minas Gerais
(RURALMINAS), would have overall responsibility for project implementation.
CODEVASF, which has considerable experience in this type of project, would
be directly responsible for supervision of the construction of irrigation
works, but would delegate to JID operation and maintenance, as well as
agricultural production and support services for project beneficiaries.
JID would contract these activities to private firms. CODEVASF would
closely monitor the activities of JID in its early years. JID, which has



-3-
already been established, would be financially self-sustaining by the end
of the project period. Federal and State agencies would participate in the
settlement process, supervise the construction of and operate and maintain
electrical works, carry out applied agricultural research, undertake a
program to control water-borne diseases, and monitor the effects of the
project on the environment.
8.       The project, to be carried out over eight years, provides funds
for the construction of the irrigation and electrical works, roads, and
buillings for administration of JID and for social services. These works
wouli be completed by the end of 1993.  From 1993 to the end of the project
period, the project would provide funds on a declining basis for operation
of JID, agricultural and social support services, technical assistance, and
training to small farmers, and applied agricultural research. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$158.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$19.6 million (1ZZ). Funds would be made
available to CODEVASF and other involved federal and state agencies on a
grant basis. Funds made available to the state power compa8y would be
accounted for as an equity contribution in the name of CODEVASF. Operation
and maintenance costs and investment costs for irrigation infrastructure
would be charged to beneficiaries through water and power tariffs. Farmers
would pay for the land they received in accordance with the terms
established in the ftleral irrigation law (currently 25-year repayment
period, 5-year grace period, and 3S real interest rate). In order to
expedite preparation of construction plans, to provide tecknical assistance
in organization and to initiate building construction and urgent
rehabilitation and completion works, retroactive financing of US$3.0
million would be provided for expenditures made after February 1, 1988, but
prior to loan signing. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedulc are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached, and the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7371-BR dated September 27, 1988 is being circulated
separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The conditions of loan effectiveness would be:
(i) Bank receipt of a satisfactory, signed subsidiary agreemelt between the
Federative Republic of Brazil and CODEVASF; (ii) contracting by JID of a
private specialized firm to provide support services to farmers (extensiGn,
training, social services); and (iii) receipt of evidence, satisfactory to
the Bank, that the Federative Republic of Brazil has made available to
CODEVASF in 1988 the equivalent of US$3.0 million for project expenditures
in 1988. A condition of disbursement for expenditures incurred by each
project executing entity would be receipt by the Bank of a satisfactory
coordinating agreement between that entity and CODEVASF. The Federative
Republic of Brazil provided assurances that water charges would be applied
to recover full operation, maintenance, and investment costs of irrigation
works, and would be adjusted at least on an annual basis and in accordance
with a methodology satisfactory to the Bank. CODEVASF provided assurances
that: (i) JID would be maintained throughout the project implementation
period with organization, structure and functions, including competent
staff in adequate numbers, all acceptable to the Bank; (ii) agreed
settlement procedures, including land repayment conditions, would be
followed; (iii) JID would contract marketing activities and operation and
maintenance to specialized firms by December 31, 1990; and (iv) it would



-4-
maintain a Project Coordinating Unit, with organization, structure, and
functions, including a project manager assisted by competent staff in
adequatp numbers, all acceptable to the Bank.
10.      Benefits.  The economic rate of return of the project would be
142, utilizing conservative assumptions concerning crops to be grown and
yields to be achieved. Main benefits of the project would include: (i)
incremental agricultural production valued at some US$36.0 million annually
at full development, and including annual exports of about US$4.0 million;
(ii) a significant increase of income for about 2,000 small farmers from an
average of about US$200 per capita to about US$800 per capita; and (iii)
the creation of about 15,000 permanent or temporary jobs, the majority on
medium-sized farms. Estimated financial rates of return for farm models
would range from 162 to 36X. An unquantifiable benefit would stem from the
operation of JID, which would provide a model and concrete experience for
the future development of viable institutional arrangements for the
operation of irrigation projects.
11.      Risks.  There are three principal risks associated with the
project. The first risk is related to the fact that small farmer
beneficiaries would have had little, if any, previous experience in
sprinkler irrigation. The use of this technique would present some
difficulty due to the high permeability of the soils. It would mean
constant monitoring of water management and frequent moves of sprinkler
equipment. This risk would be mitigated by the provision of strong
extension and training services by qualified private sector firms and by
the demonstrative effect of medium-size farms using similar technologies.
The second risk is associated with the establishment of JID. The district
would be the first of its kind in Brazil and could confront organizational
and managerial difficulties, particularly in the initial stages. Close
supervision by CODEVASF, the sub-contracting of its main activities to
competent private consulting firms, and the April 1988 appointment of a
satisfactory manager should considerably lessen the associated risks.
Finally, the uncertain economic climate in ?razil could result in
difficulties in both the supply and demand ik.r agricultural credit for
complementary productive investments. The recently approved Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 2960-BR) and the-Government's ongoing macroeconomic
stabilization plan should help mitigate these difficulties.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
