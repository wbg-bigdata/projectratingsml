1. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER CONSTRAINTS
Overview
1.01      The economy of Malaysia has maintained a rapid rate of growth over
the last decade, with an annual increase in GDP and employment averaging
nearly 8% and 4%, respectively, between 197L and 1980. The secondary
sector /1 grew even faster during this period, at about 12% p.a. for GDP and
7% p.a. for employment. As a result, the secondary sector accounted for 35%
of GDP and 26% of employment in 1980, as comipared to 26% and 20% respectively
in 1971. However, the supply of skilled industrial manpower has not kept
pace with this growth of the economy, posing a constraint to Malaysia's
development programs.
1.02      Although no reliable data are ava:ilable on the magnitude of
the existing shortage of skilled industrial manpower in Malaysia, market
conditions reflect a severe shortfall. In 980, the Public Service
Department was able to fill only 10% of 2,500 reported vacancies for
skilled workers and 40% of 970 vacancies for technicians. The State
Economic Development Corporations cite the scarcity of such manpower as an
important cause of delays and failures in iriplementation of development
projects. The shortage of technicians, in particular, is an even
greater problem for private industry since about 70% of graduates have
received government scholarships and are, therefore, bonded to the public
sector for three to five years after their 1:raining. Competition in industry
is keen for the remaining uncommitted graduates. The highly skilled occupa-
tions carry scales of pay which are ten times higher than rates of pay for
laborers, compared to a ratio of less than 'i to 1 in advanced countries.
Malaysia needs to relieve this manpower constraint by expanding industrial
skill training programs.
New Economic Policy and Industrial Development
1.03      In 1981, the country stood at the half-way point of the outline
Perspective Plan period (1971-90), within wILich the goals of the New Economic
Policy are to be realized. Under this policy, Malaysia is committed to two
objectives: (a) the reduction of absolute poverty;/2 and (b) the achievement
of a more representative racial balance at different levels of the
occupational structure./3
/1 Includes manufacturing, construction, utilities, transport, storage and
communications.
/2 Malaysia has a high degree of income ine!quality and, relative to its
resources, a high incidence of poverty. The Government estimates that
about 29% of households in 1980 were abEolutely poor.
/3  The poverty is largely concentrated among farmers, the majority of whom
are Malays.



1.04      The principal Government strategy for attaining these objectives
is to transfer more people from low productivity rural occupations to higher
income opportunities in the modern sector /1 through rapid industrialization.
Reflecting this strategy, over the next ten years industrial output and
employment are estimated to grow at average annual rates of about 10% and
5%, respectively, while the economy's output and employment are estimated to
rise at about 8% p.a. and 3% p.a., respectively.
1.05      The Government plans to attain rapid industrial growth through
various incentives and policies. Since the late 1960s, investment
incentives, import tariffs, quota restrictions, pioneer status and export
incentives have contributed to significant import substitution (in resource
and agro-based industries) and export growth (e.g., electronics, clothing,
textiles). Attainment of continued rapid industrial growth to help achieve
the goals of the National Economic Policy, however, calls for adjustments in
incentives and changes in policies to improve the regional dispersion of
industry and increase the supply of skilled workers./2
1.06      Higher income opportunities are heavily concentrated in a few
states in the country. For example, manufacturing employment is highly
concentrated in Selangor (38%), Penang (22%), Johore (15%), Perak (12%), and
Malacca (5%). These five states have only about 50% of the total population,
but have over 90% of manufacturing employment, resulting in per capita income
above the national average. In response to this geographical imbalance in
development, the Government is redirecting its incentive measures towards
industrial dispersion through financial incentives and the provision of
infrastructure. These measures are expected to lead to regionally
differentiated rates of growth in manufacturing output over the next decade.
The northeast and northwest regions of Penninsular Malaysia, where the
country's poorest states are located, are expected to show respectively 19%
and 14% annual growth rates in manufacturing output. The location of future
training facilities and training programs will need to reflect the regional
spread and characteristics of industry (Annex 2).
Need for Skilled Industrial Manpower
1.07      Malaysia is one of the medium-sized countries in terms of its
population estimated around 14 million in 1980. About 85% of this
population is in Peninsular Malaysia (Sabah 6% and Sarawak 9%) and 54% are
Malays, 35% Chinese, 10% Indians and 1% others. Between 1981 and 1990, the
population of Malaysia is expected to grow at 2.4% p.a., from 14.3 to 18.1
million. Over the same period, participation in the labor force is
/1 The 1975 mean monthly income per worker in the secondary sector was M$165
cLs compared to M$95 in the primary sector.

expected to increase from 38% to 40%, and the labor force is expected to
grow at 3.0% p.a., from 5.4 to 7.2 million. Employment over the period is
projected to increase at 3.2% p.a. as shown in Table 1.1:

1.08      Cross-country comparisons of sectoral labor productivity and skill
levels of employment suggest that Malaysia's occupation structure in 1990
would include the following coefficients of technicians and skilled workers:

1.09      The annual additional needs for skilled industrial manpower for the
1981-90 period may be calculated by applying the above coefficients to the
sectoral employment figures (Table 1.1).  Assuming an annual average rate of
attrition of 2%, the broad magnitude of future needs for technicians and
skilled workers is calculated as follows (Table 1.3):

Malaysia would require an annual average increment of about 6,000 technicians
and 35,000 skilled workers during the next decade. The requirements signifi-
cantly exceed the present annual output of 1,700 technicians and 10,000
skilled workers, pointing out the need for rapid expansion of industrial
skill training programs. This need is supported by the expansion signal
given by the rate of return analysis presented later in this report.
2. INDUSTRIAL SKILL TRAINING /1
Overview
2.01      The sources of industrial skill training in Malaysia are:
(a) polytechnics, which provide technician training; (b) industrial training
institutes, and skill training institutes and centers, which prepare school
leavers for industrial employment and upgrade skills of the employed;
(c) vocat4ional secondary schools, which supply semi-skilled workers; and
(d) industry, which provides on-the-job training for its workers. The
educational institutions suffer from both external inefficiencies (low
output and poor quality of graduates) and internal inefficiencies (poor
resource allocation and utilization), compounded by deficiencies in manage-
ment. At the same time, industry has been slow to participate in training
and accounted for only an estimated one tenth of industrial skill training
output between 1976 and 1980. As a result, existing skill training programs
can meet merely about one fourth of the annual average requirement for
technicians and one third of the requirement for skilled workers that will
arise over the next decade (para. 1.09).

Basic Features of Industrial Skill Training
2.02      Technician Training.  At present, a total of about 1,700 tech-
nicians are produced each year. About 40% of the output comes from two
polytechnics run by the Technical and Vocat:onal Education Division of the
Ministry of Education (MOE) and 13% comes from the semi-private Tunku Abdul
Rahman College. A large number of smaller private institutions account for
the balance of graduates.
2.03      One of the polytechnics, Ungku Omar Polytechnic, was established
at Ipoh in 1969 and had an enrollment of 1,560 and an output of 530 in 1980.
Kuantan Polytechnic was established in 1977., but is still under construction,
with completion expected in 1983. It currently enrolls 450 in temporary
accommodations and will eventually enroll 1,200. It produced 130 graduates
in 1980. The course of study given by the polytechnics is of 2-1/4 years
duration and, with a few exceptions, is based on a sandwich structure of one
year of study, five months of industrial placement and a final nine months
of study.  Existing courses include special:zations within mechanical,
electrical, and civil engineering, and commerce./l To qualify for admission,
entrants must have 11 years of prior school-ng and a pass in the secondary
school leaving examinations (Chart 2). There were approximately 9,000
qualified applicants in 1980 for the total of 1,200 available places. The
polytechnics have a total of 200 teaching staff and a teacher to student
ratio of 1:11.
2.04      Skilled Worker Training.  The annual output of skilled workers from
various training programs is estimated at approximately 10,000 (including
semi-skilled from vocational secondary schools), about 6,500 of which are
produced by the Government training institu:ions as shown in Table 2.1.

accountancy and 25 are enrolled in a 5 year diploma course in marine
engineering.

The two Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) are administered by the Training
Service Division of the MOLM-s Manpower Department, and are located at Kuala
Lumpur and Prai (in the State of Pulau Pinang). The ITIs offer five types of
courses. The apprenticeship training under the National Apprenticeship Scheme
includes 55 weeks of institutional training at an ITI over a 4-year period.
This consists of 22 weeks in the first year and 11 weeks in each of the
subsequent 3 years. The remainder of the four years is spent in industry.
In 1980 there were 790 apprentices registered with the MOLM and 130 who
completed the program. The preparatory trade courses (PTCs) are for
unemployed school leavers who spend six months at an ITI, followed by a
six-month industrial placement. The output of the PTCs in 1980 was 500. A
third course offered at the ITIs is part-time skill upgrading for workers
givesn on request from employers. In 1980, 320 workers received such
insitruction. A fourth type of training offered is a 90 hour course in
instructional techniques given on a part-time basis in the evenings for
trainers within industry.  About 100 received this training in 1980.  The
fifth type of ITI course is a two-year instructor training program (18
moniths of skill training and 6 months of instructional techniques), designed
to meet the staffing needs of the ITIs. To date, 71 instructors have
completed the program and 84 are presently in training.



- 7 -
2.05       The eight skill training institutes operated by MARA are exclu-
sively for Bumiputras./1 Most of the courses offered are of two years'
duration, of which six months are spent in industry.  The Youth Division of
the Ministry of Youth, Culture and Sports (MYCS) gives industrial skill
training, at one of its three centers, to out*-of-school youths. In addi-
tion, the MOE operates 30 vocational secondary schools leading to the
Malaysian Certificate of Vocational Education (Chart 2).
2.06       Overall coordination of skilled worker training is primarily
vested in the National Industrial Training and Trade Certification Board
(NITTCB) under the Minister of Labor and Manpower. The Board was estab-
lished in December 1971 specifically to develop skilled industrial manpower
to carry out the National Economic Policy objectives (para. 1.03). It is
chaired by a secretary general of the Ministry of Labor and Manpower. Its
20 members represent a variety of government agencies/ministries, and organ-
izations of employers and employees (Chart 1). Through its technical
committee /2 the Board assesses the needs for skilled industrial manpower,
recommends the establishment of new training programs, reviews and
recommends modifications to training programs, developes national trade
standards,/3 implements a national program of trade skill testing, and
awards certification to those who pass the tests.
2.07       Expenditures.  Total public expenditure on education and training
in Malaysia increased at 14% p.a. between 1975 and 1980, and allocations to
the sector as a percentage of public expenditures rose in that period from
19% to 22%. However, as a proportion of GNP, it declined from 6.2% to 5.2%.
Nonetheless, public expenditures for education in Malaysia as a percentage
of GNP remain substantially higher than the average for 98 developing
countries (4%). Funds allocated by the Ministry of Education to technical
and vocational education grew from M$11.6 million to M$26.8 million between
1975 and 1979 (33% p.a. on average), while in the same period, the total
education and training budget grew from M$1,340 million to M$2,393 million
(20% p.a. on average). Despite this relative increase to technical and
vocational education under the MOE, the percentage allocation of the
Government's education budget to the subsector remains low at 1.1% (up from
/1  Indigenous Malaysian peoples (e.g., Malays, Ibans, Dayaks, Bajaus).
/2  It is chaired by a Board member and consists of eight Board-appointed
members representing the Ministries of Education (MOE), Labor and
Manpower (MOLM), Youth, Culture and Sports (MYCS), and Majlis Amanah
Rakayat (MARA), and employers' and employees' organizations.
/3  The Board has established 28 trade standards, to date, at three levels
(basic, intermediate and advanced grades) covering automotive,
mechanical, electrical, electronics, building, woodworking, printing and
clothing trades.



-8-
0.9% in 1975). Even with the inclusion of relevant expenditures by the
MOLM, MARA and MYCS, the 2% allocation of the total education and training
budget to technical and vocational education is much lower than other
countries in the region (Table 2.2).

2.08      Return on Investments to Polytechnics and ITIs.  The economic rate
of return/I to the existing polytechnics is calculated to be at 16% (Annex
3), and the private rate of return is calculated to be about 60%. The large
gap between the economic and private rates of return /2 is mainly due to the
Government's policy of free tuition and boarding for the majority of poly-
technic students. The economic rate of return to present apprenticeship
training at the ITIs is estimated at 12%./3 These rates of return are
similar to the average 14% return to secondary education in other countries
at Malaysia's stage of development (Table 2.3 - Malaysia is assumed to
belong to the intermediate country group, and polytechnics and ITIs to the
secondary education level). The 16% and 12% rates of return confirm the
shortage of qualified manpower supply in the country (para. 1.09). How-
ever, the rates can be expected to decline as the supply of technicians and
skilled workers is increased, unless measures to reduce costs are introduced
(e.g., increase utilization of teachers and facilities).
/1 These rates of return are referred to as the social rates of return
in the literature of education economics.
/2  Evidence from other countries shows that difference between private and
social rates of return to secondary and higher education is in the range
of 4 to 5 percentage points.
/3 A private rate of return is estimated between 40% to 210% depending on
the assumption of net foregone earnings, ranging from M$500-2,500 p.a.

Issues in Industrial Skill Training
2.09      The major issues in industrial skill training are: (a) the
inability to produce the numbers of technicians and skilled workers needed
by the economy; (b) the failure of the polytechnics and ITIs to supply the
type and quality of graduates required by irdustries; (c) inefficient
utilization of physical and human resources at the polytechnics and ITIs;
and (d) weaknesses in management.
Technician Training
2.10      Level of Output.  The present output ot technician training,
1,/00, is well below the estimated average requirement of about 6,000 tech-
nicians per year over the next decade (para. 1.09). Even with optimum use
of specialist facilities (para. 2.12), therE would still be a shortage of
about two-thirds in training capacity. This clearly points out the need for
a significant increase in output, entailing expansion of technician training
tacilities and more efficient use of facilities. The large number of appli-
cants for available places at the polytechnics (para. 2.04) indicates that
there would be no shortage of qualified entrants for expanded technician
training.
2.11     Range of Courses.  The shortage of output is compounded by
the narrow range ot specializations in existing courses. The courses and
specializations offered at the two existing polytechnics are listed in Table
2.4. Notably missing are the specializations required for rapid growth
industries, particularly textiles, computer and plant technology, commercial
support services (marketing, data processing), and primary processing of
natural resources. As more polytechnics are opened, the emphasis of each
institution should become increasingly regional, and their curricula
specially designed (para. 1.06). In order t:o prepare specially designed



- 10 -
curricula, the capacity of the MOE's Technical and Vocational Education
Division (TAVED) for curriculum development will need to be expanded and it
will need to improve communications with industry.

2.12      Use of Facilities.  The capital cost of the polytechnics at Ipoh
and Kuantan of about US$13,000 per student place (in 1981 prices), is about
50% higher than the median cost for non-university, technical institutions
assisted by the World Bank between FY78 and FY80./l This high cost is
largely due to the inefficient use of physical resources. Laboratories and
workshops at Ipoh and Kuantan have been designed to give a utilization rate
of only 45%, although a desired rate is 60 to 70%.  This low rate is the
combined result of (a) duplicating specialized courses with small intakes at
both polytechnics; and (b) providing a series of separate small workshops
for each aspect of a specialization, rather than multipurpose spaces
equipp,ed for a range of related practical activities (e.g., separate
workshops for benchfitting, machining and welding are provided rather than
one large metal processes workshop). Actual utilization of the specialized
facilities is even lower, at 35%, due to single stream enrollments in some
courses where double streaming would be possible. The capital cost per
student of future polytechnics should be reduced by more efficient design
and scheduling of facilities and, where possible, eliminating the
duplication of specialization with small enrollments among polytechnics.

2.13      Management.  Since there are only two polytechnics at present,
there has been no need for elaborate formal arrangements between the
institutions and the Ministry of Education (MOE) to coordinate such
functions as student admission, course development, academic standards,
staff development and use of resources. Responsibilities for these
functions are left to individual institutions and often to their departments
and staff. As more polytechnics are built, the MOE's Technical and
Vocational Education Division (TAVED) will need to develop an organizational
structure for management ot the polytechnics as a system to ensure academic
standards and efficiency. This will require an improvement in polytechnics
management, including the establishment of polytechnic inspectors in the
technical inspectorate in the MOE, apportioning of responsibilities between
TAVED and the polytechnics, and staff training.
Skilled Worker Training
2.14      Level ot Output.  The present annual output of 10,000 skilled
workers (6,500 from the public and 3,500 from the private sector, para.
2.05) falls significantly below the projected average annual requirement of
35,000 (para. 1.09). Even with optimum use of specialist accommodations
(para. 2.16) the shortage would be greater than 50%. While it is clear
that public sector training capacity should be increased, it is also vital
that industry be encouraged to assume a more active role in training.
Reasons for the minimal involvement of industry in skill training include
the absence of appropriate financial incentives for employers to upgrade
their work force, and a lack of suitable training programs and staff. The
Government recently introduced an incentive scheme to encourage on-the-job
training in the construction industry, which includes the use of government
syllabi by industry trainers, and offers employers a double deduction from
taxable income of all wages paid to trainers for three months, plus M$23 per
day for the trainer. The scheme has been slow to be implemented, however,
due in part to the casual nature of employment in the construction industry
and its limited application to operatives. The strategy to increase the
output of skilled workers should therefore have a dual thrust. First, it
should expand public training facilities. Second, it should stimulate
training in industry, which necessitates both providing a training advisory
service to help industry develop its training capacity, and devising an
ettective tinancial incentive scheme.
2.15      Quality of Output.  In 1980, only E2% ot ITI students passed the
NITTCB tests in basic and intermediate level skills (para. 2.02). This low
achievement stems largely from inadequacies in both course design and
instruction. The 50:50 mix of theory and practice in ITI courses does



- 12 -
not give the students sufficient practical expertise. At the same time, the
courses place too much emphasis on outmoded subjects (e.g., maintenance of
valve radios, hand type-compositing) and do not allow students time to
adequately develop relevant skills (e.g., heavy equipment maintenance). The
quality of instruction suffers because teachers often have had little
experience in industry or refresher training in teaching methods. Tools and
teaching aids are also inadequate. There is, therefore, a need for improve-
ment in ITI teaching programs, staff quality and teaching support services.
2.16      Internal Efficiency.  The erratic demands made on the institu-
tions by variable enrollments at different times of the year has resulted in
ettective teaching statf to student ratios of only 1:4 in Kuala Lumpur /1
and 1:3 in Prai. Utilization of specialized accommodations runs as low as
20%. The present nature of the apprenticeship training (para. 2.05) is
largely attributed to this low utilization rate, since the apprentices spend
only 11 weeks each at the ITIs in their second, third, and fourth years,
leaving the tacilities unused for considerable periods. The utilization of
existing facilities could be improved through better class scheduling and
redesigning the apprenticeship training to condense the period over which
institutional training is received. At present, employers find the four
years to be too long to wait for an apprentice to achieve intermediate
skills. Even then, only about 60% of the students under the National
Apprenticeship Scheme pass the NITTCB intermediate trade tests (para. 2.15).
Consequently, support for the apprenticeship program is declining, with the
number of registered apprentices decreasing from 920 in 1975 to 790 in 1980.
Experience from the MARA skill training institutes has shown that a 65% pass
rate in the intermediate tests can be achieved in a shorter time (after 2
to 3 years).
2.17      Management.  The external and internal inefficiencies ot the
ITIs are related to weaknesses in management. The MOLM has difficulty
recruiting and retaining suitably qualified ITI principals and deputy
principals, due to competition from industry for persons with management and
industrial experience who would make good principals. Consequently, ITI
senior staff usually have a background only as instructors and lack
background in management and industry. Action should be taken to ensure
that ITI senior staff receive management training and the exposure to
industry necessary to improve their insight into its needs and practices.
/1 At Kuala Lumpur, 990 people received trade training in 1980; with 9/
instructors, this gives a nominal staff:student ratio of 1:10. However,
none of the 990 studied tor the full year at the ITI, and the total
institutional component of programs given in the Kuala Lumpur ITI
amounted to a full-time equivalent enrollment of 400; this gives an
effective staff:student ratio of 1:4.



- 13 -
2.18      The Training Service Division (TSD)) of the MOLM's Manpower
Department also lacks adequate organizational structure and staff to
effectively operate the expanding ITI systeri. The TSD's Technical Support
Unit /1 has basically two groups of functions of (a) developing courses of
study, institutional materials and audio-visual aids; and (b) managing ITIs
through the establishment of procedures and systems for staff development,
facility utilization, trainee selection, equipment standards and
maintenance, and material procurement. There are only four technical staff
to implement these tasks. The Technical Support Unit is recommended to be
reorganized into two with an increased number of staff to carry out the two
sets of functions. The capacity of TSD's Industrial Training Development
Unit also needs to be improved to more effectively: (a) promote in-plant
training by industry through identification and designing of training
programs, and training of industry's own instructors; (b) supervise on-the-job
training for ITI students; and (c) compile data and records. At present,
the Unit's 14 training officers are ex-instructors from the ITIs with little
experience in industry. These staff require more specialized training to
carry out their functions and to increase their credibility within industry
as experts on industrial manpower training. Also, the number of training
officers should be increased considerably ir. order to help industry take
greater responsibility for manpower training and to keep pace with the
growth expected in the ITI system.
Government Subsector Objectives, Strategy ard Programs
2.19      Objectives.  The Government aims to increase the supply of skilled
industrial manpower, which it judges critical to the country's economic
growth process. To achieve this, the Goverrment plans to (a) expand indus-
trial skill training, and (b) improve the quality and relevance of such
training. In accordance with the strategy of regional dispersion of
industrial activities (para. 1.06), the Government will establish training
institutions in the less developed states where large industrial investments
are planned or have already been made, as well as in the states where
industry is already active.
2.20      Strategy.  The Government's strategy for increasing skilled
industrial manpower during the Fourth Plan period (1981-85) involves
increasing the number of public training institutions. The planned increase
in the number and output of technician and skilled worker training institu-
tions is shown in Table 2.5. Government strategy also calls for stimulating
private industry to participate more in training. Industry's own training
efforts will be encouraged by devising apprcpriate financial incentive
schemes for different economic sectors (pare.. 1.05).
/1  There are four units under the TSD, TecInical Support Unit, Industrial
Training Development Unit, Instructor Training Unit, and General
Administration Unit

2.21       Improvement of the quality and relevance of industrial training
programs received major emphasis in the recommendations of the 1979 Report
of the Cabinet Committee to review the implementation of the Education
Policy, now incorporated into subsector policy in the Fourth Plan.
Technical secondary schools are to be phased out to focus more on training
of skilled manpower and the curriculum of vocational secondary schools will
be resvised so that their graduates can enter the labor market as useful
semi--skilled workers.
2.22      Programs.  The Government's plans for industrial skill development
for the next five years include programs to improve and expand the networks
of polytechnics and Industrial Training Institutes. Under the Fourth
Malaysia Plan the number of polytechnics will be increased from two to seven.
They will be located at Batu Pahat, Gombak, Alor Setar, Kota Bharu and
Kuching. In most cases the polytechnics will open in temporary accommoda-
tion in advance of the completion of the construction of the new buildings.



- 15 -
The output capacity of polytechnics will increase from 650 in 1980 to 4,050
by 1991. The Government has prepared a staff development plan which
provides for local scholarships to train an additional 460 staff by 1990.
The choice of locations for the new polytechnics, three on the west and one
on the east coasts of Peninsular Malaysia, and one in East Malaysia, has
been governed by the policy of spreading training facilities across the
country, locating them in areas where indust:rial growth is rapid or expected
to accelerate (para. 1.06). The polytechnic sites at Alor Setar, Batu
Pahat, Gombak, Kota Bharu and Kuching have all been chosen and are at
various stages of acquisition and preparation, with Batu Pahat and Gombak
the most advanced. All are of approximately 100 acres.
2.23      According to a long-term program 1:o establish at least one ITI in
each of 14 states (including the Federal Territory), the Government plans to
build five more ITIs during the Fourth Plan period. They will be located at
Alor Setar, Ipoh, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, and Mialacca. The output capacity of
the ITIs, including the two existing ITIs and three under construction at
Johor Bharu, Kuala Trengganu and Labuan, wiLl increase from 1,050 in 1980 to
7,200 in 1990. The Government will train about 210 teaching staff required
for the five new ITIs to be built under the Fourth Plan period in the
insttuctor training unit of the existing IT-: at Kuala Lumpur before 1985.
The choice of locations for the five new ITIs has been governed by
considerations similar to the siting of the polytechnics (para. 2.22). The
sites of about 20-30 acres have all been chosen, and are at different stages
of acquisition and readiness, with those at Ipoh, Kuantan and Malacca, the
most advanced.
External Assistance to the Subsector
2.24      Bilateral and Multilateral Assistance.  The first ITI at Kuala
Lumpur was established with ILO assistance :.n 1964 and the second ITI at
Prai was set up with German bilateral assisl:ance in 1973. During the Fourth
Plan period an advanced skill center for training industrial supervisors and
instructors, with a total project cost of $23.0 million, will be set up at
Shah Alam with Japanese bilateral assistance. The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) will assist in a project to establish nine vocational secondary schools,
one of wnich will include an equipment repa:.r center. Total project cost is
estimated at US$80 million.
2.25     World Bank Assistance.  Since 1969 the Bank has extended financing
for five education projects in support of Malaysia's national development.
These projects are helping to improve the quality and opportunities for
basic education, and meet manpower needs for- middle-level technical and
agricultural workers and for public adminislrators. The lending program to
date totals US$116.8 million.
2.26      Assistance to industrial development is included in various
components of education projects. The Firs: Education Project (Ln. 599-MA
of May 1969, US$8.8 million) assisted in increasing output of skilled
middle-level manpower through the construction of six vocational secondary
schools and five technical secondary schools. The Second Education Project
(Ln. 810-MA of April 1972, US$15.5 million) added to technical and



- 16 -
vocational training with seven more vocational and one technical secondary
schools. The Third Education Project (Ln. 9/4-MA of April 1974, US$19.5
million) assists in technical training through the establishment of a
polytechnic at Kuantan. The Fourth Education Project (Ln. 1329-MA of
November 1976, US$35 million) supports industrial skill training through the
addition of three ITIs at Johore Bharu, Kuala Trengganu and Labuan. The
Fifth Education Project (Ln. 1657-MA ot January 1979, US$38 million)
includes assistance to develop long-term strategies tor middle-level
occupational training.
2.27      In light of the government development strategy with a major
emphasis on industry, the Bank has conducted a study on development issues
and policy options in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia (Report No. 3187-
MA, April 9, 1981). Concurrently; the Bank is identifying and preparing the
tirst IDF project in Malaysia to assist in small enterprises through credits
and technical assistance. Also, in response to the important need for
skilled industrial workers, an education memorandum on technical education
and vocational training was drafted in January 1980. It specifies three
priority areas for Bank assistance to the subsector: (a) increasing the
output of trained manpower tor industry by expanding in-plant training and
by constructing additional capacity; (b) developing training programs for
instructors and management staff of public institutions, and in-plant
training techniques and management for industry's training staff; and (c)
strengthening management of industrial training with a focus on the Manpower
Department of the MOLM in its ITI management capacity. Given the above
priorities and the issues identified in the subsector (para. 2.09), the Bank
should support the Government's industrial skill development programs by
expanding training facilities and by designing programs to assist in
increased training within industry and institution building for effective
management of training programs.
2.28      To date, two Bank projects have been completed with industrial
training components and a project performance audit report on the first
project (Report No. 2520, dated May 22, 1979, SecM79-408) has been prepared
and a completion report on the second is being audited. The audit report
states that the project has been successfully implemented overall. However,
it finds that inadequate authority and staffing of the MOE's Development and
Supplies Division charged with implementing the project, together with staft
shortages in the Public Works Department, were mainly responsible for
implementation delays of about 2.5 years. Subsequent to the first project,
an increased number of staff has been assigned to project implementation.
The authority of the MOE's project director has also been increased. To
cope with the limited capacity of the Public Works Department, the
Government has used private consultants in recent education projects. In
respect to operational outcomes, the audit report notes that agricultural
schools are underenrolled due to a lack of government scholarships to sponsor
students; technical secondary schools have a limited practical subject
content; and timely review of the appropriateness of project components and
implementation procedures would have avoided the faults (e.g., workshop
layouts) and delays (e.g., procurement matters). Addressing these problems,
the Government has (a) increased the number of scholarships and agricultural
schools are now satisfactorily utilized; and (b) decided to phase out
technical secondary schools. Further strengthening ot project implementation



- 17 -
staff and use of private consultants for architectural and engineering works
would be included in the proposed project. The proposed phased assistance
to the industrial skill development would allow for developments unforeseen
at appraisal to be taken into account at a later stage. The needs for these
are confirmed in the completion report on the second project.
3. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Scope
3.01      As an integral component of the Gcvernment's industrial development
strategy (paras. 1.04 and 1.05), the proposed project would support the first
phase of a Government investment program to produce required technicians and
skilled workers (para. 1.09). The investmernt program would address the major
issues of industrial skill training (para. 2.09), namely, the program would
aim to increase the supply of technicians ard skilled workers, improve their
quality, raise internal efficiency, and strengthen management of training
programs.
3.02      To help achieve the above objectives, the proposed project would
provide civil works, furniture, equipment and technical assistance to:
Technician Training
(a) establish two polytechnics at Batu Pahat and Gombak;
(b) prepare for future establishment cf three polytechnics at
Alor Setar, Kota Bharu and Kuching;
(c) strengthen curriculum, increase facility utilization, improve
polytechnic management, and train teaching and administrative
staff.
Skilled Worker Training
(a) establish three ITIs at Ipoh, Kuantan and Malacca;
(b) prepare for future establishment cf two ITIs at Alor Setar
and Kota Bharu;
(c) promote training in industry, improve training programs and
materials, increase resource utilization, strengthen ITI
management, and train teaching and management staff.
Monitoring and Review
(a) strengthen monitoring and review activities for the proposed
project.
In addition, the project would support feasibility studies and pilot schemes
for future investments in industrial training.

Technician Training (US$60.5 million equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.03      Establishment of Polytechnics.  To increase the supply of techni-
cians, the project would establish two polytechnics at Batu Pahat and Gombak
through the provision of site development, professional services, academic and
communal buildings, furniture and equipment, and student hostels and staff
housing. The project would also include the preparatory work (e.g., designs
and site works) required to establish three polytechnics at Alor Setar, Kota
Bharu and Kuching (para. 2.22). Each polytechnic would be designed for an
annual intake of 600 students in certificate courses of 2-1/4 years duration,
including six months of related training in industry. The annual intake at
the two polytechnics would grow from 240 in 1983 /1 to reach the total planned
intake of 1,200 by 1987, and the number of graduates would increase from 200
in 1985 to the total planned output of 1,200 by 1989.
3.04      Curriculum and Staff Development.  In order to improve the quality
of polytechnic graduates, the project would assist in developing courses in
new subject areas and specializations in response to national and regional
needs (paras. 1.06 and 2.11). The range of specializations offered within
the polytechnic system would therefore be increased with the introduction of
new courses relevant to the country's growth industries (e.g., chemical
process technology, mining, textiles, printing). To help develop suitable
curricula, the project would finance: (a) 40 man-months of specialists on
short-term assignments to finalize physical and staff resource needs for
the new courses to be established in the first two polytechnics, and to
identify and plan the outline of new courses for the three polytechnics to
be established later (Table 3.1); (b) 27 man-months of short-term specialists
to help instructors in the initial implementation of new specializations
(Annex 4-A summarizes proposed technical assistance for the polytechnics).
3.05      The project would also seek to improve the quality of output by
augmenting the training of the teaching staff required for the five new
polytechnics. The required number of about 460 new staff would at first be
trained under the Government scholarship program (para. 2.22). To complement
this program, the project would include about 110 overseas fellowships of
6-12 months' duration in: (a) specialized subject study or reorientation,
particularly in practical work; (b) teaching method and practice under
supervision; (c) preparation of teaching materials related to the technician
courses; and (d) industrial experience. The project would finance a total
of 1,040 man-months. The Government assured the Bank that it would carry out
its scholarship program according to an agreed schedule (Table 3.2).
/1 The Government plans to enroll students initially in temporary facili-
ties (technical secondary schools).

/a  Represent specialized subjects for which provision would be made in
accordance with industrial needs.  In practice it is likely that the
subject areas would overlap with other general and/or specialized
courses and smaller number of distinct specialties would be required.
3.06      Improvement in Facility Utilization.  The project would seek to
improve the utilization of physical facilities in the proposed polytechnics
through (a) designing large multipurpose workshops equipped for a range of
related practical activities, rather than the large number of small
specialized workshops at the existing polytechnics; and (b) encouraging the
concentration of specialized courses in selected polytechnics with two or
three stream intakes instead of the current practice of providing the same
course at all polytechnics with consequent small intakes (para. 2.12). As a
resull: of improved schedules of accommodation and allocations for equipment of
the specialized laboratories and workshops, the project would reduce capital
cost per student place by about one quarter, from US$13,000 to US$10,000. The
utilization rates for specialized teaching accommodation (about 45% of total
teaching accommodation) would almost double from 35% to a satisfactory 68%.
3.07      Development of Management Capacity.  To cope with the administrative
complexity arising from the increasing size of the polytechnic system
(para. 2.13), the project would assist in the establishment of an effective
organization and management system. The system would aim to ensure an
appropriate balance of authority and responsibility between the MOE's
Technical and Vocational Education Division and the polytechnics to coordinate
and manage such activities as student admission, course development, academic
standards, teaching methods, examinations, student placement in training and
employment, and staffing and staff development. To establish such a system,
the project would:



- 21 -
(a) develop an appropriate structure for the internal management of
the polytechnics through the creation of (i) internal academic
boards and examination boards, and (ii) an internal organiza-
tional structure and procedures including definition of terms
of reference of all senior posts;
(b) develop an effective management system in the Ministry of
Education, in particular the Technical and Vocational Education
Division (TAVED) through the establishment of (i) a relevant
structure and responsibilities of TAVED in relation to both the
polytechnics and to other divisions of the Ministry, (ii) a poly-
technic inspectorate with special responsibility for polytechnic
matters, and (iii) an information system; and
(c) include a training program for the senior management staff of the
polytechnics and of the Ministry of Education.
The project would finance 16 man-months of specialists on short-term assign-
ments to assist in the setting up of the management systems and related in-
service training, and a total of 164 man-months of 3 to 6 months overseas
fellowships to about 50 senior management staff in TAVED (including
inspectors) and polytechnics (including principals, vice principals, heads of
department, finance officers and registrars). Understandings were reached
with the Government that the principals and department heads for the first two
polytechnics would be appointed well in advance of completion of new buildings
(i.e., by December 31, 1983 for the first and by December 31, 1984 for the
second).
Skilled Worker Training (US$25.2 million equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.08       Establishment of Industrial Training Institutes.  To increase the
number of skilled workers needed for industry (para. 1.09), the project would
establish three new ITIs at Ipoh, Kuantan and Malacca (para. 2.23) through the
provision of professional services, furniture, equipment and civil works for
academic and communal buildings, and student hostels and staff housing. The
project would also support preparation (e.g., site works, designs) for an
additional two ITIs to be built at Alor Setar and Kota Bharu at a later stage.
Each ITI would have a training capacity on a two-shift basis of 360 to 480
(Table 3.3), and would have three departments - mechanical, electrical and
construction. When fully operational, the three ITIs would produce
approximately 2,000 skilled workers per annum.

3.09      Promotion of Skill Training in Industry.  The project would help
promote skill training in industry by increasing the number of qualified
training officers and financing a study on incentive schemes. The number of
training officers attached to the Industrial Training Development Unit of the
Training Service Division under MOLM-s Manpower Department would be increased
from the present number of 14 to 32 by June 1985 and to at least 43 by 1987.
This number is based on an arrangement that one training officer would be
responsible for industrial placements and supervision of about 100 of PTC
trainees and second year apprentices. Except for the head of the Unit and a
senior training officer, they would be located in State Employment Offices.
Officers would receive training to upgrade their skills and increase their
effectiveness in carrying out their roles to promote training in industry,
identify training needs, develop and supervise on-the-job training, and assist
in the training of industry's instructors (para. 2.18). The project would
finance 36 man-months of specialists on a series of short-term assignments
(3-6 months at a time) to work with training officers in industry in Malaysia,
and 48 man-months of overseas fellowships in a program of about 3 months to
work with the same specialists in their countries (Annex 4-B summarizes
proposed technical assistance for ITIs).
3.10      In addition, the project would include a study of incentive schemes
(e.g., tax rebates) designed to encourage industry to conduct on-the-job
training. The study would evaluate the government incentive scheme recently
introduced to promote training of construction workers by contractors (para.
2.14), and recommend ways of extending such a scheme to training of craftsmen
and technicians not only in construction but also in manufacturing industries.
For the study, the project would finance six man-months of specialist
services.
3.11      Curriculum, Materials and Staff Development.  In order to raise
the quality of the training offered in the ITIs, the project would assist in
improving course content, developing teaching materials, and upgrading the



- 23 -
qualifications of instructors. Under the project, the mix of theory and
practice in ITI courses would change from 50:50 to 30:70, and the content of
the courses would be revised to promote training in areas of key importance to
industry (para. 2.15). The focus of the revised courses would be on the
production of workers, skilled either as operators from PTC courses or
craftsmen from apprenticeship courses, who woald be immediately useful in
industry. The project would provide 18 man-months of short-term overseas
fellowships and 18 man-months of specialist services to assist the Training
Service Division (TSD) in the development of training materials, visual aids,
documentation and progress testing in order to support revised courses.
3.12      To complement the scholarship program to train locally about 210 new
instructors required for the expanded system (para. 2.23), the project would
include 150 man months of overseas fellowships of about six months duration.
The Government assured the Bank that it would implement its scholarship
program according to an agreed schedule (Table 3.4).

3.13      Improvement in Facility and Staff Use.  The proposed project would
raise the utilization rates of ITI facilities and staff by increasing the
number of trainees.  The project would particularly seek to increase the
number of apprentices through consolidation o:- the institutional training
component of apprenticeship training (para. 2.16). Instead of 15 months of
training at the ITIs spread over four years, apprentices would receive
concentrated 18 months of training at the ITIs over three years. The achieve-
ment of intermediate skills in a shorter time would be expected to make the
National Apprenticeship Scheme more attractive to employers and young people



- 24 -
and, thus, make recruitment of apprenticeship trainees easier.  Recruitment of
trainees would also be improved through increased promotional activities of
the training officers (para. 3.09). Together, these measures would be
expected to increase utilization of ITI workshop facilities and achieve an
acceptable teacher to student ratio of about 1:10. Assurances were obtained
frcom the Government that they would provide a three-year consolidated
apprenticeship training program with ITI training within the first two years
of apprentices beginning July 1,1983.
3.14      Development of Management Capacity.  The project would improve the
management capacity of the ITI system at both the local and central levels
(paras. 2.17 and 2.18). At the ITI level, the project would provide 105
man-months of fellowships for the principals, the deputy principals and senior
instructors of all ten ITIs (including two existing, three under construction
and five now proposed). These staff would receive 3 to 6 months training in
curriculum and staff development, evaluation of training, facility development
and utilization, and relations with industry.
3.15      Under the project the Training Service Division of the MOLM's
Manpower Department would be reorganized and an operations unit would be
created (Chart 4). The existing Instructor Training Unit would be absorbed
into a Center for Instructor and Advanced Skill Training which is being
developed under the director's office of the Training Service Division. The
total technical staff of the Division would increase from 18 to nearly 70 by
1987. The proposed functions of the four units would be:
(a) A Training Operations Unit - develop management procedures and
systems for staff development, utilization of facilities.
selection of trainees, equipment standards and maintenance,
training materials procurement, testing and evaluation of
training. Fourteen technical staff positions would be created.
(b) An In-Plant Training Development Unit - formed from the existing
Industrial Training Development Unit. Promote training in
industry, identify training needs in industry, assist with
training of industry's trainers, and supervise on-the-job
training for trainees from ITIs. Its technical staff would build
up from 14 to 43.
(c) A Training Resource Unit - formed from the existing Technical
Support Unit. Develop and produce courses of study, and
training materials, visual aids, testing materials, and
documentation for recruitment/maintenance procedures/tralnee
records. The technical staff would increase from 4 to 13.
(d) An Administration and Finance Unit - formed from the existing
General Administration Unit. Provide the administrative and finam-
cial support services for the Training Service Division (e.g.
budgeting, payment of allowances, auditing).



- 25 -
For the new Training Operations Unit, the project would provide 36 man-months
of specialist services and 30 man-months of fellowships. Understandings were
reached with the Government on the organizational structure and staffing of
the Training Service Division, and on a schedule to implement the
reorganization and expansion.
Monitoring and Review (US$0.1 million equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.16      Strengthening of Monitoring and Review   Monitoring and review
activities for both develoment units in the MOE and MOLM would be improved
and staff strengthened for the gathering and analysis of data relevant to
project implementation and the operational impact on external and internal
efficiency, and management.  They would be assessed twice a year at meetings
of a committee comprising the relevant parties. The project would finance 9
man-months of overseas fellowships in monitoring and evaluation techniques
for staff for the units.
Studies and Pilot Schemes (US$2.0 million equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.17      In addition to direct government-financed training programs and
institutes, it will be necessary for industry itself to undertake some of the
training work necessary to develop a skilled workforce to meet national labor
requirements in the next decade. Since on-the-job training efforts have not
been commonly used in the past, it is proposed to include funds in this
project for the preparation of innovative short-term training schemes,
including employer participation incentives, based on the merits of the
incentive scheme study (para. 3.10). If these experimental pilot efforts
should prove successful, the Government could promote their wider applications
in a variety of industrial activities throughout the country. In consultation
with the Economic Planning Unit and the World Bank, feasibility studies for
Euture investment in other areas of industrial skill development would also
be included under the proposed project. A total of about US$2.0 million
would be allocated for the pilot schemes and the studies.
4. COST AND FINANCING

With the exception of costs in Sarawak which are high because of costly
transportation and high labor costs, these un:.t costs compare well with
other unit construction costs in the region. Because of the regional nature
of the institutions, about 24% of project cos: would be for student hostels
and 9% for staff housing. Costs for housing and hostels would be borne by
the Government.
4.04      Furniture costs were estimated as a proportion of construction
costs (10%) and equipment costs were derived from master equipment lists
which were reviewed during appraisal and found appropriate in scope and
cost. Technical assistance costs (about 7% oi project total) are estimated
at an average of US$7,500 per man-month for specialist services and US$1,800
per man-month of fellowship training. The man-month costs for specialists
include housing and other benefits as well as recruitment and relocation
costs. Fees for professional services (14% of actual construction costs) were
estimated on the basis of applicable fee scales of Malaysian consulting
architects.

4.06      Contingency Allowances.  A physical contingency of 10% (US$8.8
million) was added to the cost of all project items to allow for unforeseen
events. The price contingency allowance of about 27% (US$26.1 million) was
added to the base cost plus physical contingencies. This figure is based on
the implementation schedule (Annex 6) and the following escalation rates:

4.07      Foreign Echange Component.  The foreign exchange component was
estimated as follows: (a) civil works 25%; (b) furniture 25%; (c) equipment
85%; (d) professional services 10%; and (e) technical assistance 90%. These
percentages have been derived by: (a) determining the costs of civil works
and furniture attributable to material, labor, overhead and profit; (b)
analyzing awards for equipment made under earlier loans; and (c) estimating
the composition of the technical assistance program. Including contingen-
cies, ithe foreign exchange component is estimated at US$47.5 million, or
about 39% of total project costs.
4.08      Recurrent Cost.  Each student at a polytechnic pays a tuition fee
of M$450 p.a. But about two thirds of them receive scholarships. Trainees
at ITIs are free of tuition fees. Annual incremental recurrent cost to the
Government due to the proposed project is estimated at about US$3 million
equiva:Lent (in 1981 prices) for the technician training component and about
US$2 million equivalent (in 1981 prices) for the skilled worker training
component.  These costs would account for 0.2% of the MOE budget and 6% of
the MOLM budget in 1987, assuming these Ministries budgets would grow
annually at a rate of 10% in real terms.
Financing
4.09      The proposed Bank loan of US$40.6 million would finance 85% of the
foreign exchange component of the project. The remaining 15% of foreign
costs (representing the foreign exchange cost of hostels and staff housing,
which the Government would finance from its own funds) and all local costs



- 31 -
would be financed by the Government. Project: financing would be in
accordance with Table 4.7. Retroactive financing of up to US$2.0 million
is recommended to cover the cost of professional services and site works
incurred prior to loan signing but after January 1, 1982.

(a)  25% of total cost of civil works, excluding construction of
hostels and staff housing;

Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 1988.
4.12      Accounts and Audits.  The MOE and MOLM would establish and
maintain project-related accounts at the Development and Supplies Division
and at the Development Unit, respectively, which would be responsible for the
coordination of project implementation. These accounts would be operational
from the start of project implementation. Accounts would be maintained in
accordance with sound and generally recognized accounting principles and
practices satisfactory to the Bank. The above two units would submit to the
Bank annual financial statements reflecting the financial performance and
position of the project. Such financial statements would be the basis of
annual auditing of expenditures by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Annual audits would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the
end of each fiscal year of the Government to provide adequate and timely
information of the supervision of loan disbursements and of the project in
general.
5. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Management
5.01      The project would be implemented by existing organizational units
in the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Labor and Manpower
(MOLM). The MOE's Development and Supplies Division has been in charge of
implementing most of five earlier Bank-assisted education projects. The
Division remained understaffed until 1977, but subsequent strengthening in
manpower and authority of the Division has been reflected in improved
management performance; implementation of the latest education project (Loan
1657-MA of 1979) is on schedule. The unit is generally adequately staffed
to carry out its functions, but would profit from strengthening for the
purpose of collecting and analyzing data on project monitoring and review.
Similarly, the Development Office of the MOLM needs strengthening (para.
3.16).
5.02      It would be necessary to improve inplementation staffing in
several ways, particularly in respect of the Technical and Vocational
Education Division (TAVED) and the Development Unit of MOLM. The proposed
project would introduce several new institutions into a system where there
are currently only two operating polytechnics and two ITIs. This addition



- 34 -
would not onlly Increase the number of students and staff, but also increase
the diversity of training programs. Curriculum and course development would
need to be ioordlnated; the need for specialized courses at various insti-
tut-!ons established; and the changing labor market situation kept under
revIew. Staff would be trained to carry out these functions (paras. 3.07,
3.15) but it would be necessary to keep staffing needs of the project units
under periodic review during Implementation. Understandings were reached with
the Government tnat it would, starting in 1983, conduct annual reviews of
implementation staffing needs and implement the recommendations of such
revlews until project completion. Assurances were obtained from the
Government that staff would be appointed as needed to carry out the project.
5.03      Polytechnics.  The Development and Supplies Division would be aided
in implementation of the polytechnic component of the project by the Technical
and Vocational Education Division (TAVED) of the MOE.  Specific
implementation responsibilities between these bodies would generally be
divided as follows:
(a) Development and Supplies Division
(i)  calling of tenders and conducting of equipment procurement
for the polytechnics;
(ii)  review of designs, calling of tenders, award of contracts
and general supervision of construction for the polytechnics;
(iii)  administration of technical assistance contracts in respect
of polytechnics; and
(iv) claiming of disbursements from the Bank and maintenance of
liaison with the Bank on behalf of the polytechnics.
(b) Technical and Vocational Education Division
(i)  development of programs and courses for the polytechnics;
(ii) preparation of accommodation schedules, equipment lists, and
staff development programs for the polytechnics; and
(iii) technical review of equipment contract awards for the poly-
technics.
5.04      ITIs.  The Development Unit under the MOLM's Manpower Department
would implement the industrial training institute components of the proposed
project. This Unit has been in charge of implementing three new and two
expanded ITIs, assisted under Loan 1329-MA. Chronic staff shortages of this
unit, coupled with continuous delays in design preparation at the Public
Works Department, caused over three years of implementation delays in the
earlier projects. These delays have now been stabilized and implementation



- 35 -
is progressing well. To prevent recurrence of delays under the proposed
project, staffing of this unit is being increased from the current two
professionals to four professionals in 1982 (requisite posts have been
created). A minimum of a further three staff would be required by 1983.
These officers would primarily work on equipment procurement, financial
control, training course administration, techn:cal assistance administration
and general liaison with project institutes, ot:her government entities and
the Bank.
Implementation
5.05      Physical Design Services.  The Public Works Department has been
responsible for survey, design, tendering and supervision of the bulk of
earlier Bank-assisted education projects. Stai-f shortages in the Department
have been a common cause of delays in earlier projects (para. 2.28). To
avoid repetition of this problem, the Government has, with the assistance
of its Implementation Coordination Unit, seleci:ed suitable local consultants
for survey, design and supervision of all project items.
5.06      Sites.  All project sites have been selected and are acceptable
(paras. 2.22 and 2.23). Sites of project institutions to be constructed
under the first phase of the proposed project (i.e., the polytechnics at
Batu Pahat and Gombak and ITIs at Ipoh, Kuantan and Malacca) have been
acquired except for the site for an ITI at Ipoh, which is expected to be
acquired in July 1982. Services are available at site boundaries. Sites
for project items to be prepared for a second nhase project are generally in
a less advanced state of readiness.
5.07      Maintenance.  Earlier Bank-assisted School facilities have, with
few exceptions, been reasonably well maintained. The Government provides an
adequate budget for acceptable annual maintenance.
5.08      Procurement.  Contracts for civil works aggregating about US$55
million (75%  of total value of civil works) a-d equipment totalling about
US$15 million (65% of total value of equipment) would be grouped to the
maximum extent possible and awarded on the basLs of international competi-
ive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines, except as follows:
(a)  Civil works contracts (aggregating about US$15 million or 25% of
total value of civil works) costing less than US$2.5 million each.
These contracts would mostly be for site works in scattered
locations that are unlikely to interest foreign contractors, and
would therefore be awarded on the basis of locally advertised
bidding in which foreign firms would be allowed to participate.
(b) Equipment bid packages (aggregating about US$5.0 million) esti-
mated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent each, which are not
expected to interest foreign suppliers because of the variety of



- 36 -
the contents of each contract, would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with govern-
ment procurement practices which are acceptable to the Bank.
(c) Sundry items not exceeding US$25,000 in each contract and aggre-
gating a maximum of US$2.0 million equivalent which could be
purchased on the basis of a minimum of three quotations or on the
basis of Treasury contracts for bulk procurement.
(d)  Furniture and books would be purchased in accordance with normal
government procedures. These items would not be financed from the
proceeds of the proposed loan.
Bid packaging would be reviewed by the Bank prior to bid invitation. In bid
comparison of equipment procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB), domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%,
or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. prices of
competing imports. Under ICB procedures, invitations to bid and proposed
awards of contracts would be reviewed by the Bank prior to final award
decisions. It is estimated that this review would cover about 75% of the
value of civil works contracts and about 65% of the value of equipment
contracts.
5.09      Technical Assistance.  The MOE would obtain specialist services
and arrange its staff training programs overseas through its existing
strong connections with experienced technical education and management
institutions. The MOLM would obtain specialist services and place staff in
training overseas both by making its own direct arrangements and by the use
of consulting organizations. Employment of consulting organizations and
specialists would be in accordance with Bank guidelines on the use of
consultants. Understandings were reached with the Government on the
implementation of technical assistance programs.
Status of Preparation
5.10      The project is generally in an advanced state of preparation:
sites for project institutions to be constructed under Phase I have been
acquired except for the site for an ITI at Ipoh; consultant architects and
engineers have been appointed; acceptable sketch designs have been prepared;
an academic development plan for polytechnics has been outlined; detailed
staff development programs of ITIs and polytechnics have been prepared and
agreed with the Bank; job descriptions for new posts to be created under the
project and terms of reference for specialists were prepared; and master
equipment lists have been prepared. Critical steps for further project
development and initial implementation in 1982 would be:

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      There would be three principal benefits from the proposed project:
(a) an increase in the number of suitably qualified technicians and skilled
workers for industry, (b) an increase in internal efficiency in industrial
skill training; and (c) strengthened management of the polytechnics and
industrial training institute systems. In addition, the proposed project
would lay the groundwork for further increases in output under a second
phase of the industrial skill development program by preparing designs and
site works for five institutions. Increased internal efficiency and manage-
ment capacity resulting from the proposed project would also benefit a
second phase project.
6.02      The annual output of 1,200  technicians to be produced by the two
new polytechnics would meet about 20% of the projected average annual require-
ment for the decade 1981-90. The annual output from the whole polytechnic
system would rise to 4,600 certificate holders, and meet about 75% of annual
needs. The three new ITIs to be constructed in the first phase would graduate
2,000 trainees per year, or about 20% of the Estimated average annual
requirement for skilled industrial labor from 1981-90. The output of the
whole ITI system would rise to 7,200 skilled workers per annum, and meet 70%
of annual needs. The unit capital cost for the proposed polytechnics would
be about 25% lower than the costs originally estimated by the Government.
This cut would be made possible through improved schedules of accommodations
and allocations of equipment for specialized laboratories and workshops
within the network of polytechnics. Assuming that the earning stream
would remain unchanged, the economic rate of return to polytechnic education



- 38 -
would rise slightly from the current 16% to 17% in the proposed institutions.
The capital costs for proposed ITIs would be cut by 13% as compared to the
original government estimates through more efficient accommodation designs and
a consequent reduction in the need for equipment. More important, recurrent
costs would be reduced by about a quarter from those in existing ITIs, by
ensuring an improved use of human and physical resources (e.g., teacher:stu-
dent ratios in the new ITIs to be 1.10 rather than present 1:3 or 1:4). These
measures would increase the rate of return to ITI training from the current
12% toD 15% in the new institutions.
Risks
6.03      There are two important risks inherent in the proposed project.  The
first is that implementation of the project might not proceed on schedule due
to inadequate program management and a limited capacity of the construction
industry; this has proved to be a major issue in polytechnic and ITI
development programs in the past (para. 5.01). To help reduce this risk, the
Government's industrial skill development program would be assisted in phases,
the proposed project constituting the first. Phasing the project avoids
burdening the management in the MOE and MOLM with too extensive a program
before their own institutional development has got underway. In addition, the
Government has employed consultant architects for the proposed project to
avoid relying on the Public Works Department (which due to excessive work has
been a source of delays in the past). A second risk involves the possibility
of continued underenrollment at the ITIs due to the lack of interested
trainees and employers. Two measures are to be taken under the project to
avoid this: (a) a reduction in the period in which institutional training is
taken under the National Apprenticeship Scheme, from four years to three; and
(b) an increase in number and improvement in expertise of the training
officesrs of the MOLM. The changes in the apprenticeship training program
should make it more attractive to employers and trainees. At the same time,
increased promotional activities by the expanded corps of training officers
should also attract ITI entrants.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Understandings were  reached with the Government and the Bank on:
(a) the appointment of principals and department heads for the first
polytechnic by December 31,1983 and the second by December 31,
1984 (para. 3.07);
(b) the reorganized structure and staffing of the Training Service
Division and a schedule to implement the reorganization and
expansion (para. 3.15);



- 39 -
(c) annual reviews of implementation staffing needs, starting in 1983,
and implementation of the recommendations of such reviews until
project completion (para. 5.02); ard
(d) the implementation of technical assistance programs (para. 5.09).
7.02      Assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a) the Government-s scholarship prograLm to train about 460
instructors for the proposed five polytechnics would be
implemented as planned (para. 3.05';
(b) the Government-s scholarship program to train about 210
instructors for the proposed five ::TIs would be implemented as
planned (para. 3.12); and
(c)  a consolidated apprenticeship training program would be introduced
to new apprentices enrolled at all ITIs beginning July 1,1983
(para. 3.13); and
(d) staff would be appointed as needed to carry out the project.
(para. 5.02).
7.03      Retroactive financing of up to US$2.0 million is recommended for
professional services and site works incurred prior to loan signing
(para. 4.09).
7.04       Subject to the above conditions, t-le proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a loan of US$40.6 million equivalent to the Government of
Malaysia, for a term of 15 years, including a three-year grace period.

ANNEX 3

Method Used for Cost-Benefit Analysis
1.        The Annex provides the method applied for calculating rates of
return to polytechnic education and apprenticeship training. As regards
to data on costs and benefits, reference is made to a working paper in the
Project File (C.3).
2.        The basic principle of the method is to compare the costs of
education (teaching costs and foregone earnings while studying) to the
benefits (additional income over the life cycle of the individual due to
his/her education)./l A social rate of return (r) is computed through the
following equation:
Z(Ys Yu)t (l+r)t = tL  (Yu)t (1+r)-t +t l(Ci)t (1+r)t
where
Ys = yearly income of a skilled worker;
Yu = yearly income of an unskilled worker;
Ci = yearly teaching cost for an ITI student.
A private rate of return is estimated through the same formula, but on the
cost side (i.e., the right side of the equation), the cost of teaching is not
included if it is supported entirely by the State. There is also a
"short-cut method" which has proved, through empirical studies, that there is
no major difference in the results.  The formula of this method is:
r      Y -Yu
t=l(YU+Ci)
where Y5 and Y5 are the average yearly earnings of skilled and unskilled
workers respectively. The short-cut method has been used for Malaysia.
IL  For a general overview of methods and empirical results, see, for
instance, G. Psacharopoulos, Returns to Education: An International
Comparison (N.Y., 1973).
