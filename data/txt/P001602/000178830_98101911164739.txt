APPRAISAL OF NKULA FALLS II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a hydroelectric development which would be
carried out by the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi (ESCOM), a Govern-
ment owned entity, responsible for public electricity supplies in Malawi.
The project would be the fourth major project in the development of the
hydroelectric potential of the Shire River, which began in 1966.
ii.       The project will develop a hydroelectric site at Nkula Falls with
a dam, a headrace tunnel and penstock system and a powerhouse sufficient
for an ultimate plant capacity of 90 MW of which 2 x 18 MW hydro units would
be included in the project with additional units being installed in the
future to meet increasing power demand. The site potential is expected to
be fully utilized by 1989. The estimated project cost is US$66.4 million
equivalent including an estimated foreign exchange cost of US$50.6 million.
Taking into account the estimated interest during construction of US$11.6
million, of which the foreign exchange component would be US$6.1 million,
the project's total financing requirements would be US$78.0 million, includ-
ing US$56.7 million in foreign exchange. Of these requirements up to
US$59.2 million equivalent is expected to be available from various lending
agencies. The Bank would provide US$25 million equivalent by way of a
US$9 million standard Bank Loan, a US$8 million Bank Loan on Third Window
Terms and US$8 million IDA Credit to help finance the foreign exchange
costs of civil works, ESCOM's training program and interest during construc-
tion on the Bank loans. AfDB, CDC, the Federal Republic of Germany and FED
are expected to provide up to about US$34 million. External finance would
cover the full foreign exchange requirements and possibly, a small proportion
of local costs. The remaining finance would be provided from ESCOM's internal
cash generation. Interest on AfDB, Federal Republic of Germany, FED, IDA and
Third Window Funds would be capitalized during construction and treated as
Government's contribution.
iii.      The project is essential to meet Malawi's power demand, which is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 11% between 1977 and 1984.
The project is the least cost solution for meeting the projected level of
demand among all practicable alternative solutions including a number of
thermal/hydro schemes and other schemes for hydro development.
iv.       Contracts for civil works, which would be partly financed by the
Bank Group would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement.
v.        ESCOM is a well managed organization and this will be the third
project carried out with Bank Group financial assistance. An IDA Credit
(178-MAI) for US$5.25 million made in 1970 helped finance the foreign exchange
costs of the first stage of the Tedzani hydroelectric development. Parallel



- 11 -
finance of US$3 million equivalent was provided by AfDB for the foreign
exchange costs of 66-kV transmission system and distribution extensions. The
project was completed close to schedule in 1973, at a total cost of US$16.5
million including a 14% cost overrun. To help meet this overrun CDC and the
Industrial Development Bank of Malawi (INDEBANK) made further loans totalling
US$1.8 million. Cost overruns were due to unforeseen rock conditions and an
underestimate of contractors establishment costs.
vi.       A second IDA Credit (426-MAI) of US$7.5 million was made in 1973,
to help finance the foreign exchange costs of the second stage of the Tedzani
Hydroelectric Scheme which added 24 MW to generating capacity. The project
also included a 14-MW gas turbine.  CDC participated in the project finan-
cing with a loan of US$6 million. The project has essentially been completed
according to the original schedule, but the estimated cost of US$18 million
will be 27% over the appraisal estimate. CDC has provided a further US$2
million to help finance the cost overrun which is attributable to an un-
anticipated acceleration in world inflation.
vii.       ESCOM's financial performance, as reflected by earnings from opera-
tions, has been very good since the first IDA Credit was made available to
it in 1970 but earnings have been absorbed by capital expenditures leaving
a tight liquid position. However, as a consequence of tariff increases and
additional finance in 1977, ESCOM's liquid position should improve. ESCOM's
financial objectives will include an annual 12% rate of return on revalued
assets in 1978 and 1979 and 8% thereafter. ESCOM's financial operating
performance is expected to be good during and after project completion.
viii.      The project is the first part of the least cost alternative for
adding a further 90 MW of generating capacity to ESCOM's interconnected
system and the internal rate of return for the complete development would
be about 12%.
ix.       The project is suitable for Bank Group finance of US$25 million
equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF NKULA FALLS II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the first phase of the Electricity Supply
Commission or Malawi's (ESCOM) proposed Nkula II Hydroelectric Power Project.
The estimated project cost is MK 60.4 million (US$66.4 million), excluding
interest during construction, with a foreign currency component of MK 46.0
million (US$50.6 million). Estimated interest during construction would add
an estimated MY, 10.6 million (US$11.6 million) to ESCOM's total project
financing requirements.  The Government of Malawi has asked the Bank Group
to help finance the foreign exchange costs and will receive further financing
assistance from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the European Development Fund (FED) and the Federal
Republiz of Germany.
1.02      This will be the third Power Project in Malawi which has been
financed with Bank Group assistance. The main objective of all three pro-
jects is to develop the hydroelectric potential of the Shire River, which
has been the main source of ESCOM's additional generating capacity since
1966.
1.03      In 1966 ESCOM's first significant hydro plant was completed
through the first stage development of Nkula Falls site which added 24 MW
of generating capacity. The project was financed with CDC assistance.
1.04      In 1970 through an IDA Credit (178-MAI) the Bank Group provided
US$5.25 million to help finance the foreign exchange costs of a project
adding a further 16 MW of hydro generating capacity through the first stage
of the Tedzani Falls development. The project also included a 3-MW diesel
generating station and transmission and distribution facilities. Parallel
finance of US$3 million equivalent was provided by the African Development
Bank.
1.05      The project was completed close to schedule in 1973 at a cost of
US$16.5 million including a 14% cost overrun. CDC and INDEBANK provided
a further US$2.1 million to help finance this overrun. The overrun was
attributable to unexpected bad rock conditions and to an underestimate of
contractors establishment costs.
1.06      In 1973 Credit (426-MAI - Second Power Project) of US$7.5 million
was made to help finance the foreign exchange costs of the second stage
of the Tedzani Hydroelectric scheme which added a further 24 MW to generating
capacity. The project also included a 14-MW gas turbine unit to avoid a power
shortage in 1976 and subsequently for operation as a standby and peaking unit.
CDC also participated in the project financing with a loan of US$6 million.



1.07      The Second Power project has substantially been completed according
to original schedule at an estimated cost of US$18 million, 27% above the
appraisal estimate. CDC has provided a further US$2 million to help finance
the estimated cost overrun and additional funds will be provided from a
tariff increase supplemented by a temporary bank overdraft. The cost overrun
is due to an unanticipated acceleration in world inflation after the project
was appraised.
1.08      The proposed project to be constructed between mid-1977 and end-1980
would represent the second stage of development of the Nkula Falls site and
would provide for 90 MW of generating capacity with 2 x 18 MW units being
included in the project and a further 54 MW being added at various stages in
the 1980s.
1.09      All the above developments of the Shire River are based on the
recommendations of two British consulting firms, Kennedy and Donkin, and
Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann who have been employed by ESCOM for
many years. Another British consulting firm, Coopers and Lybrand Associates
Ltd., also assisted in preparing the report on the proposed development.
1.10      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal by Messrs.
I. Tuncay, E. Greenwood and J. deWeille who visited Malawi in November 1975
and on information provided by Government, ESCOM, Mr. R. Bloor (a Bank
consultant), and the consulting firms mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
Messrs. Tuncay and Greenwood visited Malawi in November 1976 to bring their
previous findings up-to-date.
II. GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      Malawi is a land-locked country in South East Africa, bordered
by Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. About one quarter of the country is
coyered by lakes, the largest being Lake Malawi with an area of some 33,000
km . Mlalawi's total land area is about 93,000 km , which consists largely
of plateau about 1,460 m above sea level; the mountainous north rises to
2,500 m and the extreme south is only 200 m above sea level. With a popula-
tion of about 5 million growing at about 2.6% per year, Malawi is one of the
most densely populated countries in Africa. Th2 population is concentrated
in the Southern Region, with 180 persons per km in 1975, compared with 114
and 60 in the Central and Northern Regions.
2.02      Since independence in 1964, GDP at constant prices has grown at a
comparatively high rate of almost 8% per year; the GNP per capita of about
US$150 is, however, still one of the lowest in the world. The economy
is based primarily on agriculture, in which over 90% of the population is
engaged, much of it at the subsistence level, and it supplies more than



90% of exports (mainly tobacco, tea, sugar and groundnuts). Total GDP in 1975
at current market prices was estimated to be US$755 million, of whichl agricul-
tural output accounted for approximately 45%, and manufacturing 14%. Between
1970-1975, high growth of investments and domestic savings (11% and 15% per
year), played an important role in the favorable development of Malawi's
economy. On the basis of past performance and present potential, an economic
growth of about 6.5% per year might be possible with manufacturing, large
agricultural estates and most services including electricity, growing at a
higher rate than the economy as a whole.
Energy Resources
2.03      The only known fossil fuels in Malawi suitable for thermal genera-
tion are coal deposits at Livingstonia, a remote area of the Northern Region.
The development of these deposits is, at present, uneconomic due to their
distance from the main centers of population. In any case, local coal would
not be cheaper than coal imported from Mozambique and Rhodesia. Fuel oil is
not imported in bulk because there is little demand for it; diesel fuel in
Blantyre now costs about US$15.4 per million keal.
2.04      Geothermal power potential exists in the north of the country but
extensive investigations have still to be carried out before a real estima-
tion of the potential and feasibility of development can be established.
2.05      There is some hydroelectric potential in the north of the country
which has yet to be investigated, but the principal large potential source
of power in Malawi is the Shire River which flows out of Lake Malawi through
the southern part of the country to join the Zambezi in Mozambique (see Map
IBRD 2369R4) Lake Malawi is a large natural reservoir and the Shire River,
which carries the overflow from the Southern end of the lake, falls about 420
m in a distance of 80 km between Kholombidza Falls and Kapachira Falls. The
total power potential of this stretch of river known as the Middle Shire has
been estimated at about 500 MW with a productive capacity of some 3,500 GWh
per annum at 80% load factor and a probability of a water shortfall only once
in 80 years.
The Power Sector
2.06      Because it operates mainly in the regions of Malawi in which
most of the economic development has occurred, the power sector has been
growing much more rapidly than the economy as a whole. Sales by ESCOM,
which is responsible for public supplies throughout the country, rose at an
average rate of 18% per annum between 1965 and 1975. Total investment by
ESCOM during 1965-1969 amounted to MK 3.5 million (US$4.3 million) 1/ or
about 2.5% of the national total of MK 138.7 million (US$169.1 million). 1/
Power investment in the Government's 1970-1974 plan was projected at MK 25.1
million (US$30.6 million) 1/ at constant 1969-1970 prices, which represented
1/   Converted at the then prevailing exchange rate of MK 0.82 = US$1.



- 4 -
about 6.4X of the total planned national investment of MK 394.1 million
(US$480.6 million) 1/ during the same period.
2.07      The industrial sector accounts for the bulk of electricity con-
sumption. During 1970-1975, industrial users accounted for about 63% of
total energy sales, followed by the commercial sector with about 18% and the
residential sector with about 17%. A statistical summary for 1970 and 1975
together with a forecast for 1980 is given below and Annex I gives fuller
details. Between 1967 and 1975 annual growth of total sales ranged from a
high of 23% in 1975 to a low of 8% in 1974 influenced largely by varying
rainfalls, which affected annual power requirements for irrigation, and by
industrial expansion.

2.08      It is estimated that about 1 million of Malawi's 5 million popula-
tion live in areas with a potential for access to present electricity supply
facilities. Of this number about 100,000 are supplied through existing
connections numbering about 15OOO. Most of the 100,000 are in Blantyre,
Malawi's main industrial and commercial center with an estimated population
of 210,000 and in Lilongwe, the capital city with an estimated population of
87,000.

-5-
2.09      Present consumption per person living in conntected houses is
about 500 kWh per year is high due largely to the air conditioning and water
heating loads of expatriates and high-ranking local officials. Connection
density is about 0.10 per 1,000 population in rural areas and about 60 per
1,000 population in urban areas.
Existing Power Facilities
2.10      ESCOM's principal generating facilities are located in the Southern
Region, which accounts for about 92% of the kWh sold. Apart from a small
diesel station at Mgugu, installed capacity 1.0 MW, there are no public
electricity supplies in the Northern Region. Malawi's current total installed
generating capacity is about 109 MW, consisting of 65 MW of hydro, 30 MW of
thermal, and a 14-MW gas turbine. About 90% of total installed capacity is
owned by ESCOM; the remaining 10% is owned by power users who are either out
of reach of ESCOM's supply lines or find it more economical to use industrial
by-products as fuel for their generating equipment. Plants already under
construction and scheduled for commissioning in the period 1976-1980 will
bring ESCOM's installed capacity to about 130 MW and the country's total to
about 140 MW. ESCOM's existing facilities are described in greater detail in
Annex 2 and are shown on the Map 2 (IBRD 2369R4) attached to this report.
Power Development Program
2.11      Apart from the proposed project, which will meet the growing demand
in the interconnected system, ESCOM's development program in the period 1975-
1980 includes extensions of existing distribution facilities and construction
of a 541-km, 132-kV transmission line from Tedzani and Nkula Falls II to
Chinteche in Northern Malawi, which will supply expected industrial loads
in the Chinteche area. 1/ The first stage of this line, which will be routed
to Salima, with a branch line to Lilongwe, is being constructed with Canadian
finance channelled through AfDB and is expected to be operational by 1978 or
1979. If the second stage of the 132-kV line from Salima to Chinteche were to
be postponed, it would have no significant effect on the timing of the installa-
tion of the additional generators required to bring the project facilities to
maximum use (see para. 4 in Annex 11).
2.12      Long-term planning for projects beyond ESCOM's 1975-1980 development
program has started, including three major hydroelectric projects (Kapachira,
Mpatamanga, and Kholombidza) with a total capacity of about 360 MW on the Middle
Shire River.
Rural Electrification
2.13      Government has yet to determine its goals for rural electrifica-
tion. This type of development electrification would be unprofitable; Gov-
ernment's prior social objective is to extend electric service to the urban
poor. Some electrification of poor urban areas is taken into consideration
in housing development programs; however, comprehensive plans have yet to be
developed for supplying electricity to the bulk of the urban poor.
1/   The Chinteche load is estimated to total 9 MW, consisting of a pulp
mill I MW, a chemical factory 6 MW and mill town 1 MW, district require-
ments I MW.

III. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01      The project will be the major part of ESCOM's 1975-1980 generating
program.  It consists of:
(a)  Construction of a rock-fill dam about 7 m in height and
about 700 m in length at Nkula site to form a reservoir
adequate for daily regulation;
(b)  Construction of a low pressure cut and cover conduit, a head-
race tunnel, penstock and a tailrace outlet system of about
1,280 m and a powerhouse with two 18-MW hydro units (first
phase of a 90-MW ultimate capacity);
(c) Consulting services; and
(d) Training.
A detailed project description is given in Annex 3.
3.02      The dam is to be constructed about 50 m downstream of the existing
Nkula I Barrage, and 8 km upstream of Tedzani II dam (see Map IBRD 12214).
The selection of the site was based on favorable ground conditions and power
optimization studies.
3.03      The location and dimensions of the dam, waterways, sizes of the
plant and individual generating units, and dimensions of the other major
equipment (such as transformers and switchgear equipment) are acceptable
and have all been determined by ESCOM's consultants, as a result of a series
of cost optimization studies based on the estimated load growth in the power
system, the prevailing local conditions (hydrological, geological and topo-
graphical), and sound engineering principles.
3.04      Although there are no competing claims for the waters of the Shire
River upstream of Nkula II, continued availability of water in sufficient
quantities for the project would be essential. Government will not permit any
abstraction of water from the Shire River or its tributaries upstream of Nkula
that would reduce the potential output of the Nkula II Hydro station (unless
the Bank agrees that such abstraction would be economically justified), and
will permit ESCOM to divert water from 3the Shire River in such amounts as may
be necessary (but not less than 170 m Is) for the purpose of power generation
at Nkula Falls II. A similar covenant was included in Credit for the Second
Power Project.
Estimated Cost
3.05      The estimated total cost of the project is MK 60.4 million (US$66.4
million equivalent), of which MK 46.0 million (US$50.6 million), about 76%,
would be foreign exchange. These costs are before interest and commitment

3.06      As in the case of the Second Power Project, Government confirmed
that it would waive duties on all imported goods and services required
for the project.   Preliminary investigation costs amounting to about MK
500,000 (US$575,000) have been covered by ESCOM and have been excluded from
the above costs.



-8-
Basis for Estimates
3.07      The project costs are based on ESCOM's consultants estimates,
as revised by the mission, and base costs are stated as of March 31, 1977.
Physical contingencies of 20% on civil works and equipment have been added.
Following discussions with Government, ESCOM and its consultants, local
costs have been assumed to escalate, 9% annually between 1977 and 1981.
Following the Bank guidelines, annual foreign price escalation for civil works
has been taken at 9% for 1977 through 1979 and 8% thereafter and foreign price
escalation for equipment at 7.5% for 1977 through 1979 and 7% thereafter. On
the basis of these estimates, the project would cost about US$2,000 per kW for
the first phase capacity of 36 MW, and about US$1,200 per kW for the ultimate
capacity of 90 MW.
3.08      Estimates of the foreign exchange costs of civil works at 70%
are justifiably high as local costs would consist only of land and unskilled
manpower, while materials would be imported.
Financing
3.09      The proposed Bank Group contribution of US$25 million equivalent
would be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of the civil works compo-
nent and of ESCOM's training program, as well as interest during construc-
tion on the Bank loans, and would cover about 32% of total financing require-
ments. AfDB finance (up to US$6 million equivalent) will be used to help
finance the foreign exchange costs of gates, screens and penstocks, FED
funds (US$9.5 million equivalent) to help finance the foreign exchange costs
of turbines, generators and cranes, and Federal Republic of Germany funds
(up to US$5 million equivalent) to help finance the foreign exchange costs
of switchgear and transformers. CDC funds (US$13.7 million equivalent) will
be available to the project without any restrictions as to their use. Avail-
able funds are expected to cover the foreign exchange requirements of the pro-
ject and possibly a small portion of local expenditures. The remaining fi-
nancing requirements would be provided by ESCOM's internal cash generation,
and in the case of AfDB, Federal Republic of Germany, FED and Third Window
Funds passed by Government to ESCOM under onlending agreements. Interest dur-
ing construction would be capitalized and treated as Government contribution.
As a condition of effectiveness of Bank Group finance, all conditions of
effectiveness of AfDB, CDC and FED agreements should have been fulfilled.
As financing for the project components expected to be financed by the
Federal Republic of Germany will not be required until 1978 and, since these
items could be obtained through suppliers' credits as a last resort, should
this be necessary, the cross effectiveness arrangements would not be required
in this respect.
Disbursements
3.10      It is proposed to use the Bank/IDA finance to help meet foreign ex-
change costs by disbursing the foreign costs of civil works and ESCOM's train-
ing program, and interest during construction on the Bank Loans.



-9-
3.11      If any of the Bank Group Funds remains undisbursed after completion
of the project, they would be canceled. An estimated disbursement schedule
is given in Annex 5.
Detailed Design and Construction Supervision
3.12      The project is being designed jointly by Messrs. Watermeyer, Legge,
Piesold and Uhlmann (civil consultants) and Kennedy and Donkin (mechanical/
electrical consultants) both of the United Kingdom (UK). These firms are
ESCOM's joint consultants and are acceptable to the Bank Group. They
designed and supervised both the Nkula Falls I and Tedzani Stage I and II
developments and they will be responsible for the preparation of all docu-
ments and evaluation of tenders and will supervise construction of the
project. ESCOM will continue to employ suitably qualified consultants on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank in carrying out the project.
Construction Schedule
3.13      Tender documents have already been prepared and issued for the main
project components. Contractors' offers for the construction of the main
civil works were received in December 1976. Construction is expected to
commence mid-1977, and to be completed in 1980. The project construction
schedule is shown in Annex 6.
Procurement
3.14      Contracts for civil works, to be partially financed from the Bank
Group funds and also gates, penstocks and screens which would be financed by
AfDB, will be awarded shortly on the basis of international competitive
bidding, following the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Other contracts
will be awarded in accordance with co-financiers procurement procedures.
Environmental Studies
3.15      A general ecological review of the Tedzani site, 8 km downstream of
Nkula Falls II, was completed in late 1974 during the course of the construc-
tion of Tedzani Barrage. This study and experiences on Tedzani Stage I and
Nkula Falls I, at the same site, indicate that the project should not cause
major ecological problems nor have any negative effects of such magnitude
as to impair the feasibility of the damming. There are no permanent human
habitations and no crops which are likely to be inundated when the dam is
commissioned. ESCOM has arranged a reconnaissance study satisfactory to the
Bank to examine the possible ecological changes arising from the project and
to recommend the steps which should be taken to avoid or mitigate undesirable
side effects. The study is being carried out by the University of Malawi.
Government and ESCOM will review the conclusions and recommendations of the
study with the Bank and take any remedial action as is considered necessary.
Effect of Nkula II on Existing Works
3.16      The proposed Nkula II Dam will raise the natural water level of the
Shire River about 7 m (maximum). Although this change will have an effect on



- 10-
the existing Nkula I hydroelectric facilities and on the water intake facili-
ties of Blantyre Water Board (BWB), only minor inexpensive modifications to
these facilities will be needed for the facilities to function satisfactorily.
IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project represents the least cost solution for meeting
Malawi's growing power demand until the early 1980's.
Market Growth
4.02      The project would supply additional energy to ESCOM's interconnected
system which supplies, inter alia, Blantyre, Malawi's main industrial and com-
mercial center with a population of 210,000, Lilongwe, the new capital, with
a population of 87,000, Zomba, the old capital, with a population of 19,700 and
also a large sugar estate. The interconnected system accounts for about 98% of
ESCOM's sales. Between 1967 and 1975, ESCOM's annual average sales increased
by 15%, largely due to industrial growth. As industrial growth is not expected
to continue at the earlier rate the annual increase in sales is projected to
gradually decline to 9% by 1984.
4.03      About two-thirds of ESCOM's industrial sales are to four large con-
sumers. By far the largest industrial customers are SUCOMA, a sugar estate
and the Blantyre Water Board, both of whom use electricity primarily for pump-
ing water. Growth in industrial sales between 1967 and 1975 has varied between
30% in 1975 to 4% in 1974 with an average annual growth rate of 16%. After
taking into account the plans of major industrial consumers, the growth rate
from 1977 to 1984 is projected to average 11% per annum. The average annual
growth rate for commercial electricity sales is projected at 10% from 1977 to
1984, as compared to 15% between 1967 and 1976.
4.04      Sales to low density residential consumers, who are mainly higher
ranking government officials and expatriates living in Blantyre, Lilongwe
and Zomba, are projected to increase at an average rate of 9% between 1976
and 1984. As a percentage of total sales, low density sales are expected
to decline from 16% in 1976 to 12% in 1980.
4.05      Sales to ESCOM's high density residential consumers, who live mainly
in the larger towns in Government low rental housing, started from a low base
and had the highest growth between 1967 and 1975, ranging between 18% in
1975 and 50% in 1967 with an average growth rate of 34%. Such high growth
rates are not expected to continue in the future and a gradual fall in demand
growth to about 20% by 1984 is expected. Detailed historical sales figures
from 1967 to 1976 and projected sales figures from 1976 to 1984 are shown
in Annex 7 together with corresponding trends in maximum demand and generation.
Need for Additional Capacity
4.06      In 1976 ESCOM's 71 MW of generating facilities included diesel,
steam and hydro plant with the hydro component representing about 70. of
the total. The hydroelectric power stations are all basically "run-of-river"



- 11-
developments. An assurance of a sufficient flow rate to operate hydro plants
at maximum capacity, even during the driest years, is provided by the Liwonde
Barrage with the almost unlimited reservoir capacity of Lake Malawi. Diesel
sets and steam units are being used to meet peak demand and to cover the
excess energy requirements over existing hydro capacity and for standby pur-
poses.
4.07      The projected maximum demand and energy requirements are shown in
Annexes 8 and 9, which demonstrate that, with the commissioning of the second
stage Tedzani Project, the interconnected system would be capable of meeting
peak demand and energy requirements until 1980 after which the generating
capacity to be provided by the project would be required.
Comparison of Alternative Development Programs
4.08      After extensive studies by the consultants involving the analysis
of 80 different development strategies, the project (Alternative I) has been
demonstrated to be the next step in the least cost solution to ESCOM's capital
development program over the next 25-year period from 1980. Future develop-
ment will be a blend of hydro and thermal generation with hydro predominating.
4.09      In addition to the above development program, other alternatives
considered for meeting long-term demand included: (a) two diesel sets of
10 MW each as the first step followed by the Nkula Falls scheme (Alternative
II); (b) two steam units of 20 MW each followed by hydro projects (Alterna-
tive III); and all hydro units (Alternative IV).
4.10      Analysis of the four development programs indicated that Alterna-
tive I would be preferable to Alternatives II, III and IV at discount rates
up to 24%. A description and analysis of the alternative development programs
are given in Annex 10.
Return on Investment
4.11      The project, which includes the development of a hydroelectric site
sufficient for 90 MW of generating capacity, will include 36 MW of hydro plant
to be followed in the later 1980's by a further 54 MW of hydro plant.
4.12      Measuring the rate of return on the complete development and using
present tariff levels in calculating benefits gives a rate of return of 11.5%.
For the project only the rate of return would be 9%. The method of calcu-
lating the rate of return is described in Annex 11.
Project Monitoring System
4.13      Project monitoring standards were agreed with ESCOM at negotia-
tions. Major project elements to be monitored against target dates would be
the contract award and the construction of coffer dam, main dam, and power
station. Financial monitoring would focus on (a) financtbii plans under five
yearly forecasts prepared annually; (b) rate of ret;r]; 'f  cdllection of
revenues; and (d) staffing. Guidelines for a project monitoring system are
given in Annex 13.

V. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY CO14MISSION OF MAALAWI
5.Oi      The US$9 million standard Bank Loan would be made directly to ESCOM.
The Government of Malawi would be the borrower in the case of the US$8 mil-
lion Bank Loan on Third Window terms and US$8 million IDA Credit. Government
would relend the latter US$16 million finance to ESCOM (the beneficiary)
(para. 6.08).
Institutional Framework
5.02      ESCOM is a body corporate, established by the Electricity Act in
1963, when it took over the assets, liabilities and staff of the Ulyasaland
Electricity Supply Commission.
5.03      Under the Act the Commission consists of a chairman and not less
than three or more than five other members, all of whom are appointed by
the Minister. At the present time, ESCOM reports to the Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Tourism.
5.04      The present board consists of a local businessman, who is chairman,
and five other members, one of whom is a businessman. The four other members
consist of the CDC representative in Blantyre, the Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism, a retired civil servant, and an
official of the M1alawian Congress Party.
5.05      Under its Act ESCOM is at all times subject to the general direc-
tion of the M'inister and requires ministerial approval of borrowings, capital
and revenue budgets and tariff changes. However, good working relationships
exist between the Minister and ESCOM which is allowed considerable initiative
in day-to-day operations and whose recommendations are usually accepted.
Organization and Management
5.06      ESCOM is a well-managed utility with experienced and competent
staff in its senior management positions. The General Manager has been
employed by ESCOM for many years and there has been little recent turnover
of staff in the senior management positions. Some shortages of supervisory
engineering staff exist, however, and higher salaries may be required to
attract the expatriate staff required. ESCOM's organizational structure is
shown in Annex 12.
5.07      ESCOM's total staff at the end of 1975 was about 1,200.  Of about
110 senior positions, 33 were occupied by expatriates including three of
the four top management posts. However, through a well-considered training
program, the number of expatriates has been graduallv reduced and by 1980
ESCOM seeks to localize its entire staff.
5.08      A staff of 1,200 for an electricity supply undertaking of HSCOH's
size is rather high. Efforts have been made to control staff additi,-m9
however, and since the last Credit was made, they have l-   -iJes - re-
lation to ESCOMI's growth.  The suQcess of these efforts          - ;e I  -c itored
through the Project monitoring Guideline: -hown in Annex 13I



- 13 -
5.09      ESCOM's staff is competent to carry out the project with engineer-
ing consulting assistance and to carry out other capital works during the
project implementation period. To ensure the continuation of ESCOM's manage-
ment capability, were new appointments to the positions of General Manager,
Chief Engineer, Secretary and Financial Controller will not be made before
taking into account the views expressed by the Bank Group on the proposed
appointments.
Training
5.10      As mentioned in para. 5.07, ESCOM's objective is to be fully staffed
with Malawi nationals by 1980. To achieve this, there has been a continuous
training program in operation since 1963. An expatriate training manager
was replaced by a Malawi national last year. ESCOM has sent the new manager
to the United Kingdom to familiarize himself with training in a British
electricity undertaking.
5.11      At the present time, ESCOM has 13 students studying overseas for
degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering, one in civil engineering,
and a further five students taking technician courses. In 1977 it is expected
that five students will obtain their degrees and will join the Commission to-
gether with a further two students who have had technician training. ESCOM
also has two students studying abroad for professional accounting qualifi-
cations and one returned to Malawi in 1976.
5.12      To assist ESCOM in its training efforts, an amount of US$330,000
has been included in the proposed Credit for training. The amount is intended
to provide short-term management and technical training abroad for about 20
Malawian managers and technicians employed by ESCOM. ESCOM will continue to
finance the remaining parts of its training program from its revenues.
5.13      ESCOM recruits its technicians from the National Apprenticeship
Scheme and trains them by sending them to the local polytechnic for one year
followed by a three year apprenticeship. This program appears to have been
successful. In addition, to improve employee job performance, ESCOM conducts
a number of weekly classes on practical topics and also provides refresher
courses.
Accounting and Auditing
5.14      ESCOM's accounting records are well maintained and financial
reports are prepared promptly. Budgeted performance seems to be ade-
quately monitored and billing and collections are good. Inventory levels
are satisfactory.
5.15      ESCOM's audit is conducted by the international firm, Deloitte
and Company, and the arrangement is satisfactory. ESCOMI would contnl__e
have its annual accounts audited by independent accountants               e
Bank.
Risks
5.16      No major risks to the success of the project are foreseen.

VI. FINANCE
6.01      ESCOM's earnings over the last few years have been good and it is
expected that this will continue during the project construction period and
subsequently. ESCOM's actual and projected financial statements, consisting
of income statements, cash flow projections and balance sheets, are given
in Annexes 14, 15, and 16, respectively. The notes and assumptions for the
financial statements are in Annex 17, and a statement of loans outstanding
at December 31, 1975 and a debt statement are presented in Annex 18.
Past Earnings and Financial Position
6.02      The following 1970-1975 operating summary shows a good financial
performance by ESCOM.  During the five-year period, kilowatt hours of elec-
tricity sold increased by 93%, revenues by 114% and net income by 126%.

but before interest) 1.26    1.32    1.51    1.63    1.71    2.85
6+03      The rate of return orn average net fixed assets valued at historical
cost was at a high of 14% in 1972, declining temporarily below the present
covenanted level of 10% to 8% in 1974 when the Tedzani Falls Hydroelectric
scheme was added to the asset base, and then increasing to 13.6% in 1975.
Between 1970 and 1975 net fixed assets in operation, expressed in historic
costs, increased 2.3 times from MK 9.7 million in 1970 to MK 22.0 million in
1975. It is estimated that during the same period, ESCOM financed 23% of
capital expenditures, including interest during construction, from internal
cash generation. Considering the high level of capital expenditures during
this period, this is considered satisfactory.
6.04      ESCOM's debt/equity ratio improved from 85/15 at the end of 1970
to 76/24 at the end of 1975 as a consequence of a good level of net income
during this period. Despite this, however, ESCOM's cash position has been
tight because internal cash generation has been absorbed by increasing levels
of capital expenditure.
Tariffs
6.05      ESCOM introduced a tariff increase on January 1, 1975, which raised
average revenues by 12% and brought the average revenue per kilowatt hour sold



- 15 -
to MK 0.026 (US$0.029) and a further tariff increase on September 1, 1976
which is estimated to increase average revenues by about 20% to MK 0.031
(US$0.034) per kilowatt hour sold. To help improve ESCOM's financial via-
bility (see para. 6.12) ESCOM will make a further 30% tariff increase by
January 1, 1978 which should increase average revenues to MK 0.040 (US$0.044) 1/
per kilowatt hour sold. To provide for ESCOM's estimated cash requirements
during the construction period, ESCOM will adjust its tariff to provide an
annual rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets of not less than
12% during 1978 and 1979; and an 8% rate of return thereafter. In the finan-
cial projections it has been estimated that 10% tariff increase would be
required on January 1, 1979 and a further 10% increase on January 1, 1981.
ESCOM will review its tariff structure and consult with the Bank about struc-
tural changes before introducing any changes in its electricity rates.
6.06      For the purpose of measuring ESCOM's rate of return on net fixed
assets, these assets would be revalued at December 31, 1975 at a gross value
of MK 45.01 million less accumulated depreciation of MK 11.8 million. The
revaluation was estimated using the United Kingdom Manufacturers Export
Index, with some modifications. Although a better method of revaluing assets
should be established in future, the initial revaluation at December 31, 1975
is acceptable as existing assets would be relatively small compared to assets
to be placed in operation between 1976 and 1980. ESCOM will revalue its
fixed assets annually in accordance with methods acceptable to the Bank and,
after consultation with Government is expected to submit a proposal shortly.
In the financial projections an assumed annual 8-1/2% revaluation of fixed
assets has been made between 1976 and 1981, the year after the Nkula Falls II
Hydroelectric Project becomes operational.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.07      The Nkula Falls II Hydroelectric Project, estimated to cost MK 71
million (US$78 million), including interest during construction, would
represent about 66% of ESCOM's estimated total capital expenditure program
of MK 107.1 million (US$117.8 million) between 1976 and 1981. Under the
financing plan for this period summarized below, ESCOM would finance 30%
of capital expenditures and additions to working capital from internal cash
generation with the remaining finance coming substantially from loans.
1/   This would bring ESCOM's tariffs into the middle range for Eastern
African countries.

6.08      In the financing plan it has been assumed that the proceeds of the
proposed IBRD Loan of MK 8.2 million (US$9 million) would be made to ESCOM
over 20 years, including a 4-1/2-year grace period, at an 8-1/2% interest.
The actual interest rate would be that prevailing at the time the project is
presented to the Board, but an adjustment to this rate will not materially
effect the financing plan. Government intends to make the proceeds of the
Third Window Loans and IDA Credits available to ESCOM at the same interest
rate as the standard Bank Loan, with interest during the construction period
being added to the onlending and, repayments being made to Government over
20 years commencing 1981. It has been assumed in the financial projections
that FED, Federal Republic of Germany and AfDB funds would be made available
to ESCOM on similar terms to IDA and Third Window finance. 1/
6.09      The CDC loan would be for a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace
period, and at an 8-1/2% interest rate.
6.10      During the construction of the Nkula Falls II Hydroelectric Project,
ESCOM is expected to construct between 1978 and 1980 the second stage of a
transmission line from Nkula Falls II to Chinteche at an estimated cost
of MK 9 million (US$9.9 million), including interest during construction
(para. 2.11). It has been assumed that about 80% of this cost would be
provided from a loan, at an 8-1/2% interest rate repayable over 20 years
commencing 1981. The source of finance has yet to be arranged.
6.11      In view of this and other planned capital expenditures occurring
concurrently with the Nkula Falls II Hydroelectric Project, in order to
ensure that adequate finance is available for the proposed expenditures,
ESCOM will not undertake capital expenditures of more than US$1.5 million
(MK 1.36 million), other than the proposed project, until project completion
in any financial year without the Bank's agreement.
6.12      Delays in introducing tariff increases and mobilizing additional
finance for the first part of the Nkula Falls - Chinteche transmission line
(which would extend from Nkula Falls to Lilongwe), which is estimated to
cost MK 7.8 million (US$8.7 million), of which MK 4.9 million (US$5.4 mil-
lion) is being provided by AfDB will leave ESCOM facing an estimated MK 3.6
1/   Since the financial projections were completed it has been learned
that FED funds would be provided directly to ESCOM over 40 years includ-
ing a 10-year grace period, at a 1% interest rate. AfDB funds are to be
provided to Government over 15 years, including a 5-year grace period
at an 8% interest rate. We have just been advised that AfDB is prepared
to make a lona of up to US$6 million equivalent (5 million Units of
Account). Regarding the Federal Republic of Germany finance, we have
just learned that KfW, following a recent appraisal, is expected to
recommend to the Government a loan of up to DM 12 million (US$5 million
equivalent) which would probably be made available to Malawi on soft
terms. The loan would probably be made available by the Malawi Government to
ESCOM at an 8-1/2% interest rate, over 25 years, including a 4-1/2
year grace period.

million (US$3.96 million) cash deficit in 1977 despite good earnings from
operations. As a condition of effectiveness, ESCOM would make arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank to provide such funds. It is expected that part
of the estimated fund requirements would come from the continuance of ESCOM's
present overdraft facilities of MK 1.25 million (US$1.37 million). In the
financial projections it has been assumed that ESCOM would borrow MK 2.4 mil-
lion (US$2.64 million) in 1977 to be repaid in 1978. ESCOM has already
borrowed MK 1 million (US$1.1 million) from Indebank in 1977 to be repaid
in 1978.
Future Operating Results and Financial Position
6.13      The following summary illustrates ESCOM's projected growth and
financial performance between 1977 and 1983 under the financial plan. In
addition to a good financial operating performance ESCOM's liquid position
should improve considerably.

6.14      ESCOM will not incur debt, without prior Bank approval, unless future
debt service is covered at least 1.5 times by internal cash generation.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) that ESCOM will consult with the Bank regarding any proposed
appointments to the positions of General Manager, Chief
Engineer, Secretary and Financial Controller (para. 5.09);
(b) that ESCOM will maintain its tariffs at a level which will
yield at least 12% on its average revalued net fixed assets
in 1978 and 1979 and 8% thereafter (para. 6.05); and
(c) that ESCOM will not undertake annual capital expenditures,
other than the proposed projects of more than US$1.5 million
without the Bank agreement (para. 6.11).



- 19 -
7.6,2     Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Bank Group finance are
(a)  all conditions of effectiveness of the AfDB, CDC and FED
financial agreements have been fulfilled (para. 3.09); and
(b)  ESCOM has made satisfactory arrangements to provide an
MK 3.6 million (US$4 million) finance for its estimated
1977 requirements (para. 6.12).
7.03      Subject to the foregoing, the project is suitable for Bank Group
finance of US$25 million equivalent.

NKULA FALLS II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Existing Power Facilities of ESCOM
1.        Most of the electricity generated by ESCOM is supplied to Malawi's
Southern Region, which includes Blantyre, the country's largest city, and
Zomba, the old capital, through the interconnected system. Part of the
Central Region, including Lilongwe, the capital city, is also supplied through
this system. This system accounts for 98% of the company's installed gene-
rating capacity of 95 MW, 97% of Jis about 16,000 electricity consumers, and
about 99% of its total 1975 sales of 237 GWh. These figures reflect the con-
centration of urban population and general economic activity in the Southern
Region. The location of interconnected power system is shown on the map
attached to the report. Other population centers with some economic activity
include Mzuzu and Salima which have installed thermal capacity of 1.1 MW.
2.        Hydroelectric power plant owned by ESCOM has a total capacity of
40.6 MW, consisting of 24 MW at Nkula Falls, 16 MW at Tedzani and about 600
kW at Zomba. All these stations are on the Shire River and feed into the
interconnected system. The small Zomba Station was completed in 1954,
Nkula I in 1967 and Tedzani I in 1973, and Tedzani II (24 MW) has recently
been put into service (March 1977).
3.        The remaining 30.2 MW capacity owned by ESCOM is provided by steam
units, diesel generating sets and a gas turbine at Blantyre, Lilongwe, Zomba,
Mzuzu and Salima. These units vary in size from 60 kW to 14,000 kW. The
installed plant capacity, at the end March 1977 is shown at the end of this
Annex.
4.        Most of the system is interconnected by means of about 520 km of
66-kV primary and about 560 km of 33 kV secondary transmission lines. For
distribution networks 11 kV and 33 kV are used. In spite of long transmission
distances and high incidence of lightning, the reliability of supply is well
maintained through good maintenance practices. Transmission and distribution
losses expressed as a percentage of units generated together total 91 which
is satisfactory.
5.         ESCOM's principal transmission system is shown on the map attached
to the report and statistical data on ESCOM's power system is given in
Annex 1.
6.        The following is a list at ESCOM's plant and installed c2parity at
the end March 1977.

NKULA FALLS II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Description of the Nkula Falls II Hydroelectric Project
1.        That stretch of the Shire River between Kholombidza and Kapachire
Falls some 130 and 210 km, respectively below Lake Malawi, is known as the
Middle Shire. Liwonde Barrage, completed in 1965, lies approximately 80
km below the lake. In the 80 km of the Middle Shire, the river potential
has been estimated at about about 500 MW. The first development provided 24
MW generating capacity at Nkula Falls (Nkula I), and the second development
(Tedzani I) provided a further 16 MW at Tedzani Falls, 8 km downstream of the
Nkula Scheme. Construction of the second stage of the development of Tedzani
Falls (Tedzani II) has essentially been completed. By the construction of
Tedzani II, the installed capacity at Tedzani Falls has effectively been
increased to 40 MW.
Toprhy
2.        The topography in the vicinity of the project is rugged with steep
valley side slopes and tributaries and little flood plain area all of which
contribute to sharp rises in the river during thunder storms and heavy silt
loads. General planning was based on several surveys culminating in 1965 in
a 1:20,000 scale aerial survey by Hunting Surveys, Ltd. The same company has
completed maps for Tedzani and Nkula dam sites and reservoir areas to a scale
of 1:1,000 with contour intervals for I m to 3 m depending on steepness of
slopes.
Geology
3.        The site geology was explored by 20 borings in 1974-75 and after a
hydraulic model test suggested a relocation of the dam, and at the suggestion
of a Bank appraisal mission, four more borings were made. These explorations
together with those made for Tedzani are adequatie. The rock is a gneiss, i.e.
foliated or laminated, and in various places may be described as granitic,
biotite or hornblende biotite. Cracking or jointing is often encountered at
depth and weathering is often deep.
4.        In view of the low height of the dam, there is little question as to
the adequacy of the foundation rock. Drilling tests reveal that foundation
problems are unlikely.
Hydrology
5.        The hydrology of Lake Malawi and the estimation of the outflow
from the lake into its single drain, the Shire River, has been thoroughly
investigated in the past and is the subject of a number of studies. These
studies show that the lake can be regulated to provide a continuous minimum



ANNEX 3
Pag^ 2
flow of 170 m Is with a one year in 80 chance of failure. In addition to the
lake outflow, there is significant seasonal augumentation of the Shire River
flows by the tributaries entering below the Liwonde Barrage. The average flow
at Nkula Falls is 255 m Is and the maximum 700 m /s to 850 m /s.
6.        The outflow of Lake Malawi which will be the source of most of the
water to be used by hydro plant is partially controlled by the Liwonde
Barrage, comprising a sill at river bed level and 14 tainter gates 9.15 m
long by 6.70 m high with 0.61 m high flash-boards atop each gate.  Partial
control only is achieved by the dam because at low lake levels or very large
flows channel control will develop between the dam and the lake. Low lake
levels are possible because the difference in average inflow to the lake
and evaporation is small considering the size of the lake. The converse is
also true if inflows are unusually large. Present Malawi policy is to main-
tain a lake level at elevation 473.5 m and avoid levels higher than 474.8 m,
the highest level reached in 1964 before the dam was in operation. Tanzania
which forms part of the lake shoreline with Malawi and Mozambique is said to
be in agreement with these policies but Malawi has 3conducted studies which
considered minimum lake outflows higher than 170 m Is. 3These considerations
would involve higher lake levels. For instance a 230 m /s minimum flow would
mean lake levels up to 475.9 m. Although no damage estimates have been made
for lake levels above 474.8 m, it is the consultants judgement that Malawi
would suffer as much or more than the other shoreline countries, Mozambique
and Tanzania. Therefore, it is unlikely that Malawi in its own interest would
allow lake levels to go too high.
Silt
7.        The Shire carries a silt load which sometimes exceeds 2,000 parts
per million. It is of a nature which is highly erosive to turbine runners
requiring replacement and repair sometimes in less than one year; despite
the most arduous efforts to flush the silt downstream, it will probably
reduce the small volumes of storage available to the Shire projects which
is valuable for daily regulation. Tedzani I Project included a siltation
chamber in the water ways as a solution to this problem, but it proved to be
a dismal failure. A spare turbine runner is included in the cost estimates
to replace damaged runners during maintenance period.
Description of Main Components
1.        Dam:  The Nkula II development is primarily based on a single
pressure aqueduct from an intake structure at the new dam to a surge chamber
on the hillside immediately behind the new powerhouse. A site for the latter
has been chosen only a short distance upstream from the existing Nkula I
station.  Height and length of the earth-rockfill dam will be 7 m and about
700 m, respectively. The dam includes two concrete spillway constructions
containing the steel radial gates and a gated intake between the two
spillways.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
2.        Headrace Tunnel:  The upstream length, adjoining the intake, con-
sists of a reinforced concrete conduit arranged in two rectangular compart-
ments. The conduit, roughly 5.2 m x 10.4 m in effective cross-section is to
be constructed just below the level of the river bed over a total length of
about 280 m. This section will be followed by a large tunnel of 8.25 m
equivalent diameter, and as the rock through which it passes is of variable
quality, it is to be lined with concrete for its full length. The tunnel
extends over a length of 960 m from the portal to the surge chamber at the
downstream end.
3.        Surge Chamber and Shaft:  The reinforced concrete surge chamber is
located in high ground at a suitable distance from the powerhouse. It is
approximately 20.6 m in diameter and 32.2 m high from the floor to the top.
A vertical surge shaft, also concrete lined, connects the floor of the surge
chamber to the upstream end of the penstock tunnel situated some 26.0 m
beneath the floor.
4.        Penstock:  Downstream of the surge shaft, the tunnel section changes
over a short transition to the circular steel lined penstock tunnel of 5.5 m
diameter leading to a manifold behind the powerhouse. Manifold consists of
five valved outlets, one for each hydro unit.
5.        Powerhouse and Tailrace Outfall:  The building to house the five
turbo generators (ultimate development) consists essentially of a water-tight
substructure up to a level of 326 m, with a reinforced concrete and struc-
tural steel frame building above. All of the substructure wall will be
constructed in the first stage of deveploment, leaving open cells in which
to place successive turbines after the first two (first phase) have been
completed. These cells, left open to the river, can be pumped out when
required by installing the tailrace gate to enable the draft tube, spiral
casing, etc., to be installed and encased in concrete.
6.        Mechanical and Electrical Plant:  The plant design provides for
the installation of five turbine generator units each of 18 MW output, the
turbines being supplied by a manifold type penstock from a single pressure
tunnel and surge control shaft, described above. Each penstock branch will
be provided with a turbine control valve of the butterfly type. The first
stage of construction would include two machines. The draft tube outlets
of each turbine will be capable of closure, for maintenance access to the
turbines and draft tubes, by twin rectangular leaf gates, each 5.5 m wide
and 3.0 m high.  The generating sets will be of the vertical type with
Francis turbines developing 24,100 h.p. at a design net head for rated out-
put of 50.9 m. A suitable synchronous speed would be 250 rpm. At rate head
and full output, the turbine discharge will be 40 m |s. Generators will be
of the vertical semi-umbrella design with a rating of 18 NW or 20 MVA at 0.90
lagging power factor. Stators will be wound for 11 kV, 3-Phase.

ANNEX 10

NKULA FALLS II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Comparison of the Project with Alternatives
Selected Alternative Development Programs
1.        This Annex discusses the four cheapest alternatives among the 80
different possible development strategies that the consultants analyzed be-
fore making their recommendations. Details of these studies are shown in
the consultants project report. 1/
2.        Selection of the next step of expanding ESCOM's generating capacity
involved the economic analysis of different possible development strategies
which would satisfy the increasing demand in the interconnected power system
over the planning period. The cost streams of these various strategies have
been compared, and the development program which includes the construction of
Nkula Falls II Hydroelectric Project as the first step proves to be the most
economic alternative. This program provides for the commissioning of Nkula
Dam in 1980, with two hydro units of 18 MW each at the proposed Nkula II Power
Station (Alternative 1). The total cost of the program includes operation
and maintenance. This program is characterized by high expenditures during
the first years of planning period, due to the construction costs of the
Nkula Dam, a power station adequate for 5 units 18 MW each and low expen-
ditures after the construction of the project because of very limited run-
ning costs (no fuel cost). The total cost of the program also includes
the cost of the gas turbines and their related running costs which would be
required to satisfy the system demand over the entire life of the proposed
project.
3.        The main alternative program for the development of the inter-
connected system would commence with two diesel sets of 10 MW each, one to
be installed in 1980 and the second 1981 together with Nkula II first and
second units (18 MW each) postponed by about two years until 1981. This
program (Alternative 2) would have low expenditures during the first years of
the planning period, but high expenditures in the running costs to cover the
system energy requirement in 1980 and 1981.
4.        A third alternative is for the construction of coal based steam
units to be followed later by hydro developments (Alternative 3) and a fourth
alternative is an exclusively hydro development.
1/   The report, issued in May 1975, is entitled "Project Report for Nkula
Falls Hydroelectric Scheme Stage II" and was prepared by three British
consulting firms: Kennedy and Donkin; Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold &
Uhlmann; Coopers & Lybrand Associates Ltd.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
Other Possible Alternatives
5.        Other thermal-hydro blend alternatives (by changing the commission-
ing years of possible thermal and hydro plants and number of units) have also
been considered but that these alternatives are equivalent to Alternatives 2,
3 or 4 and have a higher present value than Alternative 1 for discount rate of
4% to 21%.
Method of Comparison
6.        The alternative plans have been extended over the period of 40 years
to attain a common facility point and also to reach a point of insignificance
for the present worth factor.
7.        Equalizing Discounted Rates (EDR) among the basic streams of the
selected alternatives (see construction schedule on page 4 of this Annex),
are as follows:
-    Alternative I would be cheaper than Alternative 2
at discount rates of less than 24%; and
-    Alternative 1 would be cheaper than Alternatives 3
and 4 at discount rates of less than 25%.
8.        The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rates to changes in the
major variables (capital costs, operating costs, load growth) was tested as
follows:
Capital Cost
9.        It was considered unlikely that the mission's capital cost estimates
for hydro and thermal schemes would be exceeded, since the cost estimates
revised on the bases of contractor's offers for the civil works, and adequate
allowances for possible additional works and contingencies (20% for civil
works and 10% for equipment) have been included in the cost estimates. The
effects of up to 15% increases in electrical/mechanical equipment costs except
for gates and screens) would be as follows:
-    Alternative 1 would be cheaper than Alternative 2 at discount
rates lower than 12%; and
-    Alternative 1 would be cheaper than Alternatives 3 and 4 at
discount rates lower than 22% and 24%, respectively.
Load Growth
10.       The growth of demand has been projected on the basis of a detailed
analysis of future electricity consumption of large industrial consumers and
on the correlation between demand of the remaining consumers and the expected



ANNEX 10
Page 3
development of Malawi's economy. If the expectation of economic growth in
Malawi is too optimistic, then the load growth could be lower than projected.
A lower load growth would lead to a reduction in fuel consumption and conse-
quently in the total present value of Alternatives 2 and 3. A reduction in
load growth by 15% would reduce the EDR's as follows:
-    Alternative 1 would be cheaper than Alternative 2
at discount rates lower than 22%; and
-    Alternative 1 would be cheaper than Alternatives 3
and 4 at discount rates lower than 21% and 23%,
respectively.

Return on Investment
1.        Rate of return on investment is defined as the discount rate at
which the present worth of estimated capital and operating costs equal the
present worth of attributable revenues over the life of the capital expendi-
tures referred to in paragraph 3.
2.        The project has a 90-MW plant capacity of which 36 MW will be
included in the project to be followed by a further 54 MW in 1980s. Rate of
return calculations for the complete development and for the project only are
shown in pages 3 and 4 of this Annex.
(a) Rate of Return on 90-MW Development
Using estimated incremental revenues based on revenue per kilowatt
hour yielded by the September 1976 tariff increase as project benefits gives
a rate of return of 11.5%. If the development costs increased by 30%, the
rate of return would be 9.5%.
(b) Rate of Return on Project Alone
The rate of return on the project alone would be 9% using the
average revenue per kilowatt hour yielded by the September 1976 tariff
increase as a measure of benefits.
3.        Capital expenditures consist of:
(a) Nkula Falls II Hydroelectric Project expenditures and
specifically the Nkula Falls II Dam, headrace tunnel,
powerhouse, two 18-MW hydro units and associated works;
(b) the addition of 54 MW to generating capacity;
(c) generator renewals (assumed after 30 years of operation);
and
(d) transmission and distribution extensions associated with
the additions to generating capacity.
4.        Incremental sales would first start in 1980 and rise to a maximum
of 640 GWh in 1992. It is estimated that sales growth would accelerate from
the previous average growth rate of 16% and 20%, respectively, in 1980 and



ANNEX 11
Page 2
1981 with the commissioning of the Chinteche industrial complex, 1/ after
which annual growth has been assumed to continue at 8%.
5.        The rate of return calculations have been taken over a period of
50 years, the estimated life of the civil engineering components of the
project.
1/   If the Chinteche complex was delayed or cancelled, the additional 54
MW would be added at a somewhat later date and used to supply growth in
the South and Central Regions. The project rate of return for the
complete development would be effected by less than 1% if the entire
Chinteche scheme was cancelled.

ANNEX 13

NKULA FALLS II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Project Monitoring Guidelines
There are a number of areas described in this Annex which are key
factors in the efficient operation of the utility and the success of the
project. These have been discussed with the Borrower and the Consultant
and further discussions will be held during negotiations to determine firm
targets for these key factors against which actual progress will be monitored.
Main areas for establishing a monitoring system are described below:
1.   Construction of Project
1.1       Actual construction progress should be compared monthly with
planned targets. Some important target dates are shown below:
- Invitation to bid for the main civil
works                                     September 1, 1976
-  Tender period                               September 8 - December 8, 1976
-  Report on tenders                           February 7, 1977
-  Contract award                              April 7, 1977
-  Construction of coffer dam                  June 30, 1977
- Construction of the main dam and
embankment closure                        August 31, 1980
- Construction of power station and
tailrace outlets                          June 1, 1980
-  Commissioning of units # 1                  September 1, 1980 and
# 2                December 1, 1980
2.   Staffing
2.1       Existing staffing level of ESCOM is about 1,200. 1/  This seems to
be an unduly high staff level, even bearing in mind the diversification of
generating units, the amount of construction carried out by the Commission's
staff and the distances involved. It is expected that this number should
1/   Nevertheless, ESCOM's ratio of about 12 customers per employee is about

not be exceeded during the next five years. Where staffing levels are
excessive, efforts should be made to reduce staff through limitation on
recruitment, early retirement, etc.
3.   Training
3.1       Personnel under training in the country and abroad should be moni-
tored on an annual basis against the targets set under the following headings,
to meet normal wastage and turnover requirements:
(a) Graduate Engineers in university (by classification);
(b) Technicians in training (by classification);
(c) Craftsmen in training (by classification); and
(d) Others (by number).
4.   System Operations
4.1       Implementation of the new tariff, based on the recommendations of
the tariff study required under the Second Power Project, and the installa-
tion of new meters (peak, off-peak measurements system for large industrial
customers) as compared to an agreed schedule for achieving accurate measure-
ments of "peak" and "off-peak" consumption.
4.2       Records should be maintained, showing against the targets which
have been set:
(a) Hydro production (in kWh);
(b) Diesel production (in kWh);
(c) Steam production (in kWh);
(d) Gas-Turbine production (in kWh);
(e) Power consumptions (by classification);
(f) Consumption of power plants (in kWh);
(g) Average tariff level (in T per kWh);
(h)  Number of connections (by classification); and
(i) System losses (by operation voltages).

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
Notes and Assumptions to Financial Projections
1.        The financial projections were reviewed in detail with ESCOM during
negotiations and substantially revised taking into account especially the
latest information on estimated capital expenditures and related loans.
Revenues and Expenses
2.        Annex 7 gives a detailed breakdown of projected kWh sales.  It has
been assumed that a 30% tariff increase will be introduced on January 1, 1978,
a 10% tariff increase on January 1, 1979, and a 10% increase on January
1, 1981.
3.        1976 expenses are based on ESCOM's latest figures of historical
expenses. Operating, maintenance, administration and general expenses have
been projected to increase annually by 8% per annum. To this has been added
a further 8% per annum from 1977 to 1981 to provide for estimated inflation
during the project construction period.
Balance Sheet
4.        ESCOM's fixed assets were revalued at December 31, 1975 at a gross
value of MK 45.01 million less accumulated depreciation MK 11X80 million.
Estimated annual asset revaluations have been made thereafter at 8-1/2% per
annum until 1981. Depreciation is at a rate of 3.5% on average gross fixed
assets in operation. The Nkula Falis II Hydroelectric Project is first
taken into gross fixed assets in operation in 1980, the Tedzani Falls II
Project in 1977 and the Nkula Falls-Lilongwe transmission line in 1978.
Receivables - Consumers
5.        These are estimated at 12% of annual revenues (about 44 days sales),
Although receivables have recently exceeded this level because of extraor-
dinary billing adjustments, it is expected that they will subsequently drop to
this proportion.
Receivables - Others
6.        These include amounts owing for capital works, advance payments and
other miscellaneous items. Increases of MK 50,000 bi-annually have been made
to estimated amount outstanding at December 31, 1977.



ANNEX 17

Work in Progress
7.        Additions to work in progress are based on estimated total annual
cash disbursements.
Inventories
8.        Inventory levels are somewhat high, but possible delivery delays
have to be provided for. Additions are based on ESCOM's estimated require-
ments.
Payables
9.        These have been assumed to increase by 18% per year from 1976 to
1981 and 8% thereafter in line with operating expenses.
Source and Application of Funds
10.       The terms of Nkula II Project loans were reviewed with Government
and ESCOM during negotiations and are expected to be as follows:
(a)  The MK 8.18 million (US$9 million) IBRD loan would be for
a 20 year term with a 4-1/2 year grace period with the
first principal repayment being on June 1, 1982. The
assumed interest rate is 8-1/2%.
(b) The CDC loan would be in sterling for the equivalent of
MK 12.5 million (US$13.75 million with a maximum of E 8.5
million) and would be made directly to ESCOM at an interest rate
of 8-1/2% with semi-annual level principal repayments commencing
1982.
(c) Other Project loans, as follows, are assumed to be made
available by Government to ESCOM at an 8-1/2% interest
rate with interest added to the loans during the construc-
tion period and combined level 20-year principal and
interest payments commencing 1981.

ANNEX 17
Page 3
11.       It has been estimated that ESCOM would have a MK 2.4 million financ-
ing gap in 1977 and it has been assumed that this amount would be borrowed at
10% interest and repaid in 1978. ESCOM has already obtained a one year 10%
loan from Indebank, which will be repaid in 1978.
12.       ESCOM has overdraft facilities with the National Bank of Malawi up
to MK 1.25 million.
Capital Expenditures
13.       In addition to the Nkula II Hydroelectric Project, during the
period covered by the financial projections, ESCOM plans to construct in two
stages a 541-km, 132-kV transmission line between Nkula Falls and Chinteche.
(a) First Stage
Nkula-Salima-Lilongwe Transmission Line
The Nkula-Salima-Lilongwe transmission line has been estimated to
cost MK 7.1 million (US$7.8 million) and to be completed about the end of
1978. Construction started in 1976.
(B) Second Stage
Salima-Chinteche Transmission Line
It has been assumed that the transmission line would be built be-
tween 1978 and 1980 at a cost of MK 8.2 million (US$9.0 million). This is
based on ESCOM's consultants estimates adjusted for price increases. The
justification for the transmission line is related to the proposed pulp mill
and associated township at Chinteche.
General Development Program
14.       This represents estimated expenditures to be financed from ESCOM's
internal cash generation and includes generation, transmission and distribu-
tion system developments, transformers, meters, substations, office furniture
and equipment.
