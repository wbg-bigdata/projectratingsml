REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT AND PROPOSED LOANS FOR A THIRD POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi for the equivalent of US$8.0 million on
standard IDA terms and two proposed loans for the equivalent of US$9.0 mil-
lion and US$8.0 million, respectively, to help finance a Third Power Project.
The US$9.0 million loan would be made to the Electricity Supply Commission
of Malawi for a term of twenty years including four and a half years of
grace and would bear an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum; it would
be guaranteed by the Republic of Malawi. The US$8.0 million loan would be
made to the Republic of Malawi on standard Third Window terms with the first
payment due on January 15, 1983 and the last payment on January 15, 2001. The
proceeds of the proposed credit and Third Window loan would be relent to the
Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi for a term of twenty five years,
including a period of four and a half years of grace, at an interest rate of
8.5 percent per annum. The African Development Bank, the Commonwealth Develop-
ment Corporation, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Fonds Europeen de
Developpement are expected to participate in the financing of the proposed
project in an aggregate amount of up to about US$34 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Development and Prospects of
Malawi" (Report No. 560a-MAI) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on January 14, 1975. An updating economic mission visited Malawi in November/
December 1975. Its report is expected to be issued in May. A summary of the
mission's findings is set out below. Country data sheets are provided in
Annex I.
3.        At Independence in 1964, Malawi was the poorest of the three terri-
tories of the former Central African F~deration. With a population of about
5 million and a land area of 93,000 km , its population density is among the
highest of African countries. Its main assets are moderately fertile soils,
good water resources and a climate favorable to crop production. Unlike its
neighbors, Malawi has no substantial mineral resources. Forests constitute
the main, essentially untapped, resource which could be exploited on a signi-
ficant scale in the future. At Independence, the tax base was very narrow,
government revenues had to be supplemented with British budgetary aid to
support the administration, and prospects for economic development were
generally regarded as bleak.
4.        Measured against the country's natural endowments, progress since
1964 has been remarkable. Between 1964 and 1975, GDP at constant prices grew
at an average annual rate of 7.5 percent, domestic investment and savings

increased rapidly, and government finances have improved sufficiently to
eliminate the need for budgetary aid. Agriculture, which dominates the
economy and contributed 45 percent of GDP in 1975, has been directed towards
export markets by encouraging cash crop estates production and integrated
rural development schemes. Diversification has also been promoted. In
addition, rapid industrial development (the share of industry rose from 9
percent of GDP in 1964 to 14 percent in 1975) has significantly broadened the
economic base. Despite this economic improvement, however, Malawi still has
a GNP per capita of only   Us$150 and is listed bv the Tnijtprl NStionns qTnx the
world's poorest countries.
5.        Malawi's success has been the result of realistic and purposeful
planning by the Government. In 1971, a Statement of Development Policies
(DEVPOL) was published, which provides a general framework within which the
Government operates a three-year rolling plan. DEVPOL contains guidelines
for major economic indicators up to 1980 and states the main socio-economic
objectives, among which are: (a) to raise living standards and productivity
in rural areas; (b) to achieve an average annual growth of GDP of 8 percent
through the parallel development of smallholder output, estate agriculture
and industry; (c) to promote a more balanced regional development; and (d)
to develop local initiatives and a gradual increase of local participation
in the economy.
6.        DEVPOL recognizes the important role of private investment in de-
velopment which, it is anticipated, will account for about half of total
fixed capital formation over the 1971-1980 period. The Government also
recognizes the role of a healthy private sector in generating foreign exchange
and savings needed to sustain other elements of the development strategy and
has adopted policies which are intended to attract foreign investors and to
ensure a continued high growth of the private sector. Trade and payments
policies are liberal, profits moderately taxed and wages are held down to
favor labor-intensive estates and industries. The modern private sector
has been the leader in economic growth. The output of estate agriculture
increased by 10 percent a year in real terms over the past decade and indus-
trial production rose by 13 percent annually.
7.        Within the public sector investment program, agriculture will re-
ceive 19 percent, public utilities 17 percent, and social services 15 per-
cent. Government investment in transport infrastructure will be reduced
from 37 percent in the late 1960s to less than 30 percent of total public
investment. Malawi has an effective administration which has been remarkably
successful in preparing and implementing development projects.
8.        Firm information on which reliable estimates of income distribution
could be based dates back to 1969. At that time, income distribution was
relatively favorable. The poorest 40 percent of households received 15 per-
cent of incomes; the highest 20 percent received 53 percent and the highest
5 percent received 30 percent. These figures compared well with those of
other developing countries. Since then, the rapid development of the
modern private sector has probably led to a greater concentration of
incomes.



9.        To offset the adverse distributional effect of the growth of the
modern private sector, the Government has directed its agricultural investment
program towards the smallholders.    It is true, however, that for a long time
agricultural producer prices have been kept at a level which was low as
compared to international levels, and which was probably also too low to
provide a sufficient incentive to higher production. Only recently has the
Government recognized the importance of sufficiently remunerative producer
prices, and it has increased them substantially. Indirectly, wage and price
policies have reduced the gap between wage earners and subsistence farmers.
Over the past seven years, real wages have fallen somewhat, while the real
earnings of smallholders have risen. Keeping a firm check on wage increases
has also had a beneficial effect on wage employment. Total wage employment
has increased by 10 percent a year on the average. About 20 percent of
Malawi's labor force is now engaged in wage employment as compared to 12 per-
cent in 1968.
10.       Owing to its fast rate of population increase, estimated at 2.6
percent annually, population pressure is heavy in relation to arable land.
While recognizing the existence of this problem, the Government has been
reluctant to introduce population control policies and intends to rely
instead on balanced regional development, particularly in the southern region,
traditionally the most densely populated. In mid-1975, Malawi's urban popula-
tion represented only 10 percent of the total population. However, because of
the diversification of the economy, urban population is rapidly increasing by
more than 10 percent per annum, in line with the expansion of wage employment
opportunities in the non-agricultural sectors. The construction of the new
capital city at Lilongwe has also contributed to spreading more evenly the
newly urbanized population among the different cities. Nevertheless, this
fast urban growth, coupled with Government's higher priority for rural dev-
elopment and infrastructure in the use of public funds, has caused urban
infrastructure to somewhat lag behind the needs of the city dwellers.
11.       Since almost 90 percent of the population live in rural areas, rural
development is a primary social and economic objective. At the moment, the
majority of farmers are smallholders on the fringe of the market economy.
Their staple crop is almost exclusively maize and their principal cash crops
are tobacco and groundnuts. Until now, the principal instrument for increas-
ing smallholder productivity has been relatively intensive integrated devel-
opment projects in specific areas, which at the moment reach about 25 percent
of the rural population.
12.       In spite of the Government's efforts, however, the production from
the traditional agricultural sector has lagged behind that of the estate
sector. Although firm figures are lacking, indications are that the produc-
tion from the traditional sector has not increased by much more than 3 per-
cent a year over the past decade. The Government is concerned about this



- 4 -
relatively slow growth and is preparing a country-wide approach to rural
development, which would be a departure from the previous approach in that
it would primarily concentrate on the provision of farm inputs and exten-
sion services. This new approach - the National Rural Development Program -
is to become the Government's chief vehicle for smallholder development.
13.       In the past, the generation and use of domestic resources have been
good. Investments grew from 8 percent of GDP in 1964 to 27 percent in 1974.
Domestic savings, which were virtually nil in 1964, financed 42 percent of
total investment in 1975. The Government's budget has been skillfully man-
aged in order to put government finances on a firmer footing. From 1964 to
1974/75, recurrent revenues grew by 14 percent a year on the average, while
the increase in recurrent expenditures was kept down to 8 percent a year.
British budgetary support - which financed MK 10 million, or about one third
of the current budget in 1964 - was gradually reduced and was eliminated
entirely in 1972/73. In 1973/74 and 1974/75, small recurrent budget sur-
pluses of MK 1.5 million and MK 5 million were achieved.    At the same time,
the Government's domestic medium-and long-term borrowing was also stepped
up from MK 0.1 million in 1964 to MK 13.5 million in 1974/75. The financial
situation of public corporations is generally healthy, and part of their
surpluses is used to finance government investments. As a result of the
factors mentioned above, the domestic contribution to the financing of
developmens expenditures, which was negative in 1964, increased to 45
percent in 1974/75.
14.       Up to 1974, Malawi's balance of payments had shown a healthy de-
velopment. During 1967-74, exports increased by about 7 percent a year in
real terms, while imports have increased by about 6 percent a year in real
terms. The terms of trade, however, have moved somewhat against Malawi.
Payments for services increased substantially but they were partly offset
by increases in workers' remittances from South Africa. The balance of pay-
ments current account deficit increased from US$18 million in 1967 to US$45
million in 1974. This deterioration, however, was more than compensated
for by increasing private and public capital inflows. As a result, official
international reserves increased from US$22.5 million at the end of 1967
to US$81.5 million (4.5 months of imports) at the end of 1974.
15.       In 1975, Malawi's balance of payments deteriorated.    The cur-
rent account deficit is estimated to have increased from US$45 million in 1974
to about US$100 million. Private and public capital inflow did not increase
correspondingly, as a result of which international reserves declined to
U'S$61 million at the end of 1975 (3 months of imports). A number of factors
have contributed to the deterioration in Malawi's balance of payments position
in 1975. While merchandise exports increased by 13 percent in real terms over
1974, imports increased by 15 percent. As a result, the trade deficit in-
creased from US$77 million in 1974 to an estimated US$115 million in 1975,
which explains most of the increase in the current account deficit in that
year.



16.       The sharp increase in the volume of imports in 1975 was, to some
extent, due to the political uncertainties in Malawi's neighboring countries,
which led Malawian importers to accelerate their imports in order to build
up precautionary stocks. Among domestic factors which may have adversely
affected the balance of payments is the large expansion of credit, which
amounted to 85 percent in 1975. Although international reserves continued
to decline in the first half of 1976 to a level of US$30 milion in June (since
then they have remained stable), the developments of the trade balance have
been much more favorable than in 1975. In the first nine months of 1976
merchandise exports were 20 percent higher than in the corresponding period
of 1975, while imports of goods were 14 percent lower, which would suggest
that the balance of payments problems are being overcome.
17.       Notwithstanding the recent balance of payments difficulties,
Malawi's longer term prospects for growth, external trade and payments are
,ood. I'ts agricultural products have generally founld ready markets par-
ticularly in the UK and more recently in the USA. Traditional outlets and
Malawi's associate membership in the EEC offer good prospects of expanded
markets for Malawi's exports. With the substantial expansion of sugar pro-
duction that is about to get under way, total exports in real terms can
realistically be expected to grow even faster in the future (more than 9
percent a year) than in the past (about 8 percent a year). However, Malawi's
terms of trade are likely to show a further deterioration of about 8 percent
over the next five years. On these assumptions, the current account deficit
is projected to increase fromu US$100 million in 1975 to some US$150 million
by 1980.
18.       With the increase in the Government's investment program, net long-
term public capital inflow also increased substantially from US$17 million
in 1967 to US$47 million in 1975. The sources of public capital inflow have
gradually been diversified.   At Independence, the UK was virtually the only
source, but by 1974  the British contribution had declined to less than 50
,, rcent. International organizations, especially IDA, provided 20 percent
,iid the remainder came from a variety of bilateral sources.  Development
grants amounted to about 25 percent of total public capital inflow. Loan
capital was generally made available on coneessionary terms.   From 1971
Lhrough 1974, total commitments of public lcaus and grants averaged US$60
nillion a year.  The average grant element of these commitments was 77 per-
:_enlt.
19.       At the end of 1975, llalawi's external public debt totaled US$322
million, of which US$239 million had been disbursed.   Debt service in 1975
amiounted to US$12.7 million, equivalent to about 6 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. At the end of 1975, IDA's share in Malawi's disbursed debt was 25.8
percent and servicing of IDA credits accounted for 3.0 percent of total debt
services. As Malawi's need for external capital is expected to grow over the
next years, the Government may encounter greater difficulty in borrowing on
terms as soft as those it has received in the past.   Debt service is likely to
Increase, but even if the average grant element of ezternal assistance declines
fromn almost 80 percent in the recent past to some 60 percent by 1980, the debt
service ratio would not increase to more tharn 10 percent by 1985.  The past



- 6 -
record of good economic management and high growth, together with continued
favorable prospects for exports and a relatively low debt service, makes
Malawi creditworthy for limited amounts of lending on conventional terms. The
external capital requirements will continue to be in excess of the foreign
exchange component of project costs and external assistance should, therefore,
normally also cover some local costs.
20.       Malawi is considered eligible for Bank lending on Third Window terms
on the basis of the following criteria:
1.   Per Capita Income
In 1975 Malawi's GNP per capita was US$150.
2.   Performance
The Government's development effort has been commendable and,
over the last 12 years, has led to an average annual growth rate of 7.5
percent. A large part of the Government's investment program is directed
towards the rural poor.
3.   Ability to Repay
Malawi, in view of its good economic management, and the present and
prospective modest debt burden, is creditworthy for limited amounts of lending
on conventional terms, although a substantial part of future borrowing should
continue to be on concessionary terms.
4.   Access to Alternative Sources of Finance
Malawi's need for external financial assistance is increasing.
It has, however, no special access to new sources of concessionary finance,
and cannot prudently afford to borrow substantial sums on commercial terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
21.       To date IDA has made thirteen development credits to Malawi amount-
ing to US$96.7 million equivalent. Six of these credits, totaling US$42.5
million, financed agricultural projects. The remaining credits were allo-
cated as follows: two credits totaling US$21.5 million for highways in
1968 and 1974; two credits totaling US$12.8 million for power projects in
1970 and 1973; two other credits amounting to US$17.9 million for education
projects in 1967 and 1975; and a US$2 million credit in 1974 to finance the
preparation of a planned pulp mill at Viphya. The first Bank loan (US$9.2
million) to Malawi was made on Third Window terms in June 1976 to help fi-
nance the Karonga Rural Development Scheme. IFC's first investment in the
country was made in February 1976 with US$6 million for a textile mill. A



- 7 -
summary statement of Bank Group operations in Malawi as of January 31, 1977,
is given in Annex II which also contains notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
22.       Bank Group operations in Malawi will continue to emphasize rural
development but importance will also be attached to infrastructure develop-
ment (power, water supply and roads) and education. In agriculture, we are
presently assisting the Government in devising a National Rural Development
Program, for which we expect to recommend Bank Group financial assistance
in FY78. Other external agencies are likely to participate in the financing
of this program. We are also considering further assistance to help con-
solidate two previously IDA-financed agriculture schemes in the Shire Valley
and IFC is presently considering assisting a sugar development scheme. A
water supply project for the city of Blantyre was appraised in May/June
1976, and is scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors in FY77.
A third highway project, which was appraised last February, is expected to
include construction of the main road from Kasungu to Champira as well as the
expansion of the district road maintenance program initiated under the Second
Highway Project. In education, a sector study to be carried out jointly by
UNESCO and the Bank is scheduled for May/June 1977 and we would expect it
to lead to further Bank Group financing. Finally, the Bank Group is also
assisting the Government in the preparation of a major pulp development
project, whose total cost has been estimated at over US$300 million equivalent.
Bank financial assistance for this project would be considered if suitable
external guarantees can be obtained.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
23.       Malawi is rich in water resources.    The falls and rapids of several
rivers offer a source of power which can be harnessed to provide electricity
at reasonable operational costs. Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in
Africa, forms a gigantic natural reservoir which discharges at its southern
end into Malawi's principal river and major source of potential power, the
Shire. Between Khalombidza Falls and Kapachira Falls, the Shire falls about
420 m in 80 km. The total power potential of this stretch of river known
as the Middle Shire has been estimated at about 500 MW.    In the central and
northern regions, some of the rivers which flow into Lake Malawi also possess
hydroelectric potential. Alternative domestic energy resources include sone
coal deposits at Livingstonia, a remote area of the northern region, and some
6eothermal power potential yet to be precisely estimated. Imports of petroleum
are costly, and imports of coal from Mozambique or Rhodesia, or of electricity
from the Cabora-Bassa scheme in Mozambique appear costly or unfeasible at the
present time. It is therefore the Government's strategy to develop the 500-MW
hydroelectric power potential of the Shire River.
24.       A 24-MW hydroelectric power station at Nkula Falls uen the 'liddle
Shire River, which was financed by the Commonwealtlh Developmnent Corporation



- 8 -
(CDC), was commissioned in 1965. A second major scheme was the 16-MW Ted-
zani Falls hydroelectric station, Stage I, which went into operation in
May 1973.   Credit 178-MAI of February 11, 1970 for the equivalent of US$5.25
million helped finance the foreign exchange component of a project including
the latter hydroelectric station, a 3-MW diesel unit, and transmission and
distribution facilities. Parallel finance for the equivalent of US$3.0
million was provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB). The project
was completed close to schedule in 1973 at a cost of US$16.5 million, includ-
ing a 14 percent cost overrun attributable to unexpected bad rock conditions
and an underestimation of contractors' establishment costs. This overrun
was financed with the assistance of CDC and the Industrial Development Bank
of Malawi.
25.       In 1973, Credit 426-MAI helped to finance the foreign exchange
cost of Tedzani's second development stage with an equivalent of US$7.5 mil-
lion. The project added 24 MW to ESCOM's hydroelectric generating capacity
and also included a 14-MW gas turbine. CDC participated in the financing
with a loan of US$6.0 million equivalent. The project is virtually com-
pleted at a final cost of US$18.0 million, 27 percent above the appraisal
estimate. This cost overrun is due to an acceleration in world inflation.
It is being financed by CDC up to US$2.0 million equivalent and by ESCOM's
cash generation and local borrowings.
26.       These major power stations have been connected by a grid of trans-
mission lines to cover the southern region and Lilongwe, which together account
for 90 percent of power consumption. The town of Mzuzu in the north and some
of the larger tea estates in areas where electricity is not supplied by the
grid have independent supplies. A general northward extension of the grid
has been uneconomic to date, given the lower population density in the north.
27.       The demand for power in Malawi has been increasing at 25 percent
annually between 1964 and 1967, and at 15 percent annually between 1967 and
1975 largely due to industrial growth. As industrial growth is not expected
to continue at the earlier rate, the annual increase in electricity sales is
projected to gradually decline to 9 percent by 1984. With the commissioning
of the second stage of Tedzani, the interconnected system would be capable of
meeting projected peak demand and energy requirements until 1980, after which
the generating capacity to be provided by the proposed project would be
required.
28.       Apart from the proposed project, ESCOM's development program in the
period 1975-1980 includes extensions of existing distribution facilities and
the construction of a 541-kin, 132-kV transmission line from Tedzani and Nkula
Falls II to Chinteche in Northern Malawi, to support industrial development
in the Chinteche area. The first stage of this line, which will be routed
to Salima, with a branch line to Lilongwe, is financed with the assistance
of Canadian finance channelled through AfDB and is under construction and ex-
pected to be operational by 1978 or 1979. Long-term planning for projects
beyond ESCOM's 1975-1980 development program has started, including three
major hydroelectric projects (Kapachira, Mptamanga, and Kholombidza) with a
total capacity of about 360 MW on the Middle Shire River.



- 9 -
29.       The main benefit of electrification in Malawi is to provide ade-
quate support to the country's industrialization effort. Due to the high
costs involved and the scarcity of resources, rural electrification is not
at present a primary objective of the Government.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
30.       A report entitled "Malawi - Appraisal of Nkula Falls II Hydroelec-
tric project" (No. 1149A-MAI dated March 11, 1977) is being circulated sepa-
rately. A loan/credit and project summary is provided in Annex III of this
report. The proposed project was appraised in November 1975. A further
mission to Malawi took place in October 1976 to ascertain co-financing needs.
The Government subsequently (in November/December 1976) approached various
potential colenders and agreement in principle about the financing plan was
reached in January 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from
February 22 to March 1, 1977, with a Malawian delegation headed by Mr. C.
Mphande.
31.       The proposed project to be constructed between 1977 and 1980 would
represent the second stage of the development of the Nkula Falls site. It
would allow for 90 MW of generating capacity with two 18-MW units being
included in the project and a further 54 MW being added at various stages
in the next decade.
Project Description
32.       Specifically the proposed project consists of:
(a) a rock fill dam about 7 m high and 700 m long on the
Shire River at Nkula Site;
(b) a pressure cut and cover conduit, headrace tunnel,
penstock and tailrace outlet system of about 1300 m
and a powerhouse designed for five 18-MW hydro
units;
(c) two 18-MW hydro units as a first stage of the 90-MW
ultimate development;
(d) consulting services; and
(e) training.
Project Execution
33.       The project would be carried out by ESCOM with the assistance of its
consultants: Kennedy and Donkin for electrical and mechanical equipment, and



- 10 -
Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlman for civil works. These two British
consulting firms have been employed by ESCOM since Malawi's Independence.
They have together actively participated in the preparation and supervision
of all previous developments of the Shire River and in the design of ESCOM's
long-term investment program. They will continue to be employed by ESCOM in
the future and in particular will supervise the construction of the proposed
project (ESCOM Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
34.       ESCOM itself is a well managed organization with experienced and
competent staff in its senior management positions. Its performance under
the two previously IDA-financed projects has been excellent. The General
Manager has been employed by ESCOM for many years. About thirty percent of
the senior positions are occupied by expatriates, including three of the
four top management posts. ESCOM has designed a well considered training
program aimed at complete Malawization by 1980. To ensure the continuation
of ESCOM's management capability, appointments to top management positions
would be made after consultation with the Bank (ESCOM Loan Agreement, Section
4.04).
Project Cost and Financing
35.       The estimated cost of the proposed project is US$66.4 million
(including an insignificant amount of taxes and duties, since duties on all
directly imported goods and services are expected to be waived) with a
foreign exchange component of US$50.6 million. Taking into account interest
during construction estimated at US$11.6 million, of which US$6.1 million
would be in foreign exchange, the project financing requirements are estimated
at US$78.0 million, of which US$56.7 million would be in foreign exchange. A
summary of the project cost estimates is given below.

36.       The foreign exchange requirements of the project (including interest
during construction) are expected to be financed on a parallel basis by the
African Development Bank (AfDB), the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC), the European Development Fund (FED), Germany, and the World Bank Group.
The proposed Bank Group contribution of US$25 million equivalent (which would
consist of a US$9.0 million Bank loan on standard terms, a US$8.0 million Bank
loan on Third Window terms, and a US$8.0 million IDA credit) would be used to
finance the foreign exchange cost of the civil works component and of ESCOM's
training program, as well as interest during construction on the Bank loans,
and would cover about 32 percent of total financing requirements. AfDB
finance (up to US$6 million equivalent) would be used to help finance the
foreign exchange costs of gates, screens, penstocks; CDC funds (US$13.7
million equivalent) would be available to the project without any restrictions
as to their use. FED funds (US$9.5 million equivalent) would help finance the
foreign exchange costs of turbines, generators and cranes, and Federal Republic
of Germany funds (up to about US$5 million equivalent) would help finance the
foreign exchange costs of switch-gear and transformers. External funds, which
on the basis of present offers might reach up to US$59.2 million, would thus



- 12 -
cover the full foreign exchange requirements of the project and possibly some
US$2.5million of local expenditures. The balance would be provided by ESCOM,
with local interest during construction being capitalized and regarded
as government contribution to the financing of the project.
37.       The Bank loan of US$9 million would be made to ESCOM at 8.5 percent
for a period of 20 years, including a grace period of 4-1/2 years. The US$8
million IDA credit and US$8 million Bank loan would be made to Malawi on
standard IDA and Third Window terms, respectively, with the proceeds being
relent to ESCOM for a period of 25 years, including a grace period of 4-1/2
years, at an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. The AfDB loan, which is
expected to be considered by AfDB's Executive Directors towards the end of
April or early May, is likely to be for a period of 15 years including a grace
period of 5 years, and to carry an interest rate of 8 percent per annum. The
CDC loan, which would be made to ESCOM for a period of 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years, at an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum, has
been approved. The proposed FED contribution is expected to be approved
around mid-April and to be made available to ESCOM for a period of 40 years,
including a grace period of 10 years, at an interest rate of 1 percent per
annum. The proposed German contribution was recently appraised by KfW which
is expected to recommend for consideration by the German Government a loan of
up to US$5 million equivalent.    Consideration is expected by July.   The loan
would probably be made available to Malawi on soft terms with the proceeds
relent to ESCOM for about 25 years including a grace period of up to 5 years,
at an interest rate of about 8.5 percent per annum. The effectiveness of the
AfDB, CDC and FED Loan Agreements would be a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loans and IDA credit (ESCOM Loan Agreement, Section 7.01(c), TW Loan
Agreement Section 6.01(a), and Credit Agreement, Section 5.01(b)). As finan-
cing for the project components expected to be financed by the Federal Republic
of Germany will not be required until 1978 and since these items could be
obtained through suppliers credits as a last resort should this be necessary,
cross effectiveness would not be required in this case.
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       The project would be executed under several contracts with procure-
ment and disbursements arrangements to meet the requirements of the respective
colenders. The civil works contract, which would be financed by the Bank
Group, is expected to be awarded shortly. The procurement procedure followed
Bank Group guidelines for international competitive bidding. The Bank
Group's funds would be disbursed on the basis of 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for civil works and for training, as well as against interest
during construction on the Bank loans to lessen the burden on ESCOM's cash
requirements during the construction period in view of the large size of the
project. Disbursements would first be made from the IDA credit and thereafter,
on a proportionate basis, from the two Bank loans. Bids for gates, penstocks,
screens and manifold (to be financed by AfDB) were received in December 1976,
and the award is expected by April 7. Tender documents for turbines and
alternators (to be financed by FED) were issued in December 1976 and bids are
expected early in May. Tender documents for transformers and switchgear have
not yet been issued. Contracts for engineering and supervision have been
entered into by ESCOM and the consulting firms of Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold



- 13 -
and Uhlmann (civil consultants) and Kennedy and Donkin (electrical consul-
tdnts), both of the United Kingdom.
Finances of ESCOM
39.       ESCOM's financial performance has been very good.    Between 1970 and
1975, kilowatt hours of electricity sold increased by 93 percent, revenues by
114 percent and net income by 126 percent. During the same period, net fixed
assets in operation, expressed in historic costs, increased 2.3 times from
MK 9.7 million to M1K 22.0 million. Of the capital expenditures, including
interest during construction, about 23 percent have been financed by ESCOM's
internal cash generation, which is considered satisfactory given the high
level of these expenditures. ESCOM's annual accounts will continue to be
audited by independent accountants acceptable to the Bank (ESCOM Loan Agree-
ment, Section 5.02).
40.       The rate of return on average net fixed assets valued at historical
cost was at a high of 14 percent in 1972, declining to 8 percent in 1974 witl
the addition of the Tedzani Falls Scheme to the asset base. In 1975, it
was 13.6 percent. To secure a more realistic assessment of its performance,
however, ESCOM has revalued its assets at the end of 1975. Beginning December
31, 1977, ESCOM will revalue its assets annually using methods acceptable to
the Bank (ESCOM Loan Agreement, Section 5.05). In order to maintain ESCOM's
financial viability, it has further been agreed that the rate of return on
average revalued assets will be no less than 12 percent in 1978 and 1979, and
no less than 8 percent in 1980 and thereafter (ESCOM Loan Agreement, Section
5.03a).
41.       Despite an adequate level of income between 1970 and 1975, ESCOM's
cash position has been tight because of the high level of capital expenditures.
Tariff increases of 12 percent and 20 percent were introduced on January 1,
1975 and on September 1, 1976, respectively. Further tariff increases will be
necessary to achieve the above rates of return.    ESCOM and Malawi have agreed
that an increase of not less than 30 percent will be introduced no later than
January 1, 1978. This would bring ESCOM's tariffs into the middle range for
Eastern African countries. In addition, it has been agreed as an additional
condition of effectiveness that ESCOM would make arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank to raise an additional MK 3.6 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) to
meet a temporary cash shortfall that could occur during the second half of
1977. This is expected to include a combination of a renewal of overdraft
facilities, short-term local or external borrowing, and possibly a moratorium
on interest due to Government on account of past loans. Until project com-
pletion, ESCOM will not undertake capital expenditures of more than US$1.5
million other than the proposed project without the agreement of the Bank
(-SCOM Loan Agreement Section 5.07) and will not incur debt without prior Bank
approval, unless future debt service is covered at least 1.5 times by internal
cash generation (ESCOM Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).



- 14 -
42.       The introduction of future tariff increases provides the oppor-
tunity of bringing ESCOM's tariff structure closer to long run marginal
cost pricing. It has therefore been agreed that ESCOM's tariff structure
will continue to be reviewed, in consultation with the Bank (ESCOM Loan
Agreement, Section 5.03b).
Environmental Effects
43.       The proposed Nkula II dam will raise the natural water level of
the Shire River by 7 m at most. Although this change would have an effect
on the existing Nkula I hydroelectric facilities and on the water intake
facilities of Blantyre Water Board (BWB), only minor modifications to these
would be necessary.
44.       The proposed project should cause no major ecological problems.
There are no permanent human habitations and no crops which would be inun-
dated when the dam is commissioned. Nonetheless, ESCOM will examine the
possible ecological changes arising from the project and steps which should
be taken to avoid or mitigate any undesirable side effects (ESCOM Loan Agree-
ment, Section 3.03 and Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.04).
Irrigation Aspects
45.       There are at present no competing claims for the waters of the
Shire River upstream of Nkula II. Since continued availability of water in
sufficient quantities for the project would be essential, it has been agreed
that Government will not permit any abstraction of water from the Shire River
or its tributaries upstream of Nkula that would reduce the potential output
of the Nkula II Hydrostation, unless the Government and the Bank agree that
such abstraction would be economically justified, and will permit ESCOM to
divert water from the Shire River in such amounts as may be necessary (but not
less than 170 cubic meters per second) for the purpose of power generation at
Nkula Falls II (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.03).
Economic Justification and Risks
46.       The proposed project is the least cost solution among several alter-
natives for meeting Malawi's growing power demand until the early 1980's. In
addition to the proposed project, several alternatives for meeting long-term
demand were analyzed: (a) two diesel sets of 10 MW each as a first step to be
followed by the Nkula Falls scheme; (b) two coal-based steam units of 20 MW
each followed by hydro projects; and (c) only hydro units. Calculations
demonstrate that for discount rates lower than 21 percent the proposed project
is the least cost solution. Moreover, this conclusion is not affected by
substantial changes in the assumptions underlying the calculation. The rate
of return of the proposed project is estimated at 10 percent, while that of
the complete Nkula Falls development would be 13 percent. Project risks are
no greater than can normally be expected with operations of this type.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, the draft Loan Agreement between the Republic
of Malawi and the Bank, the draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the
Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi, the draft Guarantee Agreement be-
tween the Republic of Malawi and the Bank, the Recommendation of the Commit-
tee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association, the Reports of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the texts of
three draft Resolutions approving the proposed credit and loans, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       Features of the Credit and Loan Agreements of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 33, 34, 37, 39-42, 44 and 45 of this Report.
Additional conditions of effectiveness of the credit and loans are that
Government and CDC have released the security on debenture stock provided in
trust deed of April 21, 1965 between ESCOM, Malawi and Barclays Bank, that
satisfactory arrangements have been made to meet ESCOM cash requirements
during 1977 and that cofinancing agreements, except for the loan of the
Federal Republic of Germany, have been signed and conditions precedent to
their disbursement have been fulfilled.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit and loans would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and of the Bank and with the
established criteria for Third Window loans.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed cre-
dit and loans.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 102-MAI First Education Project; US$6.3 million credit of May 4,
1967; Date of Effectiveness: July 3, 1967; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project consists of the construction and equipping of one
national primary teacher training college and the provision of technical
instruction facilities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been
implemented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for about
two years. A request from the Government to use savings under the credit,
amounting to about US$420,000, for the construction of a post and telecom-
munications school to be jointly used by Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland was agreed to by the Executive Directors on December 4, 1973.
The Closing Date has consequently been postponed to June 30, 1977. Con-
struction of the post and telecommunications school has been completed and
the credit is expected to be fully disbursed shortly.
Credit No. 282-MAI Agriculture - Karonga Development Project; US$6.6 million
credit of January 26, 1971; Date of Effectiveness:
August 14, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to cost escalation the project period has been reduced from
five to four years. Only minor reductions of physical targets have occurred.
Completion of the irrigated double cropped rice scheme, reduced from 1,500 ac
to 1,000 ac was delayed due to exceptional flooding. Extension and research
are working satisfactorily. All necessary staff for the health component are
in post and bilharzia control is now a continuous program. Lake transporta-
tion has been generally improved, but the barge purchased under the credit
and put in operation in early 1976 proved defective. Corrective measures are
expected to be undertaken shortly. In addition, the Government has requested
and obtained IDA's approval to use project funds to raise the Chilumba jetty
by 2 feet to avoid flooding caused by high tides. The project is being fol-
lowed by a Phase II project (Loan 1286-T-MAI).
Credit No. 363-MAI Agriculture - Shire Valley Development Project Phase II;
US$10.5 million credit of March 28, 1973; Date of Effective-
ness: April 27, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is a continuation and an expansion of the program com-
pleted under Phase I and includes extension services, credit and marketing
facilities, a livestock component, health facilities, fisheries development,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

feeder road construction, research on irrigated and rainfed crops, land
registration and wildlife protection. Due to a combination of technical
and social factors, crop output may be lower than envisaged at appraisal.
The Government is currently reviewing the cropping program in detail and
a revision of the production targets may become necessary. The road con-
struction program is making satisfactory progress. A senior health officer
for the health component assumed duties recently and is now working on the
urgently needed operational health program. A Phase III, or a consolidation
phase, project is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture
with assistance from RMEA.
Credit No. S-17-MAI Transport Engineering and Services Project; US$2.0 million
credit of June 13, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 28,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project would help determine the infrastructural requirements
and provide technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest
resources. Necessary transportation studies and the design of the required
transport facilities have been completed. VIPCOR, the Malawi organization
which is in charge of the Viphya project, is in the process of seeking
financing and technical partners.
Credit No. 523-MAI    Second Highway Project; US$10.0 million credit of
December 19, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: February 21,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Construction works for the main road from Lilongwe to Champira,
although some months behind the original schedule, are about 40 percent
completed. The first results from the maintenance pilot program indicate
satisfactory progress. The present cost estimates indicate that the final
project costs will be well within the appraisal estimates.
Credit No. 550-MAI Agriculture - Lilongwe Land Development Program Phase III;
US$8.5 million credit of May 27, 1975; Date of Effective-
ness: August 12, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Phase III project of the Lilongwe Land Development Program has
made good progress. Construction of project infrastructure is now almost on
schedule. Due to reduced input use as a consequence of last season's high
fertilizer prices and adverse weather conditions, average maize and ground-
nut yields were lower in 1976 than in the preceding year. However, overall
production of high value crops such as tobacco and groundnuts has increased
considerably. The stall feeder and poultry programs are expanding rapidly,
contributing to sizeable income increases of small farmers. Credit adminis-
tration and loan repayments continue to be outstanding.

Credit No. 590-MAI Second Education Project; US$11.6 million credit of
November 24, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: February 24,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project will provide prototype construction models of primary
schools, strengthen the program of rural education, establish a new primary
teacher training college, and add facilities for the teaching of practical
subjects in selected secondary schools with emphasis on facilities for girls.
Prior to becoming effective on February 24, 1976, the project had made a good
start by early appointment of consultant architects. Key personnel for the
Project Implementation Unit had been appointed, including a Malawian Project
Director and a Project Architect. The Commonwealth Fund has provided two
architects and a quantity surveyor to assist the Project Architect in the
design of the primary schools and the supervision of construction. Due
to lack of skilled manpower, difficulties have arisen in finding Malawian
draftsmen for the Project Unit's design staff. However, efforts are being
made to recruit them.
Loan No. 1286-T-MAI Second Karonga Rural Development Project; US$9.2 million
loan of June 3, 1976. Date of Effectiveness: August 18,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project, financed on Third Window terms, is in part a continua-
tion of the first Karonga project and covers a larger area. It consists of
the provision of seasonal and medium-term credit to farmers, extension ser-
vice, market complexes, health facilities, boreholes and other infrastruc-
tural facilities, agricultural and hydrological research in Karonga and
Chitipa districts. The project also provides for preparatory investments
for the National Rural Development Program, and rehabilitation of berthing
facilities at Chipoka Lake terminal. Project implementation has begun.

Procurement
Arrangements:       The civil works contract, which would be financed from
Bank Group funds, is expected to be awarded shortly. The
procurement procedures followed the Bank Group guidelines
for international competitive bidding. Procurement for
items to be financed by other institutions would be in
accordance with the rules of the institutions concerned.
Consultants:         Detailed engineering of the project is being carried
out by Messrs. Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann
(civil works) and Kennedy and Donkin (mechanical and
electrical works), both of United Kingdom and who
already designed and supervised Nkula Falls I and
Tedzani Stage I and II. It is expected that these
consultants will supervise the construction of the
project (about 160 man-months).
Rate of return:      The rate of return of the complete development is esti-
mated to be 13 percent, and that of the project alone 10
percent.
Appraisal Report:    Report No. 1149A-MAI dated March 11, 1977.
Maps:                IBRD No.  2,2L. enrd 2369R4
