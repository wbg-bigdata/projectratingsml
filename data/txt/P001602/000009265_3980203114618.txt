PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KALAWt: NKULA FALLS I I HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(CREDIT 691-MAI AND LOANS 1387-T-MAI AND 1388-MAI)
Preface
The project constituted part of power generation program of the
Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOMX  in the period 1976-1980 and included
the construction of the Nkula dam and hydropower plant on the Shire River
containing  three   20-iW  generating  units,  consulting  services,  and
training.   The Bank Group assisted in this with Credit 691-MAI and Loans
1387-T-MAI and 1388-MAI (US$25 million in total) which were agreed on April
28, 1977.   The agreements became effective on November 11, 1977, and the
last disbursement was made on September 30, 1980. The Project Completion
Report (PCR) was prepared by the East African Regional Office based on the
appraisal report and other documents in the Bank files, a completion report
prepared by ESCOM, and the findings of a project completion mission which
visited Malawi ini March 1982.
The PCR summarizes the main points of particular interest.   It
shows the vulnerability of a landlocked developing country, which, even
when the administratLon of the relevant utility is smooth and the project
free of procurement problems, must rely on imported equipment and materials
for maior construction works.   The PCR also notes the success of ESCOM's
training program and manpower development.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.
Following normal procedures, a draft copy of this report was sent
for comments to the Government, ESCOM and the co-financiers for the project.
Those conments which were received have been taken into account in finaliz-
ing this report, and are attached to the report as Appendices A and B.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAWI: NKULA FALLS II "YDROELECTRIC PROJECT
(CREDIT 691-MAI AND LOANS 1387-T-MAI AND 1388-MAI)
Highlights
The project comprised the construction of a hydroelectric
generation station with two 20-MW units, consulting services and
training components.   A major objective was to meet Malawi's growing
industrial,   commercial  and   domestic   electricity   demand.           The
power station constituted the first step in the least cost capital
development program of the Electrieity Supply Commission (ESCOM) from
1980 to 2005.   It also had as its objective the strengthening of the
power  sector  through  the  development  of  local  manpower  through
appropriate training facilities and programs and through establishing
the financial viability of ESCOM.   The objectives were fully achieved
except for the financial objective.
Time overruns were minimal and the achievement exceptional
under the circumstances  (paras.  1.02 and 3.02-3.04).   Cost  increases
(para. 3.09) were justifiable given the circumstances.
Institutional performance under the project was satisfactory
except in the financial area.  ESCOM has reduced its unskilled manpower
to an acceptable level and is gradually replacing expatriates with
nationals  (para.  6.08).      To  achieve  greater  efficiency,  it  has
decentralized its operational management.
Actual  sales  and  revenues  were  lower  than  the  estimates.
Although tariff increases were implemented yearly, they were made too late
in most years to enable ESCOM to comply with the rate of return covenant
(para. 5.06).
Among   the   lessons   learned   are   the   importance   of   not
underestimating the transportation difficulties of a landlocked country
(para. 3.05), the importance of instituting good training programs (paras.
6.04-6.07), and difficulties in load growth forecasting (para. 7.02).

MALAW1:  NKLILA FALf,S Tl. IIYDROELEICTRI.C PROJECT
(CREDIT 091-MA] AND LOANS L:387-T-MAI AND 1388-MAI)
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01         The Nkuiia Falls 'IT project was one of a series of planned
projects to develop the hydropoteritial of the ShJire River to further the
Government of Malawi's policy of meeting the country's growing industrial,
comnmercial  and  donesttc  MtoctrLcily  damnaud  at the  cheapest  cost.   The
project comprised:  construction of a rork-fill dam about 7 m in height and
about 700 m in lengtlh at the Nkula site; construction of a low pressure cut
and cover conduit, a headrace ttunnel, penstock and a tailrace outlet system
of about 1,280 m and a powerhouse with three 20-MW hydro units consulting
services and training.
1.02         The project  was  completed  about a year behind the original
schedule  mainly  because  of  difficulties  caused by a war  in the region
during  the  period  of  construction  and  in  transporting  equipment  and
materials.   Although  the hydroelectric units were commissioned  on time,
these delays put the construction and installation of the barrage gates
about a year behind.   The project was completed with a cost overrun of
US$16 million, about 24% higher then the appraisal estimate. This increase
was  due  to  contractor's  claims  under  price  escalation  provisions,
transportation difficulties, and construction of a third generating unit
not included in the appraisal estimate and other changes in design (para.
2.02).
1.03        The Bank Group assistance of US$25 million was made in three
lending operations,  effective on the same date, November 11, 1977:   US$8
million (IDA Credit 691-MAI); US$8 million (Third Window Loan 1387-T-MAI)
and US$9 million  (IBRD Loan 1388-MAI).   It was agreed with the borrower
that Credit funds should be used first.  Other assistance was provided by
the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), European Development Fund
(EDF),  Germany  (KfW),  African  Development  Bank  (AfDB)  and  Barclays
Bank/Standard Chartered Bank.
1.04        During the appraisal annual average growth rates of electricity
sales were estimated at 12% as against the actual of 6%; the decrease is
mainly caused by the country's economic slow-down and worldwide recession.
The lower load growth does not affect the economic justification of the
project which remained the least cost solution.
1.05         ESCOM's operations through the project  period were generally
satisfactory although the covenanted rates of return were achieved only in
FY80 due to lower load growth and Government delays with tariff increases.
FY82 estimates indicate that 8% rate of return required for that year will
not be achieved.  ESCOM also incurred long term debts in FY81 which appear
to have contravened the covenanted debt coverage ratio (para. 5.07).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin, PreparationL Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      The project had its origin in the overall development program of
the water resources of the Shire River basin, which was the subject of many
studies and investigations in the late l.960s.  The Bank Group assisted the
Government in the development of the Shire River through its lending
operations for the Tedzani hydropower station (Credits 178-MAL in 1970 and
426-MAL in 1978).
2.02        In August 1974 the UK Ministry of Overseas Development assisted
the Government of Malawi and ESCOM in commissioning two consultant
companies   for  studies  of  all  the  major  hydroelectric  development
possibilities in Malawi and to advise the Government of Malawi on the
physical and economic feasibility of the second stage development of the
Nkula Falls Hydroelectric Scheme.   Their report,  presented  in May 1975,
confirmed the earlier conclusion that, following completion of the Tedzani
Falls Stage II Project, the next hydroelectric development should take
place at Nkula Falls. The recommendation was that the first two units (2 x
18 MW) should be in operation by January 1, 1980, and the estimated total
cost would  be MK  35 million,  based on December 31,  1974 prices.   The
project was appraised in November 1975 and negotiations were held in
Washington in February 1977.   No problems arose during negotiations and
agreements were concluded between the Bank Group and the Borrower.   The
only significant change in the project from the original scope as presented
to the Board of Directors was the increase of the number of generating
units to three and purchase of 20-MW generating units as a result of very
favorable bid prices. Annex 1 sets forth the major covenants of the credit
and loan agreements.
Project Description
2.03      The project originally consisted of the following:
(i) construction of a rock-fill dam about 7 meters high and 700
meters long on the Shire River, at the Nkula site, to form a
reservoir and enable daily regulation of the river flow;
(ii) construction of a low-pressure cut-and-cover conduit, headrace
tunnel, penstock, and tailrace outlet system of about 1,280
meters, and a powerhouse with two units with a generating
capacity of about 18 MW each, but designed so as to enable the
installation of three additional units of the same generating
capacity each;
(iii) consulting services; and
(iv)  a training program for the Borrower's professional and technical
staff.



-3-
Project Objectives
2.04           The principal  objectives  of the  project  were:   providing
additional generating capacity for the national power system (60 MW) and
175  GWh  yearly  average),  thus  saving  on  foreign  expenditures  by
substituting  less  expensive  hydropower  for  imported  oil;  initiating
institutional improvements through a well-conceived training program; as
well as gradually reducing the number of expatriates and employing inore
local staff. In general, the above objectives have been achieved.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COSTS
Credit/Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01       The conditions of credit and loan effectiveness were confined to
the fulfillment of all conditions of effectiveness of other co-financiers
and various legal actions (authorization and ratification of credit/loan
documents and the subsidiary loan agreement).  The credit/loans were made
effective on November 11, 1977, about two and a half months late.
Project Execution
3.02      After advertising in the international press and approval by IBRD
and other lenders, tender documents were issued progressively from
September 1976 to suit the project program.   The contract  for the main
civil engineering works was awarded on 31 March 1977 and the site works
commenced in June 1977.  Details of this and other contracts are shown in
Annexes 2 and 3.  Having started later than intended, the contractor did
his best to adhere  to  the  implementation  schedule.   Although  certain
milestone dates affecting other contractors were missed, by rescheduling
barrage  gate  installation  with  the  modification  of  the  method  of
construction of civil works, the contractor was able to complete the main
part of waterways in April 1980 about two months later than the original
date.  Delivery delays (para. 3.05) resulted in the need for revislons to
the program and the steel penstocks and tunnel liners were completed to
that revised schedule.
3.03       Barrage gates were delayed until March 1982, about 19 months,
mainly as a result of late manufacture and delivery of parts (para. 3.05).
Substantial  completion of the  civil  engineering  works  was  attained  in
approximately 44 months from the date of issue of tender enquiries; this is
to be compared with the 42 months allowed in the construction program in
the staff appraisal report.
3.04       Electrical and mechanical plant scheduled for completion in June
1980 was delayed three months owing to transport disruptions but the
schedule as agreed In September 1979 was maintained until completion. The
generating sets were put into commercial service at the following dates:
unit 1, October 1980; (appraisal schedule September 1980); unit 2, November
1980 (appraisal schedule December 1980) and unit 3, April 1981 (unscheduled
by appraisal mission).

3.05        A number of probiems not anticipated during project appraisal
were encountered during the construction of this relatively small project
located in a landlocked country, such as:
(a)  transportation difficulties  in equipment and material due to a
war in the region;
(b)  continuous congestion at the port of Beira in Mozambique due to
inefficient operation;
(c)  shortage of motor fuel due to transportation difficulties;
(d)  shortage of reinforcing steel (some of which had to be flown into
the country) due to transportation difficulties;
(e)  shortage  of cement  due  to machinery  breakdovn at  the cement
factory in Malawi which caused delays in the construction of
civil works; during the breakdown period cement had to be
imported from neighboring countries, but it created additional
problems because of transportation difficulties;
(f)  faccory strikes in supplier's country affected delivery dates of
various equipment;
(g)  workshops of a supplier were flooded and powerlines were washed
away and consequently spillway gates and associated equipment had
to be transported to Malawi at a time when hostilities in the
region had intensified and further delays occurred during
transportation;
(h)  the  contractor  had  difficulties  in casting  gears  for  radial
spillway gates, as it was the first time for him to cast gears of
this size; and
(i)  bad rock conditions were encountered during the excavation of the
headrace tunnel (1,200 m) which caused some additional delays.
Ecological Aspects
3.06      A general ecological review of the Tedzani site, B km downstream
of Nkula Falls II, was completed in late 1974 during the course of the
construction of Tedzani Barrage.   This study and experiences on Tedzani
Stage I and Nkula Falls I, at the project site, indicated that the project
would not have any negative effects of such magnitude as to impair the
feasibility of the dams nor to cause major ecological problems.  However,
the breeding areas for fish downstream have been subjected to constant
water levels and this has affected the breeding habits of fish. Normially,
the level of the river goes up and down thus exposing some of the areas to
sunshine.   It is not known quantitatively how much this has reduced fish
production  downstream    (Appendix A).       There  were  no  permanent  human
habitations and no crops likely to be inundated by the proposed dam. ESCOM
had arranged a reconnaissance study satisfactory to the Bank to examine the
possible ecological changes arising from the project and to recommend the
steps which should be. taken to avoid or mitigate urdesirabte side effects.
The study was carried out by the University of Malawi. The Government and
ESCOM reviewed the conclusions and recommendations of the study wl'h the



- 5 -
Bank, implemented those which related to the project and noted those
relevant to future hydro projects.
Reporting
3.07        ESCOM was informed of the Bank Group's reporting requirements
immediately after credit/loan signing and reporting has been satisfactory.
The progress reports on the project were regular and contained the
necessary information.  The Bank Group has had full insight into all major
project problems such as transportation difficulties.
Project Costs and Related Financing
3.08      The final project costs of K73 (US$82.5) million were 24% higher
than the original estimates of K60.4 million (UF,$66.4) million. A detailed
comparison of these costs is given in Annex 4.   The appraisal estimates
were revised in 1977 to allow for the effect of high inflation rates and
modified scope of work.
3.09       The major portion of the excess cost was for local expenditures
of civil works (59%) due to very high inflation on labor and material
costs.   Despite the change in the project scope (para. 2.02),  the extra
cost of the equipment due to addition of a third unit was only 1% because
of extremely low bids. Cost overruns were ftnanced by ESCOM.
3.10       The original financing plan at appraisal is given below.   Each
financing  agency  financed  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  separately,
identifiable components (as shown in Annex 4) except for CDC whose
financing was flexible and could be applied to local or foreign exchange
costs.

3.11      Foreign funds provided by the above arrangement were in excess of
the appraisal cost estimate by US$5 million.  Immediatelv after bidding the
Government and ESCOM determined that they would be able to add a third unit
to the project because they had received lower manufacturers' offers than
estimated.
3.12         The final financing plan is given below.   It shows that the
foreign currency financing requirement for the construction of the project
was about US$56.7 million compared to all available funds of about US$55.9
million. (Deficit of US$0.8 million was covered by the Government.)

a/ CDC made two loans to cover the project cost increases.
3.13        The main civil contractor made about fifty claims (total value
about SK 10.5 million - equivalent  to about US$14.0 million).   Although
most have been settled, a claim related to the gates is still under
dispute.    This  claim  was  related  to  the  transportation  difficulties
encountered during the course of the construction (due mainly to political
and economic difficulties in Zimbabwe and Mozambique), and also some design
changes such as inclusion of the third unit, larger control building and
switchyard. ESCOM does not expect that the final settlement of this claim
will have any significant financial implications on the project costs.
Disbursements
3.14             The  original  estimate  of  disbursements  and  the  actual
disbursements  are given  in Annex  5.   Cumulative  disbursements  for the
Credit planned to be disbursed first, were lower than the appraisal
estimates  due  to  Project  start-up  delays  (para.  3.02).            However,
disbursements for Loans were very much higher than originally estimated and
loans proceeds were fully disbursed one year earlier than anticipated.
This   was   achieved   through   special   contractural   arrangements   with
contractors, such as increased advances and replacement of the retention
money with bank guarantees.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.15       The performance of both the civil consultants and the mechanical
and electrical consultants was satisfactory.  The construction supervision
was adeouate and the modification of the method of construction to offset
and provide for the delay of the gates by allowing the civil contractor to
proceed without them by building an additional small cofferdam was entirely
successful.   Without this timely action the project would have suffered
greater cost increases and further delay.   However, the consultants have
not been equally successful in estimating final project costs and the
extent of additionally needed works.   Furthermore,  they did not propose



necessary protective measures to avoid or minimize the harmful effects.:  F
turbine cavitation and reservoir siltation which were observed in L
initial operation of the project (para. 4.01).
3.16       ESCOM and their consultants provided an effective team, both in
providing the off-site administration and design and in controlling the
progress and quality assurance during manufacture and on stce.  The work
was carried out on time and construction records and measurements were kept
up to date.  Designs and drawings were provided on time with little or no
delay in accommodating agreed changes.
3.17          The civil  contractor  was  well-organized  and  efficient  in
construction work and the quality of work was good.   However,  he made
numerous and excessive claims.  Many of these claims were rejected.   The
suppliers performed satisfactorily although they were affected by domestic
problems outside their control.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      Since the project has not been in service long enough and some of
its components were installed late (para. 3.03), it is diEficult to compare
the actual operating periormance of the project's physical facilities with
the  expectations  at  appraisal.    In  general,  the  initial  operating
performance  is  satisfactory.       Some  operational  problems  have  been
experienced, mostly related to protection relay setting and occasional
generating units tripping.  More serious problems have been observed with
reservoir siltation.  The tributaries of the Shire River carry extremely
heavy silt loads into the main river. Much of this is carried by the Shire
River during the flood period but s ie is deposited downstream of the
confluences and then gradually eroded and carried in suspension later by
the steady flow of the river.  The effect of silt suspended in the water
passing through the generating units has been rather severe. The silt load
in the Shire River has steadily increased in recent years as a result of
soil erosion due to increased pressure on the land, and unless controlled
the situation could continue to deteriorate.   It is clear that effective
conservation measures to reduce the incidence of soil erosion must be taken
not  only  to  impro%ra  conditions  for  the  hydropower  plants  but  more
importantly to protect and preserve valuable farm land.  The project needs
some modification of filter screens and raking equipment to cope with the
increased siltation, trash and debris which are present in quantities
greater than expected.  These problems have to be studied and appropriate
remedial measures should be adopted. Furthermore, some cavitation problems
have been encountered since generating units were operated at the beginning
with thp lower than the designed head due to late delivery of the barrage
gates. It appears that engineering consultants failed to promptly propose
necessary protective measures.  Availability of the power station in 1982
was 93%, which is below the expected value.
4.02        ESCOM's staff is well trained and operates project facilities
satisfactorily.    Reliable  and  proven equipment  has  been  used  for  the
project facilities; spare parts are available and preventive maintenance is
appropriate.

I/ Actual expenditure on the project in 1976 Was MK 1.5 million compared to
MK 0.4 million estimated for that year.



5.02          Construction expenditure  was above the estimated amount  for
reasons  outlined  in  paras.  3.09,  3.11  and  3.13.    Net  internal  cash
generation provided only 13.5% of total financing requirements for the
1977-1982 period compared with 28.1% estimated at appraisal.  Internal cash
generation was significantly lower  than forecast (paras. 5.05-5.06)  but
lower debt service, reflecting misLly lower interest rates than forecast at
appraisal  on  some of  ESCOM's  other  borrowings  served  to  partly offset
this.  Borrowings and capital contributions were higher than the appraisal
estimate.    Working  capital  decreased  substantially  over  the  period;
accounts receivable position was at acceptable level representing less than
two months of sales; however, inventories were high reflecting larger
delivery periods resulting from transportation problems and delays; the
cash position was tight and ESCOM had to obtain overdrafts to meet its cash
requirements.
Accounting, and Audit
5.03         ESCOM's accounting records are well maintained and financial
reports  are  prepared  promptly.    ESCOK's  audit  is  conducted  by  the
international  firm:   Deloitte, Haskins and Sells, and the arrangement is
satisfactory.   During the project period, ESCOM always met the covenant
requiring its financial statements to be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank within four uDnths after
the close of the fiscal year.
Financial Performance and Compliance with Covenants
5.04       Appraisal estimates and actual Income Statements, Balance Sheets
and Funds Flow Statements covering the years L977 to 1982 ate given in
Annexes 6, 7 and 8.
5.05        The following table shows the percentage variations in actual
financial operating performance compared to the appraisaL estimates.

Internal cash generation    -5        -21    -23    -24    -36    -30
5.06         Revenues were below the appraisal estimate due to lower than
forecast electricity sales and lower average tariffs (except for 1981 and
1982).  The lower growth in electricity sales is mainly due to a decrease,
in some of the years, in the annual growth of the commercial and domestic
sectors.  However, demand growth in the industrial sector was close to the
appraisal estimate and its elasticity to tariff increases appears to have



- 10 -
been  minimal.  1/    Operating  expenses  were  higher  largely  because  of
increase in staff during the implementation of this project and due to
increases in fuel costs amounting to between 50 and 300% since 1979.
ESCOM increased its tariffs yearly since the appraisal of this project
(Annex 6).  However, in spite of the Bank's urging, the tariff adjustments
were   implemented   with   considerable   delays   and   consequently   were
insufficient to enable ESCOM to achieve the required 12% return on revalued
net fixed assets in operation for 1978 and 1979 and 8% thereafter, except
in 1980 when the 8% return was achieved.   This, combined with the high
inventory resulted in cash shortages and the need for ESCOM to obtain
additiona;. loans to help finance its development program and meet its cash
requiremen s  (para.  5.02).    Although  the  debt/equity  ratio  was  more
conservative in the earlier years than estimated at appraisal, the
additional borrowings caused the debt equity ratio to inc:ease from 58/42
it 1979 to 75/25 for 1982 (Annex 7).
5.07         By obtaining the additional loans in 1981 without the Bank's
agreement, ESCOM contravened the requirement of Section 5.04 of Loan
1388-MAI which stipilates that ESCOM shall not incur any long term debt
unless its net revenues in any year are not less than 1.5 times the debt
service requirement for that year (Annex 8).  This contravention was also
due to delay in implementing tariff increases.   Because of completion of
this project restoration of ESCOM's financial viability through timely
adjustment of electricity tariffs is now proposed to be pursued in the
context  of  other  Bank  Group  operations  in Malawi  such  as  structural
adjustment  lending.    However,  the  compliance  with  the  covenants  on
revaluation  of  assets  and  limitation  of  capital  expeditures  has  been
satisfactory.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organization Effectiveness
6.01      ESCOM is a well managed utility and has a good record in carrying
out  its responsibilities.   Improvements continue to be  nade  in ESCOM's
organizational structure and management practices.   A number of measures
have  been taken  to  define management  responsibilities  and to  introduce
effective decision-making methods.  ESCOM reports to the newly established
Department of Statutory Bodies in the Office of the President and Cabinet.
However, several entities are concerned with the development of the energy
and power sector and their activities need to be better coordinated.
Further strengthening of the existing energy-related institutions is
needed,   including  more  experienced   professional   staff  and  adequate
financial resources.  The vacant post of ESCOM's chief engineer remains to
be filled by an experienced professional.
6.02        The 198l reorganization of ESCOM was intended to decentralize
operations for the purposes of reducing manpower wastage, delegating more
authority to area managers, reducing travel costs, and increasing operating
efficiency.   The decentralization principle seems well suited to ESCOM's
operations although it is still early to determine its effectiveness in
practice.
1/ ESCOM has recently prepared a tariff study which is under review in the
Bank.



- 11 -
6.03       ESCOK is currently engaged in a local staff development program
which has as its ultimate goal the replacement of all expatriate staff (14
at the end of 1982) with qualified local staff.   Replacements of this
nature are effected without undue haste and only when qualified local staff
are available. At present the fourteen expatriate staff hold managerial or
key positions, but local staff are being actively trained to take over
these roles in the future.   At the techician level all staff are now
Malawians.
Training
6.04       Training set in motion under the project and achieved has been
very successful, the result of a good response from ESCOK and a thoroughly
experienced power training consultant.  The development of local staff is
founded upon five training programs:
(a)   the ESCOM training center;
(b)   on-the-job training;
(c)   training abroad;
(d)   training with local organizations and colleges; and
(e)   participation in seminars and short courses.
6.05       The ESCOM training center was established in 1980.  The center
trains ESCOM's staff at the artisan and technician level for overhead line
work and switchgear fitting including cable jointing.
6.06       In the last two years, a total of 105 engineers and technicians
have received on-the-job training with ESCOM4 or with various ESCOM
contractors ard manufacturers employed on ESCOM projects.   This training
has involved about 20 ESCOM staff and has in part been related to the
establishment of a local ESCOM technical school and management training for
higher level local staff.  At present, there are 16 ESCOM staff members in
training abroad, mostly in engineering (12) and finance/administration
(4).  From the original sum of US$300,000 only US$10,000 was approved by
the Bank Group involving payment for preparation of the training report by
Electricity Supply Board (Ireland). All of overseas training was financed
from ESCOM's resources.   The remaining sum was eventually reallocated to
finance the engineeling works (Appendix B).
6.07          Local training programs consist of training in the Malawi
Polytechnical Institute and the Malawi College of Accountancy.   They are
well suited for artisans, bookkeepers and secretaries. During the past two
years ESCOM has sent its higher level staff for training on suitable
seainars  and  courses,   for  exaaple,   on  tariff  and  pricing,   loan
administration and new and renewable  sources of energy.   The training
programs have had very beneficial impact on ESCOM's effectiveness and
institutionaL performance.
6.08       ESCOM employs 2,063 persons which comprise 171 senior staff, 948
junior staff, 484 skilled workers and 460 temporary workers.  In 1981 ESCOM
reduced  its staff  strength  by about  two percent.   Staff salaries are
sufficiently competitive considering other employrent opportunities for
qualified staff in Malawi.   ESCOM has had no problems in recruiting and
retaining its staff.

VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Market Growth
7.01            The  project  was  to  supply  additional  energy  to ESCOM's
interconnectej system which supplies, inter alia, Blantyre, Malawi's main
industrial a±nd commercial center with a population of 210,000; L'longwe,
the new capital, with a population of 87,000; Zomba, with a population of
19,700 1/ and a large sugar estate.   The interconnected system accounted
for about 98% of ESCOM's sales.
7.02      At the time of appraisal, about two-thirds of ESCOM's industrial
sales were to four large industrial consumers. Growth in industrial sales
between 1967 and 1975 had varied between 307 in 1975 to 4% in 1974 with an
average annual growth rate of 16%.  At appraisal ESCOM's forecast for the
period 1976-1981 indicated an increase in total electricity saLes from 256
GWh in 1976 to 516 GWh in 1982, with an annual growth of 12.4%.  However,
actual sales in 1982 were 358 GWH (annual increase of about 5.7%). In 1981
sales were 3% less than in 1980.  Obviously, it was difficult to forecast
the effects of the economic slow-down in Malawi and impact of price
increases in the pattern and volume of electricity usage.   Electricity
losses remained about  13%.   These  losses reflect  an undeveloped  power
transmission  and  distribution system.   For 1982-1986  total electricity
sales are expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 6%.
Some improvements are an-ticipated in domestic and commercial consumption.
7.03        In 1976 ESCDM's 71 MW of generating facilities included diesel,
steam and hydro plant with the hydro component representing about 70% of
the  total.      The  hydroelectric  power  stations  were  all  basically
"run-of-river" development  on  the  Middle  Shire.    An  assurance  of  a
sufficient flow rate to operate hydro plants at maximum capacity, even
during the driest years, is provided by the Kamuzu Barrage at Liwonde with
the enormous reservoir capacity of Lake Malawi.   Diesel sets and steam
units were being used to meet peak demand and to cover the excess energy
requirements over existing hydro capacity and for standby purposes.   The
projected maximum demand and energy requirements demonstrated that, with
the commissioning of the second stage Tedzani Project, the interconnected
system would be capable of meeting peak demand and energy requirements
until  1980  after which  the generating capacity  to be provided by  the
project would be required.
Return on Investment
7.04        At appraisal the financial rate of return (FRR) on the project
was estimated at 9%, measuring benefits by using the average revenue per
kilowatt hour yielded at the 1977 tariff levels. However, had the benefits
reflected the average revenues assumed in the financial projections during
the project implementation period and then discounted back to the 1977
price level,  the rate of return on the project would have been higher,
since the tariffs in the financial projections were expected to increase in
real terms.   The financial  rate of return on the project has now been
l/ In 1977 the population figures for the three cities were 219,000, 98,000
and 24,000 respectively (Appendix A, para. 5).



- 13 -
estimated at about 10X using actual tariffs adjusted to 1982 price level.
The higher FRR than esttmated at appraisal, in spite of the higher cost of
the project, was more than offset by increases in the tariffs.   Although
the overall financial performance of ESCOM was less than satisfactory
during the implementation of this project, the higher FRR was earned in
spite of the lower growth in sales than estimated at; appraisal, because the
energy output from the project has been at the maximum level since the
Nkula plant is used as base toad.
VIIl.  BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance and Working Relationships
8.01         The Bank assisted ESCOM and the Government in preparing the
project in a manner that is financially and economically viable and would
attract financing from other institutions.   Therefore,  the credit/loans
were essential in securing the financing of the project.  The project has
fulfilled  its purpose from both technical  and  the  institution-building
points of view.   The financial earnings objectives have not been fully
achieved as expected. While ESCO generally promptLy made proposals to the
Government for approval of tariff revisions, such approval was inaviariably
delayed.   The Bank Group's assistance in procurenent-related matters was
helpful.
8.02        The Bank Group and ESCOM' cooperated well regarding the Bank's
supervisory  relationship.      The  project  supervision  was  regular  and
changes in supervision staff were minimal.   the Bank's prompt support of
the engineering consultant's change of construction method (para. 3.02) was
helpful.    ESCOM's  thriving  training  programs  and  training center were
successful and were aided by Bank funding and systematic guidance and
supervision.    The Bank  Group made  a  significant  contribution  to  the
project.  In future, further investments in power generation facilicies are
likely to be required.   The Bank Group support for such investments would
have  to  be  accompanied  by  further  improvenits  in  the  institutional
arrangements for the energy sector.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
OveralL Achievements
9.01         The main objectives of the project by and large have been
achieved.  The project plays a major role in efficient and reliable power
supply  in  Malawi.      Institution-building  efforts,  particularly  staff
training, were very successful.  The Bank Grotp lending was instrumental in
introducing various changes in ESCOM's planning operations and manageriaL
procedure but still much remains to be done in further power system
improvements.
Lessons Learned
9.02        The main lessons to be drawn from this lending operation are:
(i) transportation difficulties can be crucial for a landlocked country and
due allowances should be made in construction schedules and cost estimates;
(ii) the project demonstrated the importaace of employing good and



- 14 -
experienced consultants, regardless of the project size, who are able to
suitably modify the original design and improve methods of construction to
suit unforeseen circumstances when necessary and thus avert construction
delays; (iii) bad rock conditions can cause delays even in the excavation
of a very short tunnel; (iv) load forecast is greatly influenced by the
country's economic development, price increases, energy conservation and
demand management; and (v) the funding of a good training program and
facilities can show a substantial return within a short  period.   This
reinforces the more recent emphasis on development of local manpower as the
crucial contribution of Bank lending in Sub-Saharan Africa.
