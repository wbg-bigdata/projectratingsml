INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND REOOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES AUTHORITY
WAITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Liberian Public Utilities Authority (PUA) with the guarantee
of the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$4.7 million to help
finance generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The loan
would be for a term of 19 years, including a h-year period of grace.
Interest would be 7-1 L percent per annum.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In June 1970, the Bank made a first loan to PUA for the expan-
sion of its generating facilities (Loan No. 684-LBR).   One of the items
financed by that loan was a consultants' study of PUA's power transmis-
sion and distribution requirements. The study was completed in January
1971. The proposed loan will help finance transmission and distribu-
tion facilities, on the basis of the study's recommendations, as well
as further generating facilities. An appraisal mission visited Liberia
in February 1971.  Negotiations were held in iWashington on May 25-27,
1971. The delegation from the Government of Liberia and PUA was led by
the Honorable E. Taylor Major, Secretary of Public Utilities.
3.        The proposed loan would be the fourth for Liberia. A road
project financed under the first loan of $)4.25 million (Loan No. 368-LBR)
has been completed and the loan fully disbursed. A second loan for
$3.6 million was made in June 1969 (Loan No. 617-LBR) for the Monrovia
Port Project. Progress has been generally satisfactory, although there
has been some delay in revising port tariffs and strengthening the port
organization. The $7.4 million loan of June 1970 to PUA covered the
first phase of PUA's power generation program. This project is now
proceeding satisfactorily, after initial delays in procurement. All
tender documents have been issued and bids for most items have been re-
ceived. IFC has made one equity investment in Liberia of $248,950 in
the Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment.
4.        In the past, Bank lending has concentrated on infrastructure
investment. Future lending will focus rather on projects that will pro-
mote rural development and participation by Liberians in economically
productive activities. An education project was recently appraised and
should be ready for presentation towards the end of this year. This



project would be a first step in improving the quality and organization
of Liberian education. In agriculture, the Bank has experienced great
difficulty in identifying suitable projects.   In 1968, the Bank made a
technical assistance grant to Liberia to undertake a feasibility study
for a palm oil project. However, in the light of price expectations and
the conditions of production, it was felt that Liberia would be taking
excessive risks in proceeding with the project. In 1970, the Bank financed
a feasibility study for a rubber project.   In view of the striking growth
rate of the Liberian-owned rubber industry, this seered to be the most
prorfsing area for investment. However, the appraisal of the project in
June/July 1970 revealed consi.derable uncertainties concerning its econo-
mic and financial juztification, The practicability of a small pilot
project with a strong element of teclhical assistz:n^co is currently under
consideration. There are no other agricultural pzrojects prepared and,
despite ongoing a3sistance from the UNDP for the :evelopment of rice
cultivation, no alternative projects are likely to be ready for some
time.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.        The recelnt economic report on Liberia (Report No. AW-2h, "The
Current Economic Position and Prospects of Liberia", dated June 1, 1971)
described the Liberian economy as a dualistic one, with a prosperous
enclave sector composed of iron ore, rubber and forestry, and a large
under-developed sector consisting primarily of subsistence agriculture.
Tne enclave sector contributes about 38 percent of monetary GDP at
factor cost, and 90 percent of gross merchandise exports. Per capita
GDP is about $273; but with large factor payments abroad - some $90
million in 1970 - GNP per capita amounts to $213. This is relatively
high by African standards, but it obscures a highly uneven distribution
of income.
6.        In the past two years, the economy has grown at an average
annual rate of h percent in real terms.   Most of this growth originated
in the enclave sectors, particularly iron ore and logging. Outside these
sectors, growth and development continued at a slow pace, due to the lack
of defined programs and projects.   The Government is concerned about this
slow development and is in the process of defining its development ob-
jectives and priorities, a step which will be followed by the formulation
of a development program.
7.        In the next several years, public investment in Liberia is
estimated at an average of $17 million a year. Domestic sources are
projected to contribute $4-6 million a year. This leaves an average of
$11-13 million a year to be provided from external sources, including
the Bank Group and the U.S., which has been the major external donor to
Liberia.



- 3 -
8.        The improved fiscal and balance of payments position has
strengthened Liberia's creditworthiness. But continued caution must
be exercised in contracting new external debt on conventional terms.
Assuming a limited amount of new indebtedness, debt service in the
period 1971-1976 is expected to absorb about 12 percent of net export
earnings, i.e. net of factor payments abroad. In view of the country's
substantial exports, and since Liberia uses the U.S. dollar as its cur-
rency, there is no transfer problem as such; the real constraint is
rather the financial situation of the public sector. Debt service pay-
ments accounted for about 25-30 percent of public revenues in the past
five years and are expected to absorb 25 percent of prospective revenues
in the period 1971-1976. On the basis of present projections and even
assuming that the Government succeeds in increasing public savings over
current levels, Liberia therefore needs to obtain the bulk of its ex-
ternal financing requirements on concessionary terms, though there is
some margin for contracting conventional debt, expecially for revenue
earning projects. The proposed project, which will impose no strain on
the budget, is suitable for financing on conventional terms.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        In 1970, private sources of power, notably the mining companies,
generated 61 percent (463 Gigawatt hours - Gwh) of the total power con-
sumed in the country. PUA Drovided the remaining 39 percent (292 Gwh).
Most of PUA's power (277 Gwh) was generated by its Monrovia system,
i.e. the system serving a narrow coastal area from Robertsport to
Buchanan. PUA also generates and distributes electricity as agent of,
and with funds provided by, the Government in six secondary centers,
which are regional administrative headquarters of counties or districts.
10.       The Borrower, PUA, controlled by a 10-member Board of Directors
appointed by the President of Liberia, is a statutory corporation, es-
tablished in 1962, and charged with responsibility for the generation
and distribution of power. PUA was subsequently made responsible also
for operating the water and sewer departments, previously part of the
Public Works Department. The power division accounts for about 70
percent of PUA's assets and 85 percent of its revenues. Separate
accounts are kept for the Monrovia power system, secondary power cen-
ters, water and sewer operations.
11.       The proposed project, together with the project financed by
Loan No. 684-LBR, would enable PUA to meet power demand to the end of
1974. It would consist of procurement, installation and commissioning
of the fourth hydrogenerating unit at Mount Coffee (for which the civil
works were included in the project financed under the earlier loan);
and the improvement and expansion of the transmission and distribution
system in the Monrovia area. The total cost of the project is estimated
to be $6.4 million, of which the proposed Bank loan would finance the
external costs of $4.7 million, or 73 percent of project cost.



12.       PUA's power t .-ansmission and distribution network is unsatis-
factory. It is ovezCloaded, requires excessive maintenance, and gives
rise to high losses and frequent failures. The proposed project should
remedy these shortcomings, increase supply reliability, place greater
emphasis on system planning and establish a sound base for future growth.
Power demand grew at an annual rate of 22 percent during 1964-1970 and
growth during the next seven years is estimated at 13 percent per annum.
The improved reliabil-ity of service will be of particular importance to
PUA since it should provide industrial consumers writh an added induce-
ment to purchase power from PUA rather than install their own plant.
13.       The most economic way for PUA to meet its generating needs
over the next several years is by a combination of expanding its hydro-
generating plant at Mqount Coffee and installing gas turbine units at
Bushrod to firm up hydro power during the three-month dry season of
each year. The optimum timing for the introduction of further hydro-
generating units is a function of the growth of PUA#s demand and the
relative cost of operating the gas turbines. The fourth hydrogenerat-
ing unit at Mount Coffee is now scheduled to be commissioned in mid-
1974, a year earlier than was envisaged when Loan No. 684-LBR was
signed in 1970. The schedule has been advanced because energy sales
are now expected to develop more rapidly, following the signing of a
sales contract with the Bong Mining Company, and because of an increase
in the cost of fuel for the gas turbine units.
14.       The project financed by Loan No. 684-LBR included the civil
works for the third and fourth hydro units at Mount Coffee, and pro-
curement and installation of the third unit. Although the fourth unit
was not included in that project, the tender documents for the third
unit included the fourth unit as an option. Bidding for the two units,
which was carried out on an international basis, has boen c,'ipleted
and no further bidding should be necessary for the procarenc±ea.t of the
fourth unit to be financed by the proposed loan. For the r ronder of
the proposed project, specifications and tender documonits w 9. be
issued in September 1971 and the first contracts for tUe stpffir of
materials and equipment would be awarded in January 1972, A_- aal con-
struction will start in mid-1972, after receipt of matarials nrd equip-
ment which would be installed by PUA staff, under the supervision of the
project consultant.
15.       The internal financial rate of return of PUA's 1971-1974
development program, of which the proposed project forms an integral
part, is about 21 percent.
16.       The capital requirements of PUA's power division for 1971-
1974 are about $30 million, of which $20 million or two-thirds is
expected to be financed by borrowings and the remaining one-third, or



-5-
about $10 million, from internal sources. Taking into consideration
the proposed Bank loan and Loan No. 684-LBR, and a loan in 1970 from
the African Development Bank, this program would have future borrow-
ings of about $7 million to be arranged in 1973, mainly for the second
phase of the transmission and distribution program.
17.       Since 1963, PUA has had a contract with consultants for tech-
nical assistance and advice in management. After some difficulties
arising from the excessive involvement of the management team in day-
to-day operations to the neglect of forward planning, a reorganization
is being implemented. Qualified Liberians are being given responsi-
bility for management and the team is acting in an advisory capacity.
A Liberian Assistant Manager has already been appointed and the ap-
pointment of a Liberian Manager should be possible by November 1972
as agreed under Loan No. 684-LBR. Thereafter, it should be possible
to begin phasing out expatriate assistance.
18.       PUA's present financial position is weak, with a high debt/
equity ratio (77:23), low debt service coverage (1.1 times) and a low
return on net assets in operation (5.6 percent). With a recent in-
crease in power tariffs to produce 16 percent more gross operating
revenues, PUA's power financing plan is satisfactory.   The rates of
return on average net fixed assets in operation are expected to improve,
from 5.6 percent in 1970 to 9.9 percent in 1976 for PUA as a whole,
and from 6.6 percent to 12.4 percent for power operations alone. Debt
service coverage after 1971 is expected to be 1.5 times or better.
The debt/equity ratio is expected to improve to 67:33 by 1976.
19.       A number of covenants from Loan No. 684-LBR relating to
PUA's performance have been incorporated in the draft Loan Agreement.
These include covenants on the employment of engineering and manage-
ment consultants, and limitations on the payment of dividends during
the loan disbursement period and on the incurrence of debt. PUA would
also undertake not to apply revenues from power sales to its non-
power activities and not to extend its activities outside power, water
and sewerage unless it could first satisfy the Bank that it would not
thereby affect the efficiency of its power operations. In the draft
Guarantee Agreement the Government covenants to continue its policy
of financing secondary power centers without cost to PUA and to make
good any deficits on PUA's water and sewer operations.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMETS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Public Utilities
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Liberia
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The agreements follow substantially the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements under the first power project (Loan No. 684-LBR).
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMSINDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
