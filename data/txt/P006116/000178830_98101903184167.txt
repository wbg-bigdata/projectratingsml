INTERN.ATIOiHiL DEVEFL-FT H..T ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
BOLIVIA FOR A THIRD LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the followJing report and recommendation on
a proposed development credit in various currencies equivalent
to US$6.8 million to the Republic of Bolivia for a third
livestock project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        IDA first associated itself with the Bolivian livestock
sector through a $2 million credit made on May 26, 1967, in order
to help Bolivia realize the excellent opportunities that existed
for expanding production in the Beni Department of beef for export.
The progress was smoother and faster than expected. The Beni
ranchers were keenly interested in borrowing for ranch development
and in the specialized technical services provided. As a result
the credit proceeds were committed within two years from the
effective date and, in the middle of 1969, it became clear that
additional funds were necessary to preserve the momentum.
3.        The Bolivian Government applied to IDA in August 1969
for a new credit for a second and larger project, comprising, in
addition to a continued lending program for beef ranch development,
processing, storage and marketing of meat and an initial program
for small holder sheep development on the altiplano. The Government
and IDA recognized that appraisal and discussion of this project
would take considerable time. Consequently, it was agreed to
seek the approval of the Executive Directors for a small, $1.4
million, credit which would be made on the same terms and conditions
as the first credit and would finance an interim long-term lending
program exclusively. This second credit was approved in December
1969 and signed on January 13, 1970. Its proceeds are now expected
to be fully committed by October 1971.
4.        Simultaneously, the Government proceeded with the
preparation of the proposed third project. After project appraisal
in November 1969, discussions were held with the Government about
its livestock and meat policies. The negotiation of the proposed
credit took place in Washington at the beginning of January 1971,
with a delegation headed by Mr. Fernando Barthelemy of the Ministry
of Finance and comprising Mlr. Alberto Valdes Loma, General
Manager of Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB), Mr. Rafael Oviedo
of the Ministry of Agriculture, and Mr. Ewaldo Bruckner, Vice
President of the Beni Ranchers' Federation. However, the
presentation of the credit to the Executive Directors had to be
postponed in view of discussions between the Government, BAB, and



the Beni Ranchers' Federation about certain requests by some
ranchers for temporary relief frcm interest payments on previous
loans made by BAB and the Central Bank. This matter has now been
resolved satisfactorily with relatively minor rescheduling of
interest by BAB.
5.        The status as of March 31, 1971 of previous IDA credits
and the one Bank loan is as follows:

1/ Not yet effective
The power and livestock projects have been and continue to be
executed punctually and efficiently, and no delays have occurred
in the disbursement of the respective credits. Conditions of
effectiveness for the July 22, 1969 pipeline loan had not been
fully met by October 17, 1969 when the Government nationalized
the Bolivian Gulf Oil Company.  In late 1969, after the Government
assured the Bank that it intended to pay reasonable compensation
to Gulf, discussions bega-n among the several parties with a view
to reconstituting the project. The compensation issue was settled
by decree to the satisfaction of Gulf in September 1970, and over
the past three months, the agreements for the pipeline loan and
related matters have been renegotiated. The revised loan is
expected to be presented to the Executive Directors for approval
in the next few weeks. The reconstitution of the pipeline project
should lead to a substantial improvement in the investment climate
in Bolivia, as well as in its export earnings.
6.        The Bank is currently acting as Executing Agency for
the United Nations Development Programme which is financing technical
assistance to the Bolivian railways. This should result in organi-
zational and operational improvements and in the formulation of an
investment program which could form the basis for a future credit by
IDA for the railways. The Government has also indicated that
it would like further IDA assistance for the power sector, but
discussions are in abeyance pending Government action on power rates.



- 3 -
In March 1971, a Bank mission visited Bolivia to study the mining
and metallurgical sector and to determine how the Bank Group might
assist its development. The mission's report is in preparation.
Consideration of an education project is in abeyance because of
the difficulty which the Government would have to make a financial
contribution to it.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Third Livestock Development
Project" (PA-51a) is attached.

9.        Agriculture in Bolivia serves mainly subsistence needs.
It employs more than half of the working population but contributes
little to export earnings. Following redistribution of land
after the 1952 revolution, agricultural production stagnated for
some time but there have been significant increases in production
in recent years, particularly in sugar, rice and cotton in the
lcwlands. While the emphasis in past agricultural development
has been on import substitution, future agricultural development
will have to be centered increasingly on the output of commodities
with good export prospects, thus strengthening Bolivia's balance
of payments as well as providing higher incomes and employment.
The outlook for beef exports is particularly favorable. Beef
production in the Beni Department, where there are 10-15 million
hectares of open grassland with good rainfall, has increased
significantly in recent years. lWith better herd and pasture
management, and the availability of long-term funds for ranch
development, the ranchers in the Beni should be able to increase
further the supply of beef for export markets. However, if Bolivia
is to exploit the export possibilities effectively, it will be
necessary to restructure and expand present marketing arrangements.
10.       The project will improve pasture and herd management on
about 250 beef ranches through long and short-term lending by
BAB and the provision of technical services. Long-term loans to
ranchers will be for 12 years including a 4-year grace period.
4Ahile short-term loans were limited to maturities of up to 12
months under the earlier projects and were not financed by IDA,
the present credit will assist in financing such loans for
maturities of up to 24 months in order to meet ranchers' working
capital requirements more adequately. The project is expected to
increase production in approximately 10 years by 10,400 tons of
beef per year, of which a large proportion would be exported,
with foreign exchange earnings of $5.5 million equivalent. The
lending program for beef producers will cover not only the Beni
Department, but also the Pando Department and scme adjacent
provinces of other departments of north-western Bolivia. The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on April 21, 1970 made a
$5 million loan for livestock development in the eastern depart-
ments of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija. In order to ensure
uniform standards of project administration, the Project Director
in charge of technical services for the IDA-financed projects has
been placed in charge also of the IDB project.
11.       In addition to measures designed to increase production
of beef, the project includes the employment of consultants to
advise on cattle slaughter, processing, transport and marketing,
and on the organization of meat grading and inspection. Once the
work of the consultants is completed, BAB will finance with
proceeds of the Credit the construction of slaughterhouses and
cold storage plants. As a condition of effectiveness of the
Credit, the Government will abolish all quantitative restrictions
on the export of beef, and such restrictions will not be reintroduced,



- 5 -
unless they are temporary and the Government demonstrates to IDA
that they are imposed because of emergency ccnditions. The
Government has also undertaken that, with due regard to the
recommendations of the ccnsultants, it will adopt a beef price
policy acceptable to IDA establishing appropriate price differen-
tials between different grades and qualities of meat. Moreover,
in view of the importunce of air transport as virtually the sole
means of moving meat from the Beni, the Government will take
measures to ensure the provision of adequate air transport and to
keep air freight tariffs at an appropriate level.
12.       The sheep industry, concentrated in the heavily populated
but low-income highland, also offers favorable prospects of increased
production. The utilization of this potential is dependent, as
in the case of beef, on improved techniques and the availability
of long-term funds for new investment. The project will improve
pasture and herd management on about 150 sheep properties, owned
by both cooperatives and individual farmers, through long and
short-term lending programs on terms similar to those that apply
to loans to beef ranchers. The project is expected to increase
annual production, in approximately 10 years, by 1,450 tons of
mutton and 575 tons of wool. The additional wool production would
have a value of approximately $410,000 and could replace imports;
the additional mutton, valued at $850,000 would be consumed
locally. The sheep sub-project will have considerable social
benefits, providing additional income to over 3,000 families on
existing small holdings in the economically depressed highlands.
13.       The cost of the entire project is estimated at US$11
million equivalent, of which the foreign exchange component is
estimated at 62 percent. The proposed IDA credit of US$6.8 million
corresponds to this component. The local costs of the project will
be covered by BAB, the ranchers, the abattoir companies, and, in
the case of consulting services, the Government budget.
14.       The Government-owned Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB),
through which the proceeds of the credit will be channelled, has been
by far the most important source of long and medium-term agri-
cultural credit and has served as a vehicle for assistance from
the United States and the IDB. It has a wide network of branches,
an experienced staff and has disbursed the earlier IDA credits in
a satisfactory manner. Although BAB suffered losses in the 'fifties,
its situation has since improved. To improve BAB's liquidity
position and help it to make its contribution to the project, the
Government will relend the proceeds of the credit to BAB on
terms permitting the capitalization of most of the interest
during a 5-year grace period. IWJith a view to improving its
efficiency, BAB will consult with IDA concerning steps it will
take to increase the number and responsibility of middle level
executive personnel. Relending of IDA funds to ranchers iwill be
at 12 percent interest. In order to place a floor under the real
interest rate paid by ranchers, the Government has undertaken



- 6 -
that, if the annual rate of inflation in Bolivia exceeds 8 percent,
it will introduce indexing arrangements satisfactory to IDA.
15.       Individual purchases of goods for on-ranch investment
would be handled through existing commercial channels, which are
well established and provide adequate competition. All purchases
of breeding livestock, much of which will probably be imported,
would be subject to the approval of the Project Director, with
respect to quality, suitability and price. Plant, equipment
supplies and contracts for the construction and renovation of
abattoirs and cold storage facilities would be subject to
international competitive bidding.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Bolivia and the Association, a draft Project Agreement
between the Association and Banco Agricola de Bolivia, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       In addition to the undertakings described in paragraphs
11 and 14 above, the draft agreements contain provisions
normally included in livestock projects and followl the pattern
of the earlier agreements relative to livestock development
in Bolivia.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.       A report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Bolivia" (WH-199) dated May 19, 1970 was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 1, 1970.   A new economic mission
returned from Bolivia in early March, and a summary of its
preliminary findings is attached.
19.       Bolivia reached agreement in 1969 œith the holders of
its external dollar bonds on a new schedule of debt service.   After
certain delays, funds have now been transferred for bringing payments
up-to-date under this agreement. The settlement following the
nationalization of the assets of the Bolivian Gulf Oil Company has
been referred to in paragraph 5 above. In the first part of 1971,
Bolivia nationalized the assets of two U.S.-owned mining concerns,
the International Metals Processing Company, and the Matilde Mine
Corporation. In both cases, the nationalization decrees provided
for compensation to the former owners, and steps for arriving
at the valuation of the assets are being taken.

PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEHENT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed Development Credit Agreement.

PERMANDUM ON BECrT ECONOMIC DEvEOPmENTS iN BoLivIA
1.        A report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Bolivia" (W1i-199) dated Ny 19, 1970, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 1, 1970. The report noted that the Bolivian econonm
grew rapidly during the 1960's and identified rising investment and ex-
ports as the main factors contributing to this growth. The report con-
cluded that continued efforts to raise rural living standards and raise
the level of investment were required to realize Bolivia's substantial
long-term growth potential and to distribute more widely the benefits
of economic progress. An economic mission visited Bolivia in February/
March 1971 and its report is in preparation. The following paragraphs
present a preliminary summary of the mission's findings.
Output Growth, Income and Em.oyment
2.        Boliviats rapid economic growth which averaged almost 7 percent
annually during 1962-68, began to slow down in 1969. This slowdown appears
to have been carried over into 1970 with the result that GDP growth rate
fell to some b percent. -With a population increase of around 2.5 percent,
some additional improvemernt in incore per head was made possible.
3.        Underlying the recent slowdowr in economic growth was a decline
in investment. Public investment fell due to a shortage of funds, while
lack of confidence following nationalizing of Gulf Oil properties appears
to have exercised a restraining influence on private investment. A full
recession was avoided, however, due to strong export expansion: the U.S.
dollar value of exports in 1970 rose by 13 percent over 1969, following
an irncrease of 10 percen-t in the preceding year.
4.        Despite the rapid economic growth in the 1960's, Bolivia has
remained a verT poor country, and the rural income situation of the major-
ity of the population has probably not improved very much. Although the
national income statistics are weak, there are other indicators which sup-
port the validity of this conclusion: (i) cash wages paid to miners in-
creased only moderately under the new system of reruneration introduced in
1965 for workers in COIaBOL, the state mining enterprise; (ii) as a result
of a policy of austerity pursued by the public sector, which is the largest
single employer, no general wage and salary readjustment was granted after
the 1957 devaluation until late in 1970; (iii) observation of the standard
of living of 70 percent of the total population living in the rural areas,
principally in the Altiplano, suggests that any improvement which may have
taken place rust have been minimal; (iv) open unemployment has increased
since 1967 when it reached the high level of about 20 percent of the labor
force.
Public Finances
5.        Current reverue of the Central Government rose by 23 percent in
1970, of which 85 percent originated in taxes on mineral exports whose
prices were exceptionally favorable.  The 1970 revenue increase was con-
siderably more than the average increase in recent years. Current



- 2 -
expenditures, also increased sharply (17 percent) as compared to recent
years, but they rose less than the revenues. These trends helped reduce
the deficit on current budgetary account to $bl5 million in 1970, from
$b5l million in 1969 and an annual average of $b83 million in 1965-1968.
6.        The beneficial effect of this improvement in Central Government
savings was, however, offset by a reduction in aggregate profits of public
enterprises from $b420 million in 1969 to $b395 million in 1970. This re-
duction was caased by start-up losses of ENAF, the government-owned tin
smelter, and is expected to be temporary. Decentralized Government agencies
maintained their savings at the average level of the previous two years.
Aggregate public sector savings in 1970 are estimated at $b482 million or
in excess of 4 percent of GNP. Although this represents a drop from the
peak attained in 1969 it is nonetheless considerably above the average
attained in recent years.
7.        Public sector savings financed about LO percent of public invest-
ment in 1965-70. This proportion is expected to fall to 31 percent in 1971,
primarily because the investment for which the Government is responsible
has increased since the hydrocarbons sector passed entirely into public
ownership.
Balance of Payments
8.        The recent trends in the balance of payments were influenced by
exceptionally favorable terms of trade. This trend continued into 1970
and largely as a result of this exports in 1970 exceeded those of the pre-
vious year by some 13 percent. Tin reached peak prices during the first
half of 1970, antimonyts price rose to a level about three times higher
than that of 1969, and the price for tungsten also reached record levels.
In addition, exports of other minerals grew rapidly, even in some cases
like zinc, for which there was no special price increase. Thus, out of
an increase of US$36 million in mineral exports in 1970, US$26 million
was due to price increases, and US$10 million to volume. Non-traditional
exports, consisting mainly of agricultural products, grew by 52 percent
over 1969. Cotton provided most of the increase, with other non-tradi-
tional exports growing by close to 9 percent.
n,.       The slowing down in the rate of growth of economic activity men-
tioned earlier had its repercussions on the demand for imports. Imports,
which grew by an average rate of almost 11 percent between 1964-68, dropped
to 5 percent in 1969 and to only one-half this rate in 1970. Even this
small increase in imports in 1970 of under US$5 million created a problem
in spite of the rising export earnings. This occurred because disburse-
ments of foreign loans declined due to the weak financial position of the
public sector, foreign private investment disappeared, and there was a
continuation of capital flight. As a consequence, total improvement in
international reserves amounted to only US$3.1 million during 1970 after
taking into account allocation of US$[.9 million of fl-F Special Drawing



Rights. By the end of 1970, the Central Bankl' net reserve position was
equivalent to two and one-half months of merchandise imports.
Prospects
10.       There are several indicators pointing towards improved economic
performance in the future, given political stability. Unless the U.So
Government makes releases from its tin stockpile, price prospects for tin
are considered to be favorable, as are those for other minerals. Another
factor is the reconstitution of the gas pipeline project which will add
to investment and exports, and should boost private sector confidence. A
third favorable factor is the Government's recently approved first com-
ponent of a tax reform program which aims at underpinning higher leve)sof
public investment. This factor is of particular importance since success
in reaching a high growth rate depends on Bolivia's ability to raise do-
mestic savings and additional external resources. The willingness of
external sources to increase their assistance will be enhanced if Bolivia
can demonstrate that it is making maximum savings effort.  The Government
intends to increase the proportion of public sector savings in total
public investment to around 45 percent by 1976. This would entail rais-
ing public sector savings from their current level of about $bO.5 billion
to $bl.2 billion. As a first step it plans an ambitious increase in
savings of almost 37 percent over the estimate for 1971. In fact, there
are considerable opportunities for increasing public savings at the
Central Government level, both in terms of current revenues and expend-
itures, as well as in most other public sector agencies. The urgency of
further fiscal efforts is dictated not only by the need to finance a
rising proportion of an increasing level of public investment, but also
by the fact that, as noted above, past improvement was in part the re-
sult of special gains. It remains to be seen whether political circum-
stances will permit the Government to achieve its plans.
External Debt
11.       As of December 31, 1970, Bolivia had US$593 million of external
public debt (including undisbursed), of which US$64 million are repayable
in local currency. Service on this debt, US$2b.1 million, represented
about 11 percent of exports of goods and services in 1970. This rela-
tively low percentage reflects the fact that in excess of three-fifths
of existing debt was contracted on concessional terms. Service on the
existing public external debt is expected to decline only gradually, while
at the same time new debt will be incurred. Preliminary long-term pro-
jections based on the assumption of accelerated growth indicate that
service on both the existing and the new public external debt would reach
the high level of 20 percent of exports in 1983 even if very favorable
terms are obtained for nei debt. This projection assumes increased
capital inflow, a part of which will have to consist of supplierst



credits on conventional terms. It also assumes the growth of exports at
an annual rate of about 8 percent, compared to the exceptionally high
rate of 12 percent in the sixties. The projected debt service burden
and Boliviavs poverty suggest that most official external capital assist-
ance should be provided on soft terms.
