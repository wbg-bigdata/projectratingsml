                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         On April 9, 2013 an additional financing to the PDMAS in an amount of US$20 million was approved for the Food Security and Livestock Support Project. This grant is funded from
                         the Food Price Crisis Response Program Multi-Donor Trust Fund (FPCR -MDTF). It will further contribute to increased rice production and improved competitiveness of livestock
                         production in project areas. The project closing date was also extended to December 31, 2014.
