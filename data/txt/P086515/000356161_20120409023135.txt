                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. The Ministry of Railways, through the Ministry of Finance, requests (i) an extension of the
loan Closing Date and (ii) the reallocation of proceeds between two loan categories. The Bank
team has appraised the request, found it appropriate, and proposes acceptance of the request.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The Bank Board approved a USD 200 million loan for the Third National Railway on
January 23, 2007 and it became effective on May 16, 2007. The project will electrify, double
track, and raise the speed (primarily through alignment revisions) of a 254 km existing railway.
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in expanding the capacity of its railway
system to meet the growing demand for transport of people and goods between Guizhou and
Yunnan provinces. The project lies in two of the China’s 18 railway administration. The
Kunming Railway Administration portion of the project (44% of the line by length), mostly in
Yunnan Province, opened for traffic in December 2012 and the operations of this portion of the
line have been successful. The entire Chengdu Railway Administration portion of the project,
mostly in Guizhou Province, is expected to open to traffic by September 2012 with the critical
path being the construction of the 12.24 km SanLian Tunnel (Contract W4). Sections of the
Chengdu portion have already opened to traffic and operation has been successful. With the
completion of the SanLian Tunnel the entire line is expected to open to traffic by December 31,
2012.

3. The Bank’s financing is used for civil works, equipment, and material together with technical
assistance. There are nine civil works contracts which four are financed by the Bank. Of the
four financed by the Bank, three have been successfully completed and the loan disbursed. The
one remaining civil works contract (Contract W4) includes the SanLian Tunnel. The technical
assistance is complete and expenditure against the goods contracts is approximately 70%
complete. The Bank financed disbursement has for most of the project been ahead of projection
but has slowed in recent months. Disbursement is currently at 87% against the loan of $200
million with a two month lag (approximately 10%).

4. The project implementation status for the project is currently satisfactory. Issues that arose
during implementation that were related to social safeguards have since been resolved.
Compensation rates that were originally deemed to be less than those specified in the
Resettlement Action Plan have been augmented and are now considered acceptable to the Bank.
Remedial compensation measures were completed in early 2011 for the Yunnan Province part of
the project and in early 2010 for the Guizhou Province portion of the project.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

5. The following changes were requested by the Ministry of Finance in a letter dated January 4,
2012 (see attachment). Please note that the request from the Ministry of Finance failed to show


                                              -1-
the correct amount of the loan allocated to the ‘(4) Interest and other charges during
construction’ Category. It should be $431, 113.84 not zero. This has been discussed with the
Ministry of Finance and they agree.

   Extension of the Closing Date. The Closing Date has been requested to be extended by one
    year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The extension is needed to complete the
    remaining civil works contract (Contract W4) and complete related contract expenditures.

    It is proposed that paragraph 2 in Part B of Section IV of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement
    be amended to read as follows:

    “The Closing Date is June 30, 2013.?

   Reallocation between Categories. As the Loan is approaching closure, it is requested that a
    reallocation of funds between Categories be undertaken to move remaining funds in
    Categories where expenditures are complete or nearing completion to the Works category
    where the civil works is still under construction. Civil works not financed through the loan
    will be financed through counterpart financing including debt raised through commercial
    borrowing. Specifically, the proceeds of the Loan are requested to be reallocated by
    increasing to $164,368,886.16 the amount allocated to Category (1) “Works?, by decreasing
    to $35,000,000 the amount allocated to Category (2) “Goods?, by decreasing to $200,000 the
    amount allocated to Category (3) “Consultants’ services?, and by decreasing to zero the
    amount allocated to Category (5) “Unallocated?.

    It is proposed that the table following paragraph 2 in Part A of Section IV of Schedule 2 to
    the Loan Agreement be amended to read as shown below under the header “Proposed
    Revision?.

  The Loan was amended by letter to China’ Ministry of Finance dated July 25, 2008 and countersigned by the
Ministry of Finance on July 31, 2008. The amendment increased the percentage of expenditures to be financed in
Category (1) “Works? to 100%. In addition, the proceeds of the Loan were reallocated by increasing to
$137,568,886.16 the amount allocated to Category (1) “Works?, by decreasing to $56,000,000 the amount allocated
to Category (2) “Goods?, by decreasing to $431,113.84 the amount allocated to Category (4) “Interest and other
charges during construction? and by decreasing to $5,000,000 the amount allocated to Category (5) “Unallocated?.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

6. The Bank team has undertaken an appraisal of the proposed restructuring and confirms that
with this request the Loan continues to be used for approved purposes. In addition, the Bank
team confirms that the Project, as proposed to be modified, remains justified in accordance with
the project documents, the requirements of relevant Bank policies are met, and the implementing
arrangements are satisfactory.

7. The Bank team has also concluded that this request will not modify the project’s
development objective nor affect the achievement of the objective. It also does not involve a
change in the safeguard category, and it will not trigger a new safeguard category. Further, this
request is not a request for use of Project Cost Savings as defined in the Bank’s Operational
Policy 13.25 as there has not been an unexpected drop in the overall portion of the project
financed by the Bank and there has been no change in project scope. As the project scope has
not change there is no change to the project Procurement Plan. The Bank team has confirmed
that there are neither outstanding financial management issues nor other outstanding project
related issues that may cause this proposed restructuring not to be approved. Financial reports
and statements required by the Loan Agreement have been received by the Bank and deemed
acceptable. Nonetheless, the request to reallocate between loan categories and extend the closing
date does constitute a Level Two restructuring in accordance with the Bank’s Operational
Memoranda, Project Restructuring: New Procedures (Revised), dated November 18, 2009.
