751ee= De=am:  Ihe project has four components: (i) a u  lgt'   compont (US$1.4
'million) to complete implementation of recent policy ari regulatory
reformas esential to private sector performance (enlargement of the role
of the guihe unique; upgrading of the national accounting plan for
enterprisa; modernization of legal texts on corporate rights and
bankrupcy); (ii) an Intiutinal suor coonm nt (US$S8.9 million)
targeted to: (1) non-financial private enterprises (technical and
management assistance, training); (2) financial intermediaries (external
independent audits, financial and institutional development programs and
training); (3) professional associations (assistance in revision of statutes,
office technology, management information systems, training); and (4)
government agencies (including BEP, DNAE, and DNI) (revamped
information systema, legal and regulatory framework for privatization,
training); (iii) a studl oomW=t (UJS$ 0.6 million) to explore options
to deepen the Malian ftinancial system in the areas of: urban mutual
savings and credit schemes, and housing finance, and to prepare an
overall financial sector strategy; and Qiv) a communication compomt
(US$0.2 million) to disseminate information on business services to
frequently disadvantaged groups (women, rural businesses) and elicit
participation by mral service suppliers. The sub-component to provide
technical and management assistance to private enterprises will bc of a
pilot nature and administered by a private agency (Assoclatlon de

IDA.
B_uuIIta mmi 11.1: 'Inis project specifically aims at improving the private sector'a ability to
respond to the policy reforms underway and enhancing its prospecta for
leading the growdh of Mali's economy. It will improve the regu'Itory
infrastructure for private sectr operations as well as the functioning of
key private sector support institutions (including both professional
associations and relevant government agencies). The use by private



- il -
enterprisas of the business services administered by APEP should
onhance their operational capabi!ities. It is also expected that the project
would have a demonstration effect that will foster the development of a
dynamic and self-sufficient local consulting and training market. The
project wil also support the on-going PE privatlzation process by up-
grading the regulatory framework and providing technical assistance to
BEP. Additionally, the support to the bnlks and the studies componeat
have been speciflcally designed to achieve a double objective, namely,
inducin; institutional and financial strengdienlng of the banking sector
and setting the stage for future deepening of Mali's financial system.
The principai risk relates to the sustainability r.i uNe recent political
demcratization and the maintenance of a policy framework supportive
to private sector development. Ibis risk is lessened by the new
Government's commitment to continued policy reform and to private
sector promotion, as demonstrated by its recent signature of a Policy
Framework Paper and appointment of a Minisre DélEgu6 pour la
Promotion de l7nltave Privée in the Prime Minister's Office. To
furiher minimize this risk, tie project team has put particular emphasis
on obtaunhng close cooperation and intensive participstion of a wide range
of economic agents in Mali. Ihe focus on i-gacity building and
dnstitutional development activities fiurth  isolates the success of the
project from short-term policy uncertainties.
Another rirk existh diat APEP would misuse n.,. onsiderable
-ndependence in administering the sub-component to provide technical
and management assistance to non-finar.cial private enteprises. Ibis risk
is reduced by: (i) prior review and approval by IDA of APEP's
Procedures Manual, which wil be part of the Agreement under which
APEP will administer the sub-component; (i) agreement obtaiaed at
negodations that the Director General's appointment and performance
must be acceptable to IDA; and (Mii) the proposed supervision schedule,
in particular semi-annual reviews and audits, which will provide for
frequent opportun{ties to intervene in case of observed deficiencies in the
administration of the sub-component.

1.01         Mali is z '8st, lind1jcked, and resource-poor country located in the Sahelian zone of
Western Africa. Only about a quarter of its 1.2 million square kilometers are arable. Nearly 90%
of the population, estimated ^, -bout 8.5 million in 1990, is dependent on the agricultural sector
which accounts for rougely 50% of GDP. Per %.;pita income is estimated at US$280 in 1991 and
social indicators, such as life expectancy, primary school enrollment rates and access to basic health
services, are among the lowest in the world. lhe weak human resource base represents a formidable
obstacle to future growth. Mali's economic performance is highly constrained by a narrow natural
resource base consisting essentially of mmnerals, livestock and the Niger river, and the legacy of
inappropriate past policies, including inefficient public resource management and distordions in the
structure of economic incentives. Growth in the agricultural sector is conditioned by low rainfall,
I ngile soils, and low-productivity traditional technologies. These problems are compounded by high
pupi dion growth (estimated at 2.5% per annum) which puts severe pressure on both the limited
Pl r., cesource base and the financial resources available for providing basic public services.
1.2          It is only rectntly that the Government of Mali has recogaized the importance of the
oie of the privace sectir in achieving sustainable economic growth. Until the late 1980s, the private
sctor was view d witL uspicion, and was adversely affected by excessive regulation and a policy
bias toward public oect'r enterprises (PEs). As discussed later (para. 1.30-1.36), this resulted in
severe constrai.s in et  wailability to private business of financial and human resources, and key
support services. On the policy/regulatory front: prices of all but a few products had been rigidly
controlled; import and ;xport monopolies granted to key public companies had discouraged
competition from private tu-.sinesaes; rigid Government controls on employee hiring and firing had
inblbited the capacity of managers of private enterprises to recruit and retain qualified workers; and
biases in the investment, labor and commercial codes which regulated business activity had ensured
that local private enterprises could not survive in the then existing busines environment unlesu
granted special fiscal advantages and other incentives. During this period of rigid controls, most of
the research, consultancy, and business promotion firms were Government-owned or controlled and
of questionable quality. Reliable technical assistance services were virtually unavailable. A public
sector bias in the Government-controlled development bank (which monopolized foreign lines of credit
destined to finance investment) hindered access of private enterprises to bank credit.
1.03         The combination of these policy bases and excessive regulation of the economy
severely restricted the growth of the private enterprise sector. A study carried out as part of the
preparation of this Project estimated that over the period 1968-1988, some 25% of the total number
;f prIvate enterprisa failed each year, and that the more successful private enterprises were small,
in sectors of litdle interestto the public sector (bakerles, restaurants, and similar small scale activities),
or in the inoSrmal sector.
1.04         Between 1986 and 1988, a series of budgetary crises dramatically reduced
GovernmeWt's ability to continue subsidizing the PE sector. Ibis combined with the PEs' own
inefficiency and lack of economic viability and financial discipline to precipitate their bankruptcy1 and

that of the Banque de Ddwloppement du Mai (BDM), the national development bank. The
Govermment of Mali (GOM) therefore decided to redresa the public sector domination and bias in its
economy and improve private investment incentives. In 1988, it began lmplementing a serles of
policy and regulatory reforms, supported by the IMF, IDA, asd oth'r bilateral and multilateral donors
2. As part of the program, a reform of Goverument expenditures has reduced the adininstration's
debts towards the banking system, eliminating the main source of private sector crowding out from
the financial markets. A sweeping pricing reform program has taken Mali from a situation where aUl
except a few prices were controlled (prior to 1986), to one where the pricing of all commodities were
completely liberalized (July 1992). The investment, labor and commercial codes have ail undergone
revision, with the result that the exemptions from trade asd other taxes, which PEs enjoyed to the
detriment of private enterprises have ceased, and all economic activities now receive equal treatment
under the law. Import monopolles have been abolished. Restrictions on employment which
previously obliged private employers to recruit employees through Government's Qfoe de la Main
d'Oeuvre et de l'Emploi (ONMOE) have been eased. Taxation rates have been reduced on payroll
(f&om 15% to 7.5%) and on business profits (from 50% to 45%). Previously identified biases against
women and foreigners (in obtaining work permits or startiung businesses) have been eliminated. Tie
admmistrative procedures regulating business activity bave also been simplified. Import/export
licensing has been replaced with a registiation system. One-stop windows (guichets uniques) have
been introduced since 1989 for handling internetional trade transactions and for setting up new
enterprises. TIhe commercial tribunals (in Bamako, Kayes and Mopti), the Customs Tariff
Committee, and the National Tax Commission (for contesting administrative decisions) envisaged
under the Tax Code have been revived. Automatic features in the procedures for accessing benefits
under the investment code, for registering imports/exports, and for obtaining approvals from the
guichets uniques help to ensure speedy handling of business requests.
1.05         A key component of the reform program has been the attempt to restructure los-
making PEs, the BDM and the postal savings and checklng system (Coptes Cheques Postau  -
CCP). Government also decided not o engage in any new commercial or industrial ventures. As
part of this effort, aUl PEs were given managerial autonomy; financial discipline was introduced; and
the existing cross-arrears among PEs and between PEs asd Goverument were settled. Iue BDM was
privatized; the CCP was in 1990-91 restructured into the ScW  des ComWtes Ch»ques Postoau et de
la Ca*sse d»Epargne (SCPCE) (para. 1.26>; 15 PEs considered non-viable were liquldated; 14 were
privatized, albeit with mixed results (para. 1.30>, 6 were subjected to rehabilitation, and a follow-up
divestiture program was adopted for 19 others.
1.06         These reforms have begun to yield results asd significantly enhanced the environment
at the macro-economic level for private business. Real GDP growth averaged 4% per am,m between
1985 and 1990. 'Mere bas been a discernible increase in private investor confidence since the
instiution of the liberallation program, as evidenced by the number of recent enquiries and
negotations by foreign firms interested in pursuing, or at lent disussing, investment opporwnities
in Mali. Small but incieasing remittances from Maians abroad into the local banling syatem are
resulting in an infusion of much needed liquidity.

B. Overview of the Private Seetor
Prvate EnteRprises
1.07         For puiposes of this Project and in line with the definition adopted during
Government's divestiture progiam, the Malian private sector is defined as lncluding all those
enterprises (in an> area of economic activity), whose ownership is at least 80% held by non-
government interests. It therefore excludes the Government-owned PEs and those mixed companles
(SEM) in which the Government's share-holding exceeds 20%. As a group, over the past decade the
growth in the numbers of private enterprises has out-paced that of the public and mixed enterprise
sectors. An industrial sector survey undertaken in 1989 by the Direction Nationale des InduM*s
(DNI) revealed that whie privately-owned enterprises made up 45% of all industrial firms in 1981,
by 1988 that number had grown to 64%. The increase in the proportion of private industrial firms
was a reflection of the de facto failure and closure of several PE factories during the 1980 (in coment,
agricultural equipment, brick manufacturing, etc.) even before the recent formal PE privatizations and
liquidations. Ihis trend is expected to continue, as Gowernment expands its PE restructuring
program. Despite past biases, Mali's private sector enterprises account for the largest share of past
growth in employment and output. They employ over 90% of Mali's working popu lation and produce
a similar proportion of the country's output.
1.08         Mali's private enterprises run the gamut of the business spectrum, from small
backyard farms, family-run bakeries, two-person metal forges, restaurants, fruit packaging
cooperatives, medium-sized vegetable canneries, to large factories milling flour, weaving textiles,
producing batteries, or mining gold. Other than farming and trading, the key sub-sectors are food
processing, beverages, tobacco, construction, transport, and mining. Mali's modest industrial sector
(accounting for about 5% of GDP in 1990) is largely based on processing agricultural products
(paper, wood-working, textile, leather and clothing related goeds). Services comprising warehousing,
garages, banking and insurance make up the balance. Private enterprises in Mali are geographically
concentrated in the Bamako district, which houses close to three-quarters of them.
1.09         Private enterprises are essentially of small or medium size. They are estimated to
account for: (i) ail businesses of under ten workers; (à) 90% of businesses with ten to 25 workers;
(ii) about 90% of the companies with 26 to 100 workers and (iv) 40% of ail 101-500 workers
businesses. shere are no private enterprises with more than 500 employees. Many of Mali's private
enterprises are thought to be informal, in that they operate with no formal accounting systems, are
not registered, or do not pay any taxes.  ;urvey undertaken in 1990 by the Caub du Sahd indicated
that about 1500 small firms and an iru;v <rablo number of such informal enterprises are an important
source of training for craft worket. P id technicians in Bamako, Segou and Sikasso, where they
operate in wood and metal prod';tion, car and cycle repair, electrician work, and building and
construction.
1.10         Recent sector studies undertaken by consultants in preparation for dths Project (para.
1.40) show that the development potential of Mali's private sector is significant, particularly in the
agro-industrial, transport, service and building and construction sectors. lhe changed attitude of
Government vis-a-vis private business, Uie recent reduction/removal of policy distortions under the
on-going adjustment program, the restructuring of the PE sector and its withdrawal from purely
commercial activity providing room for private sector intervention, have all combined to improve the
business climate and increase the chances for effective development of Mali's private sector.

of enterprise operation and management'. CAPES, which is 100% govermme 't-owned, has excellent
tralning facilities and a professional staff of 16. As part of Govern -  overall privatization
program, CAPES is planned to be absorbed by the CCIM once the latrer ha- jeen satisfactorily
privatized and restructured (para. 1.12). Two other training institutions: the Ecole Nationale
d 'Adminstration du Mali - (ENA) and the Ecole de Haues Etudes Pratiques (EHEP) provide traing
for Goverument officials ln administration and related fields4. In additi'n, a multitude of non-
goverument organizations (NGOs) aimed at promoting and supporting private initiative have sprouted
and multiplied over the past decade, in part with donor assistance.
1.12         £C . Created in 1974, the CCIM is based in Bama}o, has about 1,200 members
(mostly traders), and maintains representatives in all the main regional centers. Its funding comes
from a compulsory contribution of 10% of the patente by ail companies in Mali. CCIM's stated
functions are: (1) to represent and voice the interests of enterprises in trade, industry, handicrafts and
services to the GOM; (à) to serve as a source of information to these enterprises; (iii) to advice the
GOM on policies and regulations affecting businesses and on issues related to international trade; and
(iv) to help to arbitrate commercial disputes. However, in contrast to the practice in other countries,
Mali's CCIM was set up as part of the GOM's administrative structuru>, wi  m oversight ministry
which appointed and paid CCIM's general secretary. Until 1991 therefore, thts CCIM behaved as part
of the Governmeut which mandated payment by enterprises of their contribution to CCIM. It was
thus an unreliable source of assistance to private enterprises, and an ineffective conduit for donor
assistance to the private sector. Although it has separate sections for promoting commerce and
industry/haudicraft, CCIM has focused almost entirely on distributive ventures, and has to date
prlmsily ussisted the commerçants interested lu obtaining trade related concessions from the
Government. ln order to improve CCIM's ffectiveness and representation, a national conference of
Mali's industialiats and traders (Etats Généraux des Industries et du Commerce) requested in
November 1991 that CCIM be de-linked from the ad, nistration. Ihe Govermment has subeequently
agreed to privatize and restructur 't. As a first step to its restructuing, CCIM's statutes and by-laws
need to be revised to, inter alh.., (i) assume its autonomy by eliminating the requirement for an
oversight ministry and allowing CCIM's members to select the genoeral secretary; (il) allow for
balanced representation among diff.erent sectors (industry, commerce, building snd construction,
banking and other services); (iii) pemit CCIM to provide the full range of information and other
services for its members; (iv) assiLt its member firms in restrcturing their -.wnership; and (v) raise
its own fnds through direct voJuntary contributions. Once reorganized, CCIM plans to focus its

1.13         The Federataon Nationale des Employeurs du Mall (NEe, which brings together
eleven regional employer and professional associations, is Mali's largest voluntary grcu.ing of
business owners and managers, and the main voice of the private rroductîve sector. In 1981, FNBM
adopted a 'private sector charter' as its guiding manifesto, with four objectives: (i) working towards
a completely liberalized economy, (il) ensuring faitr treatment by Government of the non-public sector
in fiscal, administrative and legislative matters, (Iii) stimulating the emergence and development of
private businesses in the industrial, agricultural and mining sectors, and (iv) promoting the adoption
of technologies appropriate to Mali's stage of development. FNEM participated in the discussions
leading up to the adoption and implementation of Mali's economic reform program (para. 1.04) and
thereby succeeded in achieving the flrst two of its charter objetives. It has since become an
Important instrument for channelling private sector views to Government through its on-going
participation in ministerial commissions. Its views are increasingly sought by Government on issues
of importarnce to the private sector. FNEM's funding comes mainly from a voluntary contribution
of 1% of their wage bil by private businesses. Since 1988, a te-Inical support unit for SMF
promotion (Cellule d'appui aux PME-PMI) financed by the Caisse Centrale de Coopera4uon
Economique (CCCE) has been establishsd at FNE1M to help it arrange joint ventures between Malian
firms and entrepreneurs in Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria. FNEM is also exploring ways to
increase private sub-contracting in Government-flnanced procurement.
1.14         In addition to CCIM, FNEM, CAPES and NGOs, Mali has a mumber of private irms
and professional associations which provide services, training and management consulting to private
enterprises. These include, in particular, BECIS (Bureau d'etudes, de consell et d'intervention au
Sahe), which specializes in studies and computerization assistance, and SERVULART, a micro-
enterprises support organization which promotes craft workers around the town of Segou.
The Flnandal S'-tor
1.15         FlnancJal Sector Poelies. As a member of the West Affican Monetary Union (Union
Monetaire Ouest Africaine - (UMOA», the broad guidelines for financial sector policies in Mali are
provided by the Council of Ministers of UMOA, which is made up of two ministers from each
member state. Tie policies are executed by the national directorstes of the Banque centrale de
l'1Afque de l'Ouest (BCEAO), the common central bank, which also sets rediscount rates, and
regulates and supervises the banks. Given the fixed exchange arrangement in the UMOA zone,
monetary policy is primarily oriented to minimize inflation in member countries and is administered
principally through a system of credit ceilings - by country and subsequently by bank. Until 1989,
BCEAO's monetary management was characterized by the use of inefficient instruments such as
regulated interest rates (including a system of preferential rates for selected "priority" sectors, in
particular Government, small-scale enterprises, suhort-term crop financing, and housing), and credit
allocation in favot of these sectors. Administration of these instruments by the BCEAO was wea',
so that resource allocation was severely distorted. Additionally, banking supervision was ineffective,
and sanctions agaiost banlks whose financlal performance did not comply with minimum regulatory
standards were rare.
1.16         Aware of the shortoomings of its financld policies and practices, in late 1989
UMOA's Council of Ministers initiated with IDA support a major reform program. Specifically, the
BCEAO (i) abolished the preferential discount rate system and created a uniform rediscount rate,



.-6
which was set at 10.5% and subsequently increased to 11% and then to 13% to be compedtive with
the French money market rate; (il) set the money market rate at 0.25-0.50 percentage points below
the rediscount raoe to encourage a shift from rediscount to money market as a source of bank
reflnancing; (ili) fixed the interest paid on deposits at 7% p.a. for savings accounts and liberalized
rates on current accounts (iv) tightened control of credit to the public sector; and (v) streamlined
supervision of banks by establishing a supranational Bank Supervision Commission (Commission
bancaire de l 'UMOA) as the main authority for supervising banks in the BCEAO zone. BCEAO also
plans to introduce minimum accounting standards for all banks in the zone by 1994.
1.17         In luly 1990 Mali's National Assemb!y adopted a new Banklng Law, granting the
Bank Supervision Commission comprehensive executive powers in matters of licensing, supervision,
and establishment of penalties for non-compliance with regutations and summons. In September 1991
revised prudential regulations were introduced by BCEAO for banks in the UMOA countries. The
new regulations comprise requirements and rules for (i) minimum capital (CFAF 1 billion), risk
coverage (4%) and reserves (15% of profits per year); (il) loan classification, provision and interest
suspension; (iii) review of bank accounts by commissaires aux comptes approved by the BCEAO; (iv)
limits to the activities permitted for banks; (v) portfolio quality and diversification; and (vi) liquidity.
The new rules are currently enforced by BCEAO. Further reforms under consideration include the
future replacement of the system of prior authorization of individual credit5 by the BCEAO witi
financial criteria and the introduction of reserve requirements.
1.18         Although the changes in BCEAO's prudential regulations have iniproved the financial
po.icy environment for banks, the new rules appear to be less stringent than inenational standards
in the following areas:
(a)   external. independent auditing is not a requirement under BCEAO's regulations.
Banks are supervised by commissaires aua comptes, whose professional, field work
and reporting standards may need enhancement to conform to international standards.
Among Mali's banks for instance, the accounts of BCS and BMCD are not yet
subjected to external, independent audits. Those banks would require such audits and
all of Mali's banks, other than the recently restmctured BDM, (and possibly BOA
and BIAO) might need in-depth diagnoses of their financial condition, internai
controls, and accounting and management information systems.
(b)             re       regarding (i) mininum capital levels5; «d) loan classification,
provisions and interest suspension; (li) lending limits; (iv) asset concentration; and
«iv) liquidity and transformation ratios.
1.19         la support of the BCEAO's continuing efforts to improve the financial sector in the
UMOA countries, thii Project would assist GOM in developing an overall financial sector strategy
and aim to promote institutional development of Mali's banks nm the areas of management systems,
rdit, finacial policies, staff training) and bring their performance to international standards (para.

1.21         Up until the 1980s, BDM dominated Mali's banking system with about 50% of
deposits and about 60% of loans. Ibis was largely due to BDM's role as principal banker to the
public sector. By end 1989, however, BDM's financing of projects of questionable viability and its
overexposure o PEs in difficulty resulted in deterioration of its loan portfolio, about 90% of which
became non-performing. With the help of IDA (under the Public Enterprises Sector Adjustment
Project - PESAP, Cr. 1937 of FY8S) and other donors, GOM and BCEAO restructured BDM.
BDM's restructuring program included: payment of CFAF 14 billion in PE debts through cross-debt
settlements and consolidation by BCEAO of CFAF 23.9 billion in Government deposits as guarantec
against outstanding PE debt; transfer of BDM's viable assets to a new private entity - BDM.SA; staff
reduction; foeus on loan recovery; and assumption of BDM's management by a team of Moroccan
bankers from Banque marocain de commerce extrleur (BMCE), one of the new shareholders. Ihe
new management has instituted new management policies, overhauled procedures, sharply curtailed
lending and concentrates on improving BDM.SA's operations and mobilizing deposits, most of which
it invests in the money market'. BDM's restructuring is now substantially and successfully completed
and BDM.SA now plans to resume lending for productive investment. BDM.SA has 11 branches and
288 staff.
1.22         BIAO/Meridien is a private, trade-finance banlk which was formerly part of the
French-owned BNP group and is now owned by Afri-Trust International (tIhe Meridien banking group)
(53%) and private Malians (47%). Like the other Malian banks, BlAO's portfolio deteriorated
somewhat during the 1980s. Management has over the past few years been cleaning out the porfolio
and increasing loan loss provisions. BIAO has five branches, relatively good managers and 204 staff.

Unlike BDM before its restructuring, BIAO's Malian shareholders (mostly businessmen and civil
servants) did not take advantage of their shareholder status to obtain large amounts of concessional
credit. It recently signed an agreement with Canadian CIDA to create an SME/micro-enterprise
financing unit (cellule PAŒ). The unit is assisted by technical experts from CIDA who will help
promoters to prepare tdeir projects. BIAO will lend to SMEs/micro-enterprises on a 40%-40% basis
with CIDA, with the promoter financing 20% of the investment through equity. BIAO clains that
the BCEAO-imposed credit ceilings constitute a constraint for its attempts to ihçrease its lending.
1.23         BMCD is owned almost evenly by the Mali Government and Credit Lyonnais. It has
a well developed branch network (headquarters In Bamako and branches at Dramane Diakite, Segou,
Sikasso and Koulikoro) and docs a brisk business in documentary letters of credit throu.:h Credit
Lyonnais, its main correspondent bank. Like the other banks, BMCD is cleaning out its portfolio
through increased provisions. Although its assets have been relatively stable, its deposits of over two
years have grown rapidly. BMCD's local management has little autonomy, and is required by Credit
Lyonnais to obtain prior approval from Paris for all loans li excess of CFAF 7.5 million
(US$30,000).
1.24         BOA was established in 1982 by some 400 private Malian businessmen. Since its
inception BOA's 100% private ownership has made it the focus of interest of several foreign
institutions/organizations, including Paris-based Banques Populaires, Proparco, the specialized venture
capital arm of the CCCE, and IFC, which in March 1992 became a shareholder in BOA. BOA has
been effective in expanding its deposits base which grew by 35% per year between 1988 and 1990.
BOA places most of its funds on the money market.
1.25        BCS commenced operations in 1982 as Banque Arabe Libyo-Malienne (BALIMA),
ajoint-venturebcween the goveroments of Libya (51%) and Mali (49%). It quickly became Mali's
weakest bank, and by December 1990, had accmulated CFAF 2.2 billion in losses for its CFAF 1.9
billion in deposits. In February 1991 the BCEAO suspended its banking license, and in July 1991
the shareholders decided to restructure it by increasing its capital base by 80% to CFAF 3.5 billion,
opening up its capital to the private sector ad renaming it Banque Commercial du Sahel. Until its
restructuring is completed, BCS is unlikely to become a major player among Mali's banks.
1.26         SCPCE was bom out of the reteructuing of the former CCP (para. 1.05) and is an
autonomous insdtutionowned 40% by the private sector, 40% by the Government and 20% by the
BIAO. Its resources and operations are separate from those of the Treasury and its management is
private. SCPCE's statutes limit its activities to savings mobiization and forbids it from lending
activities. Its client deposits currently total some CFAF 2.3 billion.
1.27         BNDA was established in 1981 as Mal'a agricultural development bank and is owned
by the GOM, BCEAO, CCCE, DEG of Germany and BDM.SA. BNDA has 87 staff and over a
dozen branches spread throughout the country and benefits from a growing resource base, mainly
from institutional depositors and the numerous external credit lines put at its disposai. Its portfolio
is primarily agro-industrial, with a third of ita clients in rural areas.
1.28         With the exception 6f BDM.SA, SCPCE and BNDA, all of Mali's banks are
traditional trade finance institutions. A large part of their un-lent liquid resources comes from the
demnAnd deposits of their commercial clients, with almost all the rest representing 100% cash deposits
against documentary letterm of credit. Ibis liquidity is generally placed with the BCEAO at abnnt
11% p.a.. As at end 1991, Mali's banks had about US$200 million placed on the money markei.



TIi earnings from these funds allow the banks to supplement their income from trade finance, make
provisions and generally improve their profits. These fimds represent adequate resources for
financing private sector investments but for reasons explained later (para 1.35) are currendy not
transformed by the banking system. Given the relative safety of their operations in the past, Mali's
banks had neither needed nor enjoyed high levels of capital and reserves. TIis factor, in part,
explained the fact that bankruptcy affected the only bank (BDM) which had ventured into term lending
in the past. As the banks reconsider a return to project lending, their capital bases will need
significant strengthenlng.
1.29         Non-bank Flnandal InstItutions.  Mali's non-bank fineucial institutions comprise
one Government-owned and five private insurance companies, several private savings and credit
cooperatives (SCCs) operating in the regions outside Bamako and La Financière, a new and as yet
inoperative venture capital company set up by private Malians. As part of its reform efforts, the
GOM decided to privatize the Compagnie Nationale d Assurance du Mali (CNAR), the public
insurance company. Mali's principal SCCs are Kafo Jiginew, Assoclationmalienwn pourl'insertion
professionnelle des jeunes (AMIP1), Socité de Développement International Defardins (SDID) and
Caisse Villageoise. Kafo liginew is Mali's first and only regional union of rural SCCs and comprises
about 30 cooperatives linked to cotton production. It has been supported since 1987 by several
1uropean NGOs, the European Economie Community's Development Fund (PED) and France's
CCCE. AMIPJ operates in and around Dodo, and is supported by Freedom from Hunger. SDID
is helping villagers to form cooperatives in northern Mali Sud. 'he Caisse V1ilageoise has over the
past five years successfully helped to create a network of SCCs in Dogon with assistance firom a
French NGO. Mali's SCCs serve as important mobilizers of savings and promote financial
intermediation outside the main regional centers. Ihey are the beginnings of a new grassroots type
of financial intermediary in Mali and, if properly nurtured, could be a valuable source of future termn
funding for private sector investments in the rural areas. An attempt would be made under the
proposed Project to explore the possibilities for creating similar structures in the urban areas (para.
2.01 (d)».
C. Sectoral Devedoment lmug
A Leacy of Weak Privat Enterpris
1.30         A comprehensive 1991 study of the private sector undertaken by consultants in
preparation for ths Project suggests that although many of the macro-economic constraints facing
private enterprises in Mali have been ellminated by the program of policy, regulatory and institutional
reforms of the past few years, the decades of inappropriate policies have left the sector in a fragile
condition. Two groups of particularly fragile enterprises are: (a) traditional businesses created on the
basis of temporary fiscal incentives and other advantages during the era of economic distortions; and
(b) formerly public enterprises which have been recently privatized. Many of the traditional
busmesses are suffering from the impact of competition from smuggled and other goods freely
imported in the stmosphere of liberadization, while at the same time trying to adjust to competidon
without the special advantages to which they were used. Ihe recently privadzed PEs suffer from the
results of an often hasty divestiture, mainly beause almost none of the PEs underwent internai
restructuring before beîng privatized, and the agency charged with implementhn the divestiture
program (BEP) had litde experience and no effective technical assistance. Therefore not only nust
the "privadzed" enterprises contend with the new and competitive economic evironment, but many
of tIhem mut do so from a base of oldlarchalc, ill adapted and often poorly functioning equipment,
inadequate working capital, and weak management.



- 10 -
1.31         Ibe 1991 study identified the following as the key constraints facing Mali's private
enterprises:
(a)    weak management;
(b)   lack of technical mastery of the production process.  Private
enterprises are often unable to properly operate or maintain their
machines/equipment and do not have enough infonration to choose
good equipment suppliers;
(c)    poor knowledge of local as well as foreign markets;
(d)   inadequate infrastructure (water, electricity, transport, telephone) and
difficulty in maneuvering around cumbersome administrative and
rtgulatory obstacles;
(e)    absence of effective judicial structures.  Ibis makes contract
enforcement extremely difficult, and strains the confidence of
investors in the sanctity of contracts; and
(t)   inadequate accounting systens.
These constraints prevent many private enterprises from operating efficiently, impose an undue strain
on their cash flows and exacerbate their financial problems. The demand of private enterprise for
technical assistance to rectify these problems is constrained by their limited financial resources, poor
diagnosis of their technical and management problems and inadequate knowledge of good service
suppliers. Some of the infrastructural constraints are currently being tackled through the ongoing
restructring and operational improvements in SOTELMA (telephone), Energie du Mali (electricity),
and Regle de ahein de fer du Mal - RCFM (rail transport), as well as projects to improve water
supply and the road network. To ease administrative impediments, guichets uniques have been set
up in Bamako and new commercial tribunals established in three regions {para. 1.04> to supplement
thi efforts of Mali's courts. The central location of the guichet (in the DNI) is however not practical
for businesses in the regions and its role is limited to enterprise licensing (agrme)nts). Also,
additional commercial tribunals need to be established in the remaining regions, and efforts are needed
to render both the guichets and the tribunals operational. The proposed Project will help to alleviate
the remaining constraints.
In[ff ve blstitutional    Teninal Support for Private Enterprise Needs.
1.32         To tackle the management and technical problems of private enterprises, a strong and
effective institutional suppoft structure is essential. Given the previously planned and controlled
economy, however, such support was typically provided by weak public and para-public
organizations, such as tbe former CEPI, IPGP and CCIM. 'Me services provided by these institutions
were also based on a public rather than a private sector perception of private business needs. Being
public agencies they generafly faced little competition, and this prevented them from keeping abreast
withi developments in business promotion assistance or improving the quality of their services. In
addition, their complacency made them acquire less knowledge than their private enterprise clients
of the engineering, quality control and other appropriate technology aspects of firm improvements that



they were expected to help with. The weaknesses of CCIM are detailed in paragraph 1.12. Thc
weak performance of the BEP during the privatization program also revealed the ineffectiveness of
public agencies in pzomoting privatization. The few private organizations (including FNEM) which
tried to provide advisory and tecal assistance to private enterprises were subjected to the same
biases that had faced the private sector and suffered from lack of technical expertise and financial
resources. A 1990 review of Mali's accounting capabilities, for example, showed that, despite their
apparent link to foreign firms, many accounting firms in Mali need assistance to upgrade their own
organization, operations and staff quality. Only then can they in turn assist private companies to
improve their accouating and financial management. The Project is designed to help develop the
capacities of local techimcal service firms in Mali.
1.33         In addition to the ineffectiveness of technical support institutions, there is no proper
coordination of their activities and not enough collaboration between banks, promotion agencies,
donors and reptesentative associations. As a result, banks have little confidence in the Project
feasibility studies undertaken by consulting firms; the latter have little appreciation of bankers'
perception of enterprise assistance needs; and many managers ,f productive enterprises are becoming
frstrated in their search for business related information and good quality and affordable technical
assistance.
tIlna uate Aoe. t Jnvestment Filnance
1.34          Ihe private sector in Mali had traditionally been financed by private family savings,
inten  cash generation, informil savings and credit coopeiatives (SCC), and the BDM, with funding
for the latter often obtained through foreign lines of credit. Pending the successful completion of the
restructuring of the BDM, a large part of this traditional source of institutional funding disappeared.
At the present time, Mali's banks channel most of their resources to the money market and the trading
sector. la 1990, 40% of banking resources were placed on the money market, and 80-90% of
outstaing credit in that year was for trading activities. Total investment credit to the economy in
1990 represented only 5% of GDP, and bank medium and long term credit financed less than a
quarter of all the investments carried out by private industry and teurism. Despite the large amounts
of deposits in the banking system, most private enterprises have little or no acces to institutional
investment finance.
1.35         The reasons for the banking system's reluctance to lend to the private productive
setor are both demand and supply related. On the demand side, the private sector suffered until
recently from a generally hostile environment, lack of business support, and competition from a
favored group of public enterprises. The potendal profitability of private enterprises was thus
generally low, and private firms consequently represented poor candidates for investment. On the
sopply side, the experience of banks in Mali is concentrated on dealing with large commercial and
industrial (often public) enterprises located in urban areas. Although they have branches in the
reglonal capitals, only BNDA seems to have any significant links to local, mainly agricultural,
_mmunities. Mali's banks therefore generally lack experience in lending to small sized enterprises,
and do not feel confident in undertaking sucS lending. In addition, because almost all of their
resources are of a short term nature, ' and because most of them are going though an hiternal
resmtucturing, they are unable and unwilling to bear the liquidity and interest rate risks inherent in
transforming their short term deposits into lending of longer terms, specially when the institutional
support environment for the private sector is so weak.

1.36          In view of the improved economie environment and the potential for enterprise
profitability, private sector demand for lnvestment ftancing is expected to increase in the coming
years'. Even with 70% of all new investments being financed out of intemra cash generation and
equity infusion, a tremendous demand (estimated at least at CFAF 16 billion, four times the
outstanding medium and long term loans of Mali's banks in 1991) exists for bank credit to finance
the long-term investment or rehabilitation needs of existing private and recently privatized enterprises.
Banks will expand lending to private enterprises only when the institutional environment improves
and when their internal restructuring programs have progressed sufficiently.
D. ank/Cou          5y  toe  for Pivate Sector Development
1.37          Since 1988, improving private sector incentives and increasing resources to that sector
have been the focal points in GOM's development policy, and these objectives have driven the
regulatory and institutional reforms of the past few years. In addition to policy reforms, GOM has
decided to help to tackle the non-policy impediments to the development of private enterprises and
to help provide mechanisms for supporting their prospects for leading the growth of Mali's economy.
GOM expects to achieve this by:
(a)    accelerating implementation of its program of regulatory reforms, particularly those
essential for the performance of private enterprises;
(b)    helping to remove or alleviate the managerial shortcomings of private enterprises by
inproving their access to business related information, accounting support, investment
promotion services, technology assistance, marketing support, and credit;
(c)    improving the institutional capacity of banks for intermediating funds for investment
(through training, audits and institutional development programs) and  e  access t
long term resources:
(d)    restructuring and privatizing (in their management and mode of operation, if not in
their ownership) inefficient para-public agencies such as the CCIM and helping to
strengthen private ones such as the bankers' association; and
(e)    improving the effectiveness of the privatization process, primarily by further
stregtiening the BEP.
1.38          The GOM has decided to use this Project as a vehicle to further articulate its policy
and strategy regarding the leadership role of the private sector in Mali's economy, and has prepared
a Private Sector Development Strategy Statement (Amiex 1) which was discussed and agreed with
IDA at negotiations. In this statement, GOM affirms its commitment to continue creadng and
maintaining a healthy macro-economie policy enviroament, while leaving the productive sectors to
private enterprise. In this regard, GOM articulates its atte spts to: (i) fuiiher improve the regulatory
framework; (il) establish adequate institutional support structures for the private sector; (iii) institute
a system of regular consultation betwe.n it and the private scror; and (iv) eliminate obstacles to the

private sector's access to commercial credit. GOM ls also revising the land code in ways that would
facilitate land ownership and thus its use for collateral and has recent1y abolished the requirement for
prior marital authorization for married women to undertake commercial/business activity, eased the
licensing process for foreign and auxiliary workers and plans to eliminate the iequirement that the
Minister of Justice approve bank realization of mortgages. GOM also plana to modernize the legal
texts on corporate activities and further simplify administrative procedures for business registration.
These measures are being lmplemented as part of ongoing IDA and other donor-assisted
projects/programs (para. 1.40} as well as under the proposed operation. Submission to IDA of the
signed Private Sector Development Strategy and Policy Statement is a condition of Board presentation
of the proposed IDA credit.
1.39         Mali's private sector institutions have expressed their support for the Government's
strategy, and have decided to actively participate in its implementation. A group comprising CCIM,
FNEM, Mali's banks and other private sector interest groups have subsequent1y created the
AssocWion de Promotion de l'Ewreprise PrIv-e (APEP) to coordinate the provision of technical
assistance to private enterprises, anid ease the coordination problem that had plagued banls, donors,
support institutions and representative organizations in the past {para. 1.33).
1.40         IDA's strategy for Mali supports GOM's objectives, and aims at improving business
incentives and promoting private sector development. The IDA-supported PESAP which was
completed in 1991 helped GOM to restructure its expenditures, redefine its role in and relationship
with the productive and commercial sectors, revise the investment code, restructure key financial
institutons (BDM, SCPCE) and divest some PEs from Government's ownership. The Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Project (AGSECAL Cr. 2163 of FY90) supports restructuring of the cotton sector
and liberalization of the cereals sector. The Structural Adjustment Program (SAL, Cr. 2188 of FY90)
is taclding economy-wide policies such as taxation and tariffs which affect the private sector and
revising the commercial and labor codes.' In further pursuit of IDA's strategy, it approved in March
1990 a US$750,000 project preparation facility (PPF) which was used by GOM to finance three
consultant studies which could serve as a basis for designing a project to help develop the private
sectr. These studies covered: (i) Mali's private enterprises sector, (à) support institutione and (iii)
the banking system. 'he first two studies were undertaken by Invewsssement Developpement Conseg
(IDC) and the third by Société d'Ingénierie Bancare Intemnaonale (SIBI), both of France, and were
conducted with the close cooperation and intensive participation of Mali's key private sector agents
including CCIM, PNEM, and the commercial banks, all of which actively collaborated in providing
inputs. This project is the result of this effort, as well as the advice of professionals experienced in
private sector development.
1.41         Ratia for IDA Involvement. IDA support of GOM's efforts to promote private
sector development would be a logical follow-up and complement to its policy-based lending (e.g
SAL, AGSECAL, PESAP) for reform of the private sector business environment. IDA is also
uniquely placed to help GOM to achieve a measure of coordination of the currently diffused donor
technîcal aistance programa through APEP, which will be used to execute part of this Project. In
additon, IDA's intervention would complement its recently approved Mining Promotion Istitutional

Development Project and IFC's recent and proposed investments in private banking and gold mining
by improving the institutional and technical support structures for the private sector.
1.42         Lessons from Prevlous Experience. From 1983 to 1989, GOM implemented an
IDA-financed Industrial Development Project (Cr. 986 of FY83) in an atmosphere of distorted
policies. The Project prwvided US$8 million to fund investments, technical assistance and training
for small and micro-enterprises. It financed 27 small and medium scale private enterprises (SMEs)
with moderate success. The Project suffered from poor project screening by the national development
bank (BDM") which has since been restructured, ineffective technical assistance provided by a public
agency (CEPI) which nas since been liquidated and inadequate monitoring, and was implemented
without regard to the fact that enterprises should be in business primarily for the purpose of maidng
profits (i.e. their commercial orientation), and that such Jevelopmental objectives as employment
creation or even the creation of value added, while worthwhile objectives, should at best be
considered as supplementary criteria or side benefits to commercial and financial viability. The
lessons from this Project were that the prerequisites for effective private sector promotion were: (i)
the existence of an appropriate policy environment (including an adequate interest rate structure), (il)
well-focused project screening (credit-worthiness) by banks, (iii) close supervisiontmonitoring, and
(iv) technical support provided by efficient and business oriented private institutions. These lessons
were incorporated in the design of Mali's structural and sectoral adjustment programs (SAL, PESAP,
etc.) and have been taken into account in designing the proposed operation.
1.43         Experience with implementation of the divestituïe program under the IDA-supported
PESAP also revealed that the executing agency (BEP) had neither the experience nor the technical
resources to efficiently manage PE divestitures. Instances of privatization under the PESAP were
therefore characterized by hasty dissolution of the PE concerned, without prior internal restructuring
to ensure their viability after being privatized, arbitrary valuation, litlie prospection for buyers, and
litde competition among buyers, so that the partners selected were often incapable of improving the
performance of the enterprise. Funds exist under an IDA-supported Project (Cr. 1938 of FY8S - PE
Sector Institutional Development Project) to finance internal restructuring of PEs. The institutional
support component of the proposed Project will, inter alia, finance restructuing of private enterprises,
and the tecniical assistance proposed for BEP will serve to strengthen the two remaining areas of
weakness identified: (a) valuation of the enterprise's assets in order to estimate a fair floor price as
well as the extent of the liabilities to be cleared, and (b) active prospection for, and creation of
competition among, partners capable of contributing to the enterprise's recovery or development.

TNE PROJECT
A. ProjEt Objectives
2.01         The principal objective of the Project is to help foster the development of private
sector enterprises, so that they can lead the growth of Mali's economy. It aims at puting into place
the mechanisms and measures to back up the Government's strategy of breaking from past reliance
on the public sector. The Project proposes to achieve this by:
(a)    completing implementation of reCent improvements to the regulatory
environment;
(b)    assisting a private business support strucware (APEP) to coordinate a program
of institutional support to private non-financial enterprises. It is expected that
the intervention of APEP would foster a process of private sector institutions
assisting private sector enterprises in a dynamic and liberal market, and result
in improving private business management, removing technical constraints
facing private businesses, and restoring the banks' confidence in private
business's ability to conceive and prepare bankable projects. The catalytic
role that APEP is expected to play in the Project should increase businesses'
awareness of the value of these services once local firms providing such
services have been enabled to develop recognized capabilities, and thus hk ,'
in developing a self-sufficient consulting and training market locally. By the
end of the Project, this market should be in a position to maintain its growth
though possibly at a slower pace;
(c)   improving the functioning of economic chambers, BEP and departments of
the administration responsible for administering regulations affecting private
enterprises. CCIM in particular should by the end of the Project be able to
respond better to the common needs of private enterprises, thus
supplementing the individual services whose provision would be coordinated
by APEP, and BEP should become an effective Government agency for
implementing divestiture programs; and
(d)   inducing institutional and financial strengthening of the banking sector and the
preparation of a coherent financial sector strategy. In particular the Project
sets the stage for deepening Mali's financial system through: (a) the proposed
staff training to enable banks to better assess the risk of lending to private
enterprises, (b) the assistance to banks to bring up to internaticnal standards
their management systems, credit and financial policies and accounting and
auditing practices and (c) the studies to explore the possibilities for
establishing private locally based grassroots financial (urban mutual banking)
institutions and the modalities for financing housing in Mali. If successful,
the mutualist credit institutions could complement the short-term lending of
commercial banks, in particular lending to micro and small enterprises and
provide a link between the formal banking system and local communities.

B. Eroect Descrptio
2.02         The Project, to be supported by an IDA credit of US$12 million equivalent, would
have four components: a regulatory component, an institutional support component, a studies
component, and an information and communication component.
Reg uator Component
2.03         This component which ls detailed in GOM's letter of private sector development
policy (Annex 1), will complete implementation of recent policy and regulatory reforms essential to
private sector performance. It will in particular, focus on the following:
(a)   enlargement of the role of the guichet unique to include all key administrative
formalities routinely requcsted of businesses (registration, tax clearance
eeclaration to the Insdia Natlonale de Prévoance Sociale INPS) and
physical location of offices of the guichets closer to busineuses in the regions
(eg. at offices of the economic chambers).
(b)   revision and upgrading of the national accounting plan; and
(c)    modernization of legal texts on corporate rights and bankruptcy procedures.
Imsftutional 0uQ ComW*_
2.04         Ibis component would support:
* non-financial private enterprises through APEP
* financial enterprises
* professional associations and
* Government agencies.

2.05         Pilot business &u1 thbough APEP. Through the intervention of APEP, Mali's non
financial private enterprises, including auditing and consultdng firms, would benefit from technical
assistance for inter alia, project studies and follow-u>, penetrating export markets, upgrading their
management policies and procedures, accounting, production technology, marketing and training.
In addition, recently privatized enterprises would (on request) also benefit from technical assistance
for their internal restructuring. Ibe design of the institutional support to non-financial enterprises
is based on the premise that flrms in the private sector in Mali are constrained in their decision-
making by a lack of capability and information, and could benefit from increased assess to business
services. Their demand for these services is however constrained by limited resources and
knowledge, which takes three forms: (i) not realizing the potential benefit from business services; (il)
not being aware of what kind of assistance they need; or (ii) not knowing how to obtain or to finance
the technical assistance they need. 'Me business support structure will partially refinance the costs
of business support services over a five year period so as to increase the incentives to firms both to
invest in learning about these services and to use them. Business services will be supplied by both
local &nd international suppliers in order to ensure that Malian businesses have access to services that
meet international standards. APEP's role will be twofold: (i) to select firms that would receive
technical support for lmproving their operations; and (ià) to provide them with information on the
business services available and on the suppliers who provide these services so that fims can make
well-informed choices. TIe modus operandi of APEP as well as its mechanisms for intervention are
detailed in Annex 2 and summarized in paragraphe 2.18.  The costs of APEP (comprising
US$180,000 for office equipment, rehabilitation and a vehicle and about US$190,000 per year in
operating expenses over the life of the operation) would be covered by the proposed Project.
2.06         Other Institutional Support. The institutional support to Mali's financial sector is
described in paras. 2.09-3.10 and will be targeted specifically at the commercial banks who would
receive support for project supervision/follow-up, audits and institutional diagnoses by external,
independent finms and staff training in project appraisal and supervision. Based on the results of the
audits/diagnoses, they would be asslsted to implement programs of institutional development. Ihe
CCIM would be subjected to internai reorganization, assisted to set up a new information data-base,
an export promotion service and documentation/publication facilities for the benefit of its members,
and staff training. TIe Government agencies responsible for implementing regulations affecting the
private sector would recelve training (DNAE, DNI), and technical assistance for PE divestiture
(BEP). In order to ensure that C2IM's effectiveness is no longer compromised by excessive
dependence on the administration (para. 1.12), the institutional support targeted to it wiiU be
conditional on its adoption of revised statutes and by-laws that would guarantee its independence from
Goverument interference. lhe institutional support to BEP will cover (i) preparation and adoption
of legal texts to specify the implementation modalities for privatizing public enterprises; (ii)
preparation of terms of reference for restructring PEs; and (iii) technical assistance from
internatonal agencies and firms to assist and train BEP staff (on the job) in valuing enterprises,
preparing prospectuses and searching for potential investors/buyers. Annex 4 summarizes the traning
program to be provided under the Project.

2.07         During Project preparation, Mali's banking system was revwed by a consultir g firm
and the situation of sixc Mali's banks (Meridien/BIAO, BDM, BCS, BOA, BNDA, BMCD) was
evaluated. Ihat review was followed during Project appraisa by a complementary assessment by an
eqpeienced individual consultant. (Both consultant reports arc available in the Project files). Ihese
asessment indficat that, with the excetion of the BCS, all the Malian banks are at present in overall
compliance with BCEAO's prevailing pmudential regulations. They also reveal that with the (possible)
exception of BCS, they are relatively well-managed (Meridiew/BïAO, BNDA and BDM) or adequatey
managet (BOA, BMCD). In addition the accounts of BCS and BNICD are not subject to infiependent
ezterna audits outside of te commissaires aux comptes' inspectious. BDM, in particular, which was
în distress, has benefitted from an extensive and successfully implemented restrucXring progrm
(including privafization and recapitalization) supported by IDA under the PESAP, with the fin«cia
and managerial partcipation of an experienced foreign banlc (BMOE o.r Morocco) (para. 1.21).



.19-
2.08         TIb  support to the banlc will be based on the reaults of external, independent
institutional and portfolio audits to establish the reliability of their accouats and to determine the need
for institutional improvements. Draft terms of reference for these audits are provlded in Annex 5.
Based on the results of the audits, antd if needed, detalled plans for institutional improvements would
be prepared and agreed with each bank. Ibis plan would include, among others, requirements and
targets for:
* regular external audits
* risk exposure and loan concentration
* credit analysis and loan recovery
* loan classification and provisicns
* capital base improvements.
2.09         Furthermore, all the banks need to strengthen their operational capacity In credit
analysis, project appraisal and supervision. lhe Project will provide specific technical assistanceto
commercial banks for staff training in these areas. Annex 3 sunmarim the technical assistance
activities that wlll be supported by the Project.
Studies Connonent
2.10         This component of US$0.6 million would finance two studies to explore options to
deepen the Malian financial system In the areas of: urban mutual savings and credit schemes and
housing finance, and the preparation of an overall inancial sector strategy. 'Me mutualist finance
study is expected to result evertually in a pilot prject to help to improve the access of the urban
informal sector to credit. BDM's bankruptcy in the 1980s and its subsequent restructuring resulted
in the virual disappearance of institutional credAf for financing housing in Malî and GOM has been
eager ever since to sec a housing bank established in Mali. Given the disappoitng experlence with
government-sponsored housing fina-ice schemes in the West-Africa sub-region and the low repayment
rates on BDM's housing loans, the housing finance study will be based on the principles of
sustainability, majority private sector/bank participation, commercial and financial viability and link
to prior savings by eventual borrowers. Terms of reference for the studies are in Annexes 6 and 7.
Communication Component
2.11         This will consist of a program of information diuemination and consciousness raising
to ensure diat ail relevant target groups get to know about the existence of the Project, the changes
implemented by Govermment to ease the regulatory and administrative constraints usually faced by
bushiesses, and the poteti usefulness to their businesses of quality tecbnical services. It wiU aim
speclfically at frequently disadvantaged groups such as women and rural bushiesses, facilitate thdir
accesu to the services whose provision is administered by APEP and elicit active participation by rural
supplieras of business services.
2.12         fle following activities will be micluded mi this component:

will focus on themes revolving arouid simplified administrative procedures,
the benefits of appropriate busines services and their sources of supply, the

implementation, with members of professional associations, bankers and
private business owners on the impact of good business services on enterprise
performance and on proposais to focus future assistance to the private
business sector; and
(c)    a series of sample surveys to assess priority needs of local/rural enterprises,

2.15         Mnagmnent and Coordination, Overall management of the Projeat would be the
responsibility of a superiseur du Projet who has been named for this purpose in the office of the
Ministre Délégué auprès du Premier Ministre Chargé da la Promotion de i 'Inive Privée. In order
to further institutionalize implementation of such operadons, the GOM bas designated a Unité de
Gestion de Projet - UOP (PMU) In this ministry to coordinate project activities and to oversee
implementation of the parts of the Project dealing with policy, regulation, Government agencies and
the financial system. Tie PMJ is headed by a Project Manager, who bas already been appointed,
and includes two assistants (one for administration/procurement and one for accounting) and support
staff. During negotdations, the Government gave asuanc  that the PMU will be staffed at all times
with personnei whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA. To strengthen the PMU's
capacity for coordinating and overseeing implementation, as well as for ensuring timely procurement,
auditing and reporting, the Project will finance its incremental costs incduding: (a) purchase of a
vehicle, furniture and equipment; (b) specialist services for setting up the Project's accounting system,
annual audits, monitoring and evaluation studies, the Project's mid-term  review  and other
implementation activities (including procurement); and (c) incremental operating expenses, including
salaries of local personnel under contract, operation and maintenance of vehicles and utilities,
equipment, documentation and office supplies.

2.17         The rest of the Project, namely the pilot program of institutional support to private
non-financial enterprises and the communication component is entrusted to, and will be executed by
the Associton Pour la Promotion de l'Entreprise Prlvde (APEP), under contractual arrangements
between it and the various actors concerned: the central government, consultants and private financial
and non-financial enterprises.
2.18         During Project appraisal, the Articles of Agreement, By-laws, and Procedures Manual
of APEP were preliminarily reviewed by IDA. These documents are in Annex 2. The Articles
provide that APEP is a non-profit association whose Assemblée Générale includes representations of
Mali's commercial banks, FNEM, CCIM, the Associaon desfenemms commercantes et entrepreneurs
du Mal: and the Assochion des Ingénieurs Conseil. The Procedures Manual which must at all times
be acceptable to the Bank, establishes: (i) the types of enterprises that can benefit from APEP's
interventions (private enterprises including service firms); (ii) the method to be used by APEP to
inform potential beneficiaries of the range of service suppliers available to them Çmcluding the
maintenance and updating of data banks and the procedures for classifying suppliers of technical
assistance services); (iii) procedures for receiving and processing technical assistance and training
requests from beneficiary enterprises; (iv) the limits of APEP-financed assistance to any one
beneficiary enterprise (at most two interventions, with a cumulative subsidy of CFAF 15 million); (v)
the percentage of costs to be advanced (75% for all beneficiary enterprises); (vi) the procurement
procedures that APEP must follow, including the choice of service suppliers by beneficiary
enterprises; (vii) standard bidding documents and model contracts; (viii) procedures for supervising
performance by contracted firms; «ix) APEP's staffing and financial management procedures including
its accounting, internal controls and semi-annual accounting of its use of donor funds; (x) the nature
and periodicity of reporting by APEP; and (xi) the process for semi-annual review of its operations
by GOM and donors, including IDA. As conditions of neootiations, the final draft versions of
APEP's Statutes, Bylaws, Procedures Manual and Draft Agreement were submitted to IDA, and a
director was recruited for APEP. The framework agreement (conventon) between the Government
and APEP for use of IDA funds describes APEF's modus operandi and include the Procedures
Manual as an integral part. Among other things, the Agreement establishes that APEP will execute
service contract and subprojects consistent with those defined in the Project that the central
government will place non-reimbursable financial resources at the disposal of APEP, including the
proceeds of the credit (in a Special Account); that APEP can also receive resources from other
sources, micluding national and international development agencies and donors other tha IDA; that
the Procedures Mamn   is an integral part of the Framework Agreement that the Director General
has full power in connection with management of APEP; that the Direcor General can only be
replaced in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of APEP; that the Government confers on
APEP all the powers required for implementation of this component of the Project, and that APEP
will execute is tasks in strict compliance with the Procedures Manual (which is an integral part of
the Framework Agreement). Signature of this agreement is a condition of Board  re p. The
structure of APEP allows for operational autonomy in day-to-day implementation of this sub-
component, adequate interface between the private sector and policy-making bodies, maximum
participation by the private sector in managing provision of technical assistance to private enterprises,
and proper coordination of Project activitius.
2.19         The PMU would (a) consolidate the anmual work and training program  and budgets
prepared by the agencies involved in implementing components of the Project. Acceptance by IDA
of the first year program for the training components of the Project would be a condiionf
dfectiveness of the IDA credit; (b) be responsible for the procurement of goods and services, the
rerultnment of consultants for the components it executes, and the implementation of training

programs; the support to the banks, and the studies components, as well as its own requirements; (c)
maintain the Project accounts, and manage the Special Account to be opened for all componets
except the APEP-implemented component; (d) make arrangements for the audit of Project's accounts
(including the accounts of APEP and the two Special Accounts) and SOEs; (e) prepare the necessary
documentation for withdrawal of the proceeds of the IDA credit; (f) be responsible for the preparation
of semi-annual, annual and Project completion reports; (g) supervise and coordinate Project
monitoring and evaluation activities, and organize the mid-term review o0 Project implementation;
(h) follow up the implementation of policy to promote the private sector's development; (i) arrange
for the Project launch workshop; and O) liaise with IDA and any other donors to ensure
complementarily of donors' assistance programs to the private sector.
2.20         MoniUtQrng and Evaluaion (M &  E) would be carried out during the life of the
Project by the PMU, who would bave an overview of the Project's progress and would be in a
position to recommend to GOM and IDA any corrective actions that may be required. Plans for
reporting the progress of the Project to GOM and IDA and for assessing its impact (including
indicators for inputs, outputs and effets) were discussed and agreed upon during negntiations of the
IDA credit. Monitoring and evaluation will focus on: (i) timely implementation of proposed
regulatory improvements; (ii) effectiveness of the institutional support component, in particular the
relative success or failure of the technical assistance to private enterprises whose implementation is
entrusted to APEP; (iii) the extent to which this has made a difference in the performance of prvate
enterprises; (iv) progress with CCIM's restructuring and the bank institutional development program;
(v) the availability of bankable sub-projects and tne capacity of PFIs to appraise and supervise them.
Monitoring of successful delivery of project inputs and their development impact will be based inter
alia on Uie following performance indicators:
(a)   adherence to deadlines for implementing time-bound regulatory improvements detailed
in the policy letter (Annex 1), in particular, timely adoption of a national accounting
plan for enterprises, timely enlargement of the role of the guichet unique, and
location of its offices in the regions, and timely adoption of legal texts for PE
privatzation.
(b)    availability of the information date base at APEP for the benefit of private
enterprises, the number and types of services suppliers; the number of information
requests satisfied; aid a qualitative assessment of the usefulness of this information
to beneficlary enterprises. Turnaround time of under one month (from request to
signature of service contract) for provision of APEP-administered TA and of payment
(under seven days) to service suppliers on completion of contract; pre and post
service performance of APEP assisted enterprises: output, turnover, quwitative
assessment of enterprise satisfaction with services. Quantitative indicators for
monitoring APEP's performance will be agreed between GOM and IDA by December
31, 1992.;
(c)    progress in undertkng bank audits and in adopting and implementing banking
institutions development programs;
(d)    bankling training/seminars: nwmbers/types held; participation; pre and post traùnng
performance of bank staff;



-24-
(e)    number of PH audits undertaken; valuation quality; numbers of prospective buyers
approached and results; assessment of functioning of privatized firms;
(f)   timely award of consulting contracta for studies, their timely execution within
budgets, adoption by GOM of action plan based on studies' results; and
(g)   adherence to IDA procurement audit and reporting covenants.
2.21         At mid-term (April 1995), GOM and IDA will undertake a comprehensive and
detailed review of the progress of implementation and of the extent to which the Project is achieving
its expected development impact. The mid-term review will aim at verifying the continued validity
of the eesign assumptions ln light of implementation experience gained and assessing whether this
experience suggests adjustments in the design or other aspects of the Project. The review will, inter
alia, focus on operating costs and other measures of its effectiveness and efficiency and difficulties
in the pre-qualification of TA suppliers; (il) the degree of satisfaction of private firme receiving
APEP-managed technical assistance; (iii) the impact of the institutional support to financial
institutions; (iv) progress with the preparation of a financial sector strategy and the attempts to find
ways to deepen Mali's financial system; (v) the evolution over time of the key monitoring indicators;
(vi) the impact of the communication program included in the Project and the access of disadvantaged
groups to the Project's services; and (vil) the need for redesigning or restructuring this (pilot) Project.
A key output of the review will be an action program spelling out: (i) agreements reached on changes
in objectives or performance; and (ûi) how the remainder of the Project should be implemented,
including monitorable targets and a timetable. As an input to the mid-term review, an independent
evaluation would be undertaken bg independent outside consultants. This evaluation would include
a qualitative assesument of the items and topics mentioned above and which are detailed in the Project
Implementation Manual, in particular the extent to which frequendy disadvantaged groups (women
and rural businesses) are assisted in the Project. During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that it will: (i) not later than April 30, 1995, carry outjointly with IDA the comprehensive
mid-term review of the progress of the Project; «i) not later than four weeks prior to such review,
submit te IDA a report by consultants evaluathng the progress of the Project; and (iii) soon after the
mid-term review, implement the recommendations of such review in accordance with an agreed action
plan.
2.22         Environmental Monitoring Provisions.  'e Project's components have no
environmental impact.  However, Mali's banlcs are currently no; equipped to undertake ful
environmental assessments of investment proposals. Therefore, in line with the recently prepared
Environmental Strategy for Mali, the training to be provided to staff of the banks will include
methods for identifying and fiagging the potential for adverse environmental effects in investment
proposals. 'Me proposed Project is categorized C for environmental purposes.
2.23         Proect Svision. 'he Project will be supervised up to four times yearly by IDA,
in accordance with the Supervision Plan outlined in the Implementation Manual. A staff of the
Resident Mission in Mali will also continuously follow up on implementation progress. Two years
after credit effectiveness, a full mid-term review (mini re-appraisal) will be undertaken in Bamako
jointly by GOM and IDA, as a result of whb u any or all Project components could be redesigned.

Note: Fgures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the IDA credit.
2.25         Ihe Project includes civil works for reiabiitation and renovation of offices. Works
contracts of a total value of US$0.44 million equivalent including contingencies would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertized locally (LCB) in accordance with procedures acceptable
to IDA. Procurement of vehicles, office equipment, furniture and materials for support institutions,
which would be purcbased in small lots and in the aggregate would not eoceed US$0.48 million
equivalent including contingencies, would be on the basis of competitive bids adverdzed locally
(LCB). Civil works and goods contracts in lots of US$100,000 or more would be subjected to prior
review by IDA. Consultas financed by IDA, totalling US$8.52 million equivalent, would be
contracted in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Ihe nature of these
consultancy services would be mostly tecbnical assistance to private enterprises, but would also
include sp=cialist service for BEP, the banks and the PMU asd for studis.
2.26         Ihe PMU and APEP would be responsible for procurenien. Ihi PMU, and the
Primo Minister's office are familiar with IDA guidelines. APEP has only reueny been established,
and therefore has Do track record on procurement. However, the i t iatonally recmited h*her-level
staff of APEP should have no difficulty in following IDA's guidelines for procurement and for the
use of consultants. With the assistance of IDA, the Government has prepared new procrement

regulations, and recmntly promulgated a new Public Procurement Code. Mali's current LCB
procedures are acceptable to IDA.
2.27         Dis       _. r Th IDA credit would be disbursed over a period of sx and a haif
years. The estimatd semi-annual disbursement schedule is in Annexo 10. Of the 16 IlDA project
currenty under implementation i Mali, five (Office du Niger Hl - Cr. 1906-MLI; Power I - Cr.
1998-MLI; Human Resources SECAL - Cr. 2054-MLI; SAL I - Cr. 2188-MLI; and AGSECAL - Cr.
2163-ML!) have recently experienced slow disbursement for various reasons: Political situation,
conditions not met for tranche release and inefficient and cumbersome executive agency procedures.
A disbursement mission will visit Mali in the fourth quarter of 1992 to focus on SOEs and Special
Accounts reconciliation to help accelerate disbursements.
2.28         The IDA credit would be disbursed on the basis of the categories shown below:

2.30         Disbursements of the IDA credit will be fully documented except for payments against
contracta of les than US$20,000, which would be mace against Statements of Exediture (SOEa).
Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at the PMU and APEP for review by
IDA staff during supervision missions and for regular semi-anual audits.
2.31         To facilitate disbursements, the Government would open two Special Accounts to
cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures. Special Account "A" would be set up at a commercial
bantk and managcd by APEP to cover expenditures for the business support and communication
components. Special Account "B" would be set up at a commercial baolk and managcd by the PMU
to cover expenditures for all other components. lhe authorized allocations for Special Accounts "A"
and "B" CFAP 100 million each, the esdmated average disbursement of funds over a four-month
period. IMA would make initial deposits of those amounts from the proposed credit immcdiately upen
credit effectiveness. IDA would replenish the Special Accounts upon receipt of satisfactory proof of
lncurred eligible expenditures. Replenishment requests would be accompanied by up-to-date bantk
statements and reconciliations of the Special Accounts.
2.32         Priect Susuinabiliy. 'Me Project is likcely to have a sustainable effect because it will
(i) help the recent regulatory reforms to take root; (ii) promote and strengthen suppliers of business
services and help to develop a self-sufficient consulting and training market locally; Ciii) enable Mali's
economic chambers to function more effectively and to gradually stand on their own outside the
dministration's shadow; and (iv) set the stage for deepening Mali's financial system by inducing
instittional improvements in commercial banks and by linking them to local communities dirough
mualist savings/credit institutions.

2.33         lhe PMU would consolidate and submit to IDA: (1) semi-atnual progress reports on
Project implementation; (il) annual financial statements on Project expenditures; (iii) anmual work
programs and budgets for the following year; and (iv) a project completion report within six months
of the credit closing date. Project accounts, including the Special Account, would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; aâl disbursements under SOEs would be audited
semiannually. Ifhe anmual audit reports, including the management letter and proposed internal
control improvements, would be submitted to IDA within four months of the end of each fiscal year;
isemiannul audit reports on SOEs, would be submitted within three montbs of the end of cadh audit
period. During negotiations, the Government gave     dmjrnc  that it will submit to IDA the above
mentioned reports.
2.34         A flrm will be recruited to prepare and implement a satisfactory system of accounts
aid of a management information system for APEP aid for the Project as a whole. During Project
appraisal, agreement was reached with the Government on the rma of reference for setting up the
system. Invitation of flrms to bid to ustablish the accoundng system was a conditon of neggdado
of the IDA credit. Annual audits of Project accounts and semi-annual audits of SOEs and of APEP's
accounts would be undertaken by eterna auditors satisfactory to IDA. During appraisal, terms of
reference for the audit were discued and agreed with Government.  A condition of ceit
gecfiveness would be the signing of thU contract with the selected auditor.

G.  _oeet Benefit, and Rhska
2.35         Benefits. ibis Project specifically aims at improving the private sector's ability to
respond to the policy reforms underway and enhancing its prospects for leading the growth of Mali's
economy. It will improve the regulatory infriatructure for private sector operations as well as the
functioning of key private sector support institutions (including both professionai associations and
relevant Government agencies). The use by private enterprises of the business services administered
by APEP should enhance their operational capabilities. It is also expected that the Project would have
a demonstration effect that will foster the development of a dynamie and self-sufficient local
consulting and trailning market. The Project will also support the on-going PE privatization proceus
by up-grading the regulatory framework and providing technical asistance to BEP. Additlonally, the
support to the banks and the studies components have been specifically designed to achieve a double
objective, namely, inducing institutional and financial strengthening of the banking sector and seting
the stage for future deepening of Mali's financial system.
2.36         Rish.  'Me principal risk relates tu the sustainability of the recent political
democratization and the maintenance of a policy framework supportive of private sector development.
ibis risk is lessened by the new Government's commitment to continued policy reform and to private
sector promotion, as demonstrated by its recent signature of a Policy Framework Paper and
appointment of a Mbdsre Délégué pour la Promodon de l 'Intathe PrIe in the Prime Minister's
Office. To furter minimize this risk, the Project team has put particular emphasis on obtaining close
cooperation and intensive participation of a wide range of economic agents in Mai. Ihe focus on
institutional development activities furiter isolates the success of the Project from shorterm policy
uncertainties.
2.37         Another risk exists that APEP would misuse its considerable independence in
administering the sub-component to provide technical and management assistance to non-financial
private enterprises. Ibis risk is reduced by: (I) prior review and approval by IDA of APEP's
Procedures Manual, which will be part of the Agreement under which APEP wiU administer the sub-
component; (à) agreement, obtained at negotations, that the Director Genera's performance must
at all times be acceptable to IDA; and (iii) the proposed Intense supervision, in particular semi-annual
reviews and audits, which will provide for frequent opportmities to inervene in case of observed
deficiencles in the administration of the sub-component.

tarifaires;
--   l'amélioration des procédure budgétaires de
-    la réforme de la fonction publique et le
programme de départ volontaire;
-     la  réalisation  d'audits  économiques  et
fiinanciers;
-    l'élaboration d'un plan d'action en matière

-32 -
(ii)    de la suppression des monopoles et privilèges
d'htat. Cette suppression du monopole a concerné
notamment le commerce des produit; suivants:
-    produite de première récessité;
-    cér6ales;
-    produite  pharmaceutiques   humaine  et
vétérinaires;
-    cuirs et peauX.
<iii)    de  l'amélioration   du   cadre  législatif  et
réglementaire.  Vans ce domaine les etforts les
plus marquanta ont porté sur:
-     la libératton des prlx sur l'ensetble des
marchés des produits;
-    l'a4dption d'un code de commerce révis
conforme à la volonté des autoritÀs de
relance du e"-imrec ct deu 4alires;
-    l'adoption d'un nouveau tarit dea douanes;-
-     lA révision du code minier;
_    la révision du code des investissements;
-    l'abolition  du  monopole  d'embauche  de
l'office National de la Main d'oeuvre et le
l'htnploi (ONMOhl), ainsi que la libéralisation
des procédures de recrutement et dc
icesnclement, dans le contexte du code de
travail révisé
(b)   Vans le cadre des réformes sectoriellea, plusieurs programmes
visant à promouvoir l'activité du Beçteur privé ont été lancées.
(i)     Le programmae de réforme* économiques (P'U )
apporte   un   appui  à   l'amélioration   de
l'environnement législatif et réglementaire par le
soutien  aux  réformes  fiscales  et  tarifaires
amorcées. Ce programme porte aussi son appui à
l'augmentation des performances du secteur public
à travers l'aide à la restructuration budgétaire et
l'équipement des administrations.
(i)     Le Yrogramtme  d'Ajustement du  Secteur  des
kntreprises  PJubliques  (&'ASI    a  permis  la
privatisation de il entreprises publiquea et le
lAncement d'un plan d'actiôn pour 22 autres. A
travers cette opération, l'activité du secteur privé
se développe dans des domaines importants comme:
la cimenterie, l'édition, la santé humaine et
animale.  vc plus, l'apurement du passit des
entreprises privatisées ou liquidées a souvent été
l'occasion de soulager des fournisseurs créanciers
essentiellement du 4ecteur privé. Le projet de
Développement institutionnel des 'ntreDricsA
t .lbliuoo   Vu:ltr)  permet  de  corriger  une



-33.
insuffisance conetatëe au niveau du YAste' à
savoir la restructuration interne préalable des
entreprises à privatiser en vue d'aasurer leur
viabilitê. Le Gouvernement pourauivra la oise ern
oeuvre de la restructuration des 12 entreprises
restantes sur les 22 concernêes par le plan
d'action.
(ii)     Le Programme d'Ajustement du becteur Agricole
(k&Au) est fondé sur lIA >--*en  .l'.tiSiALtivO
preiee   a  travers  la  responsabilisation   des
producteurs ruraux et des atsrociationa paysannee.
Cette responsabilisation pourrait se concrétiser
par la participation des exploitants agricoles aux
Consells   d'Administration    des    structures
d 'encadriment.
Ainsit a 1 &Compagnie Malienne de Développement
du 'T'extileS (t;MVl), le capit de la société sera
ouvert aux exploitante.
A l'Office du Niger, I'autonomlation des rizerles
est effective afin de préparer lb privatisatton de
tous  les  services  à  caractâre  Industriel et
commercial.
Le  'ASA  permet ainsi IA  restructuration  du
secteur egtonnier et la libéralistion du secteur
des céréales.
(lv>      Le pgraimre National de Ues*Uon de  e.ssOurceB
.Naturelles (i'MGIIN) vsre à assurer les base. des
productions agricoles et à pèrénieer les ressources
naturlles (gestion des forêts naturel8 Par les
privérs entre autre& ...)
(v)        Le Programme d'AJustement Structurel du Secteur
de l'tducation (PASb;O) favorise lui aussi le
dêveloppement de l'initiative privée.  Vana le
cadre de ce programme, le Uouvernelment s décidé
de
-     mettre   un   accent   particulier   sur
l'amellor*tion de la qualité de l'éducation à
tous les niveaux;
-     relever le taux de scolarisation dans le
primaire de 31% a 36% d'ici 1995;
-     renforcer l'adéquation entre l'éducation, la
formation et les besoins du imarché de
l'emploi



-    Introduire des cours d'initiation à l'esprit
d'entreprise et au technique de management
pour les futurs opirateure.
(vi)  - Le Projet Minizr : vise la promotion du secteur
des  mines  et  contribuera  à  attirer
l'investilssement   rivé  en  offrant  une
assistance en matériel et en formation à la
principale unité d'appui du secte ur lia UNC;M)
pour quelle soit en méme de traiter avec les
Investisseurs privés et a. leur fournir les
renseignements nécessaires. Il contribuera
en particulier à rendre plus transparente et
compétitive  la  passation  des  contrats
d'exploration et d'exploitation minlère, à
former  le  personnel clé  aux  aspects
fInanciers de l'exploitation et à la nëgociation
des contrat* miniers, à améliorer et à mettre
à jour les données géologiques et le système
cadastral.
Cependant, le secteur privé malien couffre encore d'entraves
majeures à son épanouissement. Parmi ceUes-ci, il y a lieu de souligner:
-    l'inadéquation des textes législatitf et réglementaires
face à lévolu'ierà rapide du contexte éconôtnique national
et international;
l'absence  d'une  gestion  efficiente  des  entreprises
privéXe.;
lu  MIIIl4Ue  de  compétence  dans  les   domaines
technologiques pour les secteurs essentiels;
-    l'insuffisance notoie  des infrstructures de base;
-    la méconnaissance des techniques de marketing;
-    les ditticultés d'accès au crédit par les VMt:/J>M1;
-    le manque de structures d'appui ou de leur Inefficacité
lorsqu'elles existent;
-    l'incapacité des banques à maitriser les études de
dossiers et le suivi des proJets;
-    le manque de disponibilit6 et de régularité de lb base de
données statiatiques;
-    le poids des entraves sociales et culturelles.
Le Gouvernement du Mali entend pallier ces insuffisances afin que
le secteur privé mien Joue le rôle que l'on en attend.
il s'agira donc de bàtir un environnement prmpice à I'éclosion et à
l'épanouissement d'une nouvelle génération d'entrepreneurs* Cette politique
se prattquera à travers une approche intégrée imnpliquant l'amélioration du
cadre législatif et réglementaire, le renforcement du système financier, la
définition d'une véritable politique de promotion du secteur privé, ainsi
que d'une nouvelle philosophie des structures d'apput au secteur privé.

6.    Afin d'atteindre  l'objectif ro^  rromotion  du uect6ur  privoA, le
(.kuvpP?nement cntend consoltder !es acquis et approfondir les rétormes
engagdes.
ta)  l'amétioratîon  du  cadre  législatif  et réBlementaire, sera
poursuivi à travers:
-     la confection d'un code de procëdures fiscales et d'une charte
du contribuable ; la charte est u document d'information
comprenant essentiellement des extraits du Code des Uouanes
et du Code des impots, à attention du contibiable pour lui
peromettre de mieux apprëhender ses droits et obligatione vis
à vis des pouvoirs publics.
-     la finalisation et la publication des mesures d'accompagnement
du nouveau code des Investissements;
-     elaboratton d'un no`uveau code domanial et foncé
-     la suppression de i'autorisation maritale de la femme mariée
pour l'exercice de la profession de commerçant;
-     la facilitation de l'agrêment des étrangers et auxiliaire* de
commerce;
-     la suppresston du quitus fiscal pour 1'agrément des étrangers;
-     l'abrogation de 1'Article 204 du code de procédure clvib:.
-     la dynamisation des tribunaux de commerce et l'accélératlon de
leur mise en place dans toutes les régions;
-     l'acceptation  des  actes  sous-seing  privés  qui doivent
cependant ètre enregistrés ;
-     l'adoption d'un code de comserce rénové,
-     le réexamen du  code des douanes dans  le sens d'une
simplification et d'une harmonisation avec celui des bate
voisins;
-     la poursuite de la réforme fiscale en cours en vc. de rendre
le systême fiscal eouple, allégé et cohérent;
-     la mise en application des mesures édictées par le code minier;
-     l'amëlioration dee procédures de création d'entreprise;
-     la reduction des exonérations;
-     le renforcement de la vérification de la valeur en douane des
produits immrtde;
-     l'application  des  nouvelles procédures  de  passation  des
marchés publics.
<b)   Le Gouvernement est conscient de la nécessité de renforcer le
systëme financier malien afin d'améliorer l'allocation des
ressources, la gestion de ces ressources et la gestion des
risques inhérents à toute activité initiée à partir du secteur
privé.
Vifférentes actions structurelles aont envisagée* en direction du
secteur financier. vans ce cadre les autoritis maliennes entend.nt'
-    poursuivre la reatructuration et l'assainiserment des
secteturs banque<s et assurances;
-    dêvelopper le financement bancaire du secteur productif;



-36-
-    encoura5er  le  financement  du  secteur  privé  en
soutenant les nouvelles approches mutualistes de collecte
d'épargne et de crédit dêcentralisees;
-    encourager le financement de l'habitat dans le cadre
d'une stratégie bancaire en s'appuyant sur des produite
d'épargne-logement;
rechercher des lignes de crédit adaptées et en faciliter
l'accès;
-    appuyer les bureaux d'études afin  d'améliorer leurs
performances dans la réalisation des études.
-    améliorer la capacité des banques en matière d'évaluation
et de suivi des projets.
-    amêliorer la collaboration entre  les banques et les
organismes de promotion et les donateurs.
<c)   Le t;ouvernement envisage  de renforcer  la politique  de
privatisation des entreprises publiques. La mise en oeuvre de
la Phase 1 du VA$bk' qui vient de s'achever via',' de montiet
tao  lm&Stoo dçs wduanlh8es actuels de privatisation.   Les
repreneurs solvables, capables de restructurer et de restaurer
la viabilité et les activités des entreprises liquidées sont
rares.
L'insolvabilité des acquéreurs potentiels et la précipitation dans
certains cas de privatisation ont conduit à la mauvaise conception des
schémas de privatisation. Ceci a pu conduire, à des cessions apparaissant
beaucoup plus souvent commi de la "braderie d'entreprise" que le r4 tultat
d'une réelle volonté de sauvetage des sociétés concernêes.
Face à ce constat, le ciouvernement du Mali entend promouvôir la
politique de privatisation.  'T'outefois, afin de pallier les insuffisances
relevëea ci-dessus, le <Jouverneeient implique les banques dans l'ingénierie
technique financière des sociétés privatisables et demandera l'assistance
technique des bailleurs de ftnds pour une recherche active de partenaires.
Par ailleurs, le Gouvernement s'attelera à mettre en place un
vérltable cadre législatif et réglementaire de privatisation dea* entreprises
publiques 'qui précisera  notamment toutes  les  procédures  et  en
systématisera la mise en oeuvre.
(d}   Plusieurs structures développent, avec un succès rmitigé, des
appuis en  faveur du secteur  privé  malien.   Les plus
importantes sont récapitulées ci-aprês:
-     les entreprises chargées de l'encadrement de l'opérateur
économique en tant que structure d'appui à la création
et à la gestion d'entreprises;
-    les organisations socio-professionnelles qui concourent
à encadrer les activités de plusieurs professions
sociétaires;
-    les admlinistrAtions  d'ttat qui apportent certaines
prestations au secteur privé.



-37-
et les autres organismes bilatéraux et multilatéraux
d'aide du développenment <UNU, V$AIU),  lA, CAMAUA).
il a été reco.nnu que l'appui de ces differentes structures n'a pas
toujours  repondu  aux  besoins  des operateurs  économiques.    kn
conséquence, la nouvelle politique de l'appui au secteur priv6 sera fondée
sur les base. suivantes:
(i)    l'aide aux entreprlsee chargées de l'encadrement
de l'opérateur economique afin de leur permettre
de fournir un programme cohérent d'appui
diversitië, en particulier dans les domaines
suivants:
-    appui à la création, à la gestion et au
,-dveloppement;
-    appui technique;
-    appui à la formation.
(ii)    la restructuration la Chambre de commerce et
d'industrie du Mali dans le sens d'une maeilleuro
adaptation aux besoins rëels du secteur privé et
d'une plue grande autonomie par rapport aux
pouvoirs publics.
(iii)    le  recyclage   périodique   des  agents  des
administrations en contact avec le secteur privê,
de même que l'équipement dee ces administration&
-'    afin  de  permettre  l'amiltoration  de  leurs
prestations.
Usns le cadre de la mise en oeuvre de ces actiont, le Uouvernement
du Mati avec le concoure de la banque Mondiale s'attelle à la création d'une
association pour la promotion de l'entreprise privée.  Cette association
servir, d'encrage à la nouvelle poUtique de otti.msll*4-n do  'IliUAIlVS
privie.
Cette asociation aura pour objectifs principaux de:
-     contribuer à la satisfaction des beaoins en prestation4 de
servico ressenti* par les entreprises;
-     sensIbiliber et amener les entrepreneurs privées à une meilleure
gestion de leurs affaires;
-    faciliter l'accès au crédit en restaurant la conftance des
banques dans les entreprises privéts par l'élaboration de
dos8iers de financement fiables;
-     lever les contraintes technologiques qui pèsent sur leur
développement;
-     développer un marché dynamique des entreprises prestataires
de service de gestion.

nationale de promotion du secteur prive, le Ucuvernement de la 3eme

IX.2. Gestio du Pesoel
La gestion du personnel de l'Agence sera faite suivant les principes de la Direction par objectifs.
IX.2.1. )fpi;tlon de la Diretion  ar obiectifs
La Direction PAR OBJECTIS est une valorisation systématisée des tâches permettant à l'agent
de contribuer lui-m8me et directement, à la définition des objectifs de son Organisation.
Par ce procédé, le supérieur et le subordonné, en dehors de toute formalité administrative, se
rencontrent et établissent les résultats à atteindre par celui-i pour une période déterminée. Ces
résultats s'inscrivent directement à l'intérieur des buts de l'organisation. Une révision des
progrès s'effectue à une date prévue afin d'évaluer les réalisations concrètes au regard des
prévisions établies.
JX.2.2. Procédure d'établissement de la lettre d'ob3ectifs
Chaque année une lettre d'objectifs annuels est remise à chaque agent, en début de cycle. La
lettre d'objectifs couvre une période d'une année allant du ler Janvier au 31 Décembre.
Par cette méthode l'AGENCE doit:
- faire savoir à ses collaborateurs ce qu'elle attend d'eux;
- les aider à faire efficacement leur travail,
- identifier ceux d'enre eux qui sont aptes à assumer de plus grandes responsabilités;
- rétribuer leurs contributions;
- sanctionner leurs défaillances.
De leur côté, les collaborateurs doivent savoir:
- comment est évalué leur travail;



-1l20 -
- ce qu'ils peuvent attendre de la performance.
C'est ainsi qu'il est nécessaire de mettre en place un programme de leurs efforts qui:
- permette à chacun de connaitre, au moins une fois par an, I'opinion circonstanciée de son
supérieur sur les résultat de son travail;
- incite les supérieurs à consiller utilement leurs collaborateurs sur leur évolution individuelle
(amélioraion des résultas, promotion éventuelle);
- serve de base à l'appLication de la politique d'augmentation de salaire au mérite.
1. Le Dirteur Généal de l'Agence réunit tout le personnel de l'Agence en début de cycle
leur expose la mission et les objectifs globaux de l'Agence pour l'année à venir et en
situant ces objectifs par rapport à toute la durée de l'Agence.
Les objecfifs globaux portent donc sur la mission générale de l'Agence.
2. Par aileurs, il établit une lettre d'objectifs individualisée pour le personnel qui relève
directement de lui.
3. Chaque cadre responsable réunit l'ensemble de ses collabora   et leur présente, en
expiquant, les objectifs généraux de l'Agence et ceux spécifiques de son unité. Ensemble, ils
anêtent les objectifs individuels.
Des entretiens individu;ls sont organisés entre le reponsable et chacun de ses collahoratur afin
de discuter l'organisation individuelle du travail, les difficultés et les contraintes qui se posent
et d'envisager les mesures nécessaires.
A l'issue , les critères de jugement des résultats individuels sont arrntés.
L'ensemble des données sont notées en synthèse dans un document qui sert de lettre d'objectifs
annuels.



- 121 -
IX.3. rz6.dm
IX.3.1.
La lettre d'objectifs et le rsltat des entretiens permettent aux collaborateur d'évaluer à tout
moment, leur propre performances et de prendre toutes initiatives à l'effet d'atteindre leurs
objectifs.
Ce procédé repose sur l'auto-contrôle qui va du principe que chaque collaborateur est
responsable et veut contribuer à l'atteinte de ses objectifs en s'auto-contrôlant et en envisageant
les voies et moyens ndcesais pour surmonter les difficultés et les contraintes qui se posent à
lui.
Pour parfaire se propres analyses, il utilise la fiche d'analyse de l'avancemant des objectifs et
peut solliciter l'avis de son suprieur hi6archique.
IX.3.2. ÉVALUATION de Fln de Cysle Annuel
Les      l    de service procèdent, en fin de cycle annuel, à l'évaluation des résultats de
chacun de leun collaborateurs par rapport aux objectifs et en tenant compte des autres éléments
pouvant influer n6gativement ou positivement sur la bonne marche du seve.
collabor   prennent conn       e de cette analyse à la suite d'entretien personnel avec
le supérieur hihique et ils peuvent y apporter leurs propres comments.
Chaque collaborateur appose sa signature sur le document qui lui est certfié sans que ceue
signature signifie une approbation de ce qui a été consigné.
Les performancs (cf. fiche d'évaluation des rsulats) sont les suivantes:

A partir du chronogramme des prestations établi par les prestataires et accepté par +AGENCE
la Direction technique tient à jour une fiche de situation pour chaque intervention. Flle permet
l'établissement des États récapitulatifs et les rapports d'activité. Après chaque mise à jour une
copie de la fiche de situation est transmise à la D.A.F. qui procède au rapprochement avec la
fiche du marché visé où sont enregistrées les décaissements effectués sur le marché considéré.
2.    IRETATION CONTROLE DE LA QUAIS DES  ESTATIONS
En raison des effectifs limités de l'AGENCE le contrôle de la qualité des prestations des
Entreprises prestataires peut être confié par contrat à un autre prestataire. Dans ce cas le
Prestataire est désigné par l'AGENCE conformément au présent MANUEL de
PROCÉDURES. Le cas échéant, un contrat de maitrise d'oeuvre est alors conclu
conformément au modèle en annexe du présent titre . Le Maitre d'Oeuvre assure
principalement les fonctions suivantes:
a) Avant I'attribution du marché:
1) préparation des pièces à caractère technique du dossier de consultation en liaison avec
le Bureau d'Etudes et de l'Agence;
il) participation en qualité d'observateur à la Commission d'Attribution des marchés;
b) En cusQ d'exécution:
hv) rôle d'interlocuteur permanent de l'Entreprise bénéficiaire de l'AGENCE et du

travaux ou des prestations financés par l'Agence.



-128-
L'Agence entretient un fichier des Maitres d'Oeuvre qui comprend pour chacun d'entre eux
les informations suivantes:
- identification (raison sociale, adresse, NI de téléphone) de l'organisme;
- nom de la personne responsable;
- liste des catégories de travaux ou prestations pour lesquells l'organisme concerné peut
assurer la maîtrise d'oeuvre;
- délimitation de la zone géographique dans laquelle l'intéres  accepte d'inteenir;
- inventaire et évaluation sommaire des prestations déjà réalisée pour le compte de l'Agence
= autres références.
Les modalités de candidature pour l'inscription à ce fichier et le modalités d'examen de ces
andidature par l'Agence sont similaires à celles qui sont applicables au classment des
Entrepris prestaires conformément à la procédure de classement des Entrises presires
prévues aa présent MANUEL.
5.                 _.                           .
L'une des fonctions essentielles de le Bureau d'Evaluation, Contrôle et Suivi de l'Agence est
de superis  les Matres d'Oeuvre qui assurent pour son compte le contrôle des tamux ou
des prestations , le cas échéant.
A cet effet elle procède à des visites sans préavis des Entprises bnficiaires ou prestat
suivant la situation, auxquelles elle convoque le Maîte d'Oeuvre uncerné.
L'objet de ces visites est de contrôler la bonne exécution des obligations contractueles du
maître d'Oeuvrc.
L'évaluation de la preson doit donc se référer exclusivement au contrat de maitrise d'oeuvre
qui comprend notamment l'obligation de portée générale faite au Mate d'Oeuvre de resecter
les rglea de l'art.

1. La vérification définitive est faite à la fin du délai contractuel par un procès-verbal
d'acceptation définitive notifié aux Entpies. L'Agence établit, alors s'il y a lieu, la main
levée du cautionnement so  résmve de l'exécution des travumx ou presons qui incombent
à l'Entreprise au titre de la garantie.
2. Le bénéficiaire des travaux ou prestations assise à leur vérfication définitive dont la date
lui est notifide par l'Agence au moins cinq jours ouvrables avant cette vérification.
L'avis du représentant de l'Agence est cependant préndérant pour la validation ou
l'invalidaion des travaux ou presations .Toutefois, la réerves éventles du bnéficire
doivent être portées sur le procès-verbal de vérification.
8.   ROCltErDEAIOlrA
Dès les premiers contacu d'une cellule oprationnelle avec un promoteur, une démarche
importante vise à localiser le bénéficiaire potentiel des actions d'ppui et de finacemt dans
son milieu de travail habituel. Des vsites sont donc faites par les agents de la cellue pour
aréci  la nature de l'établisement à parir duquel le projet préenté est censé se développa
; l'ancienneté, la stabilité, la réputaion de cet établissement et de celui qui l'occupe mont autant
de facteur d'évaluation a priori de la solidité du promoteur, entrant dans le calcul prévu dan
les Règles du jeuu et visant à donner une cote au projet (rentabilité + capacité du promoteur
+ fcteu  de risque).
C'est à partir de cete connaissance initiale de la situation conce de l'emprunteur - élément
figurant dans la fiche descriptive du crédit - que s'organise le suivi de la crénoe d'APEP.
Ce suivi s'entreprend sans attendre quelque difficulté que ce soit dans la conduite du projet
financé. Au contraire, la mission d'encouragement dont APEP est investie commenoe dès
après l'octroi du crédit et prend notamment la forme de vstes trs régulières des agents de
la cellule au promoteur et à ses asociés, cautions ou partenairs à t   titres.
Ces visites sont au moins hebdomadaires; elles peuvent être rapides ou être orgnise pour
le compte de l'Agence par des ti  conrespondants, commis ou appointés à cet effet
L'objectif poursuivi par ce contact continu est triple:



* 131-
C c'est d'abord la poursuite des actions de sensibilisation et de formation aux principes de la
gestion d'entreprises : ces visites permettent donc de rappeler ees principes, de stimuler et
d'encourager les promoteurs a prendre les décisions qui en découlent, d'en conforter
l'assimilation au concret pour les transformer progressivement en réflexe managérial";
a c'est ensuite le rappel et la responsabilisation des obligations financières contractées par
l'Emprunteur et par ss cautions et une pression constructive exercée sur eux pour que les
provisions à constituer en vue des éch.ances de remboursement soient mobilisées à temps, de
manière aussi continue que possible, atirant constamment leur attention sur l'utilité d'une
épargne régulibre, leur en conseillant les formes et contrôlant par la même occasion l'existence
et la protection des sûretés prises en garantie du remboursement du prêt;
9 c'est enfin l'apport des conseils techniques, complémentaires relatifs au projet lui-
même, l'occasion de répondre à des questions, d'indiquer des voies de solution à des
problèmes imprévus ou des sources extérieures d'information ou d'asistance, le tout sans
mplication excessive, conformément à l'esprit de la politique d'appui, et sans jamais se
substituer au promoteur, ni dans la décision ni dans l'action.
En cas de retards de paiement, des rappels automatiques sont émis par la Banque à l'adrese
de l'entreprise pour lui signaler un défaut de provision sur son compte empéchant la réaliion
du plan de remboursement, et la nécessité de l'alimenter. Ces rappels sont transmis en copie
à la Direction d'AP13P.
Si le deuxième rappel consécutif signalant un défaut de paiement d'échéance mensuelle est
aissé sans suite par le promoteur, un incident est constitué.
Une démarche ayant plus un caractre conciliatoire que dissuasif est tentée. Des traites à
l'ordre de l'Agence, acceptées par le promoteur débiteur seront éablies pour les montants
échus non payés en compensation des rembourements non effectués et les montants à échoir
suivant le plan de remboursement de l'ordre permanent de prélèvement. Cette procédure, plus
solenelle, est desdnée à sensibili le promoteur au respect de la discipline qui doit réir les
techniques de crédit.
Au cas où la traites ci-dessus présentées à dûs échéance ne seraient pas honorées, l'ensemble
des garanties constituées par l'Agence seront appelées selon les voies de droit en usage, extra
judiciaires et judiciaires, ai commençant par les cautions personnelles solidaires.

3 Eveluation de la Qulité des Actifs et des Risques Hors-Bilan:
1.  Une évaluation de la qualité des actifs et des opérations inclus hors-bilan, les risques encourus par
la Banque, et la probabilité de qu'ils découlent en pertes et dans une manque de rentabilité, qui
puiessent affecter la viabilité de la Banque dans l'avenir. Cette évaluation permettra d'identifier les
actifs - et débiteurs -- pressentant des difficultés de recouvrement et de les classer selon les
critères figurant à la place jointe cité.
2.  L'évaluation du portefeuille des opérations portant un risque de crédit - prêts, avan.as,
découverts, garanties, avals, acceptations, etc - devrait comprendre touts les risques des débiteurs
- Individuels ou groupes conformant une unité de risque 14 - par un montant total égal ou
supérieur au 0.5% des fonds propres comptables. La révision des actifs devra atteindre au moins
le 70% des risques de crédit encourus par la Banque.
3.  La manque de conciliation des parties entre comptes d'inter-sucursales et avec banques
correspondants sera également objet de classement sur la base de la date et antiquité de chaque
partie non-conciliée.
4.  L'Auditeur estimera les pertes effectives et potentielles existantes et les provisions nécessaires
pour montrer dans le bilan ces actifs - et les risques dérivés des activités hors-bilan - par leur
véritable valeur de récupération, c'est à dire en basse à la capacité de generation de flux de caisse
des des debtiteurs pour payer leur obligations. Cas de prendre en considération l'existence d'autres
garanties additionnelles, l'auditeur fera description du titre suffisante pour sa exécution, la valeur
estimée de marché de ces garanties aux prix courants, et la probabilité de expérimenter des pertes
substantives en cas de liquidation immédiate.
5.  Une identification précise sera nécessaire de: (i) les différents actifs classés; (i) la totalité des
intérêts, autres produits et agios réfléchis pendant l'année dans la compte de résultats
correspondant à ces actifs; (iii) les taux moyennes d'intérêts chargés pendant l'année; (iv) la
portion de ces intérêts et produits recues en espèces ou, autrement, capitalisés, débités en
découvert ou refinanciés par la Banque, directe ou indirectement; (v) la portion de ces intérêts et
produits à réserver ou à suspendre, d'accord aux régles proposées; (vi) les différents classes de
monnaie dans laquelles les actifs, les produits et les provisions sont ou devraient étre nominés, en
unités de monnaie étrangère et locale; et, (vii) pour ces opérations et risques denominés en
monnaie étrangère, les taux de changes utilisés, dans chaque disposition contractuelle, et dans la
translation à monnaie locale du fin de l'année.
6.  Pour les débiteurs les plus importants - risque global au-dessus du 5% des fonds propres -
montrant des problèmes réels ou potentiels de récupération, et pourtant subject à classement et
14 Parisq   de  upe, ou debiteurs qiconfomnt  une unité de drisqe, ont devrt conpndre touts tes

ce quotité, leur detail complet sera Inclus dans un annexe.
7.  L'Auditeur fera un exposé des principales traits du portefeuille des prêts de la Banque (et autres
risques de crédit hors-bilan) - et sa évolution récente -, notamment par rapport à: (i) la

distribution d'accord à la qualité des débiteurs - d'accord à la classification effectuée dans le
paragraphe a. -; et finalement, (vi) des breves remarques sur chaque débiteur - ou groupe de
débiteurs relationnés - dont leur risquss dépassent le  0% des fonds propres comptables de la
Banque - quI ne aient pas été détaillés par rapport au paragraphe antérieur f. -. Ces différents
distributions du portefeuille seront présentées tant en volume de monnaies locale et étrangère,
comme en structure porcentuelle, et aussi par rapport aux fonds propres comptables.
8. Une identification des actifs improductives, non directement liés à les activités bancaires originales,
y compris lnmeubles, titres et participations dans autres entreprises acquises par execution de
credits impayés. L'Auditeur fera l'indication du prix probable de liquidation ou cession rapide dans
les marchés, et de la probabilité de faire la cession sans suffrir de pertes addtionelles non
provisionées.

Eléments pour une Politiaue de l'Habitat au Mali
Il est indiscutabl que la demande de logement au Mali est largement supdrieure à l'offre actuelle.
Par conséquent, i est hautement souhaitable que l'Etat Malien continue la réflexion qu'il a entamée en vue
de satisfaire les besoins on logement de la population, et qu'il prenne les dispositions qui mèneront
effectivement à réduire l'cart entre l'offre et la demande.
Les interventions de la Banque mondiale se déroulant actuellement dans le secteur urbain sont de
nature à créer les conditions qui permettront le démarrage d'une politque de l'habit soutenable et réaliste.
Il convient églment de souligner que le futur Troisième Projet Urbain, actuellement en cours
d'identification pourrait inclure parmi ses éléments centraux, un volet en support d'une telle politique de
l'habitat arrte d'un commun accord entre I'Etat Malien et la Banque mondiale.
Soutenabili  e politme de la bclitague de l'habitat
Pour êtr suctenable, la politique de l'habitat ne devrait pas être basée sur des subvention*



-164-
<directes ou indirectes), dotations, ou bonifications au moyen desquelles l'Etat souhaiterait aider les
populations à accéder au logement. Une telle politique ne serait pas soutenable étant donnée la pénurie
des ressources dont dispose l'Etat. Une telle politique ne pourrait pas permettre l'accès au logement à plus
de quelques centaines )ou, dans les meilleurs des cas, quelques milliers) de famille& avant d'épuiser les
ressources de l'Etat. En effet, les familles qui auraient ainsi accédé au logement seraient des privilégiés
parmi des centaines de milliers dont les conditions de logement ne seraient nullement améliorées. Seule
une politique de l'habitat qui serait basée sur la vérité des prix et ie recouvrement des coûts peut être
soutenable et répétitive, jusqu'à permettre l'accès au logement à l'ensemble de la population.
Pour être réaliste, la politique de l'habitat devrait tenir compte des niveaux de revenu des
différentes couches socio-économiques de la population et, par conséquent, des seuils d'abordabilité
correspondants. Il ne serait pas économiquement réaliste de vouloir faire accéder à des logements qu'on
ne peut pas s'offrir. Par conséquent, il serait souhaitable que, dans la politique de l'habitat, soient prévus
différents types de logements et divers niveaux d'aménagement des terrains.
Compte tenu de ce qui précède, il paratt indispensable que la politique de l'habitat au Mali soit de
natura à encourager le développement du marché foncier, à améliorer la gestion des opérations
d'aménagement de terrains, à réduire les coûts réels de l'habitat, et à augmenter l'accès au crédit foncier.
Encouraaer le dévelonnement du marché foncier
Avant l'approbation du Code Domanial et Foncier et l'adoption des textes d'application (intervenue
au octobre 1991), les modalités de gestion du foncier (y inclus les procédures d'attribution de parcelles)
ne menaient que très rarement à la délivrance de titres fonciers. En effet, 11 0,000 parcelles ont été
attribuées dès l'indépendance, mais seuls 5.5000 titres foncier ont été délivrés. Ce qui, par conséquent,
a beaucoup freiné le développement du marché foncier. Faut'il signaler que l'intervention répétée de l'Etat
et de ses démembrements dans toutes les démarches foncières <intervention rendue possible par la
législation précédente) posait de nombreuses entraves aux opérations du marché foncier, et a beauccup
diminué la transparence des opérations foncières.
Dans ce contexte, il convient de signaler que, dans le cadre du Deuxième Projet Urbain, il est
envisagé de délivrer 5.500 nouveaux titre fonciers aux acheteurs des terrains de Baco DjikororU et Kalaban
Coura Sudé il s'agit donc de doubler en une période d'une année le nombre titres fonciers au Mali.
Améliorer la aeston des oaératon d'aménaement de terrain
En attendant à ce que des entrepreneurs privés commencent à investir dans des opérations
d'aménagement de terrains, il est d'une importance extrême que les opérations d'aménagement de terrains
menées par l'Etat ou ses démembrements soient gérées avec la plus grande prudence.  Tout
particulièrement, faudrait-il assurer, à travers les prix de vente, le recouvrement total de l'ensemble des
coOts encourus dans l'aménagement des terrains.
Etant donné le déséquilibre entre l'offre et la demande de parcelles, il est évident que tout prix de
vente ne reflétant pas le prix marchand mènera à un marché secondaire spéculatif de vente des terrains.
C'est Justement ce qui cst arrivé dans le cadre de l'attribution administrative des parcelles de
Magnambougou, aménagées dans le cadre du Premier Projet Urbain. En effet, quelle que soit la modaliîr
de vente des parcelles (attribution administraive ou vente marchande), les acquéreurs finaux paieront



- 165 -
toujours le prix marchand. Toutefois, dans le premier Ca, c'est du attributaires privilégiés qui
encaisseront la différence entre le prix marchand et le prix admtniatraf )b Orente économique,) alors que
dans le deuxiéme cas, c'est 1'Etat et ses démembrement qui encaisseront le prix marchand à 100%. Il
convient de signaler également que, dans le deuxième ca, l'Etat et des démombrements recevront des
recettes considérablement plus Importantes qui leur permettront de finance d'autres opérations
d'am4nagement de terrains et, par conséquent, de contribuer réellement à augmenter l'offr des terrains.
Par conséquent, il est Impérif qu'en vue d'éviter la spéculation foncière, l'Etat et ses
démembrement pratiquent des prix marchands dans la vente de terrains. C'est dans cette optique que,
dans le cadre du Deuxième Projet Urbain, 1'Etat et la Banque mondiale os sont mis d'accord en 1990
concerant la vente aux enchères de parcelles de Baco-Djikoronl et Kalaban Cours Sud.
Réduire les coûs de l'habitat
Il serait souhaitable que b poliique de l'habitat signale clairement ls démarches qui devm. ient dtre
effectuées en vue de réduire le coùt réd du logement. Faut-il préciser qu'il s'agit de réduire le coût et
non pas les prix (au moyen de subventions directu ou indirectes, de dérogations fiscales, ou de
bonifcations des taux d'intérêts).
Le réflexions envisageables pourraient porter sur les thèmes suivants:
- le niveau de viabUlisation souhaituble concernant l'aménagement dus terrains, compte tenu des
seuils d'abordabilllt des différentes couches socio-économiques de la popubltion;
-  l'tuilisation d'appela d'offre ouverts pour ls trvaux d'aménagement de terrains, en vue
d'encourager la concurrence entre les entreprises de travaux et d'arriver à une réduction des
coût;
-  l'utilistion de matériaux ou de technologies de consoucons de l4oements moins chers;
le niveau de concurrenwe entre ls profesionnels du ecteur du bêtiment et des travaux
publics, notamment les bureaux d'études et architectes; et
le niveau de concurrence au sein de la profeulon Juridique et notarlale Intervenant dans le
marché foncier.
AuQmenter l'accès au crédit foncier
La politique de l'habitat devrit examiner ls cause de la pnurie (voire Inoxisteince) du crédit
foncier à moyen et long tev  ou Mail. Un coup d'oeil rapide paratt Indiquer ce qui suit:
- 1l existe de nombreuses banques sur la place; dus urdiquidités Importantes existent dans le
système bancair Malien mals sont placés à court terme auprès de la Banque Centrale; il
n'oxist pas un Oproduit financer° approprié au crédit foncier; et
-  l preue Inexistence des tir fonciers au Mali décourage fortemont des prts foncie auprès
de banques commrcIales et une des caus mjoures de l'absnce de crédit foncier.



166 -
Il serait souhaitble de procder à une rflexion approfondie sur le système bancaire malien et sur
les contrainte 'ésles qui freinent le développement du cr6dit foncir. La banque mondiale est disposes
à siser l'Etat malien dans une réexion et à y apporter l'onsemble des expériences qu'elle a accumulées
dans de nombreux pays afrins.

Annex 7
MAU - PRIVATE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT IPSAPI
URBAN MUTUAL SAVINOSi/CREDIT STUDY
*Objetves
To study the desirability of a complementary financial syste n to be inserted between the present
banking system and traditional financing methods:
* by determining whether there are roal needs that are not covered and why they are not;
* by calculating the savings capacity ln Mall's urban areas and in the different wards of each
towr!;
3 by surveying credit needs by activity categories and by type of credit (investment, working
capital, cash advance, consumer credit).
To define the categories of target populations who could bonefit from this new financial system
and to determine on that basis the form this system could best take:
• by taking into consideration the culture, behavior and way of like of Mali's citizens;
- by pinpointing the speclfic needs in Mali'& urban areas.
To propose a financial system adapted to the needs thus determined:
* by defining the bases of an organization that could b. of the mutualist type or based on a
small-invastor owned system or any other type;
* by opting for a credit approach or else a system based on prior savings or any combination of
the two mothods.
To try out the above proposais by startlng up a microproject in one or more wards or on the basis
of an association:
* by defning its mode of operation;
* by providing its membership base or clientele with advisory services;
* by organizing its management.
To drsw conclusions from the experiments conducted wilth a view to subsequent development
or to terminate them If necessary.

*     Agmncy responsble
The atudy will have to be conducted with the Malian Banks under the authority of the national
and local public authorities.
It would also be deairable for the project's intended beneficiaries to be involved right from the
trt, namely amall businesses end households located In Mali's urban areas.
This ls why a specSflcteerino Committee structure coulid be set up, reporting to the Ministry
of Finance and comprising, in addition to the represertatives of the Directorate of Economic Affairs, some
local elected officials (Govemor of Bamako, mayors of large towns), representatives of associations or
wards that mlght be involved and, of course, the APB, so that the steps taken can be coordinated with
those of the banks.
The business support structures would also be associated with the project; the EDF SME/SMI
prolect. ILO/craft trades and CCCE (Grameen Bank study).
This agency would of course obtain the services of consultants and the project experts and
would work in close cooperation with the World Bank.
Actions
The two prior studios
*  Study the deslrablity of proJect - Survey of urban financial systemn <assesmmnt of potential)
The study should bogin with an Initial very general survey in Bamako and the country's other
chief towns: with a horizontal atudy by brann-hes of economic activity and categorles of savers, and a
géographic vertical study by wards within each town:
o research to determine unmet needs;
O savings capacity;
O  type of credit sought.
This first phase of the study should serve to indicate the desrability of the project and the
wards Un which it could be tried out.
It would be up to the teams asslgned to carry out this study to determine how it should be
conducted, but it wvil have to be based on sufficiently large and representative amples since very litte
is apparently known about Mall's urban popuiation.
*  lmpb_mnt.tlon sudy



- 169 -
In a second phase, the study will be based on selected towns and wards: three wards of
Bamako and threo provincial towns, for Instance. It will have to take the form of a more qualitative
approach empioying ociologiats, microeconomists and financial specialists familiar with more closoly
focused fld studios of savinq in order to obtain a better understanding of the behavior and expectations
of citizens who might b. interested in a financial system better suited to their needs. It will also have to
determine these needs with sufficient sccuracy to be able to deduce what type of organization would best
provide the target popultions with means and solutions suited to their requirements, and to desin
financial producta that meet those roquirements.
Upon comphtion of this second phase, appropriate structures will have to be designed base
on the cholces resultinq from the preceding phases, and specifically as regards the desirability or otherwise
of taking depos  prior to the etablishment of the credit systems and as regards the sources of flnancing
for the credit.
A permanent geographic location will also have to be proposed for the financial offices, along
with their mode of opration and management <estimated operating accounts).
a  Experlmenlon: plot project7
Mim. impmentaton of the project proper will have to include a preparation phase for the setting
up of thi Boards of Directors, the firat investments (buildings and equipment), staffing, preparation of the
managemnt syam  and preliminary contacts with the future clientele.
Thres montha would therefore be needed for this transition period which shouid lead into the
direct entry into effect of the project, i.e. the startup of operation proper, which could accordingly
commence in the course of the first quarter of 1993.
During the firat year an expatriate consultant would be the key man, supervising the different
offices and teir Boards of Directors, processing operations hims6lf on occasions and providing general
management guidnce.
Ha would thin progressvely withdraw, performing chiefly a training role with respect to both
the banesa dreoder or members and also its clientele and its personnel. Then, in the course of the
third vr, his rolb wouid b. reduced to that of adviser or controller.
lh. following will have to be done during this startup period:
*  enure tdta momb   or shareholders are aware of their responsibilities, have thiom meet often,
maoke sure that they understand what a bank ls, and how to set up and use a bank account
* try out the financial producta and adapt them to the usera' requirements if necessary;

* organize its management;
#  initiate members, clients and employees into banking operations;
* constantly verify the accounts and the operations carried out;
* find suitable Individuals to take over from the expatriate consultants.
All together, the project experimentation phase would last a littie over tour years including the
three months needed for preparing the structures essential for its operation, one and a half years under
an expatriate and two years with that expatriate working in a training and part-time advisory capacity.
