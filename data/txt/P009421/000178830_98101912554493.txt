CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
The Bangladesh Taka (Tk) is fixed in relation to a basket of refer-
ence currencies, with the Pound Sterling serving as intervention currency.
On August 24, 1981, the exchange rate was set at Tk 37.0545 buying and Tk
'37.1545 selling per Pound Sterling. Depending on exchange rate movements
between Sterling and the US Dollar, the Taka/Dollar cross rate is subject to
change. For the past seven months, this rate has fluctuated at levels slightly
between Tk 19.0 and Tk 19.51US$. Throughout this report the rates shown below
have been used:
US$              =   Tk 19.0
Tk 1             =   US$0.0526
Tk 1 million    =   US$52,632

INTRODUCTTON
(i,       The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has requested Bank Group financ-
ing to assist the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC) 1/, a public
sector corporation, implement its urgently-needed rehabilitation program.
This involves the balancing, modernizing and replacement of equipment in 50
of the 60 operational mills administered by BTMC. Total financing require-
ment is about US$175.0 million of which US$145.0 million would be in foreign
exchange. The program has been split into three phases, with Phase I (the
Project) covering 15 mills. Rehabilitation of these mills is expected to be
completed by the end of FY84. Phases II and III would be dependent upon
satisfactory progress in implementing the Phase I rehabilitation and in the
resolution of a number of policy issues affecting the performance of the
sector.
(ii)      The Project would consist also of a technical assistance component
to strengthen the management system of BTMC and the mills. This assistance
would build on the action program requirements under implementation under
the Imports Program Credits to Bangladesh.
(iii)     BTMC will implement the Project through a project implementation
cell staffed with experienced textile technologists and engineers. The cell
will be supported by technical assistance from a ten-member"productivity"
team established by UNIDO/UNDP under IDA's Fifth Imports Program Credit. The
project is expected to cost about US$43.9 million of which US$25.4 million
would be in foreign exchange. It will be financed by working capital/equity
infusions from GOB, internal generation of funds by the mills and the balance
by the proposed credit of US$30.O million.
(iv)      The Project is expected to improve considerably the operational
and financial performance of the mills. On completion, operational spindles
would be increased by about 52,000, operational looms by about 800, spinning
efficiencies would improve from 2.22 oz. per spindle shift to 3.42 oz. per
spindle shift and yarn production would increase by about 20.0 million lbs.
or by 34% per annum. The aggregate incremental financial and economic rates
of return are projected at 15.7% and 27.5% respectively. The technical risks
of the project are minor because of the standard plant design and technology
in operation. Given free market prices, the commercial risks of the project
should also be minor as the incremental output of yarn and cloth would
satisfy only a part of the projected per capita consumption requirements for
the next five years.
(v)       IDA's involvement in the Bangladesh textile sector started in 1973
through the First Imports Program Credit, which provided funds for essential
raw materials and spare parts. This involvement has continued under the nine
subsequent Imports Program Credits with about US$235 million allocated to the
industry. IDA's detailed involvement with the industry started with a study
1/   Hereafter reference to BTMC relates to the aggregated operations of the
individual public sector mills.

of the jute and cotton textile industries in March 1975. The findings of this
study provided the basis for an action program under the Fifth Imports Program
Credit to address operational and mamagement weaknesses in BTMC. Under sub-
sequent credits, the action progriams were expanded to address (i) appropriate
development strategies and policites Eor the industry; (ii) specific institu-
tional and sectoral weaknesses; and i(iii) needed improvements in capacity
utlization.  Overall,progress on implementing the action program requirements
is satisfactory.  Long-term financinig for the private sector (mainly special-
ized textile mills) has been prov:Lded through credits to the Bangladesh Shilpa
Bank (BSB) and credit facilities made available to the handloom sector through
three credits for small-scale industry.



I    THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR 1/
Structure of the Sector 2/
1.01      Although accounting for only 8% of GDP in FY81, the industrial
sector is an important element in tne Bangladesh economy,  It produces basic
consumer goods, supplies agriculture wi th key inputs, produces a substantial
part of the country's exports and is a major employer. The sector contributes
about 60% of export earnings and employs about five million people. Large and
medium scale units account for about 70% of the sector s contribution to GDP,
about 50% of the total value added and employ about 350,000 people. The
balance of GDP contribution manufacturing value added and employment is generat-
ed by small-scale and cottage industries, The performance of the sector thus
has a critical bearing on resource mobilization and the sector is potentially
an important area of rapid economic growth.
1.02      As a result of nationalization of many of the country's industries
following independence, most of the large and medium-scale enterprises are in
the public sector which now consists of approximately 300 units organized under
the administrative control of seven corporations (jute, textiles, chemicals,
steel and engineering, food, cement and forestry). 3/ The public sector now
accounts for about 85% of the capital assets of the sector, 65% of the value
added in industry, 85% of manufactured exports, and 25% of the industrial labour
force. Although the listing of industrial activities open to private invest-
ment has been expanded, the public sector corporations continue to dominate
basic industries.  To date, denationalization/divestment of industries in the
public sector has been on a minor scale.
1.03      The public industrial sector includes the country's largest export-
oriented industry (jute) and import substitution industries (textiles, chemicals,
pulp and paper). The jute manufacturing and cotton textile industries consti-
tute close to half of the industrial capacity in Bangladesh and have essential
links to the agricultural, rural, and cottage industry sectors of the economy
In FY80, the jute industry contributed about 30% of the value added in the
organized manufacturing sector and abour 50% of total exports, and employed
200,000 workers. The cotton textile industry, the second largest industry
in Bangladesh, accounts for about 15% of value added in the manufacturing
sector, employs 71,000 workers, and produces about 70% of the country's
total yarn requirements.
1/   For an extensive analysis of the problems facing the industrial sector
and the policies necessary to effect improvements see Report No.2191-BD
dated December 8, 1978 "Bangladesh: Issues and Prospects for Industrial
Development".
2/   Excludes mining, construction and public utilities.
3/   Sector Corporations administer GOB's shareholdings in enterprises in
the various subsectors, but do not have the legal/accounting status of
registered holding corporations. Their major role is to ensure uniform
application of GOB policies.



-2-
Production and Capacity Utilization
1.04      From FY75 onwards, the performance of the industrial sector has been
mixed. In the private sector, output of medium and large scale manufacturing
units has grown by 8.0% per annum in real terms and this growth has been sup-
ported by a similar growth in small scale industrial output. This growth
in private sector manufacturing can be attributed to several factors. Firstly
the liberalization of foreign exchange allocations has ensured the availability
of imported raw material inputs. Secondly as the premia on imported goods
have declined the relative profitability of manufacturing vis-a-vis trading
has improved. In the public industrial sector recent performance has been
variable as reflected in Table 1.1 below. Aggregate output growth since
FY75 has been about 3.5% annually but, because of import policy restrictions
(particularly relating to petroleum), fell in FY80 to about 1.0%. The per-
formance of large/medium scale enterprises was somewhat better. Since FY75,
output increased at an annual average rate of 7.5%. However, in FY79 and
FY80, due to a surging petroleum and food import bill, the growth of these
units decline to 3.5% in FY79 and 0.2% in FY80, largely as a result of constant
outputs in subsectors such as textiles. The lack of raw materials, spare
parts and other intermediate goods also affected production and the growth of
the sector.

(Weighted on value added)
1.05      Despite improvement in production, many enterprises suffer from low
capacity utilization. While average utilization was about 65% in FY80, it
was particularly low in chemicals (50%), engineering (50%), and steel (50%).
Common factors influencing utilization include irregular and insufficient
supplies of raw materials; equipment breakdown and poor maintenance; frequent
power failures and inadequate working capital due to delayed subsidy infusions.
The mixed performance of the sector is also the result of a number of Govern-
ment policy and institutional weaknesses, including labour policies inducing
over-employment and low labour productivity due to inappropriate incentive
systems. These policy weaknesses are compounded by the weaknesses in the
administrative structures of the sector corporations, including overcentrali-
zation of authority. Thus, low capacity utilization is only a symptom of
many serious problems affecting production efficiency. Under the Fourth to
the Eighth Imports Program Credits, specific action programs were developed
with GOB to help rectify these problems, particularly in the jute, textile,
and pulp and paper industries. AE; a result, improvements in the production
efficiency of the jute industry halve aided its conversion into a profitable



industry. For the textile industry the foundations have been laid for the
next steps toward bringing the industry as a whole to profitable operation.
Investment
1.06      Before independence, industry was predominantly private sector, but
controlled by Government using a framework of controls, licensing and government
allocation of resources. With independence, the structure of industry changed
dramatically, 85% of the country's capital assets were nationalized and
private investors were restricted by limits on allowable investment and areas
of operation. Since FY75, however, GOB has progressively relaxed its controls
over industrial investment, with the encouragement of private investment in
the industrial sector. Limits on the size of private sector projects have
been lifted, although projects above Tk 100 million (US$5.26 million) must be
approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).
GOB now permits private sector investment in 50 sectors, including textile
(paragraph 2.23) and sugar, previously reserved to the public sector. Encour-
aged by these actions, private investment has grown rapidly over the past five
years, rising in current prices, from a very low base of Tk 198.0 million
(US$10.4 million) in FY76 to Tk 1.2 billion (US$63.2 million) in FY80. GOB's
Second Five Year Plan (SFYP) for FY81-FY85 projects that private investment
will grow at about 25.0% per annum during the plan period. The Government
envisage also that the pattern of private sector investment will change to
one of considerable and growing diversification--in contrast to past and
present concentration in food, paper products, and transportation. Table 1.2
below shows the anticipated distribution of investment during the plan period.
The projection of an investment level of Tk 43.8 billion (US$2.3 billion) is
clearly an ambitious target but it may be attainable if resources are avail-
able, and specifically in the case of the private sector if elements of major
distortion in GOB's industrial policy framework are removed (paragraph 1.12).

GOB's Industrial Strategy
1.07      From 1973 until 1975 GOB's industrial objectives and strategy were
biased toward the use of the public sector as the vehicle for achieving indus-
trial development.  In 1975 this emphasis was changed when GOB announced its
policy of encouraging private invesltment. Since then, output has recovered
and a transition to a greater involvement of private enterprise in industrial
development has taken place (paragraph 1.06).
1.08      While GOB's policy changes have contributed towards the development
of a comprehensive industrial strategy, little progress has been achieved in
rationalizing public industrial investment as an aid to improving efficiency
and capacity utilization. Since FY76, 65% of public industrial investment
has been concentrated in five large import-substitution projects.  Some of
these investments, particularly those in the engineering sector, were poorly
conceived and have resulted in an enormous waste of investible resources.
The concentration of investment has also meant that many long-needed invest-
ments for rehabilitation 1/ of existing plants have been unduly postponed.
However, some progress has been made over the past two years in redressing
this imbalance, with major BMR programs being implemented in the jute and
fertilizer sectors and programs proposed for the cotton textile and pulp
and paper sectors.
1.09      Since 1978, GOB and IDA have sought to draw together into a compre-
hensive industrial strategy, the policy developments and objectives that have
been identified under the various lending and technical assistance programs
for the sector. A first step in this exercise was the focusing on the need
for a comprehensive export development program (EDP), including removal of
supply constraints for non-traditional exports, increasing effectiveness of
export incentives, and improvemenit of data collection and analysis necessary
to monitor export performance. Progress on these actions are satisfactory
and the EDP incorporated into the SFYP. Under the EDP GOB is counting upon
the private sector to play a critical role in the development of manufactured
goods exports. Public sector exports of manufactured goods are only expected
to rise from Tk 7.1 billion in FY80 to Tk 7.9 billion in FY85, a real increase
of only 2.2% per annum, and these will continue to be overwhelmingly dominated
by jute goods. Private sector manufactured exports, in contrast, are targeted
to increase from Tk 2.7 billion to l'k 5.9 billion over the next five years and
over 85% of this increase is anticipated to emerge in three sectors: cotton
textiles (including ready made garments), fisheries products, and leather.
1.10      GOB's principal objectives for development during FY81-FY85 are to:
(i) expand domestic production of essential "basic needs" and mass consumption
commodities; (ii) provide for the domestic manufacture of inputs necessary
to achieve major Plan targets in other sectors, including self-sufficiency
in foodgrains and the spread of rural electricfication; (iii) maximize the
use of local raw materials and naturals resources; (iv) create more employ-
ment and promote balanced regional development through the promotion of small-
scale, labor-intensive industries (e.g. handlooms etc.); and (v) improve the
1/   Rehabilitation includes balancing, modernizing and replacement of equip-
ment.



balance of payments by accelerating the growth of export-oriented and import-
substituting industries. The industrial sector is not expected to be a major
contributor to achieving these objectives.  Rather, industrial growth is
expected to be derived from the linkages between industry and other major
sectors of the economy. Thus, the industrial investment program, particularly
with respect to the public sector, is oriented predominatly towards import-
substitution investments for the domestic market.
1.11      In the SYFP, GOB envisages a substantial improvement in capital
output/ratios. However, if these improvements are to be achieved, there is a
need to increase the capacity utilization of existing facilities. In sectors,
such as the textile sector, where capital stock has been allowed to deteriorate,
rehabilitation programs offer possibilities of high incremental returns for
relatively low levels of capital expenditures. Against this background, GOB
has allocated 9.8% (US$226.3 million) of SFYP expenditure for rehabilitation
programs. The priority accorded to rehabilitation programs and to expanding
the supply of "basic needs" and some mass consumption items (such as cloth) is
appropriate in view of both the country's needs and comparative advantages.
1.12       Although the SFYP recognizes the importance of private investment,
insufficient attention has been paid so far to the provision of a conducive
policy environment for a more vigorous growth of private investment in the
efficient industrial sectors. As is the case in many developing countries
which have practiced inward looking policies for an extended period of time,
the present trade and industrial policy framework demonstrates major distor-
tionary effects on the allocation of scarce resources within the industrial
sector. In view of this, and in collaboration with IDA, GOB has identified
the need for corrective actions in the area of trade and industrial policies
including export policies, tariffs, fiscal and other incentives as well as
industrial sectoral planning and investment promotion. Since October 1980,
IDA and GOB have been involved in shaping a reform program which would
eventually be expected to lead to major corrective actions across a broad
front of trade and industrial policies. In the medium term, these actions
should facilitate the external adjustments required to bring about a more
optimistic balance of payments outlook.
II. THE TEXTILE SECTOR
Background
2.01       The textile industry is one of Bangladesh's oldest and most import-
tant industrial subsectors. It employs about 1.0 million people, accounts for
about 30% of manufacturing value added and meets about 85% of the country's
total demand for cloth.
2.02       Past growth of the industry has been mixed.  At the partition of
India in 1947, the installed capacity in Bangladesh consisted of about 110,000
spindles, 2,700 automatic looms and about 100,000 handlooms. From 1947 until
1972, using readily available and relatively cheap raw cotton from West



- 6 -
Pakistan 1/, the industry experienced a steady growth rate. By late 1971,
supported by technical expertise from West Pakistan, installed capacity had
grown to about 858,000 spindles, 7,400 automatic looms and 300,000 handlooms,
producing a steady flow of finished products for the large West Pakistan
market. In 1972, immediately prior to the creation of Bangladesh, the growth
of the industry halted, as West Pakistan investors stopped investment and in
many cases actually disinvested by rnnning down inventories, reducing main-
tenance and transferring surplus funds. Supplies of raw materials dried up
and non-Bengali management and technicians returned to West Pakistan. Without
technical supervision and ongoing maintenance, existing facilities started to
deteriorate.
2.03      Since 1972 the adjusted growth rate in the number of spindles has
been about 41% and automatic looms about 9% (Table 2.1). The market has never
presented a constraint to the expansion of the industry as domestic demand,
despite a low annual per capita income, is substantial. Inadequate foreign
exchange for raw materials and spare parts, low production efficiency and
inferior product quality as well as restrictive Government policies, have
however been the major obstacles to the growth of the industry.

Structure of the Industry
2.04      Since 1974, the textile industry has been administered by the
Ministry of Textiles (MOT). 2/ It is responsible for the development of the
1/   Only a very limited amount of cotton was grown in Bangladesh and this
was unsuitable for producing medium counts of yarn.
2/   Following the recent (November 1981) elections and the subsequent re-
structuring of Cabinet positions the MOT has now been merged with the
Ministry of Jute to create the Ministry of Jute and Textiles.

foulr main su'bse>ors of the industry, i.e. the public sector units, private
sector speciaiized mills and powerlooms, the handloom sector, and the ready
made garment indust-ry. It liases with the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Cotton Development Board on GOB's plans for the development of indigenous
cotton rescurces- Annex 2.1 shows the organization structure of the Cotton
Textile k;ing of the Ministry.
2.05      The textile industry is dominated by the 60 large public sector
m11Es which v< ere nationalized in 1972, 1/ leaving only small-scale units of
powe:rlooms andS handlooms in the private sector. The public sector mills
account for all spinning capacity, about 60% of finishing capacity and about
10% of weaving capacity. About 1.1 million spindles, 7,600 looms and 400
specialized looms, were operated by the public sector in FY81. The sector
employs about 70,000 workers (or 4% of the industrial workforce) contributes
15% of manufacturing value added, produces about 70% of the country-s yarn
requirements. and about 11% of cloth requirements.
2.06      Even though the public sector dominates, private enterprise forms
an important part of the textile industry, especially in weaving and to a
lesser extent in ready made garment production. It is estimated that about
437,000 handlooms, 1,200 power looms and 300 hosiery units are operated in the
private sector. 2/ The private sector enterprises are all small-scale units
with 1 to 25 looms per unit. Only 260,000 handlooms are in operation with
the balance idle through lack of working capital, spare parts or yarn. Most
of the handlooms are pit fly looms (62%) or semi automatic (23%), with the
balance either pit throw or fly shuttle looms. About 25% of the units also
had dyeing and finishing facilities. The handloom units provide direct
employment to about 0.9 million people, of which 57% are family loom owners
and 42% employed weavers. Operating on a full and/or part-time basis, the
average production per loom year is about 1,700 yds. Overall, the subsector
produces about 440 million yds. of cloth per annum. This meets about 70% of
the country's medium/coarse grade requirements. The power loom units account
for about 5% of the country's cloth requirements.
2.07       The technology used in the industry varies, but in the public sector
is mainly conventional technology based on automatic shuttle looms and ring
spindles. Since cotton is not grown in substantial quantities in the country
(paragraph 2.02 ), the industry is making increasing use of manmade fibres
(mmf) in both staple fibre and continuous filament form adapting existing
equipment wherever possible. At present, use of mmf in the public sector is
limited to the use of viscose and polyester staple fibre, while the private
sector weaving units tend to use more blended/straight mmf yarn. The produc-
tion flow of the industry is essentially horizontal with specialization in
yarn production, weaving and finishing. Of the 60 operational mills in
1/   In all there are 74 public sector textile mills although only 60 are
fully operational.

the public sector, 16 are composite, i.e. with finishing facilities, 10 are
semi-composite mills (i.e. with spinning and weaving facilities), while the
balance are spinning mills. The private powerloom weaving units send their
cloth to central facilities for finishing and dyeing. The handloom sector
also concentrates on weaving, sending yarn for dyeing or cloth for finishing
to the processing centres operated by the Bangladesh Handloom Board (BHB) or
the private sector.  Although specialized, the industry is currently ineffi-
cient. At the whole world average rate of production per year per installed
spindle (i.e 4.8 oz. per spindle shift), the 1.1 million spindles of the
industry should have produced about 300.0 million lbs. of yarn, more than
double that actually produced during FY81.  However, poor quality raw material,
vintage equipment and the lack of maintenance and spare parts constrain pro-
duction. Operation of the idle handlooms would have increased cloth produc-
tion to about 1.3 million yards, significantly more than the demand projected
in the SFYP.
The Market and Marketing
2.08       The Supply and Consumption of Textiles.  Cloth availability per
capita has varied considerably during the pre and post-independence periods.
While no accurate data of handloom production are available for FY81, the
figures are expected to be similar to those of FY80, in which case per capita
availability is expected to remain at about 6 yards. This is hardly suffi-
cient to make 3 lungis for the adult male or 1 saree for the adult female.
This availability is very low considering the 1972 cloth consumption per
capita for South Asia was estimated at 20 yards. 1/

2.09       Imports of Cotton, Yarn and Cloth.  BTMC has been entrusted with
all imports of raw cotton and the bulk of staple fibre imports. Annual
imports are currently about 120.0 million lbs. of cotton and about 5.0 million
lbs. of mnf. To the extent that production of local raw cotton does not meet
the projections in the SFYP, imports of cotton would continue to strain GOB's
foreign exchange resources. Imports of yarn and cloth are made mainly by the
private sector using direct import licences and imports under the Wage Earners
Scheme (WES) and Import Entitlement Certificates (IEC) (formerly Export Perfor-
mance Licences) Schemes. Volumes are difficult to ascertain as imports under
these schemes do not require import licences. In FY80, about 3.2 million lbs.
were import under direct licences. Imports by way of direct import licences
attract a tariff and sales duty of about 40%, while imports under the WES are
duty free. The regulations for importing finished fabrics are similar to those
for yarn and cloth. However, in order to protect the handloom sector, imports
of gray cloth, cotton sarees and cotton print of less than 38" are banned.
Imports thus consist mainly of sophisticated blended fabrics used in the pro-
duction of garments and high quality/high-priced sarees. Recently, a consider-
able amount of low cost synthetic, international trade rejected cloth has been
imported into the country under WES and IEC Schemes reducing significantly
demand for local yarn and cloth.
2.10       Marketing of Textiles.  The distribution of yarn and cloth produced
by the public sector has changed several times since independence.  However,
key to each change has been GOBs conviction that private sector middlemen
were reaping inordinately high margins in channelling yarn from the mills to
the weavers and in turn cloth from the weavers to the consumers. Currently,
GOB is using a mixed public/private sector distribution system, with 58% of
yarn and cloth being sold to some 4,000 private dealers tagged to individual
mills and 42% to institutional buyers (e.g the BHB and Weavers Cooperatives)
(Table 2.3). The dealers have allotments of about 600 lbs. per month secured
by cash deposits which are forfeited if the allotments are not lifted.

2.11      The present allocation provides a fair amount of competition between
public and private distribution channels. In the short term, however, there
is still scope for reducing existing mark-ups and securing a more efficient
flow of yarn to the consumer. In particular, BTMC should be allowed to dispose
of part of its yarn production by direct sales through its retail cloth sales

centres. 1/ BHB should concentrate its efforts in two crucial areas where
the private sector might not perform efficiently: supplying yarn to loomless
weavers 2/ who also need credit facilities, and distributing yarn to the more
remote and isolated areas in the country.
2.12       In the private sector, the Weavers Cooperatives and BHB are becoming
more involved in the marketing and distribution of cloth, although most of it
is still retailed direct by weavers. About 50% of the handloom sector's output
is sold directly through retail outlets. However, weavers owning 25 looms or
more significantly influence the distribution of cloth. These weavers provide
yarn to the 1-2 loom units and in turn lift the finished production at prices
well below market price (in effect the single-loom weaver works on piece rates).
About 55% of the small units have contracted loans from the large weaver and
are thus bound to them as the main outlet for their production. GOB/BHB are
addressing this issue, but the magnitude of working capital required for the
weavers is considerable. Greater use of Weavers Cooperatives is being empha-
sized by GOB in order to permit the individual and loomless weaver to receive
a higher share of retail profit margins.
2.13       Pricing of Yarn and Cloth.  The determination of prices for domes-
tically produced yarn and cloth is based on a mix of free market forces and
GOB controls. For public sector production the pricing policy and price
structure is dictated by GOB, which sets product price levels for yarn and
cloth on the basis of average "ex post" cost of mill production. This pricing
structure takes no account of the varying qualities and cost structures of
the individual mills.  Prices are reviewed periodically (usually annually)
although the review does not automatically result in price increases reflect-
ing the whole or part of cost increases that have taken place. Over the past
four years, yarn prices were increased in April 1976, reduced in July 1978,
increased again in July 1980 and in April 1981. It is GOB's policy to sub-
sidize the middle range counts (32" and 40") at the expense of the low and
high counts.  In the four-year period 1977-1981, price increases ranged from
63% for 10-count yarn to 21% for 4C0-count yarn. The weighted average price
increase over the period was about 28%, which is considerably lower than the
40% increase in raw cotton world market prices during the same period and the
cumulative domestic inflation rate of some 53%. While prices of public sector
production, particularly yarn prices, are controlled, cloth produced in the
private sector (i.e. by the powerloom and the handloom sectors) from public
sector produced yarn is not subject to price control and prices are determined
by free market forces of supply and demand. Thus there is implicit subsidiza-
tion of cloth production in the harLdloom dominated private sector.
2.14       The industry currently receives protection against imports with
nominal tariff rates increasing as the stage of finished product progresses
1/   Such an approach was adopted nmost successfully in FY76 when BMTC was
allowed to sell its yarn directly. As a result of that measure, large
stocks of yarn were reducecd from 23.3 million lbs. in FY75 to 7.7 million
lbs. in FY76 and 2.8 million lbs. in FY77.

to finished cloth (Annex 2.2). The levy of import duty and sales tax varies
according to the count of yarn and the source of foreign exchange utilized.
The net effect of the tax structure combined with a premium of 20% paid on
foreign exchange obtained in the IEC and WES markets effectively raise cif
prices by about 50%. 1/ This level reflects the "infant industry" status
accorded to the sector. With improvements in production efficiency and
quality through rehabilitation the present tariff levels could be reduced
gradually to a level when the industry is protected from dumping and yet
provided with an incentive for improvement. With the addition of foreign
exchange premia and import taxes, the prices of imported and domestically-
produced yarn are as follows:

Development Strategy
2.15       The textile sector in Bangladesh faces a number of serious problems
which affect its present performance and future development prospects. The
key problem areas were identified and analyzed during IDA's survey of the jute
and cotton textile industries in 1975. 2/ In the case of the public sector,
operational conditions in the mills were characterised by widespread under-
utilization of capacity, deteriorated and obsolete equipment, over-employment,
low levels of technical skills and lack of raw materials and spare parts.
As a result, product quality was poor. In the powerloom and handloom sectors,
GOB policies relating to credit allocation, pricing, distribution and invest-
ment were having a considerable negative impact. Against this background
(and GOB's policy decision to support the continued existence of the textile
industry), GOB agreed to a series of actions which were introduced under the
Fifth Imports Program Credit and subsequently expanded under the ongoing
Sixth to Eighth Imports Program Credits (Annex 2.3). First was the intro-
duction of a number of actions designed to improve the performance of produc-
tion facilities through: (i) increased availability of spare parts; (ii) more
1/   Tariff levels are higher for imported handloom sector items.  Raw
materials and spare parts are subject to import duties of 115%.

Industries", September 25, 1975.

comprehensive maintenance programs; (iii) rationalization of product lines;
(iv) implementation of training programs; and (v) upgrading management systems.
Additional to these actions, the program provided for a number of studies to
determine the comparative advantages of the industry, the relative efficiencies
of the subsectors and the potential for producing indigenous staple fibre.
The findings of these studies were to be used to determine an appropriate
development strategy for the industry. Given a situation of comparative
advantage, the development paths of other countries suggested that a labour
surplus country, such as Bangladesh, could become an exporter of textiles,
particularly of medium grade cotton/mmf blends.
2.16      In 1980, a detailed study carried out by Boston University 1/, found
that the industry, represented by the public sector mills, has positive short
and long-term economic domestic resource costs (DRC) 2/ of 0.40 and 0.70
respectively which are relatively insensitive to considerable changes in
price, and a high level of labor productivity in terms of net value added
vis-a-vis other subsectors. Thus it was economically advantageous for
Bangladesh with its low wage rate labor force to continue to import raw cotton
for conversion into yarn and cloth of the count and pic range currently
produced. However, any move to produce more sophisticated products (i.e.
50/50 polyester/cotton blend) or to move to more advanced technology would
require a new economic analysis.
2.17      In terms of subsectoral efficiency 3/, the weaving sectors of the
large mills were shown to have the highest level of output (12,000 yds per
loom per loom year 4/) and value added, although these advantages were offset
slightly by a high capital/output ratio. The powerloom sector with an output
level of about 8,000 yds. per loom year, demonstrated low costs of production,
particularly of specialized fabric and of medium grade cloth, and a low per
unit cost of investment. While no firm case for concentrating medium grade

rates.  The methodology used to compute the DRCs is held on the Project

cloth production in the powerloom sector (or handloom sector) could be
established on purely technical grounds, the low capital costs per unit of
domestically manufactured powerlooms makes investment in this sector rela-
tively attractive and worthy of further consideration by GOB.
2.18        In the handloom sector, output per loom year is low (about 1,700
yds), as is the working capital/value added ratio at 0.43. However, the
capital output ratio is low compared to the powerloom sector (4.77) and the
large mills (19.01). In FY80, total output of cloth from the sector was
estimated at 427.0 million yards or about 70% of annual consumption require-
ments. Given availability of working capital, spare parts and raw materials,
production from 437,000 looms worked for an average of 12 hours per day, 300
days a year, (assuming 40 picks per inch) could be 1.3 million yards - more
than the targetted requirement in FY85. This level of production could be
further increased by converting pit looms to semi-automatic looms, which have
a production capability 200% more than pit looms. As there are no inherent
technical difficulties to operating looms as single units or in sheds of 2 to
20 looms as is presently the case there is strong justification to optimize
the use of existing facilities initially to meet domestic demand and at a
later stage produce high quality, high value added items for export. Besides
the economic consideration, this focus would support GOB's employment and
income distribution objectives.
2.19       Given rising international prices of raw cotton and the slow rate
of expansion of local cotton crops, Bangladesh has sensibly decided to reduce
the cost of textiles by the use of mmf.  Since FY75, the public sector mills
have experimented with blends of cotton/viscose and cotton/polyester in blend
ratios of 60:40 to 80:20. Market resistance to a 60:40 blend of cotton/viscose
resulted in a reduction in the blend mix and the sector is presently producing
blended yarn mixes in the ratio of 75:25. In order to reduce further the cost
of polyester fibre imports GOB has carried out several studies 1/ to determine
the feasibility of producing mmf from local natural gas or the naphtha by-
products from the leased Singapore Refinery. These studies indicate that
local natural gas is unsuitable for polyester fiber production and that there
is no economic case for manufacturing staple fibres in Bangladesh from im-
ported naphtha. It was found that the long-term cost of local production
from naphtha would be higher than the cif price of imported staple fibre,
although the cost of locally-produced fibre would be lower than the projected
cost of raw cotton imports. Although no firm decision has been taken, GOB is
considering the construction of a 12,500 MT polyester fibre production plant.
This would meet the public sector mills requirements for the immediate future
assuming a yarn blend of 75:25.
2.20       GOB's Objectives FY81-FY85.  The SFYP gives high priority to the
textile sector through rehabilitation and investment. In policy terms, GOB's
objectives are to (i) optimize the capacity utlization of existing mills; (ii)
improve the quality of production; (iii) reduce imports of cloth; (iv) reduce
imports of cotton/mmf by development of local resources; (v) utilize locally-

produced textile machinery and spare parts; and (vi) revitalize the handloom
sector to provide more employment opiportunities, particularly in the rural
districts.
2.21       Projected Supply and Demand.  In the SFYP, the per capita consump-
tion of cloth is projected to increase from about 6 yds. in FY81 to 12 yds. in
FY85. 1/ This implies an annual growth rate of 11.4% which is optimistic.
Population is projected to increase from 89.6 million to 100 million by FY85
or at 2.3% per annum. Thus, 2.3% of the expected consumption increase would
come from population growth. However, with planned per capita income growth
2/ of about 4.5% and an income elasticity for cloth of about 1, a more con-
servative assessement of the total increase in consumption would be about
6.8%, implying a per capita consumption of cloth of about 9.5 yards by FY85,
a 44% increase over current levels of consumption. This demand would exceed
present supply capabilities, and imply that either additional imports or addi-
tional facilities would be needed to meet demand.
2.22      While GOB is projecting a 4.5% increase in per capita income, it
is difficult to expect any strikiLng improvement in textile availability and
thus consumption because of the balance of payment impact of importing raw
materials and the slow progress in developing indigenous cotton supplies.
As noted in paragraph 2.19, there are some prospects of reducing costs of pro-
duction by using mmf, but it is unlikely that any effect would be observable
before FY85. The yarn requirements (in lbs.) for the next five years under
differing per capita consumption levels are projected as follows:

2.23       To achieve its objectives and planned levels of output, GOB's strat-
egy for the development of the industry builds on the findings of the various
studies carried out under the ongoing import program credits. Recognizing
the comparative advantage of the spinning sector, GOB proposes to expand the
number of spindles/production of yarn in the sector as follows:
Table 2.6: PROJECTED SPINDLE GROWTH
Spindles         lbs. Yarn (million)
(i)  Rehabilitation of 50                175,000                   38.0
Operational Mills
(ii)  9 Mills under Construction          112,500                   19.0
(iii)  Proposed Private                    425,000                   81.0
Sector Mills                       712,500                  138.0
In this expansion, the rehabilitation of existing units would be given top
priority, followed by the completion of the 9 mills currently under construc-
tion in the public sector. GOB has opened the spinning sector to private
investment and has projected investment for about 425,000 additional spindles.
However, given the uncertainty of the per capita demand projections, the
construction of new spinning mills would be allowed only if shown that they
were economically and financially viable. Whenever possible, establishment
of new mills would be used to disperse industries to less-developed areas in
order to generate employment opportunities. To facilitate the rehabilitation
of existing mills and the construction of new mills, locally-manufactured
machinery and spares will be utilized as far as possible. 1/  Initially,
BTMC's central workshop is to be developed as a modern workshop and individual
mill workshops are to be upgraded. Sophisticated parts, such as ring cups,
spindles, bolsters, tension shafts, etc. would be produced by engineering
units under the control of the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation.
For the handloom sector, GOB has provided additional credit facilities to the
Weaver Cooperative through the Commercial Banks to permit the repair and
reactivation of idle looms. Additionally, BHB will carry out a program of
loom conversion, converting pit looms into semi-automatic looms (paragraph
2.18).
2.24       Planned Investments.  To achieve its objectives for expanding the
spinning and weaving sectors, GOB has projected the following investments
in the sector:

2.25       Under the SFYP, the role of the private sector is seen to be com-
plementary to, rather than competitive with, the public sector. Provision
has been made in the Plan for the installation of at least 425,000 new
spindles in the private sector, although initially, the private sector would
concentrate on specialised textile production (i.e. mnnf cloth), weaving and
finishing. At current capital costs of US$400 per spindle, implementation of
these spindles would imply an investment of about US$170.0 million which would
absorb a significant part of the scarce foreign exchange resources available
for investment in the private sector. If private sector investment of this
magnitude is to come forward, GOB needs to clarify its import, incentive,
protection and industrial policies relating to the proposed units (paragraph
2.33). With the combined public/private sector investment, GOB anticipates
the creation of about 500,000 new jobs, of which 92% would be in the private
sector.
Issues and Problems of the Industry
2.26         If GOB is to achieve its objectives and meet the levels of invest-
ment planned under the SPYP, major revisions in sectoral policy will be
required in three crucial areas (i) pricing policy for yarn and cloth; (ii)
the distribution system for yarn and cloth; and (iii) private sector controls
and incentives. Additionally, to achieve its projected output targets from
the public sector, revisions will be required to GOBs public sector policies
affecting procurement of raw materials and employment.



- 17 -
2.27      Pricing.  The financial viability of the industry and the level of
private investment in the powerloom and handloom subsectors has been signi-
ficantly affected by GOB's policy of setting ex-mill prices for yarn and cloth.
Prices of public sector products are reviewed periodically, but adjustments
are irregular, partial and delayed. As a result of distribution system weak-
nesses, the implicit consumer subsidy in the controlled prices for public
sector products has not reached the consumer, as yarns and cloth are sold in
the market at prices considerably above those set by GOB. As controlled prices
have been set at cost or below cost, neither the consumer nor the public sector
mills benefit from the policy.
2.28        GOB's pricing/subsidy policies for the textile sector, and the
impact of the policies on public sector efficiency and private sector invest-
ment has been the subject of a continuing dialogue with GOB starting at the
time of the Sixth Imports Program Credit. Policy papers have been prepared by
GOB and some limited action has been taken to adjust the price structure, but
little real improvement in rectifying the weaknesses of policy applications
has been achieved. While price increases appear necessary to improve the
profitability of public sector units and provide more incentive to private
entrepreneurs to invest in new spinning mills and weaving facilities, it is
recognised that any arbitrary increase in the domestic price of yarn over
and above the rate of increase in the cost of imported yarn would increase
the attractiveness of imported yarn and could lead to an increase in imports.
The problems of the industry can ultimately only be solved through increased
productivity and through significant improvements in the quality of the yarn
produced. Financial and technical assistance provided under the proposed
rehabilitation project will help bring this about. However, competition from
the proposed private mills and from imports is an important element in pro-
viding the necessary stimulus for such a modernisation. This competition
would be strengthened by a move from controlled ex-mill prices to "free
market" i.e. market determined pricing. GOB has recognized this need and has
agreed to adopt market determined free market pricing, under existing tariff
structures, for all public sector textile mills in accordance with a time
schedule acceptable to IDA. As a first step in this program 10 mills pro-
ducing high quality yarn and cloth have now implemented free market pricing
of their products. GOB plans to complete the transition to free market pric-
ing as quickly as possible with the present target fixed at June 30, 1985.
Progress on transition would be subject to annual review with the objective
of bringing 15-16 additional mills under the purview of the policy each
year.
2.29        Yarn Distribution.  Although the present system of distribution of
yarn and cloth provides for public/private sector competition, the system needs
to be revised. The number of tagged dealers is excessive and should be reduced.
Rather than tagging to particular mills, which can be cumbersome and inflexible,
a limited number of wholesale dealers should be selected to service particular
distribution areas. A number of small retailers would, if necessary, then be
tagged to the wholesalers to distribute into smaller markets. The maximum al-
lotment of bales per dealers needs to be eliminated or significantly increased
in order to reduce high mark-ups. This is especially so for the average yarn
counts (32s and 40s) where dealer mark-ups seem to be the highest, thus neu-
tralizing GOB's attempts to subsidise prices for average counts with higher
prices for higher counts.  Together with the revision of the allotment limits,



- 18 -
the present system of linking compulsory purchases of slow moving cloth to
purchases of yarn should be eliminated. BTMC should rid itself of stocks of
slow moving cloth through independent marketing efforts (paragraph 3.28).
2.30      GOB/BTMC agree on the need to revise the existing yarn distribution
system. A beginning has been made by changing the policy on direct sales to
the weavers. Sales centres have been established in outlying areas and more
recently direct selling to weavers through the Gram Sarkers (Village Councils)
has been introduced by BTMC. To support these actions, GOB has agreed to
adopt appropriate measures, along the lines indicated in paragraph 2.29, to
improve the yarn and cloth distribution system.
2.31         Optimum Mill Sizes.  For many historic reasons, mills in Bangladesh
vary in size from 12,500 spindles to 50,000 spindles and from 100 looms to 55
looms. Although this is a wide range of sizes, it reflects differences in
the product range of the mills. Some of the smaller mills, however, make the
largest range of products. Of the 60 operational public sector mills, 22 are
mills with about 12,400 spindles. The question of optimum mill size is often
debated.  Today, the industry "standard" unit for spinning an average count
of 30s could be said to be the 30,000 spindle ring mill and for highest effi-
ciency, units should not produce a count range wider than 20%, e.g. a mill
of 30,000 spindles could have a count range of 24s to 36s with an average
of 30s. Taking into account the effect of fibre characteristics on machine
performance, the minimum "international" economic unit size for various counts
are:
Minimum Economic Units
Average Count             Ring Spindles         Capacity lbs./Shift
lOs                     11,000                   10,600
20s                      20,000                    9,700
30s                     30,000                    9,000
40s                     40,000                     8,400
60s                      50,000                    5,700
80s                      60,000                    5,300
lOOs                    100,000                    4,800
2.32      To date there has been no determination of an economic unit size
for textile mills in Bangladesh.  Mi:ll sizes have been limited (directly and
indirectly) as part of the Governmentls policy for promoting regional develop-
ment and employment. While these are worthy objectives, the economic and
financial cost of doing so through controlled mill sizes could be high. Under
the SFYP there is no provision for the construction of additional new mills in
the public sector as GOB anticipates that any additional production capacity
required in the country would be provided by the private sector. Should this
investment be needed and not forthcoming, GOB would consider the construction
of new mills in the public sector to meet the capacity shortage, provided that
such investment met normal criteria of economic, financial and technical
viability. In the case of private sector investment, GOB has approved the
construction of a number of mills of 12,500 spindle capacity with the proviso
that the capacity could subsequently be increased to 25,000-30,000 spindles
per unit. However, GOB would monitor total investment to ensure that an
excess of capacity is not created in the country.



2.33      Tre !R..le o-s- Li.-te 17ri-aze  Sector.  While GOB's stated policy is to
expand the role or' i    r5te sectsr in the industry, GOB has not indicated
clearly he,w it pr.390ose3 to foster the involvement.  Currently it is adopting
a policy mixin.g ad hoe and infreque-nt d--vestment of mills with a planned pro-
gram of extensi-ve  si'a   sect-cr I,nvestment in new spinning mills.  At present
there is no clear rationale or program f or divesting (or returning to their
former owners) mLll         over at independence.  As many of these are units
of 12,500 spindlies, div, stmert would provide an opportunity for the private
sector to exoanF   -      ithese  Lo mo,e economic unit sizes of 25,000 spindles at
a lower overall cap:tal cost than that of constructing new units of 25,000
spindles. As of November 3A0, 1981, GOB had divested seven small specialized
textile mills and had set in motion the procedur?7 to wind up (through sale/
divestment) four chronically unprofitable mills - (see paragraph 7.08) with
a total spindlage of 61,000 and 1,600 looms.  Issuance of the Government order
providing for the winding up/divestment of the four mills is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit.
2.34      In the case of proposed private sector investment GOB has indicated
that investors would be afforded the same conditions given to private sector
investors in other industrial subsectors. However, given the levels of foreign
exchange required to establish new mills and to procure raw material, GOB
hopes that private investors would obtain their foreign exchange requirement
through the WES or by way of access to suppliers credits for equipment pro-
curement.
Sectoral Planning
2.35      Both private and public sector units are operated in line with
policy directives from GOB. The private sector has a fair degree of freedom
in interpreting and implementing the policies, whereas the public sector units
cannot (i) set the selling prices necessary to meet profitability targets;
(ii) establish a distribution system best fitted for their products; (iii)
expand or reduce their production facilities without reference to GOB, and
(iv) fix taheir own employment levels. To the extent that these decisions
continue to be taken at the Governmental level, they should be based on in-
depth analysis and appropriate planning. At present, this is not the case
and there is a need to develop the required policy/ planning role within the
MOT. Such a function within MOT would (i) liaise closely with and assist the
Planning Commission in its overall planning efforts; (ii) formulate recom-
mendations on policy and (iii) assist BTMC implement these policies. MOT's
capabilities to perform this function have to be strengthened, particularly
in areas of in-depth analysis of likely future development, monitoring future
development, monitoring the effects of existing policy measures against
desired objectives, and systematic attention to major issues affecting the
development of a medium term strategy for the textile sector. GOB/MOT recog-
nize this need and wish to do so with IDA's technical assistance. Accord-
ingly, GOB has agreed to employ an economist/econometrician by July 31, 1982
for 24 months to assist the Textile Wing of the Ministry in charge of Tex-
tiles, establish the planning cell and implement an agreed work program.

III. THE BANGLADESH TEXTILE MILLS CORPORATION (BTMC) 1/
Background
3.01      BTMC located in Dacca is operated as a wing of the MOT.  It was
established in 1972 with responsibility for administering the operations of
the 74 textile mills owned by GOB (Annex 3.1). BTMC is the second largest
of GOB's parastatal corporations.
Autonomy
3.02      BTMC.  As a wing of the MOT, BTMC is required to operate within the
parameters of autonomy and responsibility set by GOB.  BTMC's annual operating
budget is subject to approval by both the MOT and the Ministry of Finance in
close collaboration with the Planning Commission. In this process, production
targets are set by the MOT. Bulk purchases of raw cotton, (where procurement
is above US$1.2 million), a critical element in the efficient and profitable
operation of the mills, is subject to the approval of the MOT. The pricing of
yarn and cloth, ex-mill, is also controlled by GOB.  In the area of capital
expenditure, BTMC's development budget is set in consultation with the MOT
and is subject to the approval of four bodies, the Executive Committee of the
National Economic Council (ECNEC), the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of
Finance and the MOT. 2/ With these numerous layers of review and approval,
disruptions in BTMC's operations are frequent, although the incidence has
decreased during the past two years. BTMC's autonomy is also limited in staff-
ing and wage rate determination. In the area of staffing, all directors are
appointed by GOB and any appointment to a position with the rank of deputy
secretary, which can be made by the Chairman, is subject to veto by the MOT.
In the area of salary determination, BTMC is restricted by GOB's civil service
salary and benefit scale although some flexibility for change is allowed through
appropriate incentive systems (paragraph 3-26). While the autonomy of BTMC
has clearly been limited and BTMC is burdened with requirements which make it
difficult to achieve the profitability targets set by GOB (and IDA) 3/, BTMC's
autonomy has increased. Under the action programs of the Imports Program
Credits, major constraints on spare parts procurement, raw cotton procurement
(below US$1.2 million), unit personnel recruitment and marketing have been
removed and changes have been agreed in the areas of price control and cotton
procurement.
3.03      Mill Management.  At the mill level, mill boards of directors/mill
managers have autonomy over a limited number of key areas, such as spare parts
procurement, subject to expenditure limits set by BTMC. BTMC is responsible
1/   BTMC has no shareholdings in the individual textile mills or production
facilities. References to BTMC in the report relate to the aggregation
of the performance of individULal mills.

and special maintenance prograLms.

for decisions on (i) senior level staffing (e.g. Spinning Masters, Weaving
Masters, etc.) although the opinions of mill managers are taken into consider-
ation); and (ii) procurement and allocation of raw materials (e.g. cotton,
viscose, polyester staple, etc.).
Organization and Management
3.04      BTMC is headed by a six-member Board, appointed by GOB, comprising
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and five functional executive
directors. As noted in paragraph 3.02, the Board has limited policy making
powers.  Essentially, it is the operational decision-making organ of the MOT.
Through its administrative organisation, the Board controls public sector
mills and supervises the construction of new mills. Annex 3.2 shows the
structure of BTMC. The present Chairman was appointed in 1979 and is
expected to be retained in his post for at least three years.  With the
exception of the Chairman, BTMC's directors have been with the Corporation
since the establishment of BTMC or since the creation of their respective
departments within BTMC. Thus, at the Corporation level, there has been
continuity of top management, although as civil servants the directors could
be posted to other GOB positions after three years of service with BTMC.
3.05      At the mill level a management committee consisting of the Mill
Manager, Weaving Master, Spinning Master and the Administration Manager monitor
day-to-day operational activities. In turn they are supervised by a five-
member board of directors responsible, within limits set by BTMC, for the
overall operations of the mill. The Chairman of the Mill (Enterprise) Board
is a director of the BTMC or a senior BTMC officer. Other board members are
usually the Zonal General Manager (ZGM), the Mill Manager and representatives
from the banking system and the private sector (Annex 3.3). Until March 1981
the Chairman of each Mill Board was a BTMC director. As there are only six
BTMC directors to serve on 74 enterprise boards, board meetings were held
irregularly, usually at intervals of three months. Wich the greater spread
of Chairmanships, board meetings are now held monthly.
3.06      While the greater spread of Mill Chairmanships amorgst BTMC direc-
tors and senior officers (paragraph 3.05) has eased problems of communica-
tions and speeded up administrative decisions, extended spans of control and
limited responsibilities are still evident within the present organization
structure. These weaknesses have been recognized by MOT/BTMC but as yet BTMC
has not developed a clearly defined policy of BTMC/Zone/Mill relationships.
However, BTMC has agreed to employ a management consultant by July 31, 1982
for 12 months to carry out a detailed review of its organization structure
and management succession policies and to assist BTMC implement appropriate

3.08      During FY81 performance of the mills was mixed.  Thirteen mills
exceeded the efficiency target, producing yarn and cloth comparable to high
quality imported products. Twenty mills fell slightly below the efficiency
targets although they still produced good quality yarn. The remaining mills,
including ten chronically unprofitable units, fell below the efficiency targets
producing poor quality end products. Overall production of yarn was at its
highest level exceeding pre and pos t independence output, although this was
in part due to new mills coming on stream.  Production of cloth fell below
that of FY80 due to the closure of a nxumber of weaving sections for rehabili-
tation. Efficiency for both spinning and weaving is still below South Asia
norms and is considerably below general international standards. If capacity
utilisation/production is based on operational spindles and spindle productiv-
ity achieved in other countries in the Region (i.e. about 3.5 oz. per spindle
shift), actual spindle capacity utiLisation in FY81 was about 68%. Power
failures and load shedding continued to affect significantly mill performance,
with many mills forced to work four--hour shifts or abandon shifts altogether.
Losses of related production time rose from 3% in FY78, to 10% in FY80, to
about 12% in FY81, resulting in a loss of about 11.0 million lbs. of yarn.
Loss of cloth production increased also rising from about 6.2 million yds. in
FY80 to 7.2 million yds. in FY81. Labor disputes and wildcat strikes continued
to disrupt production notwithstanding iLncreases in fringe benefits and wage
rate increases of more than 13% per arnum over the past three years. Losses
in production from industrial unrest normally about 5% of possible yarn and
cloth production remained at the FY80 ]Level of about 7%.
3.09      The inadequacy of primary quality control on raw materials has also
been a major factor affecting production and product quality.  Waste percent-
ages for the mills has ranged from 6.7%, to 22.0% for spinning, and from 2.4%



- 23 -
to 10.3% for weaving. With raw materials accounting for about 65% of total
production cost, these high waste levels are untenable. In FY79, as a first
step to controlling the waste levels, BTMC introduced the use of USDA specifi-
cations for cotton shipments and in late FY80, strengthened this action by
requiring pre-shipment inspection of all deliveries to BTMC. However, Govern-
ment to Government purchases of low grade cotton of short staple length 1/ has
been a major cause of disruptions to production, poor machine efficiency and
high levels of wastage. This form of cotton procurement, whilst made at an
initially low cost, results in batch level wastages of 12%-14% of input as
compared to an average wastage level of 8%-9% when using higher grade USDA
specification cotton. Additionally, as the nominal staple lengths are too
short for the end use intended, overspinning is often the norm. Much of the
cotton procured is also excessively dirty, variable in staple length and other
fibre properties. Normalised to 30s count, the output of yarn per spindle per
annum in Bangladesh in FY81 was 150.0 lbs. against figures of 295 lbs. for
Hong Kong and 300 lbs. for the USA. Some of the difference is accounted for
by the low proportion of active spindles, and by the effects of power cuts.
However, even if Bangladesh spindles were operated 24 hours per day for 360
days without power failure, the output per spindle per annum would only be
raised to 170 lbs. With better procurement and greater emphasis upon quality,
the spindle output could be increased by about 25%-30%. Some of this improve-
ment would come from fewer machine stoppages and breakages of yarn, but most
of the benefit would come from the use of more uniform staple and staple
relevant to yarn count.
3.10      While raw material has influenced significantly the level of wastage,
this is due also to a lack of technical knowledge by mill personnel, shortages
of quality control staff at mill level and the absence of adequate quality
control equipment. BTMC's training programs should address the lack of tech-
nical knowledge at mill level and BTMC has recently initiated a program to
recruit and train about 200 Science graduates to serve as quality controllers
at mill level. To support these actions, BTMC proposes to establish seven
zonal quality control laboratories and upgrade existing mill quality control
equipment to acceptable "industry" levels. About US$2.5 million would be
required for this purpose and pending identification of alternative sources
of financing, GOB/BTMC have requested that the quality control equipment re-
quirements be funded as part of Phase 1 of the BMR program. Accordingly, the
amount required has been included as part of the total project cost to be
considered for IDA financing (paragraph 6.1).
3.11      Of the major obstacles to improved efficiency and increased capacity
utilisation noted above, only cotton quality and maintenance are within the
real control of BTMC. Scope for improving production efficiency in many mills
is limited also by the age of the facilities. However, it is evident that
there is a need to (i) rehabilitate existing machinery, through the provision
of spare parts and machine assemblies; (ii) transfer equipment amongst mills
1/   Staple lengths of 1.0" and above are required to give satisfactory
production. Staple lengths below 1.0" (particularly Pakistan/Russian
cotton) result in excessive breakages and knotting.



-- 24 -
to increase equipment standardisation; and (iii) balance operational facili-
ties to remove production bottlenecks.  Action to rectify these weaknesses,
and bring production facilities (and output) into line with South Asian norms
will be a long task, but one capaLble of achievement within the context of the
action progr~as already underway in conjunction with the ongoing imports pro-
gram credits (Annex 2.3).  To supplement these programs, however, there is a
need to address a number of weaknesses in BTMC's production planning and con-
trol function.  This is presently fragmented within BTMC, and does not function
effectively at mill level. Despite action under the Fifth Imports Program
Credit to prune count production, many mills are still producing a wide range
of counts (10 or more) which affects output and capacity utilisation. BTMC
recognises these weaknesses and gives high priority to their correction.  Thus
BTMC has agreed to employ a production planning and control advisor by July
31, 1982 for a period of 24 months to review its existing production control
systems and assist BTMC/Mills implement appropriate changes to upgrade the
production control function. Terms of reference for the assignment are held
on the Project File.

3.13      In reviewing BTMC's performance, it is necessary to note that it
is confronted with multiple objectives and must perform multiple roles. While
mills are expected to operate as efficient autonomous commercial organizations,
they are required to contribute to GOB's redistribution of income policies by
maintaining excessive levels of employment (paragraph 3.23) and by being used
as channels for distributing consumer subsidies (paragraph 2.28). GOB has
also intervened in the operations of BTMC.  It has arranged raw cotton pro-
curement, sometimes to the disadvantages of the sector. Wage rate increases
have been awarded by GOB without any linkage to productivity improvements.
Further, mill management has been prevented from closing facilities and
reducing workforces necessary to optimize production efficiency. Finally,
GOB has controlled product selling prices despite general cost inflation.



- 25 -
3.14      Since FY76, raw cotton prices have risen from 60 cents per lb. to
90 cent per lb. or by 51%. Labour costs have risen by about 125% following
significant wage rate increases in FY78 and FY79, while power costs have
increased by about 50%. Overall, the total cost of manufacturing yarn and
cloth has risen by about 45% and 38% respectively.  The weighted average price
increase for all BTMC products has been about 28%.  Annex 3.7 shows the cost
structure/margin on BTMC's products for FY76-FY80.
3.15      Annex 3.8 lists the profits and losses of individual mills for
FY76-FY81. In the case of the profitable mills, all were established after
1947 and most were established after 1960. In general, their facilities
are technically more efficient and their capacity utilization and output
is high. Analysis of mill performance shows the following split of
profitable/unprofitable units:

The losses are concentrated in 10 mills which have accumulated losses of Tk
551.8 million (US$ 29.0 million) during the period FY76-FY81, without which
BTMC would have made cumulative profits of Tk 220.0 million (US$11.6 million).
Six of the ten mills are covered by the proposed project. With the invest-
ment and technical assistance proposed, these mills are expected to approach
breakeven in FY84 and to generate profits from FY85 onwards.
3.16      Financial Structure.  The aggregated balance sheets of BTMC (Annex
3.6) show the deteriorating trend in its overall financial position since
FY76. The positive equity position of Tk 295.0 million (US$15.5 million) in
FY76, has been eroded by successive operating deficits to a negative equity
of Tk 101.0 million (US$5.3 miilion) in FY80. Currently, 25 mills have
negative equities and working capital balances and rely upon default on
repayment of long term debts and large working capital loans from the banking



- 26 -
system via BTMC to remain operational (paragraph 3.18). Under the Eighth
Imports Program Credit, GOB agreed to a program of financial restructuring
for the mills, with target long-term debt/equity ratios of 60:40 for each
mill to be achieved by December 31, 1984 through annually-phased loan conver-
sions and cash infusions. In FY80, GOB converted Tk 334.0 million (US$17.6
million) of ADP loans into equity and agreed to provide BTMC with five yearly
cash infusions totalling about Tk 860.0 million (US$45.3 million) of additional
equity. The total amount of cash infusions would be adjusted to reflect any
profits and/or losses incurred during the period to December 31, 1984. How-
ever, GOB agreed that it would provide a yearly minimum cash infusion equal
to the amount required to service mill repayment obligations to the country s
development banks on long-term debt requirements. In August 1980 a contribu-
tion of Tk 186.8 million (US$9.8 million) was made to cover part of the total
requirements for FY80-FY81.  Additional to the capital restructuring, GOB
agreed to implement by March 31, 1981 such actions as were necessary to
provide the mills with a 10% after tax return on shareholders funds based on
an assumed positive equity and debt/equity ratio of 60:40. In July 1980, GOB
announced price increases of 17% and 15% for yarn and cloth respectively, and
in April 1981 a further increase of '0% on yarn. These increases have helped
the mills move towards profitability but have not bridged entirely the consi-
derable gap between cost of production and selling prices.
3.17      Notwithstanding GOB's infusion and ADP conversions, the liquidity
position of BTMC has declined, with its current ratio falling from 1.2 in
FY76 to 0.85:1 in FY80, although its quick ratio (representing readily dis-
posable assets) has remained at about 0.4:1. To operate in this situation
of deteriorating liquidity, BTMC has obtained increased credit from the
Bangladesh Bank. This credit has been channelled through intercompany
accounts to the individual mills, mainly the chronically unprofitable and
speciality mills which have built up significant negative working capital
balances and thus do not qualify diroectly for working capital advances from
commercial banks. Until the profitability of the mills is improved, their
liquidity position will continue to deteriorate as they use their available
working capital (and additional credLt) to finance their operating deficits.
While borrowings from the Bangladesh Bank via BTMC provides a short term
solution, the long term solution rests on improving the profitability of the
mills through increased production, improved quality and market determined
prices.
3.18      While GOB has converted ADP loans, provided some cash infusions
and increased selling prices, the actions taken have been irregular, delayed
and the infusions significantly below the amounts agreed. Accumulated losses
in FY79, FY80 and FY81 have added to the total amount of infusions required.
To restore th equity/working capital position of the mills, GOB has agreed to
a revised five year program, with a total cash contribution of TK 1.2 billion
(US$63.2 million) to be provided by June 30, 1986. The annual contributions
(together with the impact of free market pricing) should allow each mill to
establish, and maintain throughout the period of the project, an adequate
working capital balance sufficient to meet operating costs and debt servicing
obligations on the basis of a current asset current liability ratio of not
less than 1.5:1 and a debt servicing ratio of at least 1.2:1. GOB has already
made a contribution of Tk 250.0 million (US$13.2 million), meeting the con-
tribution requirements for FY82.

3.19      Future Prospects.  Excluding the impact of the proposed project,
BTMC's financial position is expected to show a gradual improvement as
a result of the various action program requirements of the ongoing import
program credits. Spare parts availability has resulted in improved main-
tenance and reduced mechanical down time, while the work of the Productivity
Team has resulted in improved operating performance in the 16 mills covered
by their review. Thus without the Project, net profits after tax are pro-
jected to improve from a loss of Tk 209 million in FY80 (US$11.0 million),
to a profit of Tk 125.0 million (US$6.6 million) in FY85. BTMC's financial
projections with the Project, but excluding the benefits of price increases
from the application of free market pricing, are detailed in Annex 3.09 and
summarized in Table 3.4 below:

3.20      The projections show that with the project, BTMC-s aggregate after
tax profit would become positive. The projections are based on the assumption
of (i) increased output from existing and new mills; (ii) adjustment of ex mill
prices to reflect increases in raw cotton costs; and (iii) reduced interest
burdens resulting from capital infusions by GOB. The projections are partic-
ularly sensitive to a decrease in sales revenue and raw cotton cost increases
not accompanied by a related increase in selling prices. A 5% downturn in
sales revenue in FY82 would result in an after tax loss of about Tk 100 million
(US$5.3 million), while a 5% downturn in FY84 on the higher sales volume would
result in an after tax profit of only Tk 50 million (US$2.6 million). Similar-
ly, an increase in cotton prices of 12.5% in FY83 would produce an operating
loss of Tk 150 million (US$7.9 million). These sensitivities indicate clearly
the urgent need for a comprehensive rehabilitation program to lower conversion
costs; and a rational pricing policy relating BTMC prices to international
cotton prices/imported yarn.
Personnel Administration
3.21      Employment.  As of June 30, 1981, the total personnel strength of
the BTMC was about 70,100, 1/ with 68,130 (97.2%) located in the general mills,
1/   BTMC also has a constant force of 6,200 temporary workers.



- 28 -
1,350 (2.0%) located in the specialised mills and 620 (0.8%) located at BTMC's
headquarters. Studies carried out by the UNIDO/UNDP Productivity Team indicate
that on the basis of South Asian Industry norms applied to BTMCGs installed
capacity, BTMC is overstaffed by about 40%. However, this overemployment hides
a significant shortage at management, supervisory and craftsman level of about
1,400. BTMC has accepted this assessment and has adopted a comprehensive train-
ing program (paragraph 3.24) aimed al providing qualified individuals to fill
these vacancies. BTMC agrees also that there is a significant level of over-
employment in all mills and has placed an embargo upon recruitment of unskilled
workers for mill operations. However, because of social concerns in GOB's
labour policies, BTMC has been unable to reduce the excess, other than through
attrition and transfer to new mills in the public and private sectors as they
come on stream.
3.22      The considerable overemployment in the public textile mills is a
major operational and financial burden which has a nlumber of serious effects.
In operations, labour is used as an alternative for quality control, being
used to rectify spinning and weaving faults, but resulting nevertheless in
low quality production. In a profit-oriented operation, this practice would
not be tolerated as the costs of the excess labor would not be-justified by
the improved quality and possibly hilgher selling prices. With an imposed
labor force, costs become a fixed element rather than a variable cost, and
reduction of cost is out of the cont]rol of individual mill managers. As a
result, production costs are incresased by about 15%, making BTMC's products
less competitive with imports and as exports. The overemployment also limits
mill management from offering more attractive compensation packages to their
productive workers and has therefore contributed, in part, to low productivity
and quality.
3.23      Employment is clearly politically sensitive in Bangladesh and GOB's
desire to use the textile industry as a vehicle for job creation is understand-
able. But employment creation should be compatible with the efficient use of
expensive capital equipment. For example, the most economically viable way of
producing yarn is in well-equipped mills of at least 25,000-30,000 spindles.
If GOB wishes to use the textile sector as a vehicle for job creation, there
is more scope for employment in weaving. As the major cloth demand is for
coarse/medium grade fabric, the most economic system of production consistent
with the provision of maximum employment is the use of non-automatic power
looms and handlooms (paragraph 2.18), leaving the production of speciality
cloth and higher grade fabrics to the organised and power loom sectors. How-
ever, allied to this change in emphasis, should be an attempt to bring spindle/
loom:employee ratios more into line with South Asia industry norms. Thus a
reasonable target would be to improve BTMC's spindle/employee ratio of 18:1
and looms/employee ratio of 0.6:1, to levels more comparable to those in other
South Asian countries i.e. to 27:1 and 0.8:1 respectively. These norms have
been accepted by GOB/BTMC as the basiLs for four year (FY82-FY86) program of
labor rationalization which has been agreed with IDA.



- 29 -
3.24      Training.  As noted in paragraph 1.05, current operational conditions
in the public sector industry were characterized by widespread under-utilisation
of capacity, over-employment and a low level of technical staff. As a result,
product quality is generally poor, waste levels high and productivity low. As
a first step to resolving this problem BTMC, under the Sixth Imports Program
Credit, undertook a program to train unskilled workers, upgrade the skills of
semi-skilled workers and establish centres for formal training separate from
on-the-job training. Subsequently, considerable progress has been made in
implementing the program. Since FY78, about 3,000 unskilled workers have
passed through a three-months' spinning course at Kohinoor Textile Mill,
which is presently being used as a training mill. The Productivity Team has
determined technologist/technician shortages, designed training courses,
trained counterpart staff and has given training courses. A training centre
is under construction at Savar, adjacent to the Kohinoor Textile (Spinning)
Mill. Pending completion of this centre, the Productivity Team's training
activities are focused on the retraining of technologists/technicians in
the basic techniques of spinning, weaving and finishing to fill gaps in the
knowledge of these individuals who have many years of operational experience
but little or no formal training. This program is being carried out, on
site, in 16 mills (10 of which are covered by the proposed rehabilitation
project) and will be extended as counterpart training becomes more proficient.
BTMC's initial training program is also being revised to reflect the need to
train about 1,500 technologists/ technicians by FY85 to meet the demands
arising from the proposed creation of new public and private sector spinning
facilities. To support the Training Institute at Savar, BTMC is also
creating a number of zonal in-plant training annexes/centres attached to
existing composite mills. Whenever possible, the centres will be set up in
existing facilities utilizing new equipment or equipment considered surplus
to requirement as a result of the balancing of mills under the rehabilitation
program. The zonal location would permit easy daily travel for participants
from surrounding mills.
3.25      As a consequence of GOB's ambitious expansion plans for the industry
(paragraph 2.24), the training function of BTMC is undergoing a considerable
transformation, changing from an inward orientation to a broader industry-wide
perspective. However, this change is being made without proper consideration
of its effect on BTMC's organization, and on the promotional prospects of senior
officers moved from the mills to staff the training institute and centres. In
the area of organization, training responsibilities are being fragmented over a
number of directorates with resulting difficulties in developing a coordinated
approach to training. In the area of personnel administration, no provision
has been made to provide promotion opportunities within the training function
or to develop a suitable salary structure. To address these issues BTMC
has, agreed to employ a management consultant by July 31, 1982 for 12 months
(paragraph 3.06) to review inter alia the training structure, and assist
BTMC implement appropriate changes.
3.26      Incentives.  The current difficulties faced by the BTMC to achieve
quality production and retain skilled workers are exacerbated by GOB's low
common salary and wage structure for all public sector corporations. The
difficulties facing BTMC are expected to worsen with the establishment of



- 30 -
new private sector textile mills, which will offer salaries and wages in line
with those currently paid in the private sector and which are two to three
times higher than those of BTMC. The need to address this issue was recog-
nised in 1978 and under the provisioris of the Sixth Imports Program Credit,
BTMC introduced a number of incentive systems to foster improled production
and profitability. A scheme to reduce absenteeism has had mixed success,
although absenteeism has been helid to 30% of the workforce. A productivity
bonus scheme has achieved its objective, i.e. improved production, but as
incentives are not related to profitability/quality, there has been no im-
provement in these areas. Given GOB"s control of public sector compensation,
conditions to develop and implement a compensation system suitable for BTMC
would require a complete revision of GOBs policies. However, GOB/BTMC are
agreeable to reviewing and changing the system, within the framework of
incentive/wage structures approved by GOB and in consultation with the unions
who have resorted to strike action at previous attempts to introduce quality/
profitability elements into the system. The terms of reference of an Indus-
trial Engineering Advisor joining the Productivity Team have been expanded to
allow him to review the present incentive structure and make recommendations
for revising the systems. These recommendations should be available for
discussion and agreement with IDA by December 31, 1982.
Manpower and Succession Planning
3.27      The steps being taken (and proposed) by BTMC to address organiza-
tional and labour issues are focused on short-term solutions to the problems
that exist, with little thought being given to the medium and long-term needs
that will arise from GOB's SFYP target of 34 mills (425,000 spindles) for the
industry (paragraph 2.24). The staffing for these mills will, in large part,
come from the BTMC and, while reducing BTMC's excess employment, would give
rise to severe problems of succession planning in BTMC-s existing mills,
particularly in the areas of zonal administration, production planning and
control and training. BTMC has agreed to prepare a program to improve its
management succession planning and will employ a consultant by July 31, 1982
for this purpose (paragraph 3.06).
Marketing
3.28      Since 1972, the marketing of BTMC yarn and cloth has undergone
a number of changes with distribution responsibilities moving from BTMC to
other public sector corporations 1/, back to the BTMC and presently to a mix
of distribution by (i) BTMC through mill sales centres; (ii) tagged private
sector wholesalers; (iii) BHB; and (iv) Weavers cooperatives. However, in
spite of a protected environment, a comprehensive distribution system and a
continued shortage of yarn and cloth in the country, BTMC mills have experi-
enced difficulties in disposing of their inventories (especially at times
when the supply of imported yarn/cloth is high). This situation results
from weaknesses in quality, product development and market demand knowledge,
1/   e.g. the Bangladesh Small arnd Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC)
and the Bangladesh Jatiya Samabaya Shilpa Simmy (BJSS), etc.



- 31 -
weaknesses which must be removed if the mills are to compete against the
private sector or are to export in the medium term. However, BTMC does
not have the appropriate marketing research and planning capabilities con-
sidered necessary to address these weaknesses. Accordingly, BTMC's Sales
and Purchasing Directorate should be strengthened by the establishment of
a marketing cell with the objectives of determining more accurately con-
sumer needs and preference to allow production to reflect these needs, and
exploring possibilities for product diversification for local and export
markets, particularly in the areas of cloth production for use in the ready-
made garment industry. BTMC has agreed to establish a marketing section to
develop appropriate strategies for the sale of BTMC's products and has agreed
also to employ a marketing consultant for 24 months to assist it in estab-
lishing the section and developing the necessary marketing strategies.
Management Information and Control
3.29      Systems and Procedures.  BTMC's management information and control
systems are based on the use of four sub-systems: (i) budgetary control; (ii)
production performance reporting; (iii) financial accounting; and (iv) product
cost accounting. The data from these systems is reviewed by way of internal
audit to identify deviations from executive instructions and by the use of
external audits to assess the financial stewardship of mill managers. The
system is sound in concept, but suffers from a number of defects which weaken
it as a basis for management control. Firstly, there is an extended delay in
reporting operational and financial performance. Secondly, the system makes no
use of standards for performance review purposes and results are not presented
on an exception basis. Thirdly, reports are voluminous and subject to frequent
revision. Finally, the system focuses on the current year-s operations and
little attention is given to the requirements of medium term financial
planning.
3.30      BTMC has attempted to rectify these weaknesses by (i) revising the
structure of the system; (ii) recruiting and training accounting staff for
mills; and (iii) preparing projections for two years ahead. As a result,
there has been some improvement in the overall system. However, BTMC recog-
nises that more needs to be done at a level beyond its own inhouse competence.
Accordingly, BTMC has agreed to appoint three consultants/advisors, by July 31,
1982, to assist it further develop and implement improved financial planning
and control and management reporting procedures, including five-year rolling
projections. The assistance would be in two stages, the first covering the
review of existing systems and procedures, particularly cash flow forecasting,
the design of revised procedures and the preparation of training materials
and operation manuals. The second stage would cover the training of imple-
mentation teams, accounting and management staff from Phase 1 mills and subse-
quently training of staff from other mills. It is estimated that the consul-
tants would be required for about 18 months in order to implement the revised
systems and procedures in all operational mills by the end of FY83. During
project implementation, the consultants would also provide two additional
services, act as advisors to the Director of Finance and supplement the in-
ternal audit and review function of BTMC. The consultants would prepare
quarterly reports on their progress and within three months of Project com-
pletion would present a final report detailing overall results achieved and



. 32 -
an action program necessary to ensure continued efficient operation of in-
stalled systems and procedures.
3.31      Internal Audit.  As indicated above, BTMC uses internal audit reviews
to monitor compliance by mill management with (i) financial and administrative
regulations issued by GOB/MOT/BTMC; (ii) accepted accounting standards; and
(iii) financial stewardship of mill resources. In FY79, after several years
of unsatisfactory performance, BTMC reorganized and upgraded its internal audit
function, creating a separate Internal Audit Directorate with twelve internal
audit teams (each with three members) to review the operations of ongoing
mills, project accounting for mills under construction and the activities of
sales and display centres. As of November 30, 1981, the internal audit for
FY80 had been completed and the audit reviews for FY81 had been completed for
10 mills, was underway on a further 10 leaving the accounts of 37 mills to be
reviewed. A two-stage program has been prepared by BTMC for the completion
of (i) the internal audit for FY81 for the mills to be rehabilitated under
the Project by April, 1982; and (ii) the remaining operational mills by
September 30, 1982.
3.32      External Audits.  ln addition to the internal audit reviews carried
out each year, each mill is required to have two annual external audits, one
carried out by joint independent auditors appointed by the MOT and the Ministry
of Finance and the other carried out by officers of the Accountant-General's
Department. Although there is a neied for a detailed audit of BTMC's operations,
the need for three/four audits a year is excessive and places a heavy burden
upon mill accounting staff already carrying heavy workloads as a result of
staff shortages. As GOB effectively appoints the mills external auditors,
it would be sensible to rationalize the audit requirements, by accepting the
audit certificate of the independent auditors in lieu of the certificate from
the Accountant General. Although all mill accounts for FY80 are available
for audit, the external audits for 48 mills have yet to be completed. 1/ This
situation results in part from the delayed appointment of joint auditors for
each mill and in part from the lack of sufficient firms of qualified public
accountants 2/ to carry out the statutory audits required of limited companies
under the Companies Act. This situation has been discussed with GOB/BTMC and
BTMC has agreed that it shall take the appropriate actions necssary to ensure
that the audit of accounts for FY80 for all mills would be completed by April
30, 1982 and for FY81, by September 30, 1982.
IV. THE PROJECT
Origin and Evolution
4.01      In 1978, as a requiremient of the Sixth Imports Program Credit, BTMC
engineers carried out a mill-by-mill review of production facilities. This
i/   Audited Accounts for FY79 and prior years have been completed and made
available to IDA.
2/   Presently, there are only about a dozen firms of public accountants in
Bangladesh.



- 33 -
confirmed the findings of IDA's 1975 survey that there was considerable
deterioration/obsolescence of facilities and indicated also, that there was
an imbalance of facilities in some mills. On the basis of this survey, GOB/
BTMC submitted a project proposal to IDA in March 1979 for the rehabilitation
of 50 operational mills. Criteria for inclusion of a mill in the proposed
project were that rehabilitation/modernization would give positive incremental
internal financial and economic rates of return and a level of production
costs, after rehabilitation, not greater than the landed (Chittagong) cost of
imported products similar to those produced by the mills to be rehabilitated.
A conservative estimate of the cost of rehabilitating the 50 mills was US$100
million in FY78 prices (US$175.0 million current prices).
4.02      Although GOB had requested financing for all 50 mills as one project,
with rehabilitation to be started simultaneously in all mills, it was consi-
dered that this would place undue strains on BTMC's limited technical resources.
Accordingly, it was decided that the rehabilitation program would be split into
three phases with implementation spread out from FY82 to FY85. Each phase
would be a self-contained, individually appraised project addressing the imme-
diate needs of rehabilitation for the mills concerned. 1/ Phase I constitutes
the proposed project and also addresses major policy issues required to allow
the industry to become competitive vis-a-vis the private sector and the world
market.
Objectives
4.03      The project has two sets of objectives.  The first, relating to tech-
nical efficiency, is to (i) increase efficiency and capacity utilization of
existing mill facilities; (ii) increase output; (iii) reduce production costs;
and (iv) improve product quality. The second set of objectives relate to
improvements in sectoral and institutional aspects including: (i) implementing
pricing policy adjustments; (ii) developing an effective yarn distribution
system; (iii) rationalisng labour policies and employment levels in the indus-
try; (iv) determining and implementing economic unit levels for new spinning
mills; (v) completion of action program requirements under the ongoing import
program credits; (vi) strengthening BTMC's organizational structure; and (vii)
upgrading of management systems in such areas as marketing, production planning
and financial management.
Scope
4.04      The proposed Project covers the rehabilitation through BMR of about
15 of BTMC-s mills (Annex 4.1), as well as the sectoral and institutional
aspects noted in paragraph 4.03 above. 2/ The project is designed to opti-
1/   Chart 1 indicates the location of the mills to be covered under each
phase.
2/   Subsequent to the appraisal of the Project, GOB initiated action to
divest/wind up three of the mills, but will substitute three additional
mills with similar rehabilitation requirements.



- 34-
mize the output of existing facilities through relatively inexpensive BMR.
On completion of the rehabilitation of the 15 mills, operational spindles
would be increased by about 52,500, operational looms by about 800, spinning
efficiencies would improve from 2.22 oz. per spindle shift to 3.40 oz. per
spindle shift, with production of yarn expected to increase bJ about 20.0
million lbs. per annum or by about 35%. Quality of yarn and cloth output
would be improved indirectly through the improved technical efficiency of the
rehabilitated mills. Quality would also be upgraded directly through the
installation and use of quality control equipment in all mills and in zonal
quality control laboratories. No new buildings are envisaged and civil works
will be limited to rehabilitation and repair of floors and ceilings in the
existing mills.
Coordination
4.05      Apart from IDA, other bilateral and multilateral agencies are pro-
viding GOB with technical assistance and materials to improve the operations
of the industry. The United Kingdoma, Polish and Romanian Government have
provided equipment and spare parts to rehabilitate specific mills and UNIDO/
UNDP are providing technical assistance. The Netherlands Government is cur-
rently considering the rehabilitation of three spinning units, while USAID
is providing technical assistance to the handloom sector through the BHB.  The
various agencies exchange views periodically to ensure consistency and maximi-
zation of impact as well as to avoidl duplication of effort. Coordination to
date has worked well and this is expected to continue during the course of 'the
proposed rehabilitation and technicaLl assistance programs.
Health, Safety and Environmental Aspects
4.06      Health, safety and environmental aspects of BTMC's mills are governed
by the Factories Act of 1965, and the Environmental Pollution Control Ordinance
of 1977. The respective enforcing agencies of GOB are the Factories Inspec-
torate (FI) and the Environmental Pollution Control Department (EPCD). Provi-
sions of the Factories Act are not being met, a fact reflected in the high
incidence of respiratory and digestive system diseases among textile workers.
Environmental pollution control standards for the discharge of effluents from
dyeing and finishing facilities have not been officially adopted, but the EPCD
is aware that BTMC facilities are polluting, and in September 1980, proposed
tentative standards for the industry. Bangladesh would appear to have an
effective legal and administrative maachinery to develop standards for the
industry, and to monitor and enforce compliance. To determine the appropriate
actions required to bring BTMC's facilities into line with statutory health,
safety and ecological requirements, GOB has agreed to carry out a review of
BTMC's compliance with existing gpuidelines. This should be completed by
December 31, 1982, with recommendatLons arising from the review implemented
promptly thereafter.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Management
5.01      Prime responsibility for implementing the requirements of the
project will be split between GOB, MOT and BTMC. GOB will have responsi-
bility for developing and implementing key project elements relating to
sectoral policy issues. MOT will have responsibility for establishing a
sectoral planning cell and for the development of a distribution system
to cover the medium-term operations (FY82-FY86) of the industry. BTMC/mill
management will have responsibility for the rehabilitation aspects of the
project. In this regard technical assistance would be provided to BTMC by
the UNDP/UNIDO Productivity Team.
5.02      BTMC has agreed to create a Project Implementation Cell (PIC) at
BTMC headquarters, staffed by a project manager, civil engineer, mechanical
engineer, electrical engineer, procurement coordinator, accountant and three
textile technologists. A Coordinating Committee of concerned directors 1/
will exercise overall supervision, and monitor progress. At each mill, a
project team will be formed consisting of the mill's Chief Executive, Tech-
nical Manager, and respective Chiefs of Accounting, Procurement, Stores,
Production, and Maintenance. Installation and erection of machinery and
equipment will be carried out by the mills' own fitters, augmented as neces-
sary by roving teams of specialised fitters drawn from the 35 remaining
mills. These fitters will be supervised by technical personnel sent by the
equipment suppliers, who will be monitored in turn by the mills' project
team. Overall planning, coordination and monitoring of activities across
mills will be carried out by the PIC.  The PIC in turn will consult the
Productivity Team 2/ on technical matters, viz. (i) preparation of bidding
specifications for machinery, equipment, and spares; (ii) bid evaluation;
(iii) scheduling of erection and installation, and the activities of the
roving teams of specialist fitters; (iv) trials runs, and final discharge
of the erector/supplier; (v) follow-up and entry into commercial production;
and (vi) the general planning, execution and monitoring of the project. The
head of the PIC will be a BTMC textile technologist with 10 to 15 years exper-
ience in the industry, including senior management responsibility. Detailed
project implementation plans have been prepared by BTMC showing (i) activity
schedules by mill; (ii) PIC and mill management manpower requirements by
activity and skill; (iii) time-phasing of PIC and mill-management manpower
requirements; and (iv) a summary time-phasing of PIC manpower requirements
aggregated over all 15 mills. The staffing of the PIC appears adequate in
relation to the proposed implementation schedule (paragraph 5.04), and the
management arrangements appear satisfactory. BTMC will report to IDA of a
1/   Director, Planning and Development, Production, Finance and Purchasing.
2/   Consisting of a Chief Technical Advisor, three Spinning Advisors, two
Weaving Advisors, two Finishing Advisors, one Workshop Engineering
Advisor, and one Industrial Engineering Advisor.



- 36 -
mill-by-mill basis quarterly, showing progress, by activity, in relation to
the planned activity schedules. The establishment of a suitably staffed PIC
is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
Procurement
5.03      Procurement of equipment, machinery and spares for the rehabilita-
tion component of the project will be on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding (ICB), with the standard World Bank margin of preference al-
lowed to local bidders. In view of the rehabilitation nature of the project
exceptions to ICB will be allowed in the case of proprietary items relating
to spares and assemblies for existing equipment.   Such items may be procured
through negotiated contracts or limited international tendering, provided
however that a list of such items is prepared in consultation with the Pro-
ductivity Team, and is submitted to IDA for prior approval. Given the low
maximum value of individual civil works projects (Tk 2.5 million - US$0.13
million), civil works would be contracted out on the basis of local competi-
tive bidding (LCB), in accordance with standard GOB/BTMC procedures now in
force. Floating of tenders under ICB would be accomplished by (i) advertise-
ment in at least one English language Bangladesh daily; (ii) the simultaneous
mailing of a copy of this press advertisement to firms on BTMC's procurement
mailing list; (iii) the delivery simultaneously of complimentary copies of
the bidding documents to appropriate foreign consulates in Bangladesh,
Bangladeshi consulates abroad, and the World Bank Resident Mission in Dacca
and (iv) a general notice in the Development Forum. The proposed press
notice and the invitation to bid, would be submitted to IDA for prior review
and approval, at least 30 days before the detailed specifications are
available to prospective bidders. All contracts exceeding US$50,000 would
be subject to post-award review by IDA. Items costing less than US$50,000
per contract may be procured through Limited International Tendering (LIT)
on the basis of at least three price quotations. A percentage of these
contracts would be randomly selected for post award review by IDA. Items
costing less than US$20,000 per contract may be procured through local
shopping on the basis of at least three price quotations provided that the
aggregate of the items so procured shall not exceed US$500,000. To allow
for the procurement of critical spare parts identified during rehabilitation
but not on order, provision has been made for procurement from BTMC's own
workshops provided that such procurement shall not exceed the aggregate of
US$250,000, and is made in accordance with specified procedures designed to
ensure cost-efficiency. The cost of such procurement would be reviewed by
IDA to determine that it has been competitive vis a vis other sources of
supply. Overall about 30% of the credit amount would be subject to IDA's
post award review.
Implementation Schedule
5.04      The implementation schedule for the project is shown in Table 5.1.
It was prepared by BTMC's engineers, reviewed by the Productivity Team and
by Gherzi Eastern Ltd., IDA's consultant. It is considered realistic. The
schedule calls for a 30-month implementation period with shipment of machinery

the most variable element. This would be short for proprietary equipment, but
longer for equipment made to order. Thus, the implementation period would
vary from mill to mill depending essentially on the nature of the machinery!
equipment to be procured. As no major civil works would be involved, it would
be carried out in parallel with procurement, with substantial slack time in
even the worst case. In some cases, trial runs could commence about six weeks
after the commencement of erection and installation, and continue for about
six weeks. Preparation of the tender documents could proceed prior to credit
effectiveness, and on this assumption, it should be possible to float tenders
about March 31, 1982, implying completion of implementation by the end of
CY84.
Technical Assistance
5.05      In order to support the implementation of the rehabilitation pro-
gram and to progress further action program requirements under the ongoing
imports program credits, the project includes about 150 man-months of tech-
nical assistance for (i) sectoral. planning (paragraph 2.34); (ii) organiza-
tion and management succession review (paragraph 3.06); (iii) production
planning and control (paragraph 3.11); (iv) marketing (paragraph 3.28); and
(v) financial management and control, (paragraph 3.30 ). This technical
assistance would be integrated closely with the technical assistance already
being provided to BTMC by way of the Productivity Team. This started working
with BTMC in FY79 and is currently upgrading procedures in BTMC-s operational
mills, and developing training programs at the Textile Training Institute.
Terms of reference for each technical assistance component and the terms of
reference of the Productivity Team are held on the Project File. Selection
of consultants to carry out the various assignments would be made in accor-
dance with the Bank's guidelines on the appointment of consultants.



- 39 -
Monitoring
5.06      BTMC would submit quarterly operational statistics in a format to
be agreed with IDA, together with quarterly progress reports on utilisation
of rehabilitation funds by mill and on each technical assistance component.
Overall, project progress would be reviewed every six months with BTMC and
the Productivity Team. Six months after the fiscal year end, audited accounts
of the project would be submitted for IDA's review.
VI. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Costs
6.01      The total financing required for the project is estimated to be Tk
823.3 million (US$43.9 million) including duties and taxes of Tk 70.3 million
(US$3.7 million). In addition, Tk 426 million (US$22.4 million) will be re-
quired to bring working capital up to and maintained at the levels indicated
in paragraph 3.18. Details of the cost estimates and the assumptions used
are held on the Project File. Annexes 6.1 and 6.2 detail the cost elements,
phasing and source of financing. A summary of the estimated costs are shown
below.

6.02      Rehabilitation Costs.  Equipment and spare part costs have been
estimated by BTMC based on physical requirements determined by a mill-by-
mill survey of rehabilitation needs;; and price quotations obtained from
suppliers in November 1980. Imported equipment costs are based on cif
costs plus uLties and taxes. The mujor part of the rehabilitation costs
relates to spare parts and machinery components. As noted in paragraph
5.04, civil works costs are minimized through retaining existing buildings
and facilities. Rehabilitation costs include provisions for physical con-
tingencies of about 2.5%. Price escalation for imported parts has been
calculated on the basis of projected international inflation rates of 9%,
8.5%, 8.0% and 7.5% for FY81-FY84, although recent bulk purchases of parts
by BTMC have been made at costs below FY80 list prices. Given the nature
of the project and the ready availa'bility of the bulk of the equipment and
spare parts requirements, the rehabilitation cost estimates, including con-
tingencies, are considered realistic.
6.03      Quality Control Equipment.  The assessment of equipment costs
by BTMC/UNDP Productivity Team, to establish seven zonal quality control
laboratories, and the provision of basic quality control equipment for the
60 operational mills, indicates a requirement of US$2.5 million.  This is
based on suppliers prices ruling in March 1981, adjusted for expected infla-
tion increases in FY82. While the amount required to equip the 15 mills of
the proposed project would be considerably below this figure, the benefits
of an overall program of implementation are considerable. Given the well-
defined requirements and ready availability of the equipment, the cost
estimates are considered realistic.
6.04      Technical Assistance.  For the advisory services considered ne-
cessary to upgrade BTMC's organization/management succession, marketing,
production planning and financial control systems, a monthly fee rate of
US$8,000 per man-month has been assumed. In addition, costs of US$3,000
per man-month have been estimated for travel and subsistence expenses.
Allowing for some 150 man-months of consultancy/ advisory services and
related equipment requirements, technical assistance costs have been proj-
ected at US$1.9 million.
Financing Plan
6.05      Increased working capital requirements would be financed to the
extent possible from the mills internal funds generation, with the balance
to be provided by cash infusions from GOB. This is discussed in more detail
in paragraphs 7.10 and 7.12. Inclusive of necessary increases in working
capital, project financing would be as shown below.

Financing Arrangements
6.06      The project financing would be made available to GOB and onlent
to BTMC under a Subsidiary Agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA. In turn, BTMC, acting as agent for GOB, would make available the funds
earmarked for rehabilitation to designated mills in the form of a loan
from GOB. The list of mills comprising the project as shown in Annex 4.1.
The rehabilitation funds would be onlent to individual mills at a rate of
not less than 14.0% p.a. 1/, which is the current rate for term lending to
industry in Bangladesh with the rate subject to review, and adjustment, if
needed, to ensure that the rate remains positive in real terms. Repayment
should be made over a term not exceeding 15 years, 2/ inclusive of a grace
period of 4 years. The foreign exchange risk should be borne by BTMC/Mills.
Funds for consultancy/advisory services for the upgrading of BTMCs management
systems would be onlent to BTMC on similar terms and conditions. Funds for
the establishment of the Planning Cell within the MOT would be appropriated
from the Credit by GOB.
Disbursement
6.07      For equipment, spare parts, quality control equipment and equipment
relating to the technical assistance requirements, IDA would disburse against
100% of foreign costs, 100% of local expenditures and 70% of other expendi-
iture for items procured locally (off the shelf). For civil, electrical and
mechanical works and related services IDA would finance 90% of fund require-
ments. For technical assistance (e.g. consultancy services) IDA would finance
100% of the costs. Given the ready availability of the goods and services
required under the project and the intention to place bulk orders to cover
the requirements of all the mills, the proposed Credit is expected to be
fully disbursed within 30 months (i.e. by June 30, 1984). Projected dis-
bursement is shown in Annex 3.
1/   With inflation at about 12.0% p.a. this rate is positive in real terms.
2/   Many mills would be able to service debt of a much shorter term.
Provision for this possibility would be made in the financing agree-
ments between GOB/BTMC and the Mills.

VII. FINANCIAL AND ECQNOMIC ANALYSIS
Financial Analysis
7.01      Projected Production and Sales.  For each mill a production build
up has been projected based on production facilities, proposed rehabilitation
and capacity utilization/plans efficiency after rehabilitation. On the basis
of the rehabilitation proposals, yarn production is projected to increase from
35.0 million lbs. in FY81 to 54.0 million lbs. in FY86. Cloth production is
expected to increase from 5.7 million yds. in FY81 to 8.1 million yds. in FY86.
In the light of actual production in FY81 these projections are considered
realistic. Key indicators of production before and after rehabilitation are
shown below:

November 1981.
7.02      On the basis of the above,, sales forecasts have been made for
each mill.  These assume that alL production is sold and that there is no
build up of finished stocks. Prices as of April 30, 1981 have been used as
the basis for determining sales revenue. Sales prices have however been
adjusted proportionately in line with the projected movements in raw cotton
prices on the assumption that GOB would allow a related price increase.
Improved quality through the projecit should give BTMC management the oppor-
tunity to achieve higher selling prLces.
7.03      Operating Cost Estimates.  Assumptions used in the financial projec-
tion are detailed in Annex 7.1. Production costs are based on current costs
of raw material adjusted to reflect projected increases. 1/ Other conversion
costs have been projected to remain unchanged in constant taka terms.
1/   Bank Commodity Projections, November 12, 1980.



- 43 -
7.04      Under these assumptions, sales would be about 60% higher with the
project, in the aggregate. Profit before tax would also be about 60% higher
in absolute terms, since it would remain constant at about 4.1% of net sales
in aggregate terms. The cost structure would show improvement with conversion
cost and salaries expense, reducing by 3.0% in the aggregate from 22.4% to
18.4% of net sales. This would be due to spreading unchanged fixed cost ele-
ments over increased volume of production. This improvement in the cost struc-
ture would be offset in the aggregate by a 3.1% rise in increased interest
and depreciation expenses which would be associated with the project, thus
leaving profit before tax as a percentage of net sales unchanged at about
1.4%.
7.05      Financial Projections.  Detailed financial projections with, with-
out and incremental for the project together with detailed assumptions are
given in Annexes 7.1 to 7.4. Key financial indicators are summarized below
in constant taka terms.

7.06      The after tax profit projections shown above are a somewhat misleading
indicator of earnings as many of the mills have accumulated tax losses which
can be carried forward for five years. Similarly no rate of return on equity/
shareholders funds is given as many mills have accumulated losses since FY76
which have resulted in the erosion of their equity bases, leaving them with
negative shareholders funds. As shown below (Table 7.3) profit before interest,
other expenses 1/ and taxes (PBIT) as a percentage of total assets (or total
liabilities when shareholders funds are negative) is used as an earning
indicator.
1/   "Other expenses" consist entirely of short term interest charges on
current liability accounts.

7.07      On an asset base increasing from Tk 1.1 billion (US$57.9 million) in
FY81 to Tk 1.9 billion (US$100.0 million) in FY86 (Annex 7.2 ) or by 72%, the
aggregate PBIT is projected to increase from 10.8% without, to 12.6% with, the
project. In terms of the current long term interest rate of 14% the return is
low, and as a private sector project, would be only marginally acceptable.
There are two considerations, however, which indicate that 12.6% would be an
understated measure of earnings power with the project. First, conversion
costs have been estimated on the basis of FY80 actuals and not adjusted for
productivity gains that would flow from rehabilitation. Allowing for these,
conversion costs would be reduced by about 10%, 1/ yielding PBIT of 14.4%.
Second, the mills in question are overstaffed by about 30% (paragraph 3.23),
adding about 15% to conversion costs.
1/   Assuming (a) productivity increase as given in Table 7.1, (b) variable
elements of conversion costs of 70% in total, (c) of this variable element
(wages 60%, repair and maintenance 13%) would show a cost reduction due
directly to the productivity increase.



- 45 -
7.08      While the PBIT of 12.6% is acceptable in aggregate, three 1/ of
the fifteen mills covered by the proposed project have projected FY86 PBITs
of less than 11.0% (Annex 7.5).   Even with adjustments for productivity
increases and over employment their PBIT remains unacceptable. Subsequent to
the appraisal of the project, GOB indicated that it would divest the units
concerned and with IDA's agreement, would substitute three new mills with
(i) rehabiltiation costs equal to those of the three mills to be withdrawn
and (ii) incremental economic and financial rates of return not less than
the average rate of return for the current list of mills. A comparative
mill-by-mill statement of financial indicators for the mills appraised for
the project is shown in Annex 7.6.
7.09      Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Projections.  Aggregate balance sheet
and cash flow projections with the project are shown in Annex 7.2. The FY80
balance sheet shows a negative working capital situation (current ratio of
0.5:1) and a negative equity of about 40%, in absolute terms, of total
assets. The negative equity reflects accumulated losses of Tk 550 million
(US$29.0 million), which have been only partially offset by government con-
versions of ADP loans and cash contributions (paragraph 3.16). Thus, oper-
ating losses have been financed essentially by a negative working capital of
Tk 600 million (US$31.6 million). Of this, "Sundry Creditors" have provided
Tk 450 million (US$23.7 million), representing more than three year's of
non-wage conversion costs. The balance sheet projections assume operational
relations linking current asset and current liability accounts to levels of
sales, raw material costs, conversion costs etc, (Annex 7.1) and the estab-
lishment of a current ratio, and debt servicing capability of at least 1.5:1
and 1.2:1 respectively (paragraph 3.18). As a consequence, the negative
working capital situation is projected to be reversed with the required
working capital increase provided by government contributions.   These con-
tributions would transform the negative equity to positive equity, as well as
financing the required increase in working capital. In effect, it is assumed
that GOB will finance the mills' aggregate accumulated losses to FY81, as well
as projected increases in working capital necessary to undertake increased
volume of production.
7.10      The gross infusion of Tk 550 million (US$29.0 million) required
during FY82-FY86 would be used in part to reduce the mills- liabilities to
BTMC which in turn would reduce its obligations to GOB and the Banking System.
By this offsetting process actual GOB infusions required with the project
would be Tk 311.0 million (US$16.4 million). The required infusions would
peak in FY82 and FY85 with the initial correction for accumulated losses
(FY82), and the impact of increased production (FY85). Allowing for taxes and
dividends, wnich are inflows to GOB's budget, the net extra burden on the
budget would be Tk 188 million (US$9.9 million) to FY85; taxes and dividends
are projected to exceed required infusions from FY86 onwards, beginning with a
net budgetary inflow of Tk 46 million (US$2.4 million) in FY86. The infusions
would be essential to the continued functioning of the mills, and therefore to
the success of the project. To meet the Project's needs, GOB has agreed to a
program of estimated annual financial contributions. These would be reviewed
annually and adjusted to reflect the mills actual operating results.
7.11      The precise yearly contributions to be made would be based on the
principle that each mill should receive the amount required to cover losses,



- 46 -
meet interest and principal repayment obligations, and finance increased
working capital requirements computed on the basis of agreed coefficients.
Although the projections have assumed contributions to be entirely in the
form of equity, this is not essential to the success of the project as it
brings the debt equity ratio to 48:52 which is a higher than normal debt/
equity gearing. However, the contribution may be modified to a form that
is convenient to GOB, and makes sense in relation to the financial circum-
stances of the mill. As establishing a current ratio of 1.5:1 and a debt
servicing capability of 1.2:1 through equity contributions would give the
mills a satisfactory debt/equity ratio, no particular debt equity covenant
is proposed for the project. However, the project would be covered by the
60:40 debt-equity covenant of the Eighth Imports Program Credit. This would
give the GOB considerable leeway in determining the method of infusions it
proposes to use.
7.12      Within the limits of GOB's Budgetary constraints, the timing of
the contributions will be such as to ensure the liquidity of the mills, and
their ability to purchase needed suppLies in a timely manner consistent with
operational efficiency. The contributions would be at least semi-annually
based on the half yearly operating statements of BTMC and the Mills.
7.13      The duration of GOB's commitment to underwrite the operational
cash flow requirements of the mills until FY86 is considered sufficient to
ensure the success of mill rehabilitation in the narrow sense of attaining
the production targets set in the mills' respective spin and weave plans.
By FY86, the impact on incremental working capital needs of extra production
due to rehabilitation would already have been felt. Raw cotton price in-
creases subsequently to FY86, continued overemployment in the mills, inade-
quate price increases in the face of rising costs, etc., may all contribute
to a continued loss-making situation beyond FY86, even if mill rehabilita-
tion is successful. GOB may want to continue its budgetary support of the
industry, but it is not felt appropriate, as part of the project design, to
require it. Having carried out a rehabilitation project incorporating
operational standards, adopted a program of gradual elimination of excess
employment, and adopted a pricing policy, all geared to the creation even-
tually of an internationally competitive industry, GOB would be entitled,
in FY86, to re-examine its commitment to budgetary support of the industry.
7.14      Debt Service Coverage.  On an aggregate basis, the debt service
coverage ratio after implementation of the Project is acceptable at 2.0:1
in FY86. One mill, with a marginally acceptable earnings power of 15.1%, has
also a marginally acceptable debt service coverage ratio of 1.1 times; all
other mills had adequate debt service coverage ratio, ranging from 1.2 to
3.4, suggesting that repayment terms could be shortened as appropriate to fit
the circumstances of individual mills. This is reflected in the onlending
terms for the proposed credit (paragraph 6.06).
7.15      Incremental Rates of Return.   The incremental financial rate of
return (IFRR) and the impact of sensitivity analyses are summarized below,
and detailed in Annex 7.6.



- 47 -
Table 7.5: INCREMENTAL FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
(1)  Base case                                             15.7%
(2)  Incremental working capital up 10%                    15.5%
(3)  Conversion costs up 10%                               13.9%
(4)  Capital cost up 10%                                   14.0%
(5)  Incremental sales down 10%                            13.5%
(6)  Incremental sales down 10% without reductions
in conversion cost or working capital                 11.1%
(7)  Raw material costs and working capital up 10%          1.6%
The return is most sensitive to cost price relations: a 10% increase in raw
material costs unaccompanied by a price increase would reduce the return to
1.6%, emphasizing the importance of an ongoing review of prices coupled with
continued adjustment of prices to reflect cost changes. Production is also
important; a 10% drop in sales unaccompanied by similar drops in manufacturing
costs would reduce the return to 11.1%. The project is not overly sensitive
to capital cost, incremental working capital and conversions cost increases.
Annex 7.7 details individual mill IFRR. One mill has a return which falls
below the implicit acceptance hurdle of 14.0% but has an acceptable IERR.
Economic Analysis
7.16      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) exceeds the IFRR, and
exceeds an estimated economic opportunity cost of capital of 15%, suggesting
that on an incremental basis, in the aggregate, the project is economically
as well as financially attractive. The economic adjustments made to the finan-
cial benefit stream are favorable on balance, with adjustment for corporate
taxes, and import duties on raw materials offset by adjustments (downward) of
yarn prices by a factor of 0.95 to reflect the ex-mill price differential over
c.i.f. prices (Annex 7.1). Although not quantified, the omissions would mostly
have been favorable: grey cloth and finished cloth prices were left unadjusted,
but since ex-mill prices of these items are below production cost, and analysis
carried out prior to this appraisal (see the Boston University Study) suggest
that the domestic resource cost of cloth production in Bangladesh is below the
official exchange rate, these should be conservative omissions. The other
omission was in not adjusting conversion costs, but based on likely conversion
factors for wages, repair and maintenance, power and fuel, and factory overheads
which together constitute conversion cost, this omission is also considered
conservative.
7.17      The adjustments made to the cost stream are also favorable.  Duties
and taxes on imported machinery are removed. A conversion factor of 0.6 is
applied against the cost of civil works and installation and erection of equip-
ment. 1/ Incremental working capital is left unadjusted, on the worst case
1/   This represents an approximate overall weighted average of the standard
conversion factors, prepared by the Planning Commission of GOB for the
respective inputs to this activity.

assumption that all incremental working capital is required for imports of
raw material and spares. Finally, since no benefits are quantified for the
various technical assistance components of the project, the costs of these are
omitted, as in the financial rate of return analysis. On these assumptions,
the IERR is estimated at 27.5%. The results of sensitivity analyses are shown
below:
Table 7.6: ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
(1)  Base case                                             27.5%
(2)  Incremental working capital up 20%                    26.9%
(3)  Economic capital costs up 10%                         25.3%
(4)  Conversion costs up 10%                                25.4%
(5)  Yarn and cloth conversion factors down 10%            17.0%
(6)  Incremental sales down 10%,                           25.2%
(7)  Incremental sales down 10% without reduction
in conversion cost                                  22.5%
(8)  One-year lag in benefits                              21.7%
(9)  Raw material costs and working capital up 10%          13.1%
(10)  Combination of (3) and (8)                             12.6%
7.18      The IERR is most sensitive to cost increases unaccompanied by price
increases. It drops to 13.1% with a 10% increase in raw material costs and
working capital, with border prices of outputs assumed unchanged. The return
is also quite sensitive to the economic prices assumed for finished goods,
and would drop to 17.0% with a simultaneous 10% drop in economic prices for
yarn, grey cloth and finished cloth. This is still an acceptable return, in-
dicating that there is some margin to allow for quality differentials against
internationally available comparable products. 1/ Individual mill analyses
(Annex 7.7) shows the lowest mill IERR to be 17.1%, which is acceptable, as
it exceeds the opportunity cost of capital, which GOB estimates at 15%.
Summary of Benefits and Risks
7.19      Rehabilitation is intended to increase production and productivity,
and hence profitability, both financial and economic. The base cost esti-
mates are considered firm, and proviLsion for physical and price escalation
should be adequate. PIC, with back--up assistance from the Productivity Team,
should face little technical risk in carrying out the rehabilitation within
the estimated time frame. Once the capabilities of the mills have been en-
hanced, however, it remains the task of management to make the most of that

of production and sales revenue targets. This is threatened by relative
uncontrollables such as political disturbances, labor disruptions, power
shortages although these factors are common to all industrial units. The
achievement of production and sales targets is also threatened by more con-
trollable factors such as the ambitious expansion program proposed for the
textile industry under the SFYP, both in the public and private sectors.
Care must be taken to expand and improve the pool of trained textile manag-
ers along with the expansion of the industry, otherwise competent management
may not remain in the rehabilitated mills to exploit fully the rehabilitation.
This risk has been recognized and is being addressed by technical assistance
measures to improve BTMC-s management capability (paragraphs 3.11, 3.28 and
3.30), and organizational structure (paragraphs 3.25 and 3.27). Equally
important, it would be essential to monitor changes in the cost structure,
and adjust prices continually to reflect cost changes. However, it would be
important also to ensure that prices are not increased to a level relative to
import prices that production goes into inventories rather than sales, thus
forcing increased protection measures. The present negative working capital
and negative equity situation point to liquidity problems for the mills,
which, if unresolved, could lead to shortages of raw material and operational
spares, and an inability to meet production targets. To address this problem,
GOB has agreed to make the contributions (paragraphs 7.10-7.13) necessary
to ensure liquidity. With this and other measures taken to offset the risks
inherent in the project, it is felt that these may be contained. The benefits
are clear, and should result in a project that is incrementally attractive
both economically and financially. On a full as distinct from incremental
analysis, four of the mills proposed for rehabilitation would be ineligible
for financing until adequate measures are taken to ensure satisfactory levels
of earnings.
VIII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS

Textile Industry Rehabilitation Project
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.      Projections have been made with, without, and incremental for the Project.
Aggregate projections are shown in Annexes 7.2 to 7.4. Mill-by-mill projections
may be found in the project files. Each set of projections comprises
a statement of projected sales, debt statement, income statements, balance sheets,
funds flow and financial ratios. This Annex gives the assumptions underlying the
projections for individual items.
Income Statement
2.      Production.  Production projections both with and without the Project are
based on (i) estimates of achievable capacity, defined as installed capacity less
idle capacity, allowances for power failures, absenteeism, repair and maintenance
downtime, machinery breakdown, etc., and (ii) on estimates of productivity, i.e.
production per spindle shift in the case of spinning, and production per loom
shift in the case of weaving. Increased production from the proposed rehabilitation
project would be achieved in FY85 and onwards. However, FY81 production to the
half-year ending December 31, 1980 already shows a marked improvement over FY80
actual production, attributable to rehabilitation efforts already undertaken to
that time.l/ Thus, increased production attributable to the proposed project is
the difference between FY81 production (assumed to continue into FY84) and FY85
production. The post-BMR estimates are based on spin and weave plans drawn up by
BTMC engineers, and have been reviewedl by the consultants (Gherzi Eastern Ltd.)
retained by the Bank and by the UNDP P'roductivity Team. They are considered
achievable.  The detailed spin and weave plans, mill by mill, are available in
the project files. A tabulation showing key indicators of production
pre- and post-BMR is given below.
1/ These efforts have been aided by various bilateral aid sources (U.K., Poland,
GDR, India) and imLproved availability of spares due to ongoing Imports Program
Credits, and the presence of a IJNDP Productivity team assigned to the BTMC
under the Sixth Imports Program Credit.

a! Simple as opposed to production-weighted averages over the fifteen
mills constituting Phase 1 of rehabilitation.
3.      Sales.  All production is assumed sold in the year in which produced.
This is a reasonable assumption if it is assumed that BTMC's prices remain stable
relative to international price movements, or that relative BTMC price increases
are first preceded and justified by both real and perceived improvements in quality.
If BTMC prices were increased without a corresponding improvement in quality,
output would be sold only if increased tariff protection restrictions were
introduced. The ultimate goal of GOB's continued involvement in the textile
sector is the creation of an internationally competitive industry, which would be
inconsistent with continually increasing levels of protection. As a rider to the
assumption that sales are equal in volume to physical production, it is further
assumed in the projections that there will be no finished goods price increases,
unless brought about by international price movements in inputs.
4.      Sales volume is taken as given from the mill-by-mill rehabilitation
proposals, and are expressed in 32 counts equivalent for yarn, 54 picks equivalent
for cloth. Prices are the prices prevailing at August 30, 1981 for varn of 32
counts and cloth of 54 picks, adjusted for raw material price increases (paragraph 5).
Excise duties per pound of 32 counts equivalent yarn are a production-weighted
average computed separately for each mill, based on the following duty schedule
for individual counts:
Counts                  10      20     32      40     60     80

Page 3 of 5 pages
5.      Finished Goods Prices.  Yarn andl cloth prices are taken to be prices
prevailing as of August 30, 1981. However, yarn and cloth prices are projected
to rise or fall by the amount required to cover the change of raw material cost
per unit of production after allowance for wastage, and interest charges on the
change in working capital that could be attributed to the change in raw cotton
prices. It is assumed that price increases due to international price movements
in cotton would be passed on to the consumer without affecting sales.
6.      Raw Cotton Prices.  Cotton price projections are taken as those given by
the Bank's commodity price forecasts dated November 12, 1980 (for Mexican SM 1 -
1-1/6" c.i.f. N. Europe). Projections are in constant 1980 dollars, with a
constant exchange rate of Tk 18.0 = US$1 assumed over the life of the Project.
Given the wide geographical spread of Bangladeshi cotton imports (Colombia, USSR,
USA, Pakistan, etc.) no adjustments were made to obtain a c.i.f. Chittagong price.
Cotton yarn and cloth price projections are tabulated in the table below. Viscose
prices are projected to remain at the historical figure of about 80% of cotton prices.

_onversio.  osts.  Croves 'on costs comprise direct wages and salaries,
power and fuel, repair and maintenance., and factory overhead. These are broken
into fixed and variable elements, which have been estimated based on actual FY80 and year-
to-date FY81 results and have been projected to remain unchanged in constant takas. This
is a conservative projection since unitL variable conversion costs are expected
to decrease as a result of rehabilitation, due to increased labour productivity
and reduced power consumption per unit of output resulting from increased spindle
and loom productivity (Table 1). Thus, the reduction in unit conversion costs
implicit in the projections is due entirely to the fact that the fixed component
of conversion costs is spread over a greater volume of production; no account has
been taken of pure productivity gains.
8.      Summary.  Sales are assum.ed to remain unchanged in physical terms over the
years FY82 to FY85, with the full benefits of rehabilitation assumed to flow
beginning in FY86, in the form of increased production. Lost production during the
implementation period is considered negligible. Raw material costs vary propor-
tionately with sales, with a wastage factor built-in, generally 9.5% for yarn
manufacture, 3.0% for grey cloth manufacture and zero or negligible for finished
cloth manufacture. A 80/20 blend of cotton and viscose is assumed in yarn manu-
facture. Projected price changes (paragraph 6) in raw cotton are reflected in
yarn price changes, which in turn are reflected in raw material price changes

costs are split into fixed and variable elements according to the table below:
