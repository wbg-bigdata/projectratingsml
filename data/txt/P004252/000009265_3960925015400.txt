PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
NORTHWEST SELANGOR INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1522-MA)
PREFACE
This is a completion report (PCR) of the Northwest Selangor Inte-
grated Agricultural Development Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 1522-MA
was approved on February 21, 1978, in the amount of US$26.0 million, and
closed fully disbursed on December 31, 1984.
The Borrower's PCR (Annex I) was prepared by the Project Management
Unit, Northwest Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project, Min-
istry of Agriculture, Malaysia, and submitted to the Bank in November 1985.
The Evaluation Summary and Overview of the report, prepared by staff in the
Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region, are based on the PCR and a review of the
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 1757b-MA, dated January 30, 1978), the Loan
Agreement (dated March 8, 1978), Bank supervision reports, project progress
reports and project-related Bank files.
The project was not selected for audit by OED as its most important
findings and lessons are similar to those noted in the Project Performance
Audit Report (OED Report No. 6023, dated December 31, 1985) of three other
agricultural and rural development projects in Malaysia, which were evaluated
in depth during the November 1984 to June 1985 period.
The Overview to the report was sent to the Borrower on March 11 for
comments. A telex received from the Borrower stating their satisfaction with
the report is attached as an appendix of the Overview.
The assistance provided during the preparation of this report by
the Government of Malaysia and the staff of the Project Management Unit is
gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
NORTHWEST SELANGOR INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1522-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The project was in line with the Government objectives to increase
farm incomes of the poorer groups, achieve national food security and divers-
ify agriculture into new crops. The project also fitted with the Bank policy
to redirect its lending program to Malaysia from new land settlement to rural
development projects.
Objectives
The major objective of the project was to raise the incomes and
productivity of about 32,000 smallholders dependent on the production of padi
and treecrops in the coastal areas of the state of Selangor. This was to be
accomplished by the provision of infrastructure for:
-    upgrading/intensification of an irrigation system dating back to
1932 and serving 12,000 farmers cultivating 20,000 ha of padi;
-    improved drainage and flood protection for about 10,000 farmers
engaged in coconut/intercrops;
-    provision of major drainage works to benefit about 10,000 small
farmers cultivating mainly oil palm and the linking of this system
to those of the private estates bordering the project area, in
which about 26,000 ha was planted almost entirely to oil palm.
The project had certain institution building objectives:   notably
to encourage the formulation of long-term planning of irrigation works/
drainage systems rather than the piecemeal engineering solutions of the past
and at the same time to develop a plan of agricultural operations to coordi-
nate the activities of all supporting line agencies in an integrated effort
to upgrade small farmer output and productivity.  Total project costs were
estimated at US$60 million with a Bank loan of US$26 million to be disbursed
over five years.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation was delayed by slow land acquisition, short-
age and inexperience of staff during the early stage of implementation, late
completion of final design, late tendering, and shortage of bullding mater-
ials.  Changes in project scope and design were madi:  the project area was
increased by about 2,700 ha, more buildings than planned were constructed and
the width of access roads was increased, while the quantity of civil works,



- iv -
mostly for irrigation, was reduced.   The glass reinforced polyester flumes
used for irrigation tertiary canals proved costly and fragile and are being
replaced by concrete canals; the cost being borne by GOM. With the exception
of land levelling, project works were completed by the end of 1985, three
years behind schedule.   The project was implemented by six different agen-
cies, coordinated by a Project Management Unit (Pil).  Although the Director
of the PMU performed well due to his strong personality, hs lacked the auth-
ority and power needed to coordinate all project activities. Due to delays,
inflation, increased cost of materials and land acquisition and changes in
project design and scope, the total project cost is now estimated at US$87.0
million, a 45% overrun.
Results
Agricultural production has not yet reached its full production
stage.   Although padi and  treecrop yields have been lower so far than
expected at appraisal, there is some evidence of improved farm management
practices and crop diversification, with oil palm partly replacing rubber and
coffee, due to favorable prices, and a substantial increase in cocoa inter-
cropping with coconut. ERRs, compared with appraisal projections of 19% for
padi irrigation, 22% for treecrop drainage and 21% for the overall project
are now estimated respectively at 1%, 27%, and 8% by the Bank Overview, and
2%, 64% and 20% by the Borrower's PCR.  It is OED's opinion that the Bank
estimates are more realistic. The low overall rate of return is mostly due
to project time and cost overruns, lower crop prices and lower yields than
estimated at appraisal.   Nevertheless, farm incomes have increased and the
poverty level has decreased in the project area because of (i) the Government
subsidy and support price policy for the agricultural sector and (ii) off-
farm employment due to the booming economy of the country. The project took
innovative  measures  to  monitor  the  incide-ce  of  poverty  and undertake
follow-up evaluation studies.
Sustainability
The sustainability, or improvement, of the project benefits largely
depends on the success of the measures currently tested in Malaysia (land
consolidation, establishment of farming groups aDi mini-estates) to remedy
the small and uneconomic size of the farms.  Another condition required for
project sustainability is an adequate operation and maintenance of the irri-
gation and drainage works.
Findings and Lessons
The project did not fully achieve its objectives. While an impor-
tant reason for the project's mediocre performance is the depressed price of
most of the project's products, some factors, already noted in similar proj-
ects in Malaysia, have adversely affected the project's outcome:



(a) the project delays and cost overrun have been mostly due to
insufficient preparation, premature appraisal and insufficient
attention paid to the country's shortage of qualified staff at all
levels;
(b) the project was mainly an infrastructure (irrigation and drainage)
project with little consideration given to the agricultural
components;
(c) the principle of a PMU responsible for coordinating other agencies
hae no chance to be successful unless the project manager is given
rank and power superior to those of the agency directors;
(d) land acquisition, mainly in irrigation and drainage projects, needs
to be closely scrutinized at appraisal as it is a constant source
of implementation delay unless land offices are adequately
reinforced in staff and financial resources.

MALAYSIA
NORTHWEST SELANGOR INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LN 1522-MA)
Project Completion Report
East Asia Pacific Regional Overview
Introduction
1.        This overview is based on the PCR for the Northwest Selangor
Integrated Agricultural Development Project (Ln. 1522-MA) (Annex 1) prepared
by the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and
submitted to the Bank in November 1985. The PCR reflects the views and
opinions of Government officials closely associated with the project and in
general, presents an objective view of project implementation, performance and
impact.
Project Objectives
2.          To improve the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers and
to improve regional drainage systems with subsequent subsidiary benefits for
the Northwest Selangor Region's towns and estates, the project included
rehabilitation of 20,000 ha of padi land in the Tanjong Karang area; rehabili-
tation and improvement of drainage and flood control systems serving some
77,000 ha of tree crops; construction of offices, staff quarters, storehouses,
and drying floors; and the provision of vehicles, equipment, and training tc
support extension, agricultural credit, input supply, and marketing in the
Region. The project wa3 appraised in April 1977 and approved in February
1978; the Bank loan for US$26 million was signed in March 1978 and became
effective in June 1978. Project construction was completed in December 1985,
three years later than scheduled.
Project Formulation
3.        The project was proposed by the Selangor Drainage and Irrigation
Department to increase padi and tree crop production by upgrading drainage,
irrigation and agricultural support services. Following a May 1976
identification mission the project was prepared by FAO/CP with Government of
Malaysia (GOM) assistance.  Based upon detailed layout and design of 27% of
the irrigation area and 10X of the drainage area, major investments were
identified. During project implementation targets were revised as more
experience and information became available. Improvements to be made in
agricultural support services were outlined in the preparation and Staff
Appraisal Reports but the most detailed guidelines were published in the
Borrower's Operation Manual (October 8, 1978). However, incomplete data
during preparation (number of beneficiaries, crop yields, farm income and
project costs) gave rise to overly optimistic expectations (Borrower's PCR
paras. 2.04-2.06).

Project Implementation
4.        Project Mangement.  The PMU, established in 1978 and responsible for
project implementation, was effective and its' reporting was extensive and
timely. The various agencies involved in project implementation were: the
Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID) for design and construction of civil
works, and operation and maintenance of new systems; the Department of
Agriculture (DOA) for organization of farmers and exten3ion services, fa-mer
training and supply of improved seeds and planting materials; the Farmers'
Organization Authority (FOA) for input supplies, mechanization services, local
marketing and farmers' participation in agri-business activities; the Bank
Pertanian Malaysia (BPM) for credit facilities; the Malaysian Agriculture
Research and Development Institute (MARDI) fir basic and applied research and
development of appropriate technology; and the Land Office for matters related
to land acquisition. The project was guided, particular'.y on policy matters,
by a Federal Steering Committee headed by the Secretary General MOA. While
each agency was responsible for implementing specific activities within its
jurisdiction, responsibility for coordinating all project activities rested
with the Project Director. The borrower suggested that future projects should
provide detailed job descriptions and agree the authority and responsibilities
of the Project Director and role of each of the line agencies (Borrower's PCR
para. 5.18).
5.        The appointment of a Project Manager (director), who was to have a
small staff to assist in budgeting, procurement and disbursement matters, was a
condition of loan effectiveness. In retrospect, lack of experienced staff iA
the implementing agencies, particularly in the early stages of the project, was
a major constraint. At appraisal additional staff requirements were estimated
as 396. By the end of 1979, 213 posts were established and 179 (84Z) filled.
The maximum staff (259) of an authorized 314 was in place in 1983. DOA filled
79% of the incremental posts, DID 65% and FOA 48%. The borrower felt that the
number of authorized posts was adequate but that implementation would have been
better if all posts had been promptly filled and the frequent turnover of
leaders restrained (Borrower's PCR paras. 5.09-5.14).
6.        Project Revisions.  During project implementation, changes in project
scope and design were made. An additional 2,673 ha, including some 350 ha of
land in Ganda Sali in the State of Perak (adjacent to the project area), were
included in the project; the width of access roads was increased from 4 m to
6 m; additional quarters were constructed for PMU staff; the number of Farmers'
Development Centers (FDCs) was increased from 10 to 12; and road maintenance
equipment was reduced to about 40% of the appraisal estimate since maintenance
work was to be carried out by contract in accordance with the Government's
policy of privatization. Most important, the quantity of civil works was
reduced as better information became available (see para. 3). Compared to
appraisal, actual construction ur.der the padi irrigation component was 56% of
main canal and feeder canal improvements; 88% of distributary and tertiary
canal construction; 167% of drain construction (an exception); and 76% of roads
and bridges. For the tree crop area drainage component, 93% of tidal control
gates were provided; 35% of drain construction; and 44% of roads and bridges.

In retrospect, increases in project area and changes in works contributed to
project delays and, due to inflation, also contributed to increased project
cost.
7.        Physical Progress of Project Implementation.  A comparative summary
of actual project costs and the appraisal estimate is in Table 2. At
appraisal, planning and design of civil works were to start in January 1977.
However, the Loan Agreement was not signed until March 1978 and implementation
started in June 1978. Accordingly, completion of works was extended from
January 1983 to December 1983 and later to December 1985. The main cause of
delay was shortage of experienced staff during the early stage of project
implementation. According to the Borrower's PCR (para. 3.11) it took from June
1978 to December 1979 to staff 80% of the required posts and, as a result, most
civil works tenders were called after 1981. Despite delays, project objectives
will be largely fulfilled. At appraisal it was envisioned that irrigation
water was to be supplied to padi areas by glass reinforced polyester (GRP)
conduits, but performance was not satisfactory due to inadequate structural
strength, deterioration, and susceptibility to damage and GOM substituted
concrete conduits for tertiary canals. Land shaping which is required for
improved water management, is estimated to cover only 47% of the padi area in
part due to cost, lack of proper equipment and the need to reshape the land
several times.
8.        Contracts.  Most civil works were carried out under contract with no
major problems. As envisaged at appraisal, international competitive bidding
(ICB) was used for construction of irrigation works and local competitive
bidding (LCB) for drainage and building contracts. With the exception of one
Japanese firm, all bidders under ICB were local firms. Of the six contracts
executed for padi irrigation works, three were accepted on time; the other
three were delayed by 3 to 6 months due to site problems. Of the seven
contracts for drainage works, five were completed on time, and two contracts
were delayed by 6 months mainly due to land acquisition problems.
9.        Project Costs and Financing.  At appraisal, estimated project costs
were US$60 million, of which US$26 million, or 43%, was financed by the Bank.
However, due to delays, inflation, increased cost of land acquisition and
materials, and changes in project scope and design, the costs were re-estimated
in Uecember 1979 at US$87 million. Final costs were US$87 million. The
increased cost of US$27 million was borne by the Government. The major
increase was for the padi irrigation component which increased by 155%. Tables
2 and 3 show project costs by category and annual expenditure respectively.
Project Impact
10.       Under the project, irrigation water was provided for 19,641 ha of
padi, and drainage and flood control works serving 80,255 ha of tree crops were
completed. Yields have been in general lower than expected at appraisal but
are expected to increase over the next few years. The padi yield in 1984 was
about 75% of the appraisal projection; cocoa, about 62%; oil palm (FFB), about
72%; and rubber (latex), abour 71%. Seven-year average yields for second
season padi were as projected but first season yields were 80% of appraisal
estimates. Oil palm yields have increased but other tree crops are highly

variable, except coffee which seems to have declined, probably because of
unattractive prices and intensive labor requirements. The integrated agricul-
tural services supported under the project started slowly due to staff shor-
tages but strengthened later. Farm incomes in the project area have increased
substantially, due to fertilizer subsidies, padi support prices, favorable tree
crop product prices and off-farm employment. The Borrower's PCR
(para. 5.15(c)) estimates that absolute poverty declined from 65% in 1977 to
50% in 1984. There is some evidence of changing cropping patterns: oil palm
increastagly replaced rubber and coffee due to favorable prices, and cocoa
intercropping with coconut increased from 9,300 ha in 1977 to 14,300 ha in
1984. No significant cropping pattern changes are expected in padi and coconut
areas. The Borrower's PCR, Appendix V compares cropping patterns at project
appraisal and completion.
11.       Other effects of the project include increased farm mechanization
induced by project-financed farm road improvements - about 80% of farm
operations in the padi area, and land preparation and new planting work in tree
crop areas. Water management committees have been set up; cropping and farm
management practices have been improved; and farmers now use recommended padi
varieties, more fertilizer, direct seeding, etc. The agricultural extension
training and visit system is used throughout the project area and 605 farmer
groups are organized.
Economic Rate of Return
12.       At appraisal the estimated economic rates of return were 19% for padi
irrigation, 22% for tree crop drainage, and 21% for the overall project. At
completion, the revised estimated ERR are 1% for padi, 27% for tree crop
drainage and 8% overall. Because many schemes were only recently completed,
projections are based on the actual performance since 1982 and expected yields
and cropping intensities. In estimating rates of return, investment, O&M and
crop production costs have been adjusted by GDP deflators and appropriate
conversion factors. The project life is assumed to be 25 years and crop prick
are based on the Bank's 1985 world market price projections. The low rate of
return for padi is due mainly to increased project cost, lower projected 14'm
prices, and project delays. Recent Bank projected padi prices are
substantially lower than projected at appraisal, and the investment in padi
irrigation was more than 50% above appraisal estimates (see para. 9). If
current projected prices increase by 25%, ERR for the padi component would
increase to 5%; and for the total project to 11%.
Institutional Performance and Development
13.       Although project implementation suffered initially because of
insufficient experienced staff in the early years, institutional performance
and development generally conformed to appraisal expectations.  The PMU
performed well and effectively as project coordinator. However the Project
Director's lack of clear authority and the involvement of the policy Steering
Committee in project management were reported as constraints. The Steering
Cowmittee, chaired by the Secretary General of MOA, initially met every two to
three months but later only every six months, and the PMU had an advisory role
rather than direct control. The implementing agencies, DID, DOA, FOA, BPM,
MARDI, and the Land Office, all performed well.



-5-
Bank Performance
14.       Eleven Bank missions, totalling some 84 man-days, semi-annually in
the beginning and annually in later years, visited the project during the seven
yearb of its implementation. Bank supervision missions acted as a catalyst by
making recommendations on technical matters and agricultural development. In
retrospect, more frequent missions, particularly in the early years, would have
helped implementation. The PMU assessment of the Bank's supervision perfor-
mance (PCR para. 5.24) is: The Bank's Supervision Mission did a good job but
could have done better if all mission members consisted of qualified and
experienced personnel with pleasant personalities. Equally important is the
continuity of mission members; there is a tendency for the Bank to change the
composition of the mission team too frequently.
Lesson Learned
15.       The Borrower's PCR summaries lessons learned under the project
(paras. 6.01 to 6.06) as follows: (a) over 95% of project funds were allocated
to infrastructure development while agricultural support services received less
than 5X -- a more balanced program including more agricultural/human develop-
ment elements would have been desirable; (b) the country's shortage of qualified
staff and difficulties of recruiting experienced staff at all levels should
have been given due consideration at the time of project formulation; (c) the
PMU had only a coordinating role in project implementation but it should have
been given more authority so that it could control and manage funds and
resources more effectively; and (d) the planned 5-year time period for infra-
structure construction was too optimistic - the project schedule and start-up
targets should have been more realistic and achievable.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                        SUMMARY
Northwest Selangor Project - 1522 MA
- 13 -
SUMMARY
1. The Northwest Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project
was launched in June 1978. It covers some 19,500 farm families on
100,199 hectares of agricultural land straddling the 2 northwesteri
districts of Sabak Bernam and Kuala Selangor in th& State of Selangor.
2. The major objectives of the Projnct were to increase the yield of
various crops in the Project area, maximise farm incomes and alleviate
rural poverty and improve quality of life of 19,500 smallholder farm
families. It was also the intention of the Project to develop the
farming society to be self-reliance, progressive and commercially
orientated.
3. The major components of the Project were the upgrading and rehabi-
litating the irrigation and drainage facilities in the area and the
setting up and implementation of an integrated agricultural supporting
services with a common delivery system. These 2 components are supple-
mentary and complementary to one another in meeting the Project targets.
4. Project formulation originated in the efforts of the various agen-
cies to upgrade existing irrigation and drainage infrastructure and to
promote agricultural improvement in this major agricultural subregion
of the Selangor State. The agencies that are involved directly in the
implementation of the Project were the DID, DOA, FOA, BPM, MARDI and
Land Office.
5. Work on the Project started in June 1978 and was scheduled to be
completed by end of 1983. It is now anticipated that all major cons-
truction works would be completed by October 1985. Thus, there is a
time overrun of approximately 1 years.
6. The major problems faced by the Project were staff shortages and
inexperienced staff, delay in land acquisition and shortage of 'bakau'
piles. Although these problems were overcome later, the implementation
schedule was inevitably affected.

7. The important changes made to the Project scope and design were
the inclusion of Ganda Suli in the State of Perak, increase in width
of access path, construction of additional quarters for PMU's staff,
increase in number of Farmers' Development Centres/Sub-centres and the
reduction of procure'ent of equipment. The number of Area Farmers'
Organisations was increased from 3 to 5.
8. The original Project cost was US$60 million. However, due to time
overrun, inflation, increases in cost of materials and also changes in
Project scope and design, the actual Project cost escalated to US$87.0
million. The World Bank financed US$26.0 million or 29.9% of the
Project cost, while the balance of US$61.0 million or 70.1% was borne
by the GOM.
9. The disbursements made from the World Bank were completed on sche-
dule but did not follow the Appraisal expectations. The disbursements
were low in the first 3 years and only caught up with the Appraisal
expectations in 1982 and 1983. The slow disbursement in the early
years was due to the slow Project start-up.
10. The overall performance of the contractors and suppliers could
be considered as good. There was very little problem with the con-
tractors. There was also no problem in the procurement of equipment
as this formed a small part of the Project component.
11. The GOM always allocated sufficient funds for the. Project. Although
in the initial years,the annual allocations were less than the Apprai-
sal annual projections, it did not affect the Project implementation.
This was due to the implementation being slower in initial years because
of the slow Project start-up.
12. The type of organisation and management system practised in the
Project was of the coordinative type as opposed to the authoritative
type. Such set-up relied heavily on committees and meetings as there
was little integration of management in the Project. Although there
were weaknesses in such organisation and management set-up, yet the
set-up helped a long way in ensuring smooth implementation of the

Project. The system, however, should be reviewed if the Project records
are to be improved.
13. There was growth in the number of staff and office space of the
implementing agencies. The staff growth in all categories for DID was
204 (at its peak), DOA was 49, PMU was 38 and FOA was 29. The office
space for all implementing agencies were housed under one roof. The
headquarters of the Project is situated in Kuala Selangor and one
branch office in Sungai Besar. There were 1 FDC and 11 FDSc and all
are strategically located in the Project area to serve the farmers.
14. The staff requirement of the Project was essentially to top up
the existing staff, of the implementing agencies in the Project area
in order to enable them to strengthen and consolidate for Project
implementation. The number of posts established under the Project
was 314 (at its peak) or 79% of the Appraisal Report's requirement
of 396. This number was adequate for smooth implementation of Project.
However, some of the posts established were not filled and if all
were to be filled the performance of the Project would have been
better.
15. The Project was affected by staff shortages and inexperienced
staff especially in the early stages of Project implementation. This
was compounded by a frequent turnover of key personnel. The perfor-
mance of the Project would have been better if the staff were adequate,
qualified and experienced.
16. There had been increases in the yield of various crops in the
Project area. However, the yield fluctuated in consonance with the
vagaries of the weather, pests, etc. Padi, cocoa, coconut, rubber and
oil palm yields all showed an upward trend. However, there had been
a decreasing trend in the yield of coffee as the farmers showed decli-
ning interest in this crop.
17. There had been increases in incomes of Project farmers. These
increases in incomes could be attributed to a number of factors, among
which are increases in the yield of crops, subsidies by GOM, changes

in prices of commodities, availabilities of off-farm jobs, etc. With
this increase in income, the absolute poverty rate among the Project
farmers also dropped from 65% in 1977 to 50% in 1983 and 56% in 1984.
The revised economic rate of return for the Project is 20%.
18. There was no plan to change the cropping pattern in Project area.
The padi and coconut areas remains unchanged. However, there was ten-
dency among Project farmers especially in the Kuala Selangor district
to change their rubber and coffee to oil-palm due to better prospects
of the crop. Cocoa intercropping with coconut is very popular among
smallholders and increased tremendously.
19. Therei is tendency among farmers to mechanise their farming opera-
tions in order to save time and costs. There- had also been other
changes in farmers' attitudes including the using of improved and re-
commended padi varieties, changing to direct seeding method of padi
cultivation, adopting mature-budding techniques to improve cocoa stand,
greater use of agricultural chemicals and participation in pest manage-
ment programs and greater utilisation of agricultural credits. The
farmers also realised the importance of water management in their
padi farming operation which is an on-going program in the project and
would further be strengthened.
20. There had been a close relationship between research and extension
in the Project which came about through the management organisation
system set-up for the Project. In fact, in order to reap the full
benefits from the implementation of this Project, the existing organi-
sation should be maintained and strengthened to run the Project.
21. The Bank's Supervision Mission had done a good job, but could
have been better if all of the Mission's members were to consist of
highly qualified and experienced personnel with pleasant personalities.
Equally important here is the continuity of the members of the Mission,
as there is tendency for the Bank to change the members of the Mission
team frequently.

1. OVERVIEWu
PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.01. The Northwest Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Pro-
jects (subsequently refered to as the Project in this report) launched
in June 1978, is the sixth integrated agricultural development project
(IADP) to be lmdertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture. It is, however,
the first such project for the State of Selangor.
1.02. Th4 Project straddles the 2 northwestern districts of Sabak Ber-
nam and Klala Selangor in the State of Selangor and covers some 100,199
hectares of agricultural land as indicated on the map in Appendix I.
The distribution of crop acreages and farm households within the Project
area is as shown in Table 1.

1.03.  The average padi farm size in the Project area is 1.78 hectares.
84% of the padi farmers are owner-operators. In the coconut areas,
the average farm size is about 1.0 hectare in Sabak Bernam and 1.3 hec-
tares in Kuala Selangor. 94% of coconut smallholders are owner-opera-
tors. For other crops like oil-palm, rubber and colfee, the average
farm size is 1.2 hectares, 1.0 hectare and 0.4 hectare respectively.
1.04. The total population in the Project area is 216,350 comprising
of 64% Malays, 21% Chinese and 15% Indians. Approximately 72% of the
population are involved in agricultural activities. There are 19,500
farm households and on the average there are 6.0 persons per farm
household.
MAJOR OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
1.05.  The Project was conceived towards fulfilling the following major
objectives:-
(a) To increase the yield of various crops within the Project
through the provision of improved irrigation, drainage,
farm roads and intensified agricultural supporting services;
(b) To maximise farm income through raising productivity as
envisaged in (a) and efficient utilization of resources;
(c) To alleviate rural poverty and improve quality of life of
33,000 smallholder farm families, 65% of whom were consi-
dered to be living in absolute poverty at the time of
Project .cptaisall/ ; and
(d) To develop a farming society that is self-reliance, prog-
ressive and commercially orientated.
STRATEGIES EMPLOYED
1.06. Towards fulfilling the set objectives, the Project chartered
the following strategies:-
(a) Upgrading and intensifying the irrigation and farm road
1/ - Absolute poverty refers to situation where annual per capita
income is below the estimated poverty line income of
US$215 at the time of Project Appraisal.

systems in the padi areas to ensure sufficient and efficient
water supply to padi fields and for convenient transporta-
tion of padi to market and supply of agricultural inputs
to farms;
(b) Upgrading and intensifying the drainage and farm road
systems in the tree crop areas to alleviate flooding and
for convenient transportation of agricultural produce to
market and supply of agricultural inputs to farms;
(c) Consolidating and strengthening the agricultural supporting
services and its delivery system to the farmers through
training and visit (T&V) system of extension;
(d) Utilising efficiently all factors of production i.e. land.
labour, capitaL,. technology and management to increase
productivity; and
(e) Providing training to farmers on modern farming techniques,
concept of cost, expenditure and profit and instilling a
sense of pride and spirit of self-reliance and cooperation
among farmers.
MAJOR PROJECT COMPOIJENTS
1.07, Under the Project, the basic infrastructure for on-farm develop-
ment of the irrigation and drainage systems are provided under the
irrigation, drainage and civil works component while the back-up faci-
lities and services to ensure that such improved infrastructure can be
properly utilised to attain the major objectives of the Project is
provided under the integrated agricultural services component.
(a) rrigation, drainage and civil works - Under this component
the Project would:-
(i) Rehabilitate the existing headworks, diversions, main
canal and structures serving the 19,641 hectares of padi-
land in the Project area, construction of tertiary irri-
gation and drainage networks which would service each
ihdividual 1.2 hectare padi lot, construction of required
access roads (i.e. to improve in-field transportation)
and provision of requisite maintenance equipment;

Northwest Selangor Project - 1522 MA                        -
- 20 -
(ii) Rehabilitate and improve the existing drainage and
flood mitigation system serving 80,255 hectares of
tree crops, including upgrading, reconstruction and
provision of coastal and river bunds, tidal gates,
bridges and gated-culverts in association with the
construction of an intensive drainage network and
upgrading the main drainage system in estate areas
(i.e. to improve water control, flood control and
water table control in the rain fed tree-crop areas)
and the provision of farm access roads and bridges
(i.e. to improve on-farm transportation); and
(iii) Construct 2 Project Office Complexes, 1 Farmers' Deve-
lopment Centre, 11 Farmers' Development Sub-Centres
and requisite staff quarters.
(b) Integrated Agricultural. Services - Past experiences have
indicated that full benefits from major investment in
irrigation and drainage systems would only be forthcoming
provided that there is an accompanying, often times drama-
tic, improvement to the organisation of farmers; efficient
management of the irrigation and drainage systems so cons-
tructed; the efficiency of the extension service; the supply
of credit and inputs; and the handling of farm produce.
This cognisance has led to the inclusion of the integrated
agricultural services component. This involves the setting
up of an integratel organisation and management system de-
sigfied to coordinate planning, implementation, progress
evaluation and continuous training of all levels of personnel
of the various agencies concerned (namely, DID, DOA, FOA,
BPM and MARDI) on a routine basis. This system, together
with the provision of additional personnel, equipment,
vehicles, facilities and training programs forms the basis
of the Integrated Agricultural Services Component.

2.  PROGRAM  PREPARATION AND FORMULATION
2.01. Project formulation originated in the efforts of the Selangor
Drainage and Irrigation Department to upgrade existing drainage and
irrigation infrastructure (to improve water management) and to promote
agricultural improvement (to increase cropping intensity in padi areas
and to intensify inter-e-ropping and sole-cropping in tree crop areas)
in this major agricultural subregion of the Selangor State. 'Over time,
as long as' development was dependent on routine annual. budget alloca-
tions, it became apparent that only piecemeal engineering solutions
to the re4ion's drainage and irrigation problems were possible and the
various agricultural agencies would have to be involved in an integra-
ted extension effort to upgrade smallholder farm practices in conjunc-
tion with full-scale improvement in agricultural infrastructure. The
preparation of this Project thus involved the long term planning of
irrigation works and regional drainage systems on the engineering side
and concurrently working out a complete operational methodology for
the 'delivery system' for supporting agricultural services among DOA,
DID, FOA, BPM and MARDI.
2.02. The various agencies that are involved directly in the implemen-
tation of the major Project components are the DID, DOA, FOA, BPM,
MARDI and Land Office.a/ While each of these agencies is responsible
for implementing specific activities within its jurisdiction, the res-
ponsibility for coordinating all Project activities lies with the Pro-
ject Management Unit (PMU). The Project as a whole, is guided in its
implementation and particularly on policy matters by a Steering
Committee.
2.03. Besides these project specific activities, the above agencies
are also responsible for the implementation of a range of state-wide
and/or nation-wide programs (of their respective parent agency) in
the Project area. Concurrently, other supporting agricultural deve-
lopment agencies (e.g. LPN, FAMA, RISDA, Veterinary Services Depart-'
2/ - The Land Office was-incorporated as a Project agency
in March 1979.

-22 -
ment, Fisheries Department,etc.) also operate in the Project area.
There is, thus, an on-going attempt at integrating the activities of
such agencies in the Project area.
2.04. It is important to realise that the Appraisal Report gave a
greater emphasis to the program preparation and formulation of the
infrastructure component compared with the integrated agricultural
supporting services. The infrastructure component should be viewed
as one of the means to achieve the Project targets. An equally im-
portant means to achieve the Project targets, is thrbugh the integ-
rated agricultural supporting services. Thus, an equal if not a
greater emphasis should have been paid to the program preparation
and formulation of the integrated agricultural supporting services.
2.05. The program preparation and formulation of the Project was
based on baseline data and information which lacks accuracy. As a
result some of the targets set, such as infrastructure implementa-
tion schedules, projections on crop yields, farm incomes, etc. are
rather unrealistic and optimistic.
2.06. As a whole, t:he Appraisal Report prepared in 1977 provided a
useful general framework for programing projects and activities, es-
pecially in the early phase of the Project period. Over the years,
more data and information were collected and additional technical
sub-committees were instituted at the Project, District and Area
levels to ensure a more detailed technical planning.

3. IMPLEMENTATION
EFFECTIVEz*ESS
3.01. The implementation of Project programs and activities can be
considered as generally satisfactory and to a large extent had ful-
filled the desired objectives. However, a number of problems did
occur during program implementation.
3.02. The first major problem faced was the staff shortages and in-
experienced staff. It took about 1 years i.e. from June 1978 through
to December 1979 to get 80% of the established posts filled and when
filled they were more often filled with inexperienced new recruits.
In short, both stiff shortages and inexperienced staff were critical
in the early years of 1978 through to 1980 causing delay in the imple-
mentation of the infrastructure program, which could not be brought
back to schedule and hence resulted in t_me overrun. Similarly, the
staff shortages and inexperienced staff which occurred in June 1978
through to 1980 also affected the implementation schedule of the integ-
rated agricultural supporting services program. This early setback in
the implementation of the integrated agricultural supporting serviles
was, however, brought back to schedule later, when more posts were
filled and staff gained experience.
3.03. Secondly, the Appraisal Report envisaged that the District Land
Offices at Kuala Selangor and Sabak Bernam could cope with the work-
load on land acquisition. The number of lots of land to be acquired
for the Project were 20,000 and it was found out that the 2 District
Land Orfices with their existing staff could not cope up with this
workload. As such, 2 Land Mobile Units had to be requested from the
Federal Department of Land and Mines to carry out land acquisition for
the Project. The Land Mobile Units were Incorporated as a Project
Agency in March 1979. This had caused delay in land acquisition and
thus to some extent affected the infrastructure implementation schedule.
3.04. Thirdly there was the problem of general shortage of 'bakau'
piles of 4-inches diameter. 'Bakau' piles were used for the foundation
of the concrete conduits. The number of 'bakau' piles required was



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                  MAIN REPORT
Northwest Selanoor Project & 1522 MA
- 24 -
1.3 million. This shortage in one way or other affected the implemen-
tation of the infrastructure.
REVISIONS
3.05. The important changes made in the Project scope and design were
the inclusion of 348.2 hectares of land in Ganda Suli in the State of
Perak which is adjacent to the Project area, the increase in width of
access path from the original 1.22 metre (4 ft.) to 1.83 metre (6 ft.),
construction of the additional quarters for PMU's staff and also the
increase in number of Farmers' Development Centres from 10 to 12.
Ganda Suli area, although part of the State of Perak, lies strategically
within the Project area and thus was appropriate to be incorporated
into the Project area. The original width of the access path was too
small and not accessable to most farm machineries whose width is 1.83
metre and above. There was an oversight in the Appraisal for not
providing quarters for PMU's staff and the 2 additional Farmers' Deve-
lopment Centre were required for proper coverage of the Project area.
Detail of changes made in the infrasturcture works is shown in Appendix
II. The changes made in the Project scope and design not only caused
delay but also contributed in some way to the increase in Project cost.
3.06. The procurement of equipment was also revised from US$1.4 million
to US$0.57 million. The main reason for the reduction was that main-
tenance works would be carried out on contract basis. This is in
accordance with the GOM policy on privatisation.
3.07. The Appraisal Report mentioned that there would be 3 Area Farmers'
Organisations in the Project Area. However, the number of Area Farmers'
Organisatiln had been revised to 5, and this revision coincided with
the number of service areas as envisaged in the Appraisal Report.
3.08. The'announcement of the National Agricultural Policy in late 1983
and the release of Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Malaysia Plan in 1984,
shifted the foci of agricultural supporting services program from the
already on-going farmers' groups towards group farming and mini-estate.
In addition, the withdrawal of input subsidies in favour of encouraging

- 25 -
credit utilization by farmers especially as provided by the Agricul-
tural Bank also shifted the foci of agriculture supporting services
program. The above changes also consequently affected training and
education program designed for staff and farmers alike.
IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
3.09. According to the implementation schedule as drawn up in the
Appraisal Report, the implementation of civil works was supposed to
start in January 1977 and completed by December 1982. However, the
Loan Agre ment was only signed on March 8, 1978 and the Project was
only offidially launched on June 6, 1978. As such, the schedule of
iaplement Ltion of civil works was adjusted accordingly to begin in
June 1978 and to complete by December 1983. It is therefore appropri-
ate to consider this date as the commencement of the implementation
schedule of civil works for the Project. The original schedule of
implementation as appeared in the Appraisal Report is in Appendix
Illa, whereas the revised implementation schedule is in Appendix IlIb.
3.10. The completion date for the civil works will be October 1985
when 2 irrigation contracts in Panchang Bedena and Bagan Terap will be
completed. The drainage contracts were completed by April 1985. The
completion date for the Project is therefore delayed by 1 year and 10
months. The actual implementation of civil works is as in Appendix IIIc.
3.11. The main cause of the delay in the implementation of civil
works was mainly due to staff shortages and inexperienced staff which
occurred from 1978 through to 1980. It took nearly 1 years from June
1978 to December 1979 to get 80% of the established posts filled and
when filled, they were more often filled with inexperienced recruits.
As a result, majority of tenders for civil works were only be able to
be called in 1981.
3.12. The implementation of the integrated agricultural services
program started off slowly in the early phase due also to staff short-
ages and inexperienced staff but picked up later and was able to comp-
lete ahead of schedule. The Sekincan technique of padi direct seeding
was introduced to other blocks in 1981. This technique required among



PRoJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                  MAIN REPORT

other things good water distribution and control. As a result, many
problems were faced in water supply, distribution and control. Efforts
were made and still being made to improve the water supply, distribu-
tion and control in the padi areas. On the other hand, in tree crop
areas, especially in acid-sulphate and potential acid sulphate areas,
the main problem faced is the maintenance of adequate water table.
The infrastructure planned for the drainage areas did not cater for
this aspect of water control. The shortcoming however, is being
rectified by building sandbag dams at strategic locations along the
secondary drains to command the required water table.
3.13. The staff shortages and inexperienced staff and the lack of
capacity of the District Land Offices to undertake the land acquisition
work could have been foreseen and avoided. The original time schedule
of the Project was unrealistic in view of the fact that the Loan Agree-
ment was only signed on March 8, 1978. The 5-year project implementa-
tion period is too optimistic for this Project. This is further com-
pounded by an overly optimistic start-up targets. The length of the
project implementation period should therefore be according to the
complexities of each project and should not be stereotyped for all
IADPs.
3.14. The effects of the delay were reflected in the increase in costs
and in the delayed benefits to the farmers. The costs would have been
different if most of the tenders were to be called in 1978/79 and not
in 1981 as in the case of this Project. The benefits to farmers were
also delayed by the time overrun.
3.15. There were no changes in the original procurement plans and also
in the extent of local and foreign procurement. International Compe-
titive Biqdings (ICB) were called for irrigation contracts and Local
Competiti4e Biddings (LCB) for drainage and building contracts. With
the excep ion of one (a Japanese firm),all other bidders for ICB were
local contractors. As such, there was no need to call for ICB and in
future, LCB will be adequate for this type of project.

Total = US$0.57 million.
(iii) *** - DOA - US$1.65 million and FOA - US$0.50 million
Total - US$2.15 million.
3.17. Table 2 above clearly shows that there is cost overrun of US$27
(US$87.0 - US$60.0) million or 45% from the Appraisal estimate. However,
the actual costs and the cost revisions as done on December 1, 1979 were
very close. The main increase in cost was in the padi irrigation system.
Appraisal estimates were made in 1977 whereas most tenders for the civil
works were called mainly in 1981 i.e. a difference of 5 years and hence
the increase in bid prices compared with the Appraisal estimates. The
physical and price contigencies were inadequate to cover up this price
increases. The cost overrun was financed by the Malaysian Government.
DISBURSEMENT AND FINANCIAL SOURCES
3.18. The actual cost of the Project is around US$87.0 million. The
World Bank financed US$26.0 million or 29.9% of the Project cost, while
the balance of US$61.0 million or 70.1% was borne by GOM.

3.19. According to the Loan Agreement, the GOM had first to finance
the Project, and later to reimburse from the World Bank. The actual
disbursements made from the World Bank compared with the Appraisal
expectations is shown in Table 3.

1983         26.0                  26.0
3.20. Table 3 above shows that the disbursements were completed on
schedule but did not follow the Appraisal expectations. The disburse-
ments were low in the first 3 years and only caught up with the App-
raisal expectations in 1982 and 1983. The main reason for the diffe-
rence in actual disbursements compared with Appraisal expectations was
as explained earlier due to slow start-up of the Project in years 1978
through to 1981.
PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS AND BORROWER
3.21. Overall, the contractors' performance can be considered as good.
Of the 6 contracts for padi irrigation works, 3 were completed on time,
while the other 3 were extended to between 3 to 6 months due to site
problems. 5 out of the 7 contracts for drainage works were completed
on time, while 2 other contracts were delayed and were extended by 6
months due to land acquisition problems. The offices, quarters, FDC/
FDSc etc. were completed within -he stipulated periods.
3.22. There was no problem in the procurement of equipment, as this
formed a small part of the Project component. The performance of the
suppliers was good.

3.23. In the early phase of the Project period, the technical and
managerial competence of the implementing agencies was rather weak,
but their competence improved with time, as staff strength grew and
the staff gained more experience. Some of them had been taken out
of the Project and emplaced to other newly established IADPs.
3.24. On the whole, the actual operating performance of the Project
was satisfactory. Most managerial and technical problems that occurred
had largely been overcome. The staff of all implementing agencies
(now an experienced lot) were able to work as a team and were confident
of their roles.  This, together with the increasing committment from
all levels of staff towards the Project concept (as they get a better
'feel' of things) were major contributors to the optimism of a better
performanc as the Project grows.

4. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.01. The GOM always allocated sufficient funds for the Project. In
fact, the GOM had funded the Project well above the Appraisal estimate.
This was due to the fact that the GOM realised that changes in scope
and design together with increases in prices had pushed the Project
cost welA over the Appraisal estimate and in order to ensure the success
of the Prt*ject, the GOM had no qualms in allocating additional fund to
the Projedt.
4.02. The annual Appraisal projections compared with the annual allo-
cation and the actual annual expenditure are as in Table 4.
Table 4 - Annual Appraisal Projections Compared With
Annual Allocation And Actual Annual Expenditure

Notes:-
(i)  * - 1985 estimates.
4.03. Table 4 above shows that the actual annual allocations deviated
from the Appraisal annual projections. Although the annual allocation
for the first 3 years i.e. 1978 through to 1980 were smaller than the
Appraisal annual projections, this did not affect the project implemen-
tation. In fact, the annual allocation given in 1978 through to 1980
far exceeded the requirement for these years. As mentioned earlier,
the main reason for this occurrence was due to slow start-up in the
early phase of project implementation. The tempo of implementation
started only to pick up in 1980 and peaked in 1982.

4.04. As also mentioned previously, funds were not a problem for this
Project. In fact, funds were made available to the Project according
to its capacity in implementing its program. However, it is pertinent
to point out that the implementation schedule of civil works was too
optimistic,. The implementation schedule for civil works drawn up for
this type bf project should take into account all the constraints
particular ly staffing problems, capability and capacity of officers,
etc. so that a more realistic and practical schedule could be drawn up.
The experience gained in this Project should therefore be used in
planning future IADPs.

5. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01. Generally the institutional performance and development conformed
to as in the Appraisal Report. Any weakness found during the course of
project implementation were corrected and strengthened from time to time.
By this way the Project Management has strived to achieve the institu-
tional objectives and has met with some degree of success.
MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL EFFECTTVENESS
5.02. Management is perhaps the most critical element affecting project
implementation. Not withstanding the type of organisation and manage-
ment system, the success or failure of any project also depends on the
quality, experience, personality and competence of the Project Director
and key personnel. Equally important is continuity of staff i.e. to
keep such staff in post for the Project period which can be done by
introducing promotion prospects for successful performers.
5.03. The type of organisation. and management system practised in
the Project can be called the coordinative type as opposed to autho-
ritative type (as in MADA or KADA which operate as independent Autho-
rities). In order to ensure efficient coordination in the implemen-
tation of the Project, the overall management is organised along the
lines as per Appendix IVa which is self-explanatory. The apparently
overt reliance on committees and meetings as shown on the chart is
conditioned by the fact that there is little integration of management
in the Project (unlike MADA or KADA). Consequently, the present manage-
ment organisation is a 'second-best approach' and is constructed so as
to afford a somewhat 'rudimentary' management system which nevertheless
is vital to the proper implementation of the Project. The implementa-
tion record of the Project would certainly improve if the management
organisation of the Project were to be of the authoricative type.
5.04. The management organisation as set up, helped a long way in
ensuring smooth implementation of the Project. There were little
changes made to the management organisation set-up during the course
of Project implementation except in the re-naming of certain committees

and co-opting more agencies to be members of various committees and
meetings (and vice-versa) when the need arises, with the aim of con-
tinued cooperation in the implementation of the Project.  The renaming
of some of the committees is to be in accordance with the requirement
of the Ministry of Agriculture Malaysia. The latest management set-up
of the Project is as in Appendix IVb.
GROWTH
5.05. In order for the Project to be implemented, additional staff,
office space, stores, drying yards atd staff houses were required by
the implementing agencies. There was a growth in the number of staff
of all implementing agencies including the PMU. The staff growth in
all categories for DID was 204 (at its peak), DOA was 49, PMU was 38
and FOA was 29. The office space for all implementing agencies was
housed under one roof. The headquarters of the Project is situated
in Kuala Selangor and one branch office in Sungai Besar. There were
1 FDC and 13. FDSc; all are strategically located in the Project area
to serve the farmers. Each FDC/FDSc complex normally consists of
office space, stores, drying yard and staff quarters for all imple-
menting agencies. There is a total of 143 staff quarters. .
5.06.  The agencies involved (including those not financed by the Pro-
ject) in project implementation and their respective roles are summa-
rised below:-
(a) PMU - Besides providing close and continuos liaison between
the implementing agencies, the PMU also assists the imple-
menting agencies in the planning and implementation of the
integrated agricultural services component and the planning
and synchronisation of land acquisition and alienation with
all major construction works; the monitoring and evaluation
of the overall progress of the Project; and acts as the
secretariat to the Steering Committee.
(b) DID - Besides the design and construction of all irrigation,
drainage and civil works, DID is also responsible for the
operation and maintenance of the new systems. DID and DOA
jointly undertake the organisation of farmers into water-

user groups and train them in the proper operation of the
new systems according to Project concepts, adherence to
planting schedules and proper water management practices.
(co DOA - In conjunction with the organisation of farmers Into
common farmer groups (i.e. the delivery system for integ-
rated agricultural services), DOA operationalises the T&V
system of extension in the entire Project area and through
such a system introduce improved agronomic practices and
enhanced farm advisory services necessary to achieve the
expected yield increases (i.e. Project targets). DOA pr4-
vides pest monitoring and surveillance and crop prot,ctioit
services; soil analytical services; farm mechanisation
training; and supply of improved seeds and planting
materials (in collaboration with MARDI and FOA) in support
of the integrated delivery system. DOA is also responsible
for ensuring the liaison and close cooperation among other
agencies in implementing the integrated agricultural
services component in the padi and tree crop areas.
(d) FOA - FOA is responsible for the supply of inputs; mechani-
sation service, local marketing (transport, storage and
processing) and the increased participation of farmers in
agribusiness activities (including the rehabilitation of
cooperative rice mills) related to the production of the
respective crops in the Project area. FOA will also re-
orientate and channel its established and new activities
especially through the new delivery system of common farmer
groups.
(e) BPM - BPM is responsible for providing its range of credit
facilities especially through the common farmer group set-up.
Most importantly, BPM will advice and supervise the farmers
in the proper utilisation of the different types of credit
facilities made available to them.

36 -
(f) MARDI - Through its basic and applied research programs,
MARDI will ensure a continuos flow of appropriate techno-
logy (including improved varieties) necessary for effective
extension and ultimate achievement of Project targets.
MARDI will also work closely with the other agencies
(particularly DOA) in setting up a network of demonstration
plots and investigate optimal enterprise mixes (for multi-
enterprise farms) under varying conditions in the Project
area.
(g) Land Office - The major role of the Land Office is not only
in speeding up land acquisition but more importantly in
synchronising its work and priorities with those of DID's
construction works scheduling as and when 'unforeseen cir-
cumstances' arise.-! This role is most vital to the time-
liness of project implementation in view of the amount of
land (particularly number of lots) that needs to be acquired
and the somewhat over optimism in the time scheduling of
the construction works.
5.07. It is recognised that simultaneous to the efforts of the above
stated agencies, the support of other agencies and local institutions
must be solicited in order to realise the stated Project objectives,
viz.,:-
(a) LPN's and FAMA's support in the marketing of the major crops;
(b) Veterinary and Fisheries Department's (and to a certain
extent, RISDA) support in the evolution of better cropping
systems (multienterprise farms);
(c) District Offices' and Village Development And Security
Committees' support in resolving and reconciling social
conflicts and problems.
5.08. The list would grow with the Project. Accordingly, represen-
3/ - Such 'unforeseen circumstances' have proved to be a norm in
almost all major infrastructural projects and similarly so
in the case of this Project.

tatives of these agencies will be co-opted into the various commit-
tees and meetings (and vice versa) when the need arises, with the aim
of continued cooperation in the implementation of the Project.
STAFF RECRUITMENT, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
5.09. Project programs and activities were carried out by the imple-
menting agencies, (coordinated by the PMU) which had to make bids to
the Central Agencies every year for the required posts. When the
posts were established, each implementing agency had to fill the
posts. The posts established and filled for the period from 1978 to
1985 are as in Table 5.

5010.  The staff requirement of the Project was essentially to top up
the existing staff of the implementing agencies in the Project area
to strengthen and consolidate themselves for Project implementation.
Table 5 shows that the staff requirement as envisaged in the Appraisal
Report was 396 posts, and in 1983 at the peak of project implementation
314 posts were established i.e. 79% of the Appraisal requirement. The
number of posts established by the GOM for the Project was adequate
for its smooth implementation. The performance of the Project would



PROJECT COMPLETON REPORT                                  MAIN REPORT

have been better if all the posts that were established were filled.
Further, it is important to note that the acute staff shortages and
inexperienced staff from 1978 through to 1981 contributed to the
initial 1D year delay in Project implementation.
5.11. It is pertinent to note here that the Appraisal Report made no
provision of staff requirement for the PMU, except to say that there
should be a Project Director and he "would have a small staff to assist
"4/
in budgeting, procurement and disbursement matters".4 The Project
Director and his staff play a very crucial role for smooth project
implementation.  Therefore, it is very important that adequate staff
provision be made for the PMU from the very beginning.
5.12. Acute staff *shortages occurred at the initial period of project
implementation. Table 5 clearly shows that acute staff shortages
occurred in this Project in the initial period from 1978 through to
1980. It seems that the parent agencies required some time to react
and to fill the posts created in the Project. This weakness had to be
overcome in the future IADPs.
5.13.  The key personnel of the Project were experienced officers.
However, the recruits to the Project such as Engineers, Agricultural
Officers, Technical Assistants, Agricultural Assistants, Technicians,
Cletical staff, etc. were raw. Generally, they were fresh graduates
of universities, technical institutes, etc. At the beginning they
were a burden to the Project as they had to be trained and guided.
They had to undergo on-the-job training and attend either in-house
courses or other organised courses. It took about 1-k years for
these staff to learn their trade and to contribute positively to the
implementation of the Project. The performance of the Project would
have been better if most of the staff were experienced.
5.14. Qualified and experienced Project Director and Component Heads
of the Project are the key to successful project implementation. They

should be carefully selected and placed in their jobs covering
the span of the Project period. Promotion prospects and other
incentives, of course, have to be given to them. It is inte-
resting to note that in this Project, except for the Project
Director, there had been frequent changes in the Component
Heads; so far there had been 3 Component Heads each for DID,
DOA, FOA and MARDI and 4 for BPM. In the lower categories of
staff, the turnover rate was comparatively low.
AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS ON THE BENEFICIARIES
5.15. The impacts on the beneficiaries were varied and many.
These various impacts will be discussed under the following
sub-headings:-
(a) Yield - There is no doubt that there had been
increases in the yield of various crops except
coffee in the Project area. For most of the
crops except coconut,the projected yields were
always higher compared to the actual yields
achieved by smallholders. This may be due to
the lack in accuracy of the data used for the
projection of the yields especially for cocoa,
oil-palm, rubber and coffee. However, the yields
achieved for padi show a close resemblance to the
projected one, though this could not be stabi-
lized from season to season. As for coffee, the
downward trend in the yield achieved is due to
the declining interest of farmers for this crop.
Yield achievement for various crops except coffee
are expected to show a better performance in the
future. Table 6 shows the yield for various
crops up to 1984.

rate as these estimates did not reflect in the prevailing
incomes as found out in the yearly surveys carried out by
the Project Management. However, it is suffice to say
that there have been increases in incomes of the Project
farmers. These increases in incomes could be attributed to
a number of factors, among which are increases in production,
subsidies by the COM, changes in prices of commodities, avai-
labilities of off-farm jobs, etc. However, it is not

possible at this juncture to apportion values to these
various variables. It is suffice to emphasise here that
there had been increases in incomes of farmers in the
Project and these incomes have the potential to be further
increased in the near future. The increase in incomes
among sole crop farmers in the Project area is as shown in
Table 7.

(c) Poverty Redressal - The surveys carried out by the Project
Management shows that there have been a decrease in absoulue
poverty in the Project area. At Appraisal (1977) the pover-
ty rate in the Project area was 65% (poverty line income in
1977 was US$207 per capita per annum) compared with 50% in
1983 and 56% in 1984 (poverty line income in 1983/84 was
US$329 per capita per annum). As there is potential for
further increasing productivity and incomes of Project
farmers, there is also no doubt that poverty in the Project
area could further be reduced. Poverty reduction among sole
crop farmers in the Project area is as in Table 8.

(d) Cropping Pattern - There was no plan in the Appraisal Report
to change the cropping pattern of smallholders in the Project
area.  The padi area remains unchange, except that the crop-
ping intensity had increased from 170% in 1977 to 180% in
1984. The cropping intensity for padi would be increased
further with the completion of the new irrigation infrastruc-
ture and its usage by farmers. The coconut area also remained
basically unchanged. Replanting of old coconuts with MAWA
variety was negligible. As for other crops, there was ten-
dency especially among farmers in Kuala Selangor District
to change from rubber and coffee to oil-palm because of
it's greater economic prospects. Cocoa intercropping in
coconut is popular among smallholders and had increased
tremendously from 9,260 hectares in 1977 to 14,261 hectares
in 1984. The changes in cropping pattern is shown in
Appendix V.
(e) Mechanisation - Better farm road system and improved irri-
gation and drainage network provided by the Project in the
padi area had made mechanisation possible in the hitherto



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                   MAIN REPORT

- 43 -
unaccessable and deep areas.  In addition, mechanibdLon
saves time and labour costs and thus becomes a profitable
proposition. As a result, mechanisation in the padi area
has become widespread. Approximately 80% of farm operations
in the padi area were mechanised. As for the tree crop, the
land preparation work for new plantings were mechanised but
other work like maintenance and harvesting were still manual-
ly done.
(f) Water Management - With the provision of the new irrigation
and drainage infrastructure, there is a need for the farmers
to manage their water wisely. Good water management is
essential in order to fully realise Project benefits. To
achieve ihis, water management committees were set up at
various levela. Presently about 90% of the padi fields had
the required in-field drains and bunds but these structures
were not adequately maintained by the farmers. Land levelling
which is essential for good water management, is estimated
to cover only about 47% of the padi area. Land levelling
progresses relatively slow as this operation is costly and
also there is lack of suitable equipment for problem soils.
Furthermore, land levelling operations had to be carried out
for more than one season before any significant effects could
be realised. Water management is an on-going program in the
Project and would be further strengthened.
(g) Farmers' Attitudes - There had been changes in farmers'
attitudes in the Project area. Among the important changes
were using of improved and recommended padi varieties,
changing from traditional to direct seeding method of padi
cultivation, adopting mature-budding technique to improve
cocoa stand, greater use of chemicals and participation in
pest management programs and greater utilisation of agricul-
tural credits. More than 90% of the farmers were using
improved and recommended padi varieties compared to less
than 50% before the Project and approximately 60% of the
adi area were under direct seeding as compared to less than
2 before the Project. The farmers also showed readiness to

Northwest Selangor Project - 1522 MA
- 44 -
follow padi planting schedules as laid dcwn by the Project Manage-
ment. The mature-budding technique to improve the cocoa stand was
popular among the farmers. Mini estate and joint farming concepts
had also been well recieved by the Project farmers as evidenced by
their participation in 2 mini estate projects and several joint
farming projects. All in all, the farmers in the Project area are
generally receptive to changes.
RATE OF RETURN
5.16. The overall economic rate of return for the Project as estimated
in the Appraisal Report is 21%. The econiomic rate of return for the padi
irrigation area is 19%, whereas for the tree crop drainage area is 22Z
(15% for the smalltolder sector and 30% for the estate sector).
5.17. During the course of Project implementation, there had been a num-
ber of changes. Among the major changes are the increase in Project costs
from the estimated US$60 million to US$87 million (an increase of 45%
from the Appraisal estimate) and the rapid transfer of technology and
management know-how to the farmers and also their rapid adoption. The
cost of the padi irrigation component increased from the estimated US$23.8
million to US$60.7 million (or 155%) while the cost of the tree crop drai-
nage component increased from the estimated US$13.2 million to US$17.7
million (or 34%). Based on these major changes, the revised overall eco-
nomic rate of return is calculated to be 20%. The economic rate of return
for the padi irrigation area is 2%, whereas for the tree crop drainage
area is 64% (56% for the smallholder sector and 81% for the estate sector).
The low economic rate of return for the padi irrigation area is mainly due
to the very high investment cost (US$60.7 million) and 1 years time over-
run. On the other hand, the high economic rate of return for the tree
crop drainige area are due mainly to low investment cost (US$17.7 million),
availability of high yielding oil palm hybrids and cocoa clones and also
management factors.
SPECIAL ISSUES
5/
5.18.  All the various recommendations put forth in the Appraisal Report-5
had been met. The Tanjong Karang swamp had been gazetted as a forest

- 45 -
reserve.  The Selangor State Government still collects irrigation and
drainage rates from land owners. However, no revisions had yet been made
to these rates. Other issues to be discussed are as follbws:-
(a) Research And Extension Relationship - There is close relation-
ship between research and extension in the Project area. This
had come about through the management organisation system as
explained previously and as per charts in Appendices IVa and
IVb. Apart from the various committees set up in-the manage-
*ment organisation system, there were other sub-committees set
up at Project level to foster close relationship between
research and extension. These sub-committees include transfer
of technology committee, DOA-MARDI committee on pest control,
supply of cocoa planting materials committee, fertilizer appli-
cation rates committee, post-harvest losses committee, mini
estates and joint farming committees and various other sub-
committees to foster close inter-agency cooperation.
(b) Lack Of Authority And Proper Job Description Of Project
Director - The coordinative management organisation system as
practised in the Project depends very much on committees'
decisions and personalities of various officers for smooth
project implementation. There is lack of authority on the part
of the Project Director in this type of management organisation
system. This lack of authority is further compounded by the
lack of a proper job description for Project Director and the
ranking of Project Director vis-a-vis Component Heads of line
agencies, which in turn complicates the relationship between
Project Director and line agencies. To summarise, this type
of management organisation subjects line agencies to the super-
vision of an operational head (Project Director) and the control
to its functional head (parent agency) and in such a situation,
line agencies would tend to give priority to their parent
agency when their services are needed both at the same time.
Further, this type of organisation management raises problems
in the day to day running of the Project, such as inadequate
cooperation being given to Project Director and lack of team
work or low priority given to the Project. To overcome this,



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                       MAIN REPORT
Northwest Selangor Project - 1522 MA
- 46 -
it is suggested that:-
(M) The Project Director should be given legitimate authority
by emplacing line agencies directly under the Project
Director. This would enable him to have full and direct
control of resources, as a clear line of hierarchical
structure exists and he functions as a manager rather than
a coordinator,
OR
(ii) The Project Director should be given authority other than
by legitimate authority i.e. by strengthening the present
management system. This can be done by having a proper
job discription for Project Director, raising his grade,
giving management training, extending Project Director's
function to the grassroot level, etc.
Off the two suggestions above, the former one merits special
consideration and should be implemented in new IADPs if project
performance tecord are to be improved.
(c) Form Of Orga4nisation After Project Completion - Full benefits
of the Project would only be obtained years after the Project
completion. Therefore, in order to reap the full benefits from
the implementation of this Project, the existing organisation
should be maintained and strengthened to run the Project.
(d) GRP Conduits - This type of canal structure was introduced in
the Project area in Sawah Sempadan and Sungai Nipah in 1977.
It was found that the performance of the GRP conduits was not
as expected. The condition of the conduits deteriorated after
3 years of utilization and this is due generally to:-
(i) The overall structural strength of the conduit was unable
to withstand the constant weight and vibrationary impact
of the water, especially in the larger sections. This
factor was compounded by the deterioration of the GRP resin
including the wooden framework under intense exposure to
sunlight;
(ii) The fragility of the GRP conduits make it very vulnerable
to breakages and damages by external factors such as fire,
machineries, human vandalism, etc.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                     MAIN REPORT
Northwest Selangor Project - 1522 MA
- 47-
With this experience, it is suggested that in the future, GRP
conduits should not be used anymore for canals or other similar
purposes.
(e) Environmental Effects - The Project has reduced the frequent
occurrence of floods in the area. This is evidenced by .the
lesser number of yearly complaints recieved compared with
previous years. However, due to the more efficient drainage
system, there is tendency of overdrainage in some'areas re-
sulting in poor crop growth, which become more apparent in
acid sulphate areas. Coastal protection works had contributed
in maintaining the environment and habitat of the coastal
areas.
CHANGES IN REPEATER PROJECT
5.19. Many lessons can be learned from this Project. As has been men-
tioned earlier, this Project is geared more towards infrastructure deve-
lopment as evidenced by more than 95% of the fund was allocated for this
component.  The agricultural supporting services was allocated approxi-
mately the other 5% of the fund. Therefore, a more balanced program
between infrastructure and agricultural/human development should have
been drawn, up for this type of project in order to tap the maximum bene-
fits from Lts implementation. As such, more detailed planning should be
carried out for agricultural/human development programs so that more such
programs could be included in the Project.
5.20. The schedule for infrastructure implementation for this Project
is very optimistic. This is further compounded by an overly optimistic
project start-up targets. The disbursement schedule which is closely
tied up with the infrastructure implementation schedule, also becomes
optimistic. To overcome such problems, a more realistic implementation
schedule should be worked out which would improve project implementation
record.
5.21. The type of management organisation system set up for any project
of this kind is one of the critical elements affecting project implemen-
tation. Qualified and experienced Project Director and key personnel



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT                                       MAIN REPORT
Northwest Selangor Project - 1522 MA
- 48 -
are also the key to successful project implementation. The management
organisati: n of the Project and the selection procedures for Project
Director a d key personnel should therefore be reviewed and improved. An
effective uanasgemeat organisation system, with qualified and experienced
Project Director and key personnel would no doubt improve project imple-
mentation record.
5.22. The initial implementation of this Project has been affected by
staff shortages and inexperienced staff. Although staff shortages have
been 'overcome' (that is total requirements stipulated in the Appraisal
Report have been largely met) the quality and experience is thin.  The
implementation record of the Project would certainly improve if there
were no staff shortages and the staff were experienced.
COMMENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK
5.23. In the early phase of project implementation, the Bank's Super-
vision Mission made bi-yearly visits to the Project. However, this was
reduced to once a year in later years. This is a good arrangement as it
is in the early phase of project implementation that the Project Manage-
ment needs more guidance and advice. In fact, the more frequent visits
the Bank's Supervision Mission makes to the Project in early phase of
projeqt implementation, the more beneficial it will be to the Project.
5.24. The Bank's Supervision Mission had gone a good job but it could
have done better if all of the Mission's members were to consist of highly
qualified and experienced personnel with pleasant personalities. Past
experiences have shown that a few Mission team members could not contri-
bute significantly towards the Project. Therefore, if the Bank's Super-
vision Mission want to do an excellent job, the members of the Mission
should at all times be consisted of staff who are highly qualified,
experienced and with pleasant personalities. Equally important here is
the continuity of the members of the Missions as there is tendency for
the Bank to change the members of the Mission team too frequently.

6. CONCLUSION
6.01.  The overall performance of the Project so far is satisfactory
considering the host of problems faced initially. The initial slide
or delay in the implementation of irrigation, drainage and civil works
had been arrested and present expectations indicate that all major
construction would be completed by October, 1985.
6.02. The initial implementation of the Project has been affected
by staff shortages and inexperienced staff. Although staff shortages
have been "overcome" later, the quality and experience is thin. These
problems must be recognised and overcome in future projects if the
project records were to be improved.
6.03. The infrastructure implementation schedule of 5 years set for
the Project is very optimistic. This is compounded by an also overly
optimistic start-up targets. For a project of this nature and size,
such schedule and targets are unrealistic. As such, project schedule
and start-up targets should be more realistic and achievable..
6.04. This Project is geared towards infrastructure development as
evidenced by more than 95% of the fund was allocated for the construc-
tion of the infrastructure. On the other hand the agricultural suppor-
ting services were allocated approximately the other 5% of the fund.
A more balanced program should have been planned for this Project
and in this case to include more agricultural/human development
elements.
6.05. Management organisation set up for the Project is of the
coordinative type. This type of management organisation placed a
heavy reliance on committees and meetings and thus present many
weaknesses. If this system is to be maintained, it has to be stream-
lined and strengthened.

6.06. There had been increases in yield of crops and income of
Project farmers. Poverty rate among Project farmers had been reduced
from 65% in 1977 to 50% in 1983 and 56% in 1984. Farmers were
trained and mobilised to farm their holdings in a more effective and
economical ways. Better showings are still to come. Project benefit
can still be expected to be reaped well after year 2000.
