NEKORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EMCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED LOANS OF US$33 MILLION
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
AND US$99 NILLION TO THE OFFICE OF PORT OPERATIONS
POR A PORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed loans to the
Kingdom of Morocco, in the amount of US$33 million equivalent, and to the Office
of Port Operations (Office d'Exploitation des Ports - ODEP), in the amount of
US$99 million equivalent, is submitted for approval. The proposed loans would
be repayable over 20 years with five years of grace at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and would assist in the implementation of a port sector
project.
2.        Macroeconomic Context.  The Moroccan economy has seen a remarkable,
though fragile, recovery in recent years.   To reinvigorate the economy and
stimulate trade, the Government is presently carrying out an adjustment program
with specific measures to liberalize imports, promote and diversify exports,
and further develop industry, particerlarly those branches involving exports and
the agriculture sector. Because the adequacy of transport infrastructure and
logistics systems have a major impact on foreign trade, a number of measures
have been initiated, over the past five years, to improve the efficiency of the
country's ports. The most notable of these has been the establishment of a new
port organizatior  (CDEP).   Even though this has resulted in substantial
improvements, Moroccan ports are still below international levels of performance.
Physical constraints limit further expansion of specialized traffic (e.g.,
container, roll-on roll-off). Intermodal linkages continue to be weak. Despite
significant progress towards streamlining customs procedures, the overall quality
and flow of information related to trade transactions needs considerable
improvement. The proposed project would therefore support a program of port
modernization and institutional strengthening aimed at removing bottlenecks to
export growth and facilitating continued growth in foreign trade.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The proposed project forms an
integral part of the Bank's strategy to support Morocco's adjustment efforts.
Accordingly, it is designed to help increase public enterprise efficiency,
ritionalize public investment programs, and promote exports. It also forms part
of a longer-range transport sector strategy in which the Bank continues to play
an active role; our most recent involvement includes the development of a
National Transport Master Plan Study and a Highway Sector Project. The ongoing
Bank-assisted Ports of Casablanca and Mohammedia Project (Loan 2657-MOR), though
limited in scope, has already helped improve operational efficiency in the port
of Casablanca, enhance management of ODEP and rationalize the pricing of port
services.  Furthermore, the Bank serves as executing agency for a UNDP-financed
Trade Facilitation Project.
4.        Continued Bank involvement would provide critical support in several
areas. First, the proposed project would Felp improve cost recovery policies
and strengthen investment planning both at the subsector level and in the
individual ports. A National Port Master Plan Study would address the issues



of coordination within the port subsector and coherence between long-term
planning and short-term programs.   Second, the Bank's support to the port
subsector would enhance Morocco's access to the kinds of international experience
and expertise that are needed to increase operational efficiency, further develop
modern cargo-handling and communication technologies, and improve environmental
practices. Third, continued Bank involvement would also provide an operational
context for ensuring the improvement of port procedures thus supporting the
present trade facilitation strategy. Finally, the Bank could help improve the
responsiveness of the logistics system to changing environments in international
trade and transport markets, particularly the forthcoming unified European
market.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would broaden assistance
provided under the ongoing Ports of Casablanca and Mohammedia Project to support
better allocation of resources and utilization of existing port facilities. It
has been designed to: (a) improve operational efficiency to cope with the growth
and changing structu:e of foreign trade, especially through provision of adequate
facilities for unicized cargo; (b) strengthen the economic viability of port
sector investment, through improved screening and planning of subprojects; (c)
improve the recovery of infrastructure costs through, inter alia, appropriate
changes in port tariffs; and (d) promote foreign trade, by encouraging more
coherent policies and institutional measures that would result in better
coordination of port activities. These objectives are consistent with the Bank's
country strategy for Morocco and fit in with corresponding actions at the macro
level to rationalize the public investment program, liberalize the econom   and
provide support for resource mobilization.
6.        Project Description.  The project would encompass the main components
of the country's port investment program: (a) construction of a new container
terminal in the port of Casablanca, with the provision of specialized container-
handling equipment; (b) facilities for Ro-Ro traffic in the port of Tangier;
(c) adaptation of a berth for coal traffic in the port of Jorf Lasfar;
(d) construction of a radar control tower and provision of related vessel traffic
services for marine security; (e) maintenance dredging and breakwater
strengthening works designed to ease a sizeable backlog accumulated over the
years; (f) continued development of computerized management and operational
systems for ODEP and for port operatiors; and (g) studies, technical assistance,
and training in support of the institutional development component.   This
component would include measures to support a Contract -an between ODEP and the
Government, currently under preparation, increased financial viability, the
development of environmental studies, the establishment and monitoring of
performance targets, the modernization of communications, and the reduction of
container dwell times in the port of Casablanca. Additional technical assistance
would be provided to help ODEP address trade facilitation issues and would
supplement ongoing actions under the UNDP Trade Facilitation Project, which
focuses on institutional and informational bottlenecks to trade transactions.
In parallel with the project, the Ministry of Foreign Trade is also planning to
carry out a complementary trade logistics study focussing on cost analysis and
identification of constraints to the development of trade affecting selected key
export and import cargoes.
7.        Proiect Costs and Financing.  The project would be implemented over
a four-year period at a total estimated cost of US$282 million equivalent, with



- 3 -
a foreign exchange component of US$151 million (541). It would provide funds
for civil works including dredging, equipment, technical assistancs, and
training. The project would be financed through two separate loans: one to ODEP
for US$99 million with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Morocco and the other to
the Kingdom of Morocco for US$33 million. The aggregate amount of these loans
(US$132 million) would finance 87X of the foreign exchange costs of the project
and 471 of the total port investment program. The remainder of foreign exchange
costs would be covered by other loans (Schedule A) and internal cash generation.
Possible cofinancing and bilateral assistance may reduce Bank and councerpart
funding. Discussions between the Government and the Ex-Im Bank of Japan for a
contribution of US$38 million to the project have been initiated.   If a
cofinancing agreement is obtained, the Bank intends to cancel an amount
equivalent to Japanese participation. The rest of the program would be financed
from budgetary resources (17%), ODEP (321), and ongoing World Bank and African
Development Bank loans (41).   In addition, the Government and ODEP expect
bilateral sources to finance about US$11 million of specialized equipment. If
bilateral financing materializes, it will reduce the shares of the Government
and ODEP to 16X and 30%, respectively.
8.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government and ODEP on: (a) time-bound Dev-lopment Programs, to be carried out
by the Government and ODEP, related to the efficiency of port services, port
procedures, information systems for trade facilitation, investment planning,
the environment and safety, and cost recovery; (b) annual reviews of the
investment program for the port sector and ODEP, to be carried out by the Bank;
(c) procedures and criteria related to the eligibility of subprojects to be
financed by the Bank; (d) completion of a dredging study and an environmental
study of maintenance dredging in four ports by December 31, 1991; (e) signature
of a Contrazt Plan between ODEP and the Government by June 30, 1991; (f) ODEP's
postponement of the procurement process for the coal terminal at Jorf Lasfar
until a satisfactory agreement on the operation of the terminal has been signed
with the National Electricity Board (ONE); (g) a new tariff structure for port
dues related to container handling a d Ro-Ro traffic, to be implemented by
September 30, 1991; and (h) an annual iate of return, to be attained  by ODEP,
on its revalued assets in operation of at least 71 and a debt service ratio of
not less than 1.5, to be maintained throughout the project period.   Cross-
effectiveness conditions have been introduced under each loan in view of the
integrated nature of ODEP/Government activities.
9.        Environment.    The project  is not  expected  to have  arny major
environmental consequence requiring the preparation of a full-scale Envi onmental
Assessment (EA). Environmental issues were, nonetheless, assessed in the course
of project pre-appraisal with the result that potential impacts were identified
particularly in the areas of dredging, reclamation, and dust release. Based on
this assessrent, detailed analyses of potential impacts will be carried out and
the necessary measures taken against possible negative environmental effects.
An environmental study of dredging would be required in four selected ports prior
to implementation of rehabilitation dredging in those ports. In addition, the
project-financed technical assistance and training to Government and ODEP staff
is expected to raise environmental awareness in the port subsector and strengthen
the capacity to study environmental aspects and carry out appropriate actions.



- 4 -
10.       Benefits. The project would enhance the international compe.titiveness
of Morocco by increasing the overall efficiency of port operations fad supporting
further growth in export trade. A reduction in trauisport and handling costs on
a large part of the country's foreign trade flows would yield significant savings
in foreign exchange. The consequeni. reduction in the cost of exports would then
improve Morocco's comparative advantage in export trade. The economic rates of
return of subprojects range from 19X to 50e. The economic rate of return on the
overall port program is estimated at about 25Z.
11.       Risks.  The main project risk is the uncertainty regarding future
traffic levels and distribution of general cargo traffic between containerized
cargoes and Ro-Ro.  To mitigate this risk, project design allows sufficient
flexibility to cope with both types of cargoes. There is also some risk that
delays would be encountered in the implementation of the institutional cnanges
required in terms of trade facilitation and logistics. Although progress is now
being made in i iroving documents and procedures related to trade flows, trade
facilitation and logistics aspects would be closely monitored within the
framewirk of the next phase of trade reforms. It is not anticipated that slow
implementation of related measures iould frustrate the needed container and Ro-
Ro investments proposed under the project. Primarily affecting the Government
component is the possibility of a shortfall in budgetary allocations for the
program. This risk has been considerably reduced with (a) the inclusion in the
project of the essential core of the sector investment program and (b) the
periodic reviews of the public inves'ment program under this project.
12.       Recommendation.  I am s   sfied that the proposed loans will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of    Bank and recommend the Executive Directors
approve them.
