MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y
SERVICIOS PUBLICOS
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SANITAON SOR
PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios
Publicos (BANOBRAS) with the guarantee of the United Mexican States for the
equivalent of US$350 million to help finance a Second Water Supply and
Sanitation Sector Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace.
2.    Background. In Mexico, water resources are unevenly distributed.
Average rainfall ranges from 100 mm/year in the dry zones of the North to
5,000 mm/year in the tropical lowlands of the South. In addition, while 70%
of the population and 80% of the country's industrial plant are located above the
elevation of 500 m, only about 15% of the country's surface water is above that
elevation. Moreover, a significant number of aquifers are being depleted and
severe pollution has threatened and reduced the use of many nrvers and other
surface bodies of water. Municipal water supply, the main subject of the
proposed project, accounts for about 11% of the country's total demand for
water resources. The lagest water user in Mexico is agriculture, accounting for
about 80%. Industry accounts for only about 7%, with other uses accounting
for another 2%.
3.    Overall, water supply and sanitation services have improved during the
past three years, following a decade of stagnation in the 1980s. In 1992, 84%
of the population had access to piped water, compared to 70% in 1980. During
the same period, access to sewers increased from 49% to 67%. In spite of this
progress, services are still inadequate, and significantly below comparable
countries in Latin America. Furthermore, the problem of insufficient coverage
is aggravated by poor water quality. Largely as a result of this deficiency,
gastro-intestinal diseases are still one of the principal causes of morbidity and
infant mortality.
4.    For the first time in Mexico, the current administration has established
a coordinated legal, policy and institutional framework within which to manage
the country's scarce water resources. As a result, Mexico now has a well
conceived water management policy which is presented in a government policy
statement issued in support of the proposed project. This policy is consistent
with the Bank's operational policy guidelines on water resources management
(OP 4.07) and its recent water resources management paper. Mexico's policy
is based on the following elements: (a) integrated water management based on
the development of river basins; (b) water pricing aimed at improving the
efficiency of water use and the implementation of tariffs that cover costs and
reflect scarcity values; (c) decentralized, efficient and financially-sound water
utilites (WU) at the local level, together with greater participation of



2-
communities; and (d) protection of the environment through: (i) incentive
policies, such as pollution charges; (ii) expanding water and sanitation coverage
to the poorest segments of the population; (iii) restoration and preservation of
ecosystem and groundwater resources and regulation of extraction; and (iv) strict
enforcement of environmental regulations.
5.    Significant progress has been achieved on the legal front. Two important
new laws, the National Water Law and the Federal Water Charges Law, were
pa3sed in December 1992 and October 1991, respectively. The National Water
Law provides for the development of water markets, private sector investment
and water conservation. It also better defines water property rights, including
concession renewals for periods of up to 50 years, and provides for changes in
water use and the transfer of concession titles without p-ior government
approval. The National Water Law also mandates the creation of "river basin
councils" (consejos de cuenca), composed of government and user group
representatives, to coordinate and manage water resources in an integrated
manner. Furthermore, the law establishes that concessions for water and
drainage systems can be granted to the private sector.  The Federal Water
Charges Law defines the charges to be applied to the consumption or extraction
of federal watvrs, to the use of public infrastructure and to wastewater
discharges. An existing law, the General Ecology and Environmental Law,
passed in 1988, contains important provisions for the preservation of water
quality.
6.    Major efforts have already been made by the Government to improve the
efficiency of the sector's institutional framework. Amendments to the Mexican
Constitution, made in 1983, assigned to municipalities the responsibility for the
provision of water supply and sanitation services. The majority are organized
as autonomous WUs1, however, some municipalities still manage their water
services directly, together with other services. Most of the states also operate
some autonomous WUs. They operate small water systems for several
municipalities in order to take advantage of economies of scale when individual
municipalities are too small to run their own systems efficiently. The National
Program for Water and Sewerage (NPWS), financed by the ongoing water
sector loan, supported the development of financially autonomous municipal and
state water utilities (WUs).
7.     The federal secretariat responsible for water resource management, is
the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) which operates
through its agency, the National Water Commission (CNA). The Social
Development Secretariat (SEDESOL) is responsible for the issuance of the
official Mexican water norms and the evaluation of environmental impact
assessments (EIAs). All other aspects of water management, including the
enforcement of water effluent and environmental standards, are handled by
1. A WU is classified as autonomous if it has its own separate legal identity, its finances are
independent of the municipality or the state, it has ownership of all its assets, proper
commercial accounting and auditing, and a Board of Directors with final legal authority to
mange its operation.



- 3 -
CNA. CNA has delegated to the Mexican Institute of Water Technology
(IMTA), which is also under SARH, the design and implementation of the
National Training Program for the sector. The creation of CNA in 1990, made
possible a full integration of all aspects of national water resource management
within one agency. To help coordinate federal and state activities in the sector,
State Water Supply and Sanitation Subcommittees (SWSS) have been created in
all the states. The SWSSs represent all sector-related federal and state agencies,
and are the focal point for sectoral planning at the state level.
8.    The main challenges facing water resource managemernt in Mexico will
continue to be the implementation of existing legislation, the effective devolution
of responsibilities to the states and municipalities, the implementation of river
basin management, a more effective use of incentives and other indirect
measures for pollution control, and encouragement of community participation.
To meet these challenges, the CNA has prepared the National Program for
Water Quality Irlprovement (NPWQI). This program aims at: monitoring
water quality and assessment; development of effluent standards and discharge
permits; strengthening of the financing system; development of sanitation and
treatment infrastructure; better management of river basin pollution; and
strengthening the sector's institutional capacity, with emphasis on enforcement
including reliance on a credible self-repordng system for industries within both
the public and private sectors. The strategy under NPWQI is based on the
concept of integrated water management and it includes prescrbed actions,
quantitative goals and estimates of investment needs. This program is fully
supported by the proposed project.
9.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed operation is consistent
with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico to be presented
to the Board with the Northern Border Environment Project (eport No. 6287-
ME) on June 9, 1994 in parallel with this project. The stategy aims at assisting
Mexico to keept its economic restructuring process on track, while supporting
programs that contribute to poverty reduction, improved environmental
management and long-term sustainable economic growth and development,
particularly through investments in human resources, infrstrucre and natural
resource management. The strategy also aims to push the reform process
downward to the subnational (state and municipal) level and support the further
devolution of expenditure and revenue responsibilities to these local
governments. Working within this strategy, the proposed project is specifically
aimed at developing capacity to supply water and sanitation services, addressing
environmental issues, at the local level, increasing services to the poor and
protecting the country's scarce water resources.  By providing technical
assistance for the formulation of a well-defined regulatory framework, the
proposed project also aims to promote a larger private sctor involvement in the
supply of water and sanitation services. The Bank's past involvement in the
water sector, puts it in a unique position to strongly support the ongoing process
of decentalized water utilities, focusing on better management practice,
improved water and sanitation service delivery and greater attention to water
pollution problems.

10.   Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are to: (a)
improve the quality and expand the coverage of water and sanitation services;
(b) strengthen the institutional capacity of CNA to comply with its legal mandate
to assist local water utilities (WUs) improve their operating and plaming
capability, and train their personnel to properly manage and maintain their
systems; (c) reduce subsidies- to the sector b- promoting the development of
adequately sized WUs that are operationally and financially autonomous; (d)
strengthen BANOBRAS' capacity to appraise and supervise sub-projects at its
Mexico City headquarters and, especially, at its state offices; (e) encourage
private sector participation by establishing the appropriate legal and technical
framework to attract private investment; (f) improve the management of water
resources and the environment by supporting water quality programs; and (g)
strengthen the sector's capacity to enforce environmental regulations and carry
out EIAs.
11. Project Description. The project would have three main components:
(a) strengthening of the major federal institutions that play a key role in the
management of water resources; (b) supporting the investment/operational plans
of WUs; and (c) strengthening the WUs to make them viable and sustainable
institutions.
12.   Strengtening the Federal Agencies (USS 33.7 million). Under this
component technical assistance would be provided to strengthen the capabilities
of CNA, IMTA and BANOBRAS to provide assistance to the WUs, to evaluate
and supervise the implementation of subprojects, to manage water resources and
to develop cost-effective po!icies to prevent water pollution.
13.   The Investment Support to Local Water Utilities component (US$722.8
mii;on) would provide credit to autonomous WUs to fund subprojects in full
compliance with agreed eligibility criteria related to the technical, financial and
operational viability of the WU and the subproject. Subloans could also be used
to assist public companies to subcontract services to the private secto; by
financing start up costs. In order to become eligible for Bank financing under
the project, WUs would need to prepare master plans covering their investment,
organizational and financial plans over a seven to ten year period. The actions
to be takn in any one year would be recorded in an agreed Memorandum of
Understanding (MU). The types of subprojects expected to be financed include:
(a) expansion and rehabilitation of water supply and distribution systems such
as: (i) surface water intakes; (ii) raw water pump stations; (iii) wells; (iv)
storage tanks; (v) transmission mains; (vi) filtration plants; (vii) disinfection
facilities; (viii) booster pump stations; and (ix) piping distribution networks; and
(b) expansion and rehabilitation of wastewater collection and treatment facilities
such as: (i) laterals; (ii) trunk sewers; (iii) pump statons; (iv) primary,
secondary or advanced wastewater treatment plants; and (v) discharge outalls.
This infrastruchte component would also include engineering for the
preparation of detailed design documents and construction supervion.
14.  Institutional Suport for the WUs (US$13.5 mMion).  Under this
component, technical assistance would be provided to WUs which do not



-5-
comply with the eligibility criteria and, therefore, cannot be included within the
investment support to WUs component.  Techiical assistance under this
component would be onented to helping the WUs become ligible, and hence
would be limited to: (a) preparing master plans; (b) preparing Environmental
Impact Assessments (EIAs); and (c) implementing cetain institutional
development programs, with particular emphasis on commercial and financial
areas including tariffs, water metering and reduction of unaccounted-for-water
losses. Most of the funds for this component would be provided as grants.
15.  Project Costs and Filnancing. Total project cost is estimated at US$770
million. Financing for institutional development support for the federal agencies
(US$33.7 million) will be channelled through BANOBRAS. Financing for
investment support to Local Water Utilities (US$722.8 million) would be based
on a combination of Bank loan and government (federal and state) grant funds
also channelled through BANOBRAS. While the precise proportion of
government grant funds will depend on the level of income and population of
the states and municipalities in which the WUs are located, a provisional
Mdicative estimate has been made. On average, the following proportions are
expected: loans from BANOBRAS, 45 %; internal cash generation from the
WUs, 15%; federal grnts, 25%; and state grants 15%. The institutional
support to the local WUs (US$ 13.5 million) will be financed by state and
federal grants (from 70% to 100%) with the difference being linanced under the
proposed loan as a loan from BANOBRAS. All imvestments financed by loans
are expected to be recovered through water and sewage fees and additional
interal cash generation due to increased effliciency of the WUs. Estimated
project costs and the proposed financing plan are provided in Schedule A.
16.   Up to 10% of the total loan would be eligible for retoacive financing
to ensure continuity of technical assistance and infrastructure investments as all
funds from the ongoing water supply operation have been committed. All
retroactive financing would be in accordance with Bank guidelines and would
apply to expenditures incurred after July 7, 1993.
17.  Project bnplementation. The Borrower and executing agency for the
proposed project would be BANOBRAS, which will be reonsible for overall
project execution. CNA, as the government agency responsible for the water
sector, will serve as the technical agent. The WUs will be the main executors
of the subprojects approved for financing under the proposed loan. The smte
governments will allocate the grants to the selected subprojects. CNA will be
responsible for ensuring that a judgement on the preliminary ElAs prepared for
subprojects under consideration is issued and that additional ations, as required
in connection with the subprojects (such as the need to issue an Environmental
Impact Statement), are taken.
18.   BANOBRAS, in order to better coordinate, supevise, and monitor all
water and sanitation projits that it finances, would appoint a Task Manager,
who would work within the newly created Executive Coordinating Unit (ECU),
using the resources of the existing division in charge of Financing Potable Water
and Sewerage Projects. Operating regulations have been designed to guide



-6 -
project implementation and monitoring. Support to the federal agencies would
be implemented by the respective federal agencies. Master plans would be the
responsibility of the WUs. CNA would be available for advice. Each
subproject would have its own financing, cost recovery, and implementation
scheme in accordance with agreed criteria. Performance indicators for the
sector were developed during appraisal. In addition, performance indicators
would be developed for each WU in their respective master plans. These
performance indicators will be monitored by CNA, BANOBRAS, and by
Bank/Government missions in the context of semi-annual and mid-term reviews.
19.   Project Sustainablilty. By strengthening the sectoral framework for
water resources management as well as the local institutions that deliver water
and sanitation services, the project is expected to contribute to a sustainable
institutional development process. This is reinforced at the local level by
requiring a minimum internal cash generation as part of the financing plan of
the WUJs, in addition to a minimum rate of return of 12% for each subproject.
20.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. Bank involvement
in the water supply and sanitation sector started in 1973 with the approval of the
first water supply loan. To date, six loans have been made amounting to about
US$675 million. The only ongoing project in this sector, (Loan 3271-ME,
US$300 million, 01/18/1991) is 95% disbursed and 100% committed. It is
expected that this project will be completed and closed by mid 1994, two years
ahead of schedule.
21.  The key lessons learned from the previous operations in Mexico, which
have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project, may be
summarized as follows: (a) the preferability of having one agency take the
leadership role; (b) the importance of subproject design and preparation; (c) the
desirability of decentralized decision making and greater participation of
beneficianres; (d) the need to have adequate supervision from BANOBRAS and
CNA; (e) the need to give the beneficiaries a real sense of ownership of the
project; and (f) the importance of coordination among the various agencies.
22.   Actions Agreed. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following main conditions: (a) eligibility criteria for the participating
autonomous WUs and onlending conditions; (b) indicators to measure project
implementation and impact; (c) reporting schedule and semi-annual reviews; (d)
timing of the project mid-term review; (e) a methodology regarding the
procedure to verify and implement the EIA process; (f) schedules for reporting,
with quantitative indicators including status of river basin studies and the status
of the national targets to increase the volume of treated wastewater; and (g)
annual reviews of the national program for training in the sector.
23.   Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that: (a) the Guarantor and
BANOBRAS shall provide the Bank an executed contract, satisfactory to the
Bank, descrbing the Guarantor/BANOBRAS transfers and relending procedures;
and (b) BANOBRAS shall have (i) the MIS fully operetional; and the Executive
Coordinating Unit (ECU) legally established.



-7 -
24.   Environmental Aspecs. The proposed project, which is a category B
project, would help improve evironmental conditions in the prqect areas by
reducing water pollution and minimizing the danger of water-related diseases.
It would assist Mexico in improving its water pollution control policies by
providing CNA with added capacity to develop pollution oontrol strategies, to
monitor water quality and to enforce environmental regulations. Each WU's
master plan would contain a preliminary E1A for all the aetivities proposed.
Prior to funding, individual investments would be recorded in the annual
Memorandum of Understanding and would have ELAs in accordance with
existing SEDESOL guidelines. The current legislation also allows for the
possibility of dispensing with an EIA by submitting a prior notice demonstrating
that the activity in question will not cause negative environmental impacts, or
exceed the limits and standards defined by technical regulations.
25.  Intenational waterways. Mexico shares intenaional waterways with
Belize, Guatemala and the United States. Interational waterays as defined in
OD 7.50 include not only rivers or other bodies of waters that form a boundary
between countries but also rivers or bodies of surface waters that flow through
two or more states and tributaries or other bodies of surface water that are a
part or a component of any such waterways. The proposed project is national
in scope and under its investment component local improvements in water
supply treatment and sanitation may be financed through subloans in areas that
could affect Mexico's international waterways. While both the Mexican
authorities and the Bank belies -at, because of the nature of the project, these
improvements would only have beneficial effects, if any, on other riparians, it
is too early to determine the possible impacts on neighboring countries until the
actual imvestments have been identified and appraised. After discussion of this
matter with Mexico, and at the request of Mexico, it was agreed that the Bank
would inform the neighboring countries of the proposed project, which was
done.
26.   Official communications from each of the three neighboring counties
have been received. In light of the procedures for selection and appl of
subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan, as well as the expected
benefcial effects of such subprojects on the affected waterways, Belize
expressed its full support for the project. The United States encouraged the
Bank to continue with the preparation of the project and stated that it would
review the project at the time of its presentation to the Exeutive Directors.
Guatemala said it would assure itself dtrough its bilatl treaty arrangements
with Mexico that the interests of both Mexico and Guatmala will be protcted
with respect to subprojects. In light of these statements, no special provisions
for subprojects that may affect teational  ter*ays with Belize, Guatemala
and the United States have been included in the project documents. (Copies of
the responses of Belize, Guatemala and the United States are attached as Annex
1,.
27.   Progam Objective Category. By imprving the operions of water
utilities at the local level, the project is expected to etend coverage of basic



-8 -
water supply and sanitation services to the poorer areas of the communities that
these utilities serve. As a result, the quality of life in these poorer areas should
improve substantially. The project is also aimed at encouraging private sector
participation by establishing the appropriate legal and technical framework
within which to attract private investment.
28.   ProJect Benefits. Improved water quality can be expected to contribute
to the control of cholera and significant reductions in other gastro-intestinal
diseases, which are especially prevalent in the poorer areas of Mexico. The
project is expected to uirectly benefit about 10 million people. In addition, the
project would: contribute to the ratonalization of sector investments; promote
water conservation through the implementation of more rational tariffs and the
reduction of unaccounted-for-water losses; stimulate intemal sector savings;
reduce the sector's dependence on Government funding; promote the adoption
of cost-effecdve policies to achieve environmental improvements; and encourage
investment in human resources in the environment field.
29.   Project Risks. The technology involved in the proposed investments and
the required technical assistance do not pose any unusual risks. However,
continued ieform of sector policies and institutions is a complex undertaking
which is subject to various political and other changes. Although major reform
measures were taken under Loan 3271-ME, the following risks remain: (a)
inadequate counterpart funds due to Government delays in distributing its
revenue-sharing contribution to the states and municipalities; (b) failure to give
the beneficiaries a real sense of project ownership due to pressures from a more
politically powerful CNA and SEDESOL; and (c) lack of coordination between
other federal programs, such as SOLIDARIDAD, dtt may introduce policy
changes affecting overall implementation of sector policies agreed to in the
context of the project. The frm commitment shown by Government in the
eparation of this project and its track record in this and other sectors gives
confidence that whatever problems that arise in implementation can be
overcome.The curent design of the proposed project, including the agreements
reached with the Government, also reduces these risks to a minimum, acceptable
level.
30.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that its Executive
Directors approve it.
