2.  In the procurement of works in accordance with this Part A, bidding
documents prepared by the Guarantor, if consistent with the Guidelines and
otherwise satisfactory to the Bank, shall be used until the Bank issues
relevant standard bidding documents for Mexico acceptable to the Guarantor.
At the time of such issuance and thereafter, only said relevant standard
bidding documents (with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have
agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project) shall be used.
3.  In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A, the relevant
standard bidding documents issued by the Bank as modified by agreement
between the Guarantor and the Bank dated December 8, 1993 shall be used,
with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be
necessary for the purposes of the Project provided, however, that for any
such procurement for which the invitation to bid ("convocatoria") is dated
prior to February 1, 1994, standard bidding documents based on the so-called
"Cuernavaca Documents" with such changes as may be agreed by the Bank and
the Guarantor for each contract shall be used.

packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $350,000 or more each, and
contracts for civil works shall be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost
the equivalent of $10,000,000 or more each.

(d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment
out of the Special Account in respect of such contract.
    (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding

in carrying out the Project, the Borrower, the Guarantor or the Operating
Agencies shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms

consultants shall be selected in accordance with principles and procedures
satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing

For complex, time-based assignments, such consultants shall be employed
under contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants'
services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall have been
agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract documents have been
Page  15
issued by the Bank, other standard forms agreed with the Bank shall be used.
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the

                    and Terms and Conditions of Subloans
1.  (a)   The amortization period for each Subloan shall not exceed fifteen
years, with a maximum grace period of three years.
    (b)   Subloans shall be denominated and repayable in pesos.  The
interest rate on such Subloans shall be variable and no less than the sum
of (i) the CETES Rate or CPP, whichever is higher at the time such sum is
made, plus (ii) two percentage points.
    (c)   Costs for Subprojects shall, as set forth elsewhere in paragraph
1 of this Schedule, be covered by a combination of: (i) Subloans; (ii)
grants from the Guarantor; (iii) grants from the government of the state in
which the relevant Operating Agency operates; and (iv) the Operating
Agency's own internal cash generation from its operations (which in no case
may include Operating Agency borrowings of any sort).
    (d)   The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) below notwithstanding,
with respect to municipalities with a high Marginality Index, the funds mix
established in the Manual Unico de Operacion of the Guarantor's Programa
Nacional de Solidaridad shall prevail in case of inconsistency with the
provisions of said paragraphs.
    (e)   With regard to a water supply and sewerage infrastructure
component of a Subproject for a municipality with a population of under
80,000 inhabitants:
                (i)   if such municipality has a medium Marginality Index,
                      the Operating Agency shall provide an average (as
                      defined below) of fifteen percent (15%) of the costs
                      of such Subproject component from its own internal
                      cash generation from its operations during 1994 and
                      such other percentage in subsequent years as may be
                      agreed with the Bank. Such Subproject component costs
                      not covered by such internal cash generation shall be
                      covered up to a maximum of sixty percent (60%) by
                      Guarantor and state grants, with the remainder to be
                      covered by a Subloan;
               (ii)   if such municipality has a low Marginality Index, the
                      Operating Agency shall provide an average (as defined
                      below) of fifteen percent (15%) of the costs of such
                      Subproject component from its own internal cash
                      generation from its operations during 1994 and such
                      other percentage in subsequent years as may be agreed
                      with the Bank. Such Subproject component costs not
                      covered by such internal cash generation shall be
                      covered up to a maximum of forty percent (40%) by

                      covered by a Subloan; and
Page  16
              (iii)   if such municipality has a high Marginality Index, no
                      Subloan Agreement shall be entered into with an
                      Operating Agency serving such municipality. In such
                      a case, the Operating Agency shall provide an average
                      (as defined below) of twenty percent (20%) of the
                      costs of such Subproject component from its own
                      resources or resources of beneficiaries. Such
                      Subproject component costs not so covered shall be
                      covered by Guarantor and state grants.
    (f)   With regard to a wastewater treatment component of a Subproject
in a municipality with a population of under 80,000 inhabitants, the funding
proportion for such component shall be: (i) if a medium Marginality Index
applies, an average (as defined below) of ten percent (10%) of total
component costs to be covered by Operating Agency internal cash generation
from its operations and maximum eighty percent (80%) of all other component
costs to be covered by Guarantor and state grants, with the remainder to be
covered by a Subloan; (ii) if a low Marginality Index applies, an average
(as defined below) of ten percent (10%) of total component costs to be

Agency's own resources or resources of beneficiaries with the remainder to
be covered by Guarantor and state grants.
    (g)   With regard to an institutional development component of a
Subproject for a municipality with a population of under 80,000 inhabitants,

Marginality Index applies, maximum eighty percent (80%) of all component
costs to be covered by Guarantor and state grants, with the remainder to be
covered by a Subloan; (ii) if a low Marginality Index applies, maximum
seventy percent (70%) of all component costs to be covered by Guarantor and
state grants, with the remainder to be covered by a Subloan; and (iii) if
a high Marginality Index applies, all component costs to be covered by
Guarantor and state grants.

remainder to be covered by internal cash generation and Subloans; (iii) for
a wastewater treatment component, one hundred percent (100%) of total
component costs to be covered by Subloans; and (iv) for an institutional
development component, up to one hundred percent (100%) of total component

Guadalajara (Jalisco), Monterrey (Nuevo Leon) and Mexico (Distrito Federal).
    (j)   For the purpose of paragraphs (e) and (f) above, "average" means
the average on a calendar year basis.
2.  No expenditures for goods, works or services required for a Subproject
shall be eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan unless:

Bank shall have approved the application referred to in paragraph 3 (a) of
this Schedule in respect of such Subloan; or
    (b)   the Subloan for such Subproject is a free-limit Subloan, in which
case no application to the Bank and no prior approval of the Bank is

in respect of such Subloan shall be kept by the Borrower for the Bank's
Page  17
information and ex post review. For the purposes of this Agreement, a
free-limit Subloan shall be a Subloan to an Operating Agency in an amount
which, when added to any other outstanding Subloan amounts to the same
Operating Agency, shall not exceed the sum of $10,000,000 equivalent.
3.  (a)   When presenting a Subloan to the Bank for approval, the Borrower

the Bank shall so request, such goods and the sites, works, plants and
construction included in the Subproject, the operation thereof, and any
relevant records and documents;
    (d)   require that: (i) the Operating Agency shall take out and maintain
with responsible insurers such insurance, against such risks and in such
amounts, as shall be consistent with sound business practice; and (ii)

installation, any indemnity thereunder to be made payable in a currency
freely usable by the Operating Agency to replace or repair such goods;
    (e)   obtain all such information as the Bank or the Borrower shall
reasonably request relating to the foregoing and to the administration,

to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, its operations
and financial condition, including records and separate accounts adequate
to reflect all resources and expenditures in respect of the Subproject;
    (b)   the Operating Agency shall: (i) have the records and accounts
referred to in paragraph 5 (a) of this Schedule and its financial statements
(balance sheets, statements of income and expenses and related statements)
for each fiscal year audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards and procedures, by independent and qualified auditors acceptable
to the Borrower; (ii) furnish to the Borrower as soon as available, but in

                                SCHEDULE 6

be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to
the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to

$30,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the
Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as
follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
    (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the
                Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
                specify.
          (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence
                required pursuant to para- graph 4 of this Schedule for the
                payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is
Page  19
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank
                shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been
                shown by said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
    All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account
under the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was
made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account
in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
    Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment
or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account
shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c)
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.

                  Modifications of the General Conditions
1.  The last sentence of Section 3.02 is deleted.
2.  In Section 6.02, subparagraph (k) is relettered as subparagraph (l) and
a new subparagraph (k) is added to read:
          "(k) An extraordinary situation shall have arisen under which any
Page  20
    further withdrawals under the Loan would be inconsistent with the
    provisions of Article III, Section 3 of the Bank's Articles of
    Agreement."
3.  The words "the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor,
terminate the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals with respect to such
amount. Upon the giving of such notice, such amount of the Loan shall be
cancelled" set forth at the end of Section 6.03 are deleted and the
following is substituted therefor: "or (f) by the date specified in
paragraph 3 (b) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement, the Bank shall, in
respect of any portion of the Loan: (i) have received no applications
permitted under paragraph 2 (a) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement; or (ii)
have denied any such applications, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower
and the Guarantor, terminate the right of the Borrower to submit such
applications or to make withdrawals from the Loan Account, as the case may
be, with respect to such amount or portion of the Loan. Upon the giving of
such notice, such amount or portion of the Loan shall be cancelled.".\1a
