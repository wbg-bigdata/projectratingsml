Il/ INTRODUCI1ON
One of the outstanding objectives of the Hungarian energy policy approved by
the National Assembly is the diversification of the energy sources, and - in
view oI wire energy - the extension of the connections. Therefore, in 1991, the
Government made a decision, that the Hungarian energy system joins UCPTE,
the association of the Western-European electric energy systems, which are on
a higher technical level and which may guarantee a more safe electric energy
supply for Hungary.
One of the basic conditions of joining UCPTE is, that the Hungarian electric
energ system should have a quick-action, so-called secondary control reserve
capacities of a size determined by UCPTE recommendations. These reserve
capacities should be equivalent at least to the greatest capacity of the electric
energy production unit of the system. In the Hungarian electric energy system
the greatest capacity production units are the 460 MW blocs of the Nuclear
Power Plant of Paks, thus the secondary control reserve capacity should be of
460 MW.
In the recent years, the Hungafian Power Companies Ltd. (MVM Ri.) has
performed comprehensive investigations for analyzing the most purposeful
possibilities of ensuring the required reserve capacity. Based on the analysis.
MVM has come to the conclusion, that 200 MW of the required reserve
capacity should be ensured by establishing quick-start gas turbine power
plants.

1/2 BACKGROUND
I12.1 Alternatives of the location of the facility, reasons
Starting from the role of the secondary control power plants played in the
electric energy system, MVM has come to the conclusion, that it would be
purposeful to install the power plants serving for this purpose at the significant
connection points of the electiic energy system, at the great substations of the
network. In spring 1994 investigations have been carried out for the possible
locations. Four substations have been found as optimal locations for
installation: the substation of the Nuclear Power Plant of Paks, the substation
of Lit6r. the substation of Martonvasar and the substation of Saj6sz6ged.
In autumn 1994 MVM invited ETV-ER6TERV Rt. Power Engineering and
Contractor Co. to prepare a detailed feasibility study and a preliminary
environmental impact study for the above four locations. When evaluating the
conceptual plans it has become clear, that at the substation of Martonvasar the
connection of the power plant to the network could only be done at much
higher costs with respect to the other sites, therefore further investigations
have been stopped by MVM for this location.
For the locations of the Nuclear Power Plant of Paks, of Liter and Sajoszoged
the detailed feasibility studies and the preliminary environmental impact
studies have been completed by the beginning of 1995.
Based on these documentations. in May 1995, MVM Rt. started the licensing
procedure of the facilities.

In its decision No. 3935-3/1995, the Environmental Inspectorate of Northem
Hungary prescribed to prepare a detailed environmental impact study for the
secondary reserve gas turbine power plant to be established at the substation of
Saj6szoged.
In its decision No. 47/1995, the Hungarian Energy Office has granted a
preliminary building permit for the secondary reserve power plant of
Saj6szoged.
In January and February 1996, in possession of the preliminary building permit
issued by the Hungarian Energy Office, in cooperation with ESBI-ETV
Engineering Services Co. Ltd., MVM Rt. organized a public hearing in
harnony with Govermment Decree No. 146/1992.(XI.4.). On April 22, 1996 a
decision has been issued by the inter-departmental committee in connection
with the information of the public, according to § 3 of the above said
Government Decree.
i/2.2 The iuvestigated technologiral versions, their evaluation
A secondary reserve function can be ensured by the water reservoir power
plants or the quick-starTi open-cycle gas turbine power plants.
The advantages of the water reservoir power plant are: quick starting, the
transformation of the cheaper night electric energy to a day-time peak energy,
the disadvantages are: the high specific investment cost and the long building
time. It would be impossible to build a water reservoir power plant by the time
of the final joining to the UCPTE system - by the end of 1997 -, consequently,
the only altemative is the installation of quick-start gas turbines.

ETV-EROTERV RL.
fER O TE                                       Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
Based on the evaluation of 12 informal proposals for gas turbines, which have
been received during the past 2 years, we have drawn the general technical
consequences, namely, that the requirements of quick starting (rated output to
be achieved in max. 10 minutes) are primarily met by the acroderivative gas
turbines, which are driving gears of airplanes transformed for industrial
purposes.
The most applicable types are LM 6000 (GE) and TRENT (Rolls-Royce) gas
turbines, see installation plan I/23.-2. These gas turbines comply with the
environmental requirements, and - thanks to their layout characteristics
(container-type structure) - they can be installed easily, quicldy and efficiently.
When evaluating the proposals, the environmental aspects shall fully be taken
into consideration. The selection of the final type and the determination of the
number of the units shall be based on the results of an international
competition, taking also into consideration the environmental aspects.
Since 100 ±20 MW has been determined in the preliminary building pennit of
the Hungarian Energy Office as the capacity of the power plant, therefore.
when investigating the environmental impacts, 120 MW maximum capacity
and a two-bloc structure shall be taken into consideration, however, in some
cases, the single-bloc structure shall also be investigated.

1/3. GEOGRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT, LANDSCAPE
The geographical environment of the projected power plant is located mainly
on the talus of Sajo-Hernad (small region No. 1.9.32 in the cadaster of the
small regions of Hungary), but it also touches the area of small regions
Borsodi-flood plain (1.7.12) and Taktakoz (1.7.11).
The average altitude of the above regions is about 100 m BSL, they are a talus
plain and an absolute plain. The original surface has been transformed by the
erosion of the rivers into hillfoot ridges of 5 m/sq.km average relief, articulated
by low ridges between the valleys, thus the topography is characterized by
slopes. The flood plain area of Saj6 and Saj6-Hernmd is a wavy resp. slightly
wavy plain of a small relative relief Due to slight slopes the area is
characterized by bad run off and dominated by large plains. The only variety in
the topography of the area are the abandoned river bed generations indicating
the former flow direction of Tisza, Saj6-Hemad and Hej6 rivers.
The settlements in the investigated area are: Saj6szoged, Nagycs6cs, Girincs,
Hajfbaba, Saj66rs, Kiscsecs, Szakild, Muhi, K6r6m, Nemesbikk and
Tiszauijvaros.The above are mostly agricultural settlements. but there are also
industrial -plants in the region (Tiszafijviros). The most important traffic road
is main road No. 35.
More than 2/3rd of the area is ploughland. The lower flood plain of Saj6 is
bordered by the remnants of the once contiguous soft-wood woodlands. At the
higher areas there are also oak-ash gallery-forests in patches. The forests
mainly consist of young and mixed-age soft- and hard-wood species. In the
area there are large patches of disturbed grasses and pastures.

According to preliminary investigations and data collection, in the region of
the projected power plant only the Doy castle of Girincs enjoys local
protection, due to the trees in the park of the castle.
Near the site the following areas are under protection (see Fig. MA3.-1):
-    to N-E from the site of the projected power plant, at a distance of
approx. 8 kIn, at the border of Kesznyet the Landscape Protection
Region of Kesznyet
-    to N-E from the site, at a distance of approx. 15 kan: the Tiszadob flood

1/4 CLIMATIC CONDMONS OF THE SITE
For characterizing the climatic conditions of tfie site we have used the
temperature, air humidity and precipitation measuring data of the civil
meteorological stations of Tisza(zjvhfros, Miskolc and Nyiregyhbza, measured
during 30, resp. 60 years with a firquency of 8 times/tday, as well as the hourly
data of wind and sunshine measurements of the meteorological stations of
Miskolc and Nyiregyhaza, measured during 35 years.
The climate of the area of Saj6sz6ged is moderately warm and rather dry with
respect to the conditions characteristic to the country. The summer is colder
than in the southern, resp. south-eastem part of the country, however, in mid-
summer subtropical heat also may occur. Winter temperatures are very
capricious, cold and dry periods change frequently to mild and rainy periods.
The mean annual tenrperatre is about 9.6°C.

In the region the mean annual temperature is about 9.6°C (the mean annual
temperature in the country is 9.7°C). The warmest month is July (the mean
temperatre in July is 20.4°C), the coldest one is Januay (-2.6°C).
The annual temperature is characterized by the great fluctuation in the mean
temperatue value, i.e. the difference in the mean temperature of the warmest
and the coldest month. In case of Saj6szoged this value is about 23°C, which
means a great fluctuation.
PreciRitation
The climai. - of Saj6szbged is drier than the average. It is well shown in Table
X/4.-2 that in the area of Saj6sz6ged the precipitation is lower than the average
value in the country.

The annual precipitation in the area is about 538 mm (the mean value in the
country is 600 mm). A part of winter precipitation is snow, but, in comparison
with the total amount of winter precipitation, snow does not exceed 50-60% of
the total amount.
The most rainy month is June, the mean precipitation in this month is 79 mm,
the secondary maximum is in July (63 mm).  The lowest amount of
precipitation appears in January (30 mm). The highest amount of precipitation
in the beginning of summer can be attributed to the more intensive cyclone
activity (the summer monsoon occurring in the second half of May, resp. in
June), and to the local geographical and hydrological conditions (the
inunediate vicinity of the Saj6 river, and the affect of the frequently occurring
floods in spring - up to the end of May).
In the region of Saj6szbged the distribution of precipitation is very uneven, dry
periods without rainfall occur very often, mainly in the summer period. The
amount of precipitation shows great fluctuations not only during the year, but
also year by year.
The distribution of rainy days is different from that of the amounts of
precipitation, namely the highest number of rainy days are in December (14),
then in May, June and November (13-13-13).
From spring up to autumn storms occur frequently, sometimes without rainfall,
but mostly with abundant, shower-like rain, cloud-burst and hail. The stormy
period lasts from April to October, the main season is from May to July, but it
may occur in other seasons, too. In Hungary, the average number of stormy
days is 20-30. In the region of Saj6sz6ged, in the flood plmin of the Saj6 river
extremely high number of storms can be expected due to frequent floods, in
some years the number of stomns may exceed the average even by 50-70%.

Wind
The region of Saj6szoged belongs to the meteorological zones of strong air
current. According to a medium annual wind velocity value, the air currents
are generally stronger between December and March, while between August
and October they are weaker. The most windy month is April, the most calm is
September. According to the average monthly wind velocity data, higher wind
velocities appear in late spring and in the summer, respectively in winter.
In the region of Saj6szoged, in an annual review the most frequent wind
direction is north (annual fiequency is 15.1%/6), the second most frequent wind
direction is north-east (10.7% of the total wind occurrences), then south
(10.1%). The frequency of N-NE and N winds varies significantly by seasons,
but they are dominating during the whole year. The relative frequency of
synoptic wind velocities by seasons is shown in Table I/4.-3.
In spring the dominating wind direction is norti (frequency: 12.5%), the
second dominating wind direction is north-east (10.4%). Strong winds (11-14
m:s) most frequently blow from north, fresh winds (7-10 m/s) also blow from
north in the majority of cases.
In summer the dominating wind direction is north (frequency: 14.3%), the
second dominating wind direction is north-east. Strong winds blow from
north/north-east, east/north-east and north, the dominating wind direction of
fresh winds is north.

In autumn the dominating wind direction remains north (9.3%), the second
dominating wind direction is north-east and south (both with the same
frequency: 8.9-8.9%), then follow the winds of south-westm direction (8.6%).
Strong winds blow from northem, north-eastern, western, north-western and
northern direction with the same frequency, in case of fresh winds the
dominating direction is north.
In winter the dominating wind direction turns into south-west (frequency:
10.4%), the second dominating wind direction is north-east (9.9%), then north
and north-east. Stormy winds blow from north and north-east. Strong winds,
in the majority of cases, blow from north, north-east Fresh winds mostly blow
from north and north/north-east.
In the region there is no meteorological station where the vertical temperature
gradient is examined (there are only 13 such meteorological stations in the
country). Therefore, the average occurrence frequencies in the wind velocity
and stability categories are same as the national average frequencies in Table

1/S GEOLOGICAL, HYDROGEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE
ENVIRONMENT
1/5.1 Geological conditions
Saj6szoged is located on the conmmon talus of the Saj6 and Hernad rivers. The
general geological structure of the investigated area is shown by the successive
layers of Fig. I/5.1.-i. The forrn of the basin bed of the region looks like a
"chess-table". Its materials are: sedimentary rocks and metamorphological
slates.
In the Austrian Orogenic period the area have significantly sunk along the
dislocation belt formed in northern direction from the crystalline substratum.
and have given its place to the sea protruding from the north-eastern
Carpathian Mountains. Here, by fast and rhythmic sedimentation, thick (over
1000 m) magmatic formations have accumulated, which have an Orogenic
character, and which belong to the diabase group, which are in connection with
the Cretaceous-Paleogenic flysch and with the deep furrows of the dislocation
belt. Then formations of a character of Eocene and Oligocene flysch. and tuff,
tufite, and gray-red clay are shown in the successive layers. The Miocene
formations settled on the Oligocene formations are of rhyolite tuff in a
thickness of 400-500 m. The composure is generally without layers or cross-
layered, which means that they are dry or alluvial accumulations. The tuff is
covered by lower Pannonian clay. clay marl, sand and sand stone, with thin
brown coal-clay stripes at some places. The lower Pannonian, slightly salty sea
sediments are of a thickness of about 1000 m along the Tisza river, and they
become thinner in eastern direction. The lower Pannonian formations are
covered by late Pannonian freshwater-, lake- or marshy sediments (sand, clay,
clay marl). In this composure several aquitard sand layers have formed. In the
surface of the late Pamnonian sediments - possibly in conmection with the
Romanian and the following younger Orogenic movements - a number of
shallower-deeper basins bave fonned, which have been filled with alluvial
deposits and unified with the separating hilltops by the end of the Pleistocene
epoch.

The coarse alluvial deposits filling the quickly sinking area of the Lowland is
called the talus of the Saj6-Hernad rivers in the literature. The thickness of the
Quaternary layers varies between 40 and 350 m, it is demonstrated by the
geological section shown in Fig. I/5.1.-2. The largest part of this region is the
area surrounded by settlements Tiszadob-Em6d-Mez6keresztes-Egyek-
Balmazijvaros-Tiszadob. The whole talus - according to literature - has a
surface of 1,250 sq.kmn. Its average thickness is 100 mn The greatest thickness
is 300 m at Polgar, in Tiszaujvaros it is 200 m according to the data of the
local thermal water well. The talus in the region has been investigated up to a
depth of 110 I, we have the data of the successive layers of this depth.
The Tisza river - according to the data of the literature - appeared in the
ancient Holocene epoch, i.e. approx. 15-20 thousand years ago (at the very end
of the formation of the gravel bench) and disposed its drift during floods. Its
bed has cut into the gravel bench where the water disposed fine-grain silty
sand flour. The river bed follows the direction of the nearby SW-NE frrow.
The structure of the successive layers of deposits is like a sandwich. In the
research borings we can find all grain fractures, from coarse gravel to alluvial
clay. In many cases, the specific layers of the same soil-physical
characteristics may protrude even within a distance of 50-100 m. The shallow
geological structure of the Tisza-Saj6 delta is shown in Fig. IIS.1.-3.
In the area of the Lowland, at the end of the Pleistocene epoch significant
quick sand and loess formation had taken place, which had an influence on the
whole area. However, a part of the alluvial sand had transformed into quick
sand had covered large areas. The gravel, sand and flood plain clay of deeper
basins repeat themselves rhythmically, according to the sinking periods and
the climatic cycles influencing ablation and filling.

Contractor Co.
From the data of the shallow research borings drilled in the area of
Tiszaujvaros, close to Sajoszoged, we can get a clear picture on the structure
of the soil layer and the shallow layers and their granulometric composition.
The mean characteristic values of the granulometric composition are shown in
Fig. I/5.1. 4.
1/5.2 Hydrogeological conditions
From the point of view of water supply, the most important water resource of
the area is the talus of the Saj6 river. The water volume stored in the full
composure of the talus can be considered as a uniformn water system, one
single water mass, which means the water resource of the talus at any tapping
point (at any level ). The total volume of water contained in the gravel bench is
estimated 5-6 cu.hn. The maximum water capacity which can be extracted
without disturbing the static balance is 500,000 cu.m/day.
The water resource of the talus has a supply from various sources. The most
important supply is by precipitation. Groundwater which is in direct
connection with the precipitation is close to the surface. According to the
many years' data of the groundwater monitoring wells in Sajoars and
Sajoszoged (VITUKI data base) the groundwater level is at 4-5 m under the
ground level. Groundwater level depends mainly on the amount of
precipitation, its annual periods follow the annual periods of precipitation, with
an adequate delay.
The Tisza river which crosses the talus supplies with water the gravel bench
primarily at high stages, as it is shown by the stage records dispiayed in Fig.
1/5.2-1. At low stages the Tisza river has a tapping impact on the gravel bench.
The supply value of tie Tisza river, based on several measuring result series, is
100-110 Vs/km.
In the form of deep water flows, the water resource of the gravel bench also
has a supply from the Build mountain and the Taktakoz and Szerencs hill
country. Thus, it becomes clear, that deep waters flow towards the Tisza
valley.

The same holds for the groundwater flow, since groundwater cannot be
separated in the gravel bench. The regional flow directions of groundwater are
shown by Fig. I/5.2.-2. In the environment of the project groundwater flow
(and also the contamination) has a northerr!south-easten direction. However,
flow conditions are significantly influenced by the cunrent stage of the rivers
and also by precipitation.

I/7.1 Status of waters
I1/7.1.1 Subsurface waters
The data of groundwater monitoring well No. 593 of VITUKI. located in
Sajoszoged, are the following:
Altitude:                    96.19 ASL
Annual low water (KV):       92.79 ASL
Annual high water (NV):      95.71 ASL
Annual medium water (KOV):  94.01 ASL
Highest water (LVN):         95.75 ASL (March 1966)
Lowest water (LKV):          92.05 ASL (September 1974)
High water is characteristic to May-June, while low water is characteristic to
December-January, the annual water level fluctuation is 1.5 m on the average.
Fig. I/7.1.1.-4 shows the annual water level data of the above mentioned
VITUKI well No. 593 and 4_TIF0 wells (Tiszai'jvaros) (VITUKI data base).
During the exploration of the contamination in the area of TVK Rt. several
wells were drilled, in which groundwater levels were measured. The
measuring results show, that groundwater has an expanded surface, i.e. the
water level settles in the clayey cover layer. Water level measurements based
on the above measuring results show, that within the regional NW-SE flows
there are some local deviations, but these change flow conditions only in some
10 resp. 100 m size areas.

The quality of the subsurface waters in the area are characterized by a
relatively low pH value and high lime-aggressive carbon-dioxide contents.
Their manganese contents is over the limit value specified by the standard
specifications, their iron contents is about the permissible limit value.
The quality of subsurface waters in the immediate vicinity of the projected
power plant shall be dealt with again in section 1/7.2, when we present the
results of soil investigations.
I/7.1.2 Surface waters
In the vicin!tv of the projected power plant there are no surface waters,
however, tne area belongs to the region endangered by the floods of the Sajo
and Tisza rivers. The location of the flood plains is shown in Fig. 1I7.1.2.-4.
The section of che Tisza river shown in the figure is 62 kn long, it has a water
supply only from the right side: from the Saj6 and Hejo rivers, from the Rig6si
main canal and the Sulymosi main canal. The left side of the small region is in
contact with the water resource of Kiraly-brook and Als6selypes-brook which
join the Hortobagy-Beretty6 rivers. The area is dry, with few run off. Fishing
lakes and irrigation canals can also be found within the boundaries of the area.
On both sides of the Tisza river flood protection dams were built as a part of
the river control. Approx. 55-65% of the area fall under flood level.
The foreshore of Tisza has been built in a width of 1-4 kan along the river in
order to drain floods. The relevant hydrological data are shown in Table
117.1.2.

The length of canals draining inland waters is approx. 230 km, eight pump
plants pump their water into the Tisza when flood comes. The foreshore of
Tisza is everywhere separated by dams. The small region has 13 lakes. 9 of
them are backwaters of the Tisza with a total water surface of 128 ha. two of
them are natural lakes with a total surface water of 3.4 ha. and there are two
fishing lakes at Tiszakeszi and Tiszafiired (48 and 75 ha).
In the Taktak6z there arc no communal drinking water wells. The highest
water consumption is in Tiszau3jvaros, shore-filtered drinking water is
produced in 12 water works. In this area the water resources are endangered by
s ,rface contamination. With regard to the future water use, the area of the
Tisza-SaJ6 junction has a regional importance (shore filtering, groundwater),
since this area has only a partial protection against contamination. due to it
geological structure.
Quality of the surface waters
In the region of the investigated area, the water quality of the Tisza river is
characterized by the data of the sampling place in the Tisza-Polgar section
(498.5 river kmn) of the official measuring network. The water quality at the
sampling place is detennined partly by the river section over the sampling
place, and partly by the water quality of the Saj6 river. In our opinion and
according to experience, the right solution for the problem is. when we
compare the measuring results of the above mentioned Tisza river section with
those of the Saj6-Kesznyeten river section (10.4 river km).
The measuring results of 1994 together with the standard water quality classes
(Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 12749) are show in Tables inl.1.2.-2
and I17.1.2.-3 (VITUKI data base).

Based on the comprehensive qualification of the groups of components the
difference in the water quality between the Tisza-Polgar and Saj6-Kesznyeten
river sections becc;ne: evident. The water quality of the Saj6 river shows
worst results in all respects than that than of the Tisza river. The changes
which have taken place during the past 20 years are demonstrated in a
graphical form in Figs. IJ7.1.2.-2, -3 and -4 based on the mean annual values
of KOld. the ammonium-ion and the total hardness, as well as on the basis of
the linear trend lines between the data of 1973-1982 and 1983-1992. The
improvement of the water quality taking place in the second period in the case
of all the three components is clearly shown in the figures.
The water of quality class V. of the SaJ6 river (which is contaminated with the
waste waters of Miskolc and the industrial plants located in the upper section
of the river, and due to the industrial contamination originating from Slovakia)
has an unfavorable impact on the water quality of the Tisza along this river
section.
I17.2 Soil investigations
In the area of the projected power plant soil and groundwater investigations
have been perforned in order to survey the current status and to asses the
possible existing contamination. When marking out the place of the borings,
we were striving for the comprehensive assessment of the area, taking into
consideration the potential contamination sources. The location of the borings
are shown in Fig. 1/6.-1. Based on the soil-mechanical investigation of the
borings it can be stated, that, in the borings medium- and coarse grain gravel is
found under a yellow clay and sand cover layer (see successive layers in Fig.
I17.2.-1).
Taking into consideration the materials as potential contamination carriers, the
soil and groundwater samples taken from the borings have been submitted to
the following analyses:
- groundwater analysis: metals, TPH (aliphatic hydrocarbons). general
water analysis
- soil analysis: TPH

Comparing the measuring results with the relevant limit values it can be stated,
that, with respect the general chemical parameter of the groundwater, only the
manganese concentration exceeds the permissible limit value for drinking
water, which is characteristic to the subsurface waters of the region.
The analytical results of the toxic metals, together with the relevant limit
values are shown in Table 1/7.2.-2.

Based on the analytical results it can be stated, that the majority of heavy
metals is not detectable in the groundwater samples, only some of them appear
in traces, but their concentration never exceeds the permissible value specified
in the relevant standard specifications, and thus the groundwater can be
considered clean.
For reasons due to the technology applied in the existing transformer plant
close to the area of the projected power plant, the soil possibly may
contaminate with oil derivatives. Table I/7.2.-3 shows the analytical results of
TPH in the groundwater. The analytical results have been compared with the
limit values specified in Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 450/1-1989
and with those of the Dutch "C" List (Dutch standard specifications for soil
contamination).
The values below the limit values of Dutch "A" List are not considered
contamination, while the concentrations exceeding the limit values of the
Dutch "C" List require direct measures: the earliest localization and
elimination of the contamination.

3.           424               100                50 (600)
Based on the measuring results it can be stated, that TPH concentrations in the
groundwater samples taken from borings No. 2 and 3. exceed both the
permissible values of the Hungarian standard specifications for drinking water
and the limit values of the Dutch "A" List, and the concentrations of the
samples of boring No. exceed event the limit values of the Dutch "C" List.
which require interaction.

We have performed separate TPH tests of the soil samples taken fiom the three
borings, from various depths. The analytical results are shown in Table I17.2.-
4. The analytical results have been compared with the values of the Dutch "C'
List, since there are no Hungarian standard specifications for soil
contamination.

From the measuring results it can be stated, that the soil can be considered
clean froin the point of view of aliphatic hydrocarbon (TPH) contamination.,
mineral oil derivatives can only be found in traces.

IJ73 Air quality
In this section we describe nitrogen-dioxide, sulfur-dioxide and flue dust
concentrations in the ambient air on the basis of the measurements of the
Institute of Borsod-Abaiij-Zempl6n County of ANTSZ (National Public Health
and Medical Officer's Service) in February-March 1996, and those of the
National Immission Measuring Network in the heating period of 1995 in
Tiszaujvaros.
The Institute has four air sampling device Type Letronik 8 in the following
places:
1. Regional Primary School, Saj6szoged, Ady E. u. 20.
2. Nursery Home of Hejobaba, Sz6chenyi u. 94.
3. Mayor's Office, Nemesbikk, Pet6fi u. 5.
4. Primary School of Hej6pap, Templom u. 1.
NO2 concentrations have been determined according to Hungarian Standard
Specifications MSZ-44-77, while S02 concentrations have been determined
according to Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ-/33-84.
In addition, in the area of the Regional Primary School of Sajoszoged a dust
sampling device was established in order to determine the concentration of the
large quantities of flue dust in the air. Saraples were taken once in a week. The
concentrations have been determined according to Hungarian Standard
Specifications MSZ 21454/2-83.
The measurements shall be continued by the Institute of B.A.Z. County of
ANTSZ in April and May.
Based on the preliminary agreement with the Environmental Inspectorate no
measurements of settling dust have been performed, since the projected power
plant shall have no significant emissions of solid particles.

The traverses and the residual gallery forests along the Saj6 river are potential
nesting places of birds of prey. The mapping of the nests and the breeding
species is underway together with other species which have a value from the
point of view of nature protection. We are also searching for the habitats in the
environment of the area which have a natural value.
117.5 Noise emission, current noise load of the area
The area surrounding the Saj6szoged sub-station is partly agricultural area,
partly industrial area, and partly residential and administrative area of low
building density. Main road No. 35 passes close to the area, the heavy traffic
of which makes the environment noisy in day time.
The permissible noise load values (noise inunission) originating from the
activities in the industrial plants (based on Attachment No. I to Decree No.
4/1984.(I.23.)EUM) are shown in Table I17.5.-1:

Consult-R Environment Development Partnership Company performed
measurements to determine the noise emission of the sub-station of
Saj6szoged. The measurements have been carried out on March 29, 1996
according to Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ-13-111-85 and MSZ
18150/1-83. The location of the measuring points are shown in Fig. 1/7.5.-1.
while the equivalent and noise emission sound pressure A- levels, the
calculated noise emission limit values and the ground noise values are shown
in Table 117.5.-2.
The noise emission sound pressure level A at the measuring points shall be
calculated with the following formula:
LAE=Aeq+KI +K2+K3
where:
LAeq is the equivalent sound pressure level A (dB)
K1   is the correction due to ground noise (dB)
K2   is the correction relating to impulse noises (dB)
K3   is the correction due to the narrow-band character of the noise (dB)
Reasons of the day/night noise emission limit values of the table:
In the vicinity of the two border lines of the Saj6szoged sub-station there are
no dwelling houscs to be protected, thus the noise load limit values should not
be complied with. On the measuring surfaces exposed at a distance of 10 m
from these two border lines (measuring surface III - measuring points 3101-
3107, measuring surface IV - measuring points 4101-4103), according to
Section 3.2 of Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ-13-111-85, the highest
value of the permissible noise emission limit value, i.e. 70 dB can be taken
into account as noise emission limit value.

In the direction of measuring surface I (measuring points 1101-1106), located
at a distance of d=10 m from the border line of the site, at a distance of 500
and 900 m, in he direction of measuring surface II (measuring points 2101 -
2105), located aw a distance of d=10 m from the border line of the site, at a
distance of 900 m there are dwelling houses to be protected. Thus the noise
emission limit value should be determined for these two measuring surfaces by
calculation in a way, that the noise emission limit values should be complied
with at a distance of 2 m from the facade of the buildings.
In case of dwelling houses to be protected, the noise emission limit value LKJH
(dB) should be calculated by the following formula:
LKJ-1=LTH+KN+KR+KD
where:
LTH  is the noise load (noise immission) limit value permissible in the
enviromment of the plant, dB, which can be determined for the various
parts of the environment of the sub-station taking into consideration the
function of the specific area as indicated in Table 1/7.5.-i. In our case
the function of the area to be taken into consideration is a residential
and administrative area of low building density.
KN   is the correction associatcd with the number of noise sources in the
enviromnent (in our case 0 dB)
KR   is the correction associated with the echo (in our case 0 dB)
KD   is the correction associated with noise propagation.
The correction associated with noise propagation KD, in case of measuring the
permissible noise emission limit value in dB, should be calculated by the
following formula (according to Section 3.3.4 of Hungarian Standard
Specifications MSZ-13-111-85 ):
KD = L*AE - L*AM
where:
L*AE - is the noise emission sound pressure level A measured at the critical
point of the measuring surface, dB
L*AM   the highest standard sound pressure level A in the same direction,
dB

The standard sound pressure level A can be calculated by the following
fonnula (according to Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 18150/1-83):
LAM - LAeq + K1 + K2 + K3
Since, according to the measurements, the noise was not of a narrow-band and
it had not a pulsed character, (the correction value of K2 and K3 was zero),
only the correction associated with ground noise (K1) had to be taken into
consideration.
When making the calculations for measuring surface I, KD (day) could not be
calculated (since the standard sound pressure level A could not be determined
due to the heavy traffic noise), we calculated with the night values. KD (night)
= 15 dB for the official quarters, and KD (night) = 13 dB for dwelling houses
of Baba street.
When making the calculations for measuring surface II - which is emitting
noise only towards the dwelling houses of Baba street -. KD (day) could not be
calculated (since the standard sound pressure level A could not be determined
due to the heavy traffic noise), we calculated with the night values. KD (night)
= 17 dB for dwelling houses.
With the calculated KD values the noise emission limit values for measuring
surface I are the following:
-    for the official quarters, in the day-time period: 75 dB(A) (the
--   permissible highest value is 70 dB(A)), during the night: 65 dB(A) on
measuring surface I exposed at a distance of 10 m from the border of
the site;
-    for dwelling houses of Baba street, in the day-time period: 63 dB(A),
during the night: 53 dB(A) on measuring surface I exposed at a distance
of I 0 m from the border of the site.

In such cases, when evaluating noise emissions, the stricter emission values
should be taken into consideration, i.e. 63 resp. 53 dB(A).
With the calculated KD values the noise emission limit values for measuring
surface II (dwelling houses of Baba street) exposed at a distance of 10 m from
the border of the site are, in the day-time period: 67 dB(A), during the night:
57 dB(A).
At the time of the investigations the noise emission of the sub-station was
approx. 80% of the maximum possible value. At this time all transformers and
5 cooling ventilators were operated. This can be considered normal working
conditions.
Comparing LAE noise emission sound pressure levels A determined at the
specific measuring points and the associated LKyj noise emission limit values.
we can state the following:
a)   In the day-time period (6 A.M. - 10 P.M.) the noise emitted by the sub-
station was lower than the permissible noise emission limit values at the
reference measuring points. The ground noise at the dwelling houses to
be protected was higher than the noise load of the sub-station, and thus
the measurements at these points could not be evaluated.
b)   In the night period the ground noise in the environment of the sub-
station was lower than that of the day-time period. On the measuring
surfaces exposed at the border lines of the site no excess values were
measured, the measured values were lower than the relevant noise
emission limit values (53, 57 resp. 70 dB(A) ). The noise load value at
the dwelling houses to be protected was max. 35 dB(A), below the limit
vzlue.

II/I   DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION OF THE PROJECTED GAS
TURBINE POWER PLANT
The gas turbine power plant is one of the technologies of electric energy production
processes which causes the least environmental pollution. During its operation only
airbome emissions and noise mean a pollution load to the environment.
The decisive technological element of the power plant is the gas turbine, which has
three main parts: the compressor, the combustion chamber and the turbine. The
compressor compresses the suction air to the required pressure for combustion. The
fuel is bumt by special burners. The turbine is rotated by the expansion of the high
pressure and high temperature flue gas discharging from the combustion chamber.
Electric energy is generated by a generator connected to the turbine.
The generating flue gas is discharged to the open air through a stack. The gas turbine is
mounted with a silencer both at the suction side and at the stack.
The operation scheme and the axonometric view of the gas turbine is shown in Fig.
11/1.-i. while the view and the axonometric picture of the container unit are shown in
Fig. Il/I.-2.
During combustion at a high temperature a part of the suction air and the nitrogen-
containing compounds of the fuel form nitrogen oxides. Their amount depends on the
temperature of the flame and on the time of residence of the gases in the combustion
chamber. The rate of nitrogen oxide generation can be kept on a low level by the
proper fonnation of the combustion chamber, respectively by water injection. The fuel
also contains some sulfur, in a very small quantity (max. 0.2%). During combustion
this forms sulfur dioxide. The carbon monoxide and soot emission of the newest types
of turbines is minimal.

In the attachment to this study, as a reference, we present the emission values
measured in the Kelenfdld Power Plant, one of the Hungarian gas turbine power plants.
In the present phase of planning neither the number of the required gas turbines has not
been determined, nor the type has not been selected. Based on the received informal
proposals we have selected one from among the possible types for demonstrating the
envirommental impacts of the projected power plant, which has the most unfavorable
characteristics from environmental point of view.
The power plant shall have 100-120 MW capacity generated by one or two gas
turbines. The most probable solution shall be a two-block facility, but the single-block
version cannot be excluded either. During the investigation of the environmental
impacts the most important difference between the two solutions is the analysis of the
air pollution, since there is a significant difference between them with respect to
immission.
During the investigation of the environmental impacts the highest possible capacity -
120 MW - shall be considered as a reference. The characteristics of the power plant
associated with this capacity (based on the received infornal proposals and the
preliminary discussions with the potential suppliers) have changed as follows with
-respect to the version presented in the preliminary environmental impact study:

II/2 CONSTRUCTION AND ASSEMBLY
II/2.1 Construction and assembly works
According to the soil mechanical tests under the topsoil there are the following soil
layers: max. 70 cm humic clay, 60-70 cm silty sand flour, 2.5 m clay, then sandy
gravel and gravely sand. The layers have settled nearly horizontally, and they are
characterized by stable settling conditions.
The excavated soil layer shall be stockpiled safely in order to be backfilled after the
construction. Approx. 3000 cu.m soil shall be excavated at the site of the engineering
structures, but this volume shall not be removed from the site, because it shall be used
for terrain correction after the construction.
The construction work associated with the main equipment is basically foundation
work, since the equipment is built from container units.
With regard to the soil mechanical characteristics, in order to prevent the propagation
of vibrations, the reinforced concrete foundation block shall be installed in a reinforced
concrete basin, it shall contact with the foundation through a 6 cm thick vibra cork or
another anti-vibration material layer.
The main transformer shall have a reinforced concrete block base placed in a
reinforced concrete oil catch basin having a closed stone bed. For the connections to
the network several reinforced concrete base structures shall be built.
For the storage of the fuel two 1000 cu.m above-ground cylindrical tanks shall be
installed in vertical position, provided with a fixed roof and an inner floating roof. The
tank shall have thermal insulation, an alumina sheet casing and a reinforced concrete
protective ring. Demi water shall be stored in two 300 cu.m capacity containers
installed on a reinforced concrete base.

The building materials and the technological equipment shall be transported to the site
by road. The construction period - approx. 8-10 months - shall be characterized by an
intensive transportation activity, therefore we have to count with the increase of road
traffic.
Transportation of building materials: in average 100 t/day (i.e. 4-5 trucks/day, during
earthworks and concrete works 6-8 trucks/day). During the construction period approx.
600-700 cu.m concrete resp. approx. 60 t steel shall arrive to the site. Concrete shall be
transported in mixer trucks.
Technolo   : main equipment (turbines, generators, transformers - machine parts, stack
parts, tanks) shall be transported pre-assembled, by special trailers. Auxiliary
equipment and machine parts shall be transported by normal trucks with an average
frequency of 2-3 trucks/day during the 2-3 month period of assembly.
During the construction and assembly works mobile toilets and bathroom containers
shall be installed on the site based on an agreement with the building company. The
collection and the disposal of the generating waste water shall be the responsibility of
the building company.
The communal waste and the debris which is not qualified as hazardous waste (for
example offal, packing materials, etc.) shall be collected and disposed by the
contractor performing the building and assembly works. According to the relevant
regulations, possible hazardous wastes (as for example paint wastes, oily rags, etc.) in
all cases shall be collected, stored on a temporary basis and disposed by the contractor.

11/212 Changes taking place in the environmental elements
Air quality
During the construction works we have to count with a temporary dust load of the
environment due to the removal of the vegetation, the foundation work and other
earthworks. The air pollution by the exhaust smoke of the machines shall not be
significant due to the distance of the construction site from the residential area (the
closest dwelling house is at a distance of 500 m).
The pollution of the access roads of the site means a secondary pollution (the vehicles
passing through the area shall disturb the clay-mud-sand mixture on the road from time
to time), but this shall affect only the immediate vicinity of the roads, the pollution
shall decrease parallel with the distance from the construction site. The air pollution by
the exhaust smoke of the increased road traffic shall not be significant compared with
the current pollution load of the heavy traffic roads in the area. Thus the traffic
associated with the construction shall not have a significant impact on the air quality of
the area.
Impacts on soil quality and subsurface waters
The impacts of the construction works shall be manifest only in the plant site. Since the
plant site shall already be excluded from agricultural cultivation by the time of the
construction works, so-called "green damages" (treading underfoot) during
construction may not be expected. The excavated topsoil shall be stockpiled separately
and shall be backfilled after the construction, and care shall be taken, that a humic
layer shall be at the top, where it is needed.

The soil shall only be affected by physical impacts (for example compaction),
chemical impacts may not occur if technological discipline shall be respected. The
building company shall be obliged to prevent the spill of any chemicals (on the
ground), or - in case of a possible contamination - to remediate the soil; furthermore to
remove any offal from the site when demobilizing. Soil contamination shall be
prevented by full compliance with the water protection and waste management
regulations.
Subsurface waters could only be contaminated through the soil. which may not take
place with regard to the above.
Impacts on surface waters
Since there are no surface waters in the work site and its immediate vicinity, during the
construction works we do not have to count with pernicious environmental impacts
affecting surface waters.
Communal waste waters shall be collected in closed containers and shall be transported
for disposal by licensed contractors. thus no waste water shall be discharged into the
environment.

Noise load of the environment in the construction period
The construction, resp. building or demolition works are not performed on a permanent
basis, it is an activity which shall be completed within a shorter or longer period of
time. For this reason, the permissible noise level values are higher for such works than
those prescribed for the time of operation based on regional categories. During
construction the following activities (increasing the noise load) shall be carried out:
transportation of materials and equipment necessary for the construction.
noise of the construction and the assembly,
transportation of the wastes and debris generating during construction.
The permissible noise load limit values originating from the construction work have
been determined for the investigated site on the basis of Attachment No. 2 of Decree
No. 4/1984.(I.23.)EiM, for a period of time shorter than I year (see Table I/2.3-1).
Table 11123.-1 - Permissible noise load limit values originating from the
construction work
Function of the area                Day dB(A)   Night dB(A)

Industrial area mixed with residential
and administrative buildings            70            55
The construction works shall be performed in day time, in the open air. Considering
the relevant regional categories and the distance of the dwelling houses to be protected
from the site of construction (the closest dwelling houses to be protected are at a
distance of 500, resp. 600 m from the site), respectively the 70 and 60 dB(A) day-time
noise load limit value, excess noise load values are not expected at the official quarters
and at the dwelling houses at Babai street to be protected.

Contractor Co.
The transportation of the generating wastes from the site and the transportation of the
materials and equipment required for the construction shall be by road. Based on
previous estimation approx. 900 heavy truck tum-rounds shall be required for the
transportation of the various materials and equipment. Since this shall be performed
expectedly within a period of time shorter than I year, at least 6-8 truck turn-rounds
per day (in day time) can be taken into consideration.
The equivalent noise level calculated from the traffic data can be deternined by
calculation on the basis of Section Ml.I of the Hungarian Standard Specifications
MSZ-13-183-1 (counting with a velocity of 50 km/h in the residential area). 8 truck
turn-rounds/day in the given route means the passing of 16 heavy trucks (8-8 in each
direction). The reference time is 16 hours, i.e. on the average, I heavy truck shall pass
in each hour. The calculation with the fornula of the standard specifications (for heavy
trucks) shall result, that the transportation activity in itself shall produce 51.6 dB(A)
equivalent sound pressure level A at a distance of 7.5 m from the center line of the
road.
Currently the average equivalent sound pressure level A on the projected transportation
road is 49 dB(A) (at the dwelling houses at Bibai street)), and thus the resultant of the
two sound pressure levels is 53.5 dB(A). Consequently. the transportation activity
during the construction works may cause an excess of 0.6 dB(A). and thus the noise
load shall be far below the guiding value (60 dB(A)).
Impact of the construction on the flora and the fauna
The projected site has recently been excluded from agricultural cul:ivation. though it is
still cultivated on a temporary basis, thus no values can be found in the area from the
point of view of the flora and fauna. The construction and asse.-nbly works shall not
disturb natural habitats.

Air pollution and noise increasing during the construction/assembly works and the
associated transportations shall have no unfavorable impact on the flora and fauna,
partly because they shall not be significant, partly because only a few species could
find their home in the vicinity of the transportation roads due to the strong
antropogenic effect.
Human impacts of the construction
Human impacts of the construction activity can be air pollution and noise. The
construction shall result in a smaller dust pollution, however, due to the distance of the
residential area from the site, this shall not cause measurable changes in the air quality.
The imnpact of transportations on air pollution shall not be significant with respect to
the current load of the nearby roads with heavy traffic.
During the construction/assembly and the associated transportation activities the noise
load shall expectedly a bit higher in the day time, but it shall not be over the limit
values due to the distance of the dwelling houses from the site.

No. 4/1986.(VI.2.)OKTH, respectively with the expected (and thus projected)
technological emiission limit values. Comparing the expected maximum airborne
emissions with the two emission limit values it is clearly shown, that the emission are
below the permissible concentrations.

II.3.1.2 Determination of the height of the stack
Determination of the heiEht of the stack on the basis of the emission limit values
Based on hourly emissions we have determined the height of the stack required
according to regulations (decree 21/1986.(VI.2.)MT, 4/1986.(VI.2.)OKTH, and
Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 21854). The height of the stack shall always
be determined on the basis of the expected volume of the dominating (most critical)
pollutant. In our case the dominant pollutant is NOx.
The current air quality limit values for the site, respectively for the block to be built are
shown in Table IL'3.1.2.-. The plant belongs to Protection category I, therefore,
these limit values should be taken into consideration when determining the height of
the stack.

The load index of Saj6szoged for SO2 and for nitrogen-oxides is 50, thus the official
limit value shall be:
100 - 50
K2=          =0.5

The regional emission limit value of the point source has been determined with the
following formula:
En = Ef*Kl r?
where:
En   is the regional emission limit value of the point source
K1   is the permissible air quality limit value of the given pollutant for 24 hours.

Ef   is the emission factor depending on the heigh! of the stack and the number of
emission points:

where:
Ef.i  is the regulatory value prescribed in the Decree
n    is the number of point sources
Based on the above data it can be checked, whether the projected stack meets the
official requirements. The applied height of the stack is 51 m. In this case the
permissible S02 and NOX emission shall be:
In case of the 2-stack version
Efi  =2.0

In case of one single stack
Efi  =2.0
n    =1
Ef   =2.0
En=2.0x 150x0.50=15Okg/h
The NOX emission of the power plant (max. 149 kg/h resp. 74 kg/h) is lower than the
regional emission limit value, thus the applied stack height - 51 m - meets the
requirements.
The height of the stack determined in the present study differs from that of the
preliminary environmental impact study, since on the basis of the inforTnative
proposals and the previous discussions with the potential suppliers it has become clear,
that, thanks to the technical development, there exist quick-start gas turbines the NOx
emission of which is significantly lower than before.
Comparing the expected S02 emissions with the regional emission limit values
belonging to the required stack heights we get a result, according to which the quantity
of S02 is 51% of the limit value.
Controlling stack height determined from the emission limit values on the basis of air
quality limit values
For controlling the 51 m stack height determined in the above, respectively for
determining the required basic data for the estimation of the expected air quality, we
have made propagation calculations for the environment of the power plant. For the
calculations we have used the computer program developed by the Environmental
Office of ETV-EROTERV Rt.

-    MSZ 21459/1-81 - Determination of the transmission of air pollutants.
Calculation of the pollution impact of the point sources.
-    MSZ 21459/5-85 - Determination of the transmission of air pollutants.
Determination of the effective height of the emission.
During the calculation of propagation - as a result of the experience of the preliminary
environmental impact study and updating of data - we have calculated 30-minute
concentrations of nitrogen-oxides, sulfur-dioxide and carbon-monoxide (under the axis
of the smoke plume) within 20 km distance from the plant. We have not calculated
daily (24 h) and yearly immissions, since
-     -due to the short and fluctuating daily respectively yearly operation times (10
startings/year in average, 2-hour operation time per starting) the calculated
average values shall not be characteristic;
the calculated 30-minute maximum immissions are lower than the 24-hour
healthy limit values (for NOX: 150, resp. 100 Lg/cu.m in the areas of
outstanding protection category) reduced by the basic load. and even than the
annual limit value (100 j±g/cu.m) for areas of protection categorv 1. reduced by
the basic load.
We have not dealt with solid particles as air pollutants. since solid particles are not
characteristic to the emissions of gas turbines.

pollutant is NOx.
Comparing Figures Il/3.1.2.-I and 1113.1.2.-3, respectively II/3.1.2.-2 and II/3.1.2 .-4 it
can be stated, that the emissions of the 2-stack version are the double of the single-

phenomenon can be attributed to the height difference of the stacks.

The actual height of the stack is the height of the level, where the axis of the smoke
plume leaving the stack becomes horizontal, its value is the sum of the additional and
the built heights of the stack. The additional stack height is the height of the smoke
plume over the stack following discharging. The additional stack height depends on the
thermal and kinetic energy of the flue gas, as well as on the meteorological conditions
in the ascent domain of the smoke plume
As a result of the interaction of the ambient air, the flue gas emitting from the stack
shall gradually loose its energy. The time of this process depends (in addition to the
parameters of the ambient air) on the mass and the temperature of the smoke plume
(thermal energy) and on the speed of the emission (kinetic energy).
In the case of the projected gas turbine power plant - two-stack version - the same
volume of the flue gas shall be emitted by two stacks. and the two smoke plumes shall
not mix up with each other. Thus the total energy of the specific parts shall only be the
half of that of the single-stack version. Consequently, the additional height of the
stacks shall be lower than that of the smoke plume of the single-stack version.
In case of the projected power plant, the additional stack height originates mainly from
the buoyancy resulting from the difference between the temperature of the ambient air
and that of the emitting flue gas. The ascending effect originating from the kinetic
energy of the flue gas is significantly smaller. Therefore. a possible rise of the emission
speed shall not mean a significant rise of the additional stack heignt. at the same time,
it shall have a negative influence on the efficiency of the power plant.

Based on the analytical results of the 2-stack version of greater pollution, we can state
the following (see Fig. II/3.1.2.-2): According to the propagation calculations,
maximum concentrations appear within the most unfavorable meteorological
concentrations (S = 7, v = 6 m/s - frequency is less than I%) at a distance of approx.
1300 m from the source. In case of NOx the concentration is 12% of the 30-minute
limit values for the areas of protection category 1 (200 jggcu.m), i.e. 25 ;Lg/cu.m.
Within the most frequent meteorological conditions (S = 6, v = 3 m/s - frequency:
13%) the maximum concentration appears at a distance of approx. 7 kIn from the
source, its value is 7% of the limit value, i.e. 14 p.g/cu.m.
Based on the above results it can be stated (see Table 11/3.13.-I) that the immissions o
the power plant are below the pernissible concentrations (limit value reduced by the
basic load), and thus the 51 m stack height is satisfactory from the point of view of
immission.
Determination of the stack height on the basis of the immission limit values
The result received during the control of the 51 mn stack height (there is a significant
difference between the actual immissions and the limit values) draws the attention to
the fact, that the immissions do not justify the construction of 51 m high stacks.
Trherefore, in the following, we shall examine the immissions in case of lower stack
heights. During the investigation we search for the height at which the standard air
quality values determined for the environment of the plant shall be met in all cases
(i..e. we shall not permit even short-time excess. which can be tolerated according to
the Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 21854-1990).

The calculation method is based on propagation models using the meteorological data
base of the region, according to MSZ 21457/4-80, as well as according to Sheet 5-85
of MSZ 21459/1-81, calculating with various stack heights. Based on these
calculations, the stack should have a height, at which the 30-minute maximum
concentration shall never be over the limit value corrected according to the bzisic load
(taking into consideration, that a part of the investigation area is of outstanding
protection category).
During calculations, in order to eliminate the impacts of mechanical turbulence
generated by the facilities, we calculated with a stack height higher at least by 2.5-
times than the buildings in the surrounding, i.e. we have taken 40 m as a starting data.
as the minimum acceptable stack height. At this height, in case of the highest pollution.
taking into consideration the 2-stack version and various meteorological conditions.
the result of the calculation shall be, that there shall be no excess values in case of the
stack height of 40 m (see Fig. II/3.1.2.-5).
The explanation of the difference between the calculation of the stack height on the
basis of the immission limit values and the calculation on the basis of the emission
limit values can be, that the current Hungarian regulations for the protection of the air
quality do not take into consideration the physical characteristics of the exhausted flue
gas. In our case, the mass flow of the discharge flue gas is 2.5-3-times more than that
of a traditional boiler firing the same quantity of fuel, and its temperatue is about
500°C (while the flue gases discharged by a traditional equipment are of a temperature
of 100-200°C). Accordingly, we get a significant stack he -ht (according to the
propagation calculation, in our case, in case of a 2-stack version, within normal
operational conditions Ah = 185 m, while in case of the single stack version Ah = 259
m). which has the same impact from the point of view of the propagation of the
airbome emissions.

Comparing the results of the calculations for the two different stack heights, within the
most unfavorable meteorological conditions (S = 7, v = 6 mIs), it can be stated, that, at
a stack height of 40 m, the jimnission value is higher by about 10% than at a stack
height of 51 m, while it is significantly below the limit values (see Fig. I113.1.2.6).
Il/3.1.3 Changes of the air quality in the impact area
Operational impacts on air gualitY
From the point of view of air quality, a circle of a radius of 5 kn around the stack is
considered as the impact area of the power plant, since in this area, according to the
presented propagation calculation, the maximum 30-minute NOX concentration
remains below 10% of the air quality limit value in the areas of protection category 1.
within all meteorological conditions. Over the 5 kan distance immission shall further
reduce. Thus, on the basis of the upgraded calculations. the impact area of the power
plant has becorne smaller than a circle of a radius of 10 km. which has been
investigated by the Preliminary environmental impact study. The reason is the
significantly lower achievable nitrogen-oxide emission.
The values calculated with the transmission model are superposed to the existing
pollution level of the area, i.e. to the background pollution. These summarized values
should be compared with the prescribed air quality limit values.
The expected changes of the air quality in the concerned settlements are shown in
Table II/3.1.3-1. Based on the data of the table it can be stated, that
Considering the periodical, short-time operation, and that the immission caused
by the gas turbine, even if superposed to the basic load; shall remain below the air
quality limit values in any of the settlements, the expected emissions of the power
plant shall not result in a pemicious pollution load to the environment.

ImRacts of transRortations and vehicle traffic
The majority of transportations shall be fuel and demi water transportation by road.
The frequency is, on the average, 24-24 tank trucks of a capacity of 30 cu.m per year.
The time schedule of transportations is irregular, it depends on the operation time of
the gas turbine. The air pollution caused by transportation is insignificant with respect
to the current load of the heavy traffic roads of the region.
11.3.2 Changes in the soil quality
Soil quality may potentially be affected by the oil manipulations (transportation,
racking. storage and feeding), as well as by the contact with wastes. The normal
operation of the plant - thanks to the applied technical protective solutions - has no
negative impact on the soil.
During the racking and the storage of the oil the applied technical solutions (the oil
resistant concrete tray under the racking equipment, the pipelines and the fittings; in
case of the tanks the protective ring made of reinforced concrete) shall prevent the oil
from spilling to the ground.
In the area of the projected power plant traffic roads shall have a hard cover. and the
pavements shall have a slope towards the catch basins. Liquid materials running down
from the roads, and originating from the racking places and the technological system
(rainwater, spilling, leakage, etc.) shall run to the oil separator, where these materials
shall appropriately be treated and cleaned.
The applied technology and the monitoring system shall immediately detect the
leakages of the fuel and lubricating systems, and shall ensure the corrective measures
without delay, thus minimizing the losses and the possibility of the environmental
damages.

The negative impacts caused by the wastes can be avoided by the full respect of the
relevant rules and regulations.
Soot deposit in surface waters and in the soil, originating from the flue gases emitted
from the stacks, is practically insignificant and thus negligible.
11/3.3 Changes in the quality of surface and subsurface waters
In the area there is no surface water flow, water excavation or water discharge. The
power plant shall be supplied with water through a branching from the drinking water
pipeline of the sub-station. and thus there shall be no need to establish a separate water
supply system.
The communal water demand of the power plant is 0.1 cu.m/day, maximum I cu.m per
month. The power plant shall be provided with a 450 cu.m fire water pool, which,
according to the Hungarian standard specifications (MSZ 9779/4) has to be filled with
water within 48 hours. This quantity requires a pipeline of 2.6 I/s capacity. These water
demands shall be satisfied by a branching from the drinking water pipeline supplying
the sub-station with water.
Demi water, required for the additional water supply used for the cooling svstem and.
if required, for the reduction of the NOx emission of the gas turbines, shall be
transported by road, in tank-trucks.
During the provisional stay of the operating staff in the power plant approx. I cu.m
communal waste water may produce per month. It shall be collected in a closed waste
water reservoir and then transported for disposal.

rainwater can be contaminated with oil (for example the oil racking station) rainwater
shall be discharged to an oil separator. Thus the oil concentration of rainwater shall not
exceed 2 mg/l. The treated rainwater shall be infiltrated into the soil.
I113.4 Impacts originating from handling and storage of raw materials and wastes
Raw materials
In the plant site we have to count only with the storage and handling of fuel oil and
demi water as raw materials. The storage and handling of demi water has no impact on
the enviromnent. Demi water shall be transported to the plant by road, in tank-trucks,
and it shall be stored in two 300 cu.m capacity tanks.
Fuel oil shall also be transported by road, in tank-trucks. Two 1000 cu.m capacity
tanks shall be built for the storage of the fuel oil. In connection with the handling and
the storage of the fuel oil, the soil shall be protected with technical solutions as
described in Section II/3.2. Similarly, technical solutions (isolating cocks, gate valves.
floating roof) shall ensure, that the hydrocarbon emission shall be insignificant.
Communal wastes
Communal wastes shall consist of the generating organic wastes and the packing
materials of the auxiliary materials. Their volume shall be about 2 cu.m per year. They
shall be collected together with the communal wastes of the sub-station. They shall be
transported for disposal by the local company of public hygiene.

11/3.5 Impacts of noise emission originating from the operation of the plant
The immission limit values for work places are prescribed by the Hungarian Standard
Specifications MSZ 18151/2-83:
-    the equivalent sound pressure level A of the noise affecting the workers may not
exceed LAeq= 85 dB;
-    the highest sound pressure level A of the noise may not exceed. in any case,
LAI = 125 dB.
The investigation of the noise emission of industrial plants and constructions and the
determination of the noise emission limit values are included in the Hungarian
Standard Specifications MSZ-13-111-85:
The highest permissible noise emission limit value is LKH = 70 dB(A). This value
should be measured on a vertical measuring surface exposed parallel with the border
line of the plant, at a distance of "d" from the border line. Distance d = 1 0 m.
The noise load caused by the new facility has been investigated at the dwelling houses
located in the concerned area. At the dwelling houses to be protected the resultant of
the noise, originating from the newly installed equipment, the existing sub-station and
the ground noise, may not excced the currently permissible noise load limit values.
This means, that, at two of the investigated dwelling houses (official quarters) 50
dB(A). while at three other houses (watchman's house, two dwelling houses at Babai
street) 40 dB(A) noise load limit value should be met during the night (see Table
1i7n5.-I).
The potential suppliers have been informed. that the sound pressure level measured on
the emission surfaces exposed in a distance of I m from the container units to be
installed. respectively from the buildings may not exceed 85 dB(A). We have made
calculations in order to determine, whether the noise load limit value can be met at 85
dB(A) noise emission.
86



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
( ER d TER V)Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
When making the calculations, the damping effect of the air, the earth effect, shielding
(the dwelling houses to be protected have a free overlook to the new plant), the
damping effect of the vegetation (the height and the density of the existing vegetation
may not reduce the emitted noise), and the impact of the meteorological conditions
have not been taken into consideration.
The two gas turbines installed close to each other and the two stacks (taking into
consideration, that primarily the top of the stack shall emit noise) can be considered
point sources due to the distance of the dwelling houses to be protected. The distance
from the dwelling houses is the multiple of the largest sizes of the new facilities. The
distance-dependant damping has been calculated with the following fonnula:
Lt = 20 Ig(rl/r2)
where
ri   500 m (distance of the official quarters from the projected power plant),
resp. 900 m (distance of the watchman's house and the dwelling houses at Babai
street from the projected plant)
r)   I m (distance of the emission surface from the equipment)
As a result of the calculation, in the case of the official quarters located at a distance of
500 m from the new facility, the distance-dependant damping is 54 dB(A). while in the
case of the dwelling houses at Bibai street this value shall be 59 dB(A).
The sound pressure level at a distance of 2 m from the facade of the dwelling houses to
be protected (taking into consideration a correction of -3 dB due to the echo, and 4
point sources) is 40 dB(A), respectively 35 dB(A).. This means, that the new facilities
in themselves shall not exceed the noise load limit value, not even during the night.
Calculating from the measuring data, in the night period the current effective sound
pressure level A at the official quarters is 35 dB(A), while at the watchman's house and
at the dwelling houses at Babai street it is 37 dB(A). The sound pressure level
generated by the new facilities shall be superposed to this noise at the given exposure
points.

( ER dER                                         Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
Summarizing the two sound pressure levels at the exposure points, the resultant shall
be 41.5 dB(A) at the official quarters, while it shall be 39 dB(A) at the dwelling houses
at Babai street. Based on the summarized levels, at the dwelling houses there shall be
no excess noise load during the night.
In day time the noise load limit value is higher (60, resp. 50-4dB(A) ). The noise
emission of the power plant shall be identical day and night, thus it seems to be clear,
that there shall be no excess noise load during the day either.
In summary, it can be stated, that the noise emission of the projected plant shall
increase the noise load of the dwelling houses to be protected in the area with respect
to the current values, but no excess noise load is expected neither in day time, nor
during the night.
Noise originatina from traffic
For the supply of the consumed fuel - taking into consideration the storage capacity of
the available tank park - we have count with the traffic of at least one single 40 cu.m
capacity tank-truck.
The equivalent noise level has been calculated on the basis of the traffic data. as
follows:
the calculated equivalent sound pressure level A at a distance of d = 7.5 m from the
center line of the road shall be:
LAeqm = 23.2 + 10 Ig Qm + 16.7 Ig vm dB(A)
where:
Qm = 0.125 dB - number of passing heavy truck per hour
vm = 50 km/h - velocity of the truck in the residential area

( !)                                      Contractor Co.
1 truck turn-round/day in the given route means the passing of 2 heavy trucks (1-1 in
each direction). The reference time is 16 hours, i.e. on the average 0,125 heavy tmck
shall pass in each hour. Calculating with the given fornula this means. that the
transportation activity in itself shall produce 42.5 dB(A) equivalent sound pressure
level A at a distance of 7.5 m from the center line of the road.
Currently the average equivalent sound pressure level A on the fuel transportation road
is 49 dB(A), and thus the resultant of the two sound pressure levels shall be 49.9
dB(A). Consequently, the transportation of the fuel supply may cause an increase of
0.9 dB(A) in the noise load, which is negligible, and even the increased noise load
shall be far below the guiding value.
I11.3.6 Ecological prognostics for habitats
Since the ecosystems are very complex systems, the estimation of the impacts caused
by the environmental changes is very difficult. The projected power plant may have an
impact on the flora and fauna through airborne emissions. The impact of the power
plant shall superpose on the impact of the air pollution originating from the
neighboring industrial areas, and cannot be separated from it. In the present phase of
the study what we can do is. that we assess the flora and the fauna of the impact area of
the projected power plant, and thus, through the biomonitoring system, we can follow
with attention the changes which shall take place in the future.
Due to the extremely short operation times and the periodical operation, as well as due
to the relatively small immissions the projected power plans shall expectedly have a
small impact on the animal and plant communities, which can be compensated by their
self-control system.

I1/3.7 Impacts on human health and other human impacts
The power plant shall have an impact on the population through the air pollution and
the increase of the noise load.
Taking into consideration periodical and short-time operation, as well as the fact, that
the immissions caused by the gas turbine shall remain, in any of the settltmrients in the
area, below the limit values of public health (as shown in Section 11/3. 1), even if they
are superposed to the basic load, the expected air pollution shall not have a negative
impact on the health of the population.
The noise emission of the projected power plant shall slightly increase the noise load
of the dwelling houses to be protected in the area with respect to the current values, but
no excess noise load is expected neither in day time, nor during the night, as it was
described in Section 1/3.5.
I1.3.9 Social-economical impacts
In JanuaTy and February 1996, in possession of the preliminary building permit of the
Hungarian Energy Office, in cooperation with ESBI-ETV Engineering Co. Ltd.. MVM
Rt. organized a public information in harmony with Govemment Decree No.
146/1992.(XI.4.). On April 22, 1996 a decision has been issued by the inter-
departmental committee in connection with the informnation of the public, according to
§ 3 of the above said GoveTmnent Decree. The decision included the following:
1.   On a preliminary basis, in its session of December 20, 1995 the Committee was
of [he opinion, that the concept of the development of a secondary reserve power plant.
within the framework of the development program of MVM Rt. - as a precondition of
joining the Western-European power system - is in harnony with the objectives of the
Hungarian energy policy and with the viewpoints of the protection of the environment.

2.   The Conmittee states, that during the preparatory phase of making a decision
on the development the feasibility study and the preliminary environmental impact
study have been prepared. The Hungarian Energy Office issued a preliminary building
permit and, in January 1996 - based on the approved "program for the information of
the public" - MVM Rt started the infornation of the great public. The technical public
hearing took place in Saj6szoged, on February 23, 1996, where the concerned
communities could make comments and proposals.
3.   The Committee, in order to ensure the proper control of the program, invited -
by way of competition - an Expert Organization, which performed the following tasks
based on a contract:
-    they managed the reconciliation of the interests and supervised the procedure
and the correctness of the program,
-    they cooperated with the PR-agency selected by the investor in the preparation
and the carrying through of the public information, as well as in the
organization and the procedure of the public sessions and public hearings.
they followed with attention the public relation forumns and cvents taking place
between the investor and the communities of the concemed region, they ensured
an objective background for the reconciliation of the interests and they
prepared the official report of the technical public hearing,
they prepared a summary report for the Committee about the realization of the
public infornation program and the reconciliation of the interests. in the
framework of which
- they evaluated the documents prepared during the preparation and the
realization of the program,
- they made comments on the activity of the PR agency with special regard to
the contents of the "program for the inforrnation of the public".
- they supervised the PR-documentation prepared during the specific work
phases,
- they made proposals supporting the decision-making of the Committee.

Based on the opinions voiced during the public hearing of February 23, 1996 in
Saj6szoged, on the data of the second follow-up public opinion poll, as well as on the
contents of the sununary report of the Expert Organization, the Committee states, that
the majority of the concerned population support the investment project. Based on the
above, the Committee considers satisfactory the public information procedure
connected with the building of the 100 MW capacity gas turbine secondary reserve
power plant of MVM Rt. in Saj6sz6ged.
The Committee - with regard to the great interest of the public - is of the opinion, that
-    the investor, during the licensing procedure, should keep on informing the
concemed municipalities about the most important decisions associated with the
, ojected power plant (for example the selection of the technology, the fuel
material, the final plant site, etc.).
-    the investor should ensure the access for the municipality to the public
documents in connection with the projected power plant, and for the public the
possibility of inspection of these documents and the possibility to make
comments.
4.   At the same time, the Committee draw the attention of the investor. the
concerned municipalities and the licensing authorities to the following:
-    in the tender invitation for the supply of the gas turbine the new limit values and
requirements for the protection of air purity and air quality should be indicated.
which are in harmony with the regulations of the protection against noise - in
relation with the secondary reserve capacity. These new limii values and
requirements shall enter into force within the framework- of the current law on
environmental protection,

the concemed municipalities - in harmony with the comments made during the
technical public hearing - with the involvement of the competent environmental
regulatory agencies, should initiate, that the investor takes the responsibility of
ensuring the availability of controllable infornation about the quantity
(consumption) and quality (for example sulfur content) data of the energy
carriers required for the operation of the secondary reserve capacity,
collecting the oily waste waters generating in the plant in a closed container.
and having an acceptance declaration by a licensed disposal plant,
buiiding an appropriate monitoring system for controlling the environmental
impacts (air, waters) during operation,
the Hungarian Energy Office should prescribe in its license the obligation of
posterior reporting about each starting in order to control the secondary
character of the capacity.
In the opinion of the Committee it would be purposeful, that the investor and the
representatives of the concerned municipalities pursue a direct reconciliation about the
requirements voiced by the local population at the technical public hearing of
February 23, 1996, first of all in order to avoid the increase of the load to the
environment.

Taking into consideration the statements of the summary report of the Expert
Organization, and on the basis of the experiences of the technical public hearing of
February 23, 1996, the Committee is of the opinion, that the public information
process in connection with the projected 100 MW capacity gas turbine secondary
reserve power plant of MVM Rt. in Saj6szoged was satisfactory, and considers the
prescribed Commission activity as closed, with the condition, that the public should
be kept informed about the details of the protection of the environment.
With regard to the opinion of the Committee, the licensing procedure by the
regulatory agencies and the preparation for the construction of the 100 MW capacity
gas turbine secondary reserve power plant of MVM Rt. in Saj6szoged can be
continued.
11/3.9 Impacts on the landscape
The 2.4 ha -size plant site is located in the outskirts of Sajoszoged, to SW direction
from the village, close to main road No. 35, in the vicinity of the existing OVIT sub-
station. The area is accessible from the transformer transportation road.
The plant shall be built on a former agricultural area, which is already excluded from
agricultural cultivation. The landscape shall not significantly influenced by the sight of
the power plant, since the neighboring sub-station already gives an industrial character
to the area. With regard to the general appearance of the projected facility, it shall fit to
the existing buildings of the sub-station. The gas turbines shall have an 51 (40) m
stack(s). After the completion of the building works, the area shall be gassed and also
trees shall be planted

11/3.10 Other expected impacts due to average and operational troubles
Due to the applied technological and technical solutions, as well as to the character of
the plant, hazardous materials may enter into the environment only in case of average.
Such hazardous materials can be the fuel and lubricating materials. as well as the fire
extinguishing materials in case of fire, which can be qualified as case of average.
Potential sources of danger are in connection partly with the transportation, movement.
racking of storage of hazardous materials, respectively with the possible failure of
cables, fittings, storage means and tanks.
A case of average may occur as a result of
-     disaster (earthquake. thunderstroke)
-     fire
-     traffic accident
-     technological problem, operational trouble
-     aggressive human action (intentional damaging, terrorist action).
In this section we describe only the possible impacts, the elimination shall be dealt
with in Section 11/5.7.
The greatest possible average is fire, during which both the fire and the extinguishing
may result in environmental damages.

During fire the combustion products (flue gases, smoke, soot, etc.) enter into the air.
where gases shall mix according to the current weather and wind conditions, while
heavier solid particles (soot) after a certain time shall deposit on the soil. The
propagation of the pollution can hardly be determined, since it depends on the
meteorological conditions, the dispersion processes, as well as on the natural and
artificial settling effects (for example water spraying).
A part of the water and the foam material (type: LW ATC FC 600) used for
extinguishing - mixing with the burning material - shall inevitably spread on the soil.
respectively enter into the soil, and, in such a case, it shall contaminate it.
Average - endangering the cleanliness of the soil and the waters - may caused by
operation troubles of the equipment, respectively by the hazardous materials leaking
from injured storage tanks (fuel materials, lubricating materials). From this point of
view, the most dangerous situation is, when an operation trouble occurs in the fuel
supply system, since in such case of average oil may leak from the system.
The operational troubles of the fuel supply system may also result in air pollution, due
to the evaporation of the fuel material hydrocarbon emission may occur.
The environmental impacts of the aggressive human actions cannot be estimated
without knowing the motivations and the intentions.

IIA EXPECTED IMPACTS OF DECOMMISSIONING
The projected life time of the power plant is 30 years. After the shut-down of the plant
the equipment shall be disassembled and transported from the site. The dismounted
machine equipment can be recycled (iron scrap). The underground concrete structures
shall remain in place. No waste shall remain on the site.
The expected impacts of decommissioning are similar to those of the construction
period, but somewhat smaller. We have to count primarily with air pollution and noise
caused by dismounting works and transportation.
I114.1 Changes in subsurface and surface water quality
The power plant - during its normal operation - shall not have any impact on the
quality of subsurface and surface waters, therefore, likely, there shall be no change in
the quality of waters after decommissioning.
In case of a decommissioning performed by the contractor with the utmost care to be
expected, no negative imnpact or contamination mav occur to the subsurface and
surface waters of the area.
II/4.2 Changes in the soil quality
The power plant - during its normal operation - shall not have any impact on soil
quality. therefore, likely, there shall be no change in the quality of soil after
decommissioning.
In case of a decommissioning performed by the contractor with the utmost care to be
expected. no negative impact or contamination may occur to the soil in the area.

II1/43 Ecological changes
Decommissioning and the cease of air pollution shall have a favorable influence on
the flora and fauna of the region by all means. After decommissioning only the
underground engineering structures shall remain in the site. the hollow underground
structures (fire water tank, cable ducts) shall be filled. In case of a complete
decommissioning, these structures shall not mean "traps" which may cause damage to
the ecology of the region.

After decommissioning the area shall be arranged and grassed. The landscape shall be
restored according to the original status, however, the current use of land (ploughland)
can possibly not be restored.

11/5 DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES
II15.1 Protection of the air quality
At the gas turbines, in case of oil firing, the characteristic air pollutants are: nitrogen-
dioxides, sulfur-dioxide, carbon-monoxide and soot.
Carbon-monoxide and soot emission at the gas turbines can be kept below the emission
limit values without special environmental measures.
At the gas turbines two technological solutions can be applied for meeting NOx
emission limit values:
gwater injection into the combustion chamber. This shall reduce the temperature
at the places which can be considered critical from the point of view of
nitrogen-dioxide generation. With this solution the amount of the generating
nitrogen-dioxide can significantly be reduced.
an appropriate bumer construction (so-called Dry-low-NOx burners), which
keeps nitrogen-oxide generation on a low level. This solution is currently used
at the gas turbines burning gaseous fuel, but experiments are underwav with oil
fired burners, and such burners shall expectedly appear on the mark-el within
one or two years.
In the present study we have supposed the application of the water injection method .
At the gas turbines the sulfur-dioxide emission limit values can be met by the proper
selection of the fuel material. In the power plant investigated by the present study the
sulfur contents of the fuel material is very low (max. 0.2%), and thus the emission limit
values can be met.

II/5.2 Water protection
The generating communal waste water shall be collected and treated in a closed waste
water reservoir, and then transported for disposal.
In the projected plant site - due to its position (in the area there is no water flow) -
surface and subsurface waters could only be contaminated through the soil, and thus
the following measures to be taken for the protection of the soil shall also serve for the
protection of the waters.
11/5.3 Soil protection
The technical solutions (oil-resistant tray at the oil racking station and under the
pipelines and fittings, a reinforced concrete protective ring for the tanks) shall prevent
the oil from spilling onto the soil.
An oil trap shall be built for the collection of oily waters running down from the access
road of the racking station, as well as for the collection of the oils spilling at the gas
turbine units. Oily waters shall be cleaned in an oil separator. The oil concentration of
the water discharging from the separator shall not exceed 2- mg/I. The separated oil
shall be pumped into a container and then transported for disposal.
Wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall temporarily be
stored in a separate storage place in the plant. They shall be remediated by a licensed
company specialized for this activity.

IISA Noise protection
In the projected power plant the noise protection shall be ensured by silencers, by
special sound insulations and by the light-structure casing.
1115.5 Nature protection
Nature protection shall be ensured by the optimal design of the plant, taking into full
consideration the environmental requirements (selection of the fuel material, water
injection) and by the way of construction.
11/5.6. Landscape protection
With regard to the general appearance of the projected facility. it shall fit to the
neighboing sub-station. After the completion of the construction of the plant the area
shall be arranged and grassed, the newly planted trees shall intercept the sight of the
plant.
11/5.7 Averages and the plan for their elimination
In order to prevent the pernicious impacts of accidents which may occur during
transportation and on the material movement routes, the traffic roads in the projected
plant area shall have a hard cover, and the pavements slope towards the catch basin.
Liquid materials running down from the road and from the racking station. as well as
originating from the technological system (rainwater, spills. leakages, etc.) shall be
col!ected in the oil separator, where they shall be treated and cleaned up to a
appropriate measure.
The leakages of the fuel material and lubricating materid systems shall immediately be
explored by the monitoring system thus making possible to take the necessary
measures without delay, and also to minimize losses and the possibility of causing

environmental damages. The technical solutions (a concrete tray at the oil racking
station and under the pipelines and the fittings, reinforced concrete protective ring for
the tanks) shall prevent oil from spilling onto the ground in case of operational
troubles.
For the case of earthquakes and thunderstrike - taking into account their frequency and
energy - the prescriptions for designing are included in the national standard
specifications, the compliance of which shall be supervised by the regulatory
authorities through the building permits and the license for use.
The greatest possible case of average which may occur is a fire. The elimination of
such averages and fire protection are prescribed in detail in the relevant official
regulations. Planned fire protection is effective against fire averages.
When extinguishing fire, the fire extinguishing material shall spread on the soil in a
relatively sman.ll part of the area, thus the extension of the contamination can easily be
delineated and the contamination can effectively be eliminated. In order to reduce
these damages, after the fire the following steps should be taken as soon as possible:
- collection and absorption of the spilled hazardous materials and contaminated water
- assessment of the rate of contamination
- clean-up or remediation of the contaminated soil.
The protection against aggressive human actions shall be ensured by applying a fence
around the site and by guarding.
The action plan for the elimination of averages can be prepared on the basis of the
technical prescriptions provided by the suppliers. The action plan shall be prepared in
the knowledge of these technical prescriptions, after the selection of the supplier.

The main uncertainties of the designing conditions originate from the fact, that the type
and the supplier of the equipment is not yet selected. The projected power plant shall
be of 100-120 MW capacity. During the analysis of the environmental impacts the
highest possible - 120 MW - capacity has been considered effective. Thus the
associated air pollution and noise emissions can be considered as the highest estimated
values, and the actual emissions shall expectedly be lower.
11.6.2 Building conditions
The main uncertainties of the building also originate from the fact, that the type and the
supplier has not yet been selected. Therefore, the volume of the construction/assembly
works, the number and the type of the machines and the transportation vehicles, as well
as the material quantities to be transported have only been estimated on the basis of
earlier experiences.
11/63 Current environmental status and impacts
11/63.1 Air quality
In connection with the air quality and the air pollution of the projected power plant
there are several uncertainties.
The first uncertainty is connected with the assessment of the current status. The air
quality of the region of the projected power plant has been characterized on the basis
of the data provided by the measuring instruments which we installed in the area, and
thus these data refer only to the heating season. Further assessment of the current status
is underway.

We have already mentioned the second uncertainty: since the type of the equipment
has not been selected, the emission of the equipment has been indicated on the basis of
the data provided by the potential suppliers.
Another uncertainty is the limited reliability of the propagation calculation model.
According to experiences, the difference between the calculated values and the actual
imrnissions can be max. 20%.
II/6.3.2 Ecological data
The collection and the processing of tfie ecological data is done on a continuous basis.
The evaluation of these data can take place only after the completion of the
assessment.

III/7.1 Monitoring during construction
No separate monitoring system shall be designed for the investigation of the impacts
during the construction - due to the measure of the impacts. At the same time, during
the construction/assembly works, the investor shall supervise the building company
and the other contractors on a continuous basis, and shall follow with attention the
respect of the environmental regulations.
II/7.2 Monitoring during operation
II/7.2.1 Air pollution and air quality
The following characteristic data and components of the flue gas shall be measured in
the stack during operation, on a continuous basis:
- So2,
- NOxR
- solid particles (soot),
-Co,
- O? or C02,
- temperature of the flue gas,
- volume flow of the flue gas.
The measuring data shall be processed by a computer proL,am registering and
evaluating the data according to the relevant regulations.
Due to the short operating times (20 hours per year, on the average) the building of a
separate immission measuring system is not justified.

In the course of the present work we performed the detailed environmental impact
assessment of the projected power plant and we compiled a Detailed Enviromnental
Impact Study, the main topics of which are summarized in the following, in harmony
with § 13 of Government Decree No. 152/1995(XII.12.):
11/8.1 Introduction
One of the outstanding objectives of the Hungarian energy policy approved by the
National Assembly is the diversification of the energy sources, and - in view of wire
energy - the extension of the connections. Therefore, in 1991, the Goverrnment made a
decision, that the Hungarian energy system joins UCPTE, the association of the
Westem-European electric energy systems, which are on a higher technical level and
which may guarantee a more safe electric energy supply for Hungary.
One of the basic conditions of joining UCPTE is, that the Hungarian electric energy
system should have a quick-action, so-called secondary control reserve capacities of a
size deternined by UCPTE recommendations. These reserve capacities should be
equivalent at least to the greatest capacity of the electric energy production unit of the
system. In the Hungarian electric energy system the greatest capacitv production units
are the 460 MW blocs of the Nuclear Power Plant of Paks, thus the secondary control
reserve capacity should be of 460 MW.
In the recent years. the Hungarian Power Companies Ltd. (MVM Rt.) has performed
comprehensive investigations for analyzing the most purposeful possibilities of
ensuring the required reserve capacity. Based on the analysis, MVM has come to the
conclusion, that 200 MW of the required reserve capacity should be ensured by
establishing quick-start gas turbine power plants.

I1l8.2 Description of the facility
1118.2.1 Installadon
Starting from the role of the secondary control-purpose power plants played in the
electric energy system, MVM Rt. has come to the conclusion, that it would be
purposeful to lo¢ate such power plants at the more important junction points of the
electric energy system, close to the large sub-stations of the network.
The 2.4 ha size location of the projected power plant is in the outskirts of Sajosz6ged.
in SW direction from the settlement, close to main road No. 35, in the vicinity of the
existing OVIT sub-station (see site plan No. 1/23.-1).
In the plant the following equipment and systems shall be installed (see installation
plan No. 112.3.-2):
-     gas turbine and auxiliary equipment
-     generator and auxiliary equipment
-     electric equipment of the power plant
-     electric technology of the substation
-     control system
-     environmental monitoring system
-     fuel supply system
-     water supply systems
-     fire protection systems.

IU82.2 Description of the operation of the projected gas turbine power plant
It is a basic requirement, that the projected power plant units reach maximum capacity
within 10 minutes after starting by the National Electric Load Distributor (OVIT). It is
owing primarily to the aeroderivative gas turbines - transformed from airplane gear
drives for industrial purposes - that the requirement of quick starting can be met.
Based on statistical data, the expected number of starting shall be minimum 5,
maximum 60. After starting a 2-hour operation time is expected. During this period of
time the defected unit can again be put into operation, or a reserve unit can be started.
The most probable number of working hours per year shall be: 10 x 2, i.e. 20
hourstyear.
The projected power plant shall operate without permanent operating staff.
The decisive technological element of the power plant is the gas turbine, which has
three main parts: the compressor, the combustion chamber and the turbine. The
compressor compresses the suction air to the required pressure for combustion. The
fuel is bumt by special burners. The turbine is rotated by the expansion of the high
pressure and high temperature flue gas discharging from the combustion chamber;
Electric energy is generated by a generator connected to the turbine.
The generating flue gas is emitted to the open air through a stack. The gas turbine is
mounted with a silencer both at the suction side and at the stack.
The operation scheme and the axonometric view of the gas turbine is shown in Fig.
Il/1.-4. while the view and the axonometric picture of the container unit are shown in
Fig. II/L.-2.

During combustion at a high temperature a part of the suction air and the nitrogen-
containing compounds of the fuel form nitrogen oxides. Their amount depends on the
temperature of the flame and on the time of residence of the gases in the combustion
chamber. The rate of nitrogen oxide generation can be kept on a low level by the
proper formation of the combustion chamber, respectively by water injection. The fuel
also contains some sulfur, in a very small quantity (max. 0.2%). During combustion
this forns sulfur dioxide. The carbon monoxide and soot emission of the newest types
of turbines is minimal.
In the present phase of planning neither the number of the required gas turbines has not
been determined, nor the type has not been selected. Based on the received informal
proposals we have selected one from among the possible types for demonstrating the
environmental impacts of the projected power plant, which has the most unfavorable
characteristics from environmental point of view.
The power plant shall have 100-120 MW capacity generated by one or two gas
turbines. During the investigation of the environmental impacts the highest possible
capacity - 120 MW - shall be considered as a reference. The characteristics of the
power plant associated with this capacity (based on the received informal proposals
and the preliminary discussions with the potential suppliers) are the following:
Capacity:                         120 MW
Efficiency:                       40%
Quantity:                         I or 2
Operation:
Number of startings/year
- average                         10
- maximum                         60
- minimum                         5
Expected operation time of one
single starting                   2 hours

11183.1 Investigation of the environmental impacts and the impact areas
The areas to be investigated for the current environmental status and for the impacts of
the operation of the projected power plant have been selected and presented
separately, according to the environmental elements and the investmnent phases (see
Table 1/6.-i and Fig. I/6.-6).
l/83.2 Current status of the environment
In summary, based on the available data and the performed noise measurements, the
current envirommental status of the projected power plant can be characterized as
follows:
Air quality
According to the investigations perforned during the preparation of the present study it
cam be stated, that, in Saj6szoged, Hejobaba, Nemesbikkl and Hejopapi the
concentrations of nitrogen-oxides have never exceeded the air qualitv limit values in
the measuring period, the air of the settlernents has been qualified satisfactory (mark
1).
At the measuring points of the National Immission Measuring Network. in
Tiszauijvaros, in the measuring period, excess values occurred both in nitrogen-oxide
concentrations (frequency: 1.39 %) and in sulfur-dioxide concentrations (frequency:
0.82%). The town has got an air quality mark 2 (moderately polluted).

Contractor Co.
Soil and subsurface waters
In the area of the projected power plant soil and groundwater investigations have been
performed in order to survey the current status and to asses the possible existing
contamination.
Based on the measuring results it can be stated, that, with respect the general chemical
parameter of the groundwater, only the manganese concentration exceeds the
permissible limit value for drinking water, which is characteristic to the subsurface
waters of the region. The majority of heavy metals is not detectable in the groundwater
samples, only some of them appear in traces, but their concentration never exceeds the
permissible value specified in the relevant standard specifications. and thus the
groundwater can be considered clean. At the same time, with respect to oil derivatives.
the groundwater proved to be contaminated in two of the three borings.
We have performed separate TPH tests of the soil samples taken from the three
borings, from various depths. From the measuring results it can be stated. that the soil
can be considered clean from the point of view of aliphatic hydrocarbon (TPH)
contamination, mineral oil derivatives can only be found in traces.
Surface waters
In the vicinity of the projected power plant there are no surface waters, however, the
area belongs to the region endangered by the floods of the Saj6 and Tisza rivers.
The highest water consumption is in TiszaijvAros, shore-filtered drinking water is
produced in 12 water works. In this area the water resources are endangered by surface
contamination. With regard to the future water use, the area of the Tisza-Saj6 junction
has a regional importance (shore filtering, groundwater).

The water of quality class V. of the Saj6 river (which is contaminated with the waste
waters of Miskolc and the industrial plants located in the upper section of the river. and
due to the industrial contamination originating from Slovakia) has an unfavorable
impact on the water quality of the Tisza along this river section.
Noise
According to the measuring results performed in March 1996 in order to asses the
current noise conditions, the noise emitted by the sub-station is below the permitted
noise emission limit values both in day time and during the night.
At the dwelling houses, in day time, due to the noise load caused by road traffic, the
ground noise is higher than the noise load caused by the sub-station, but it does not
exceed the limit value. During the night the ground noise of the enviromnent is lower
than in day time. At the dwelling houses to be protected the noise load was also below
the limit value (below the lower night noise limit value).
Flora and flauna
No earlier assessments are available on the flora and fauna of the environment of the
projected power plant. Within the framework of the present environmental impact
study the preparation of a vegetation map of the habitats of the area (spring-early
summer period) and a zoological characterization are underway. For the time being
only a general characterization can be given on the habitats in the environment of the
area.
The lower flood plain of the Saj6 river is bordered by the remnants of the once
contiguous soft-wood woodlands. At the higher areas there are also oak-ash gallery-
forests in patches. The forests mainly consist of young and mixed-age soft- and hard-
wood species. In the area there are large patches of disturbed grasses and pastures.

The traverses and the residual gallery forests along the Saj6 river are potential nesting
places of birds of prey. The mapping of the nests and the breeding species is underway
together with other species which have a value from the point of view of nature
protection. We are also searching for the habitats in the environment of the area which
have a natural value.
Il/833 Impact of the construction on the environment
The building materials and the technological equipment shall be transported to the site
by road. The construction period - approx. 8-10 months - shall be characterized by an
intensive transportation activity, therefore we have to count with the increase of road
traffic.
Transportation of buildine materials: in average 100 t1day (i.e. 4-5 trucks/day, during
earthworks and concrete works 6-8 trucks/day). During the construction period approx.
600-700 cu.m concrete resp. approx. 60 t steel shall arrive to the site. Concrete shall be
transported in mixer trucks.
Technology: main equipment (turbines, generators, transformners - machine parts, stack
parts, tanks) shall be transported pre-assembled, by special trailers. Auxiliary
equipment and machine parts shall be transported by normal trucks with an average
frequency of 2-3 trucks/day during the 2-3 month period of assembly.
The impacts of the construction works shall be manifest only in the plant site. Since the
plant site shall already be excluded from agricultural cultivation by the time of the
construction  works, so-called  "green  damages"  (treading  underfoot) during
construction may not be expected. The excavated topsoil shall be stockpiled separately
and shall be backfilled after the construction, and care shall be taken, that a humic
layer shall be at the top, where it is needed.

During the construction and assembly works mobile toilets and bathroom containers
shall be installed on the site based on an agreement with the building company. The
collection and the disposal of the generating waste water shall be the responsibility of
the building company.
The communal waste and the debris which is not qualified as hazardous waste (for
example offal, packing materials, etc.) shall be collected and disposed by the
contractor performing the building and assembly works. According to the relevant
regulations, possible hazardous wastes (as for example paint wastes, oily rags, etc.) in
all cases shall be collected, stored on a temporary basis and disposed by the contractor.
During the construction/assembly we have to count mainly with air pollution and noise
caused by the construction and assembly works and the transportation activity.
Air qualitv
During the construction works we have to count with a temporary dust load of the
environment due to the removal of the vegetation, the foundation work and other
earthworks. The air pollution by the exhaust smoke of the machines shall not be
significant due to the distance of the construction site from the residential area (the
closest dwelling house is at a distance of 500 m).
The pollution of the access roads of the site means a secondary pollution (the vehicles
passing through the area shall disturb the clay-mud-sand mixture on the road from time
to time), but this shall affect only the immediate vicinity of the roads, the pollution
shall decrease parallel with the distance from the construction site. The air pollution by
the exhaust smoke of the increased road traffic shall not be significant compared with
the current pollution load of the heavy traffic roads in the area. Thus the traffic
associated with the construction shall not have a significant impact on the air quality of
the area.

Possible soil and water contamination shall be prevented by full compliance with the
water protection and waste management regulations.
Noise load of the environment during the construction of the Rroiected Rower plant
During construction the following activities (increasing the noise load) shall be carried
out:
transportation of materials and equipment necessary for the construction.
noise of the construction and the assembly,
transpe,rtation of the wastes and debjis generating during construction.
The cjnsi.uct;on works shall be performed in day time, in the open air. Considering
the dista-pie of the dwelling houses to be protected from the site of construction (the
closest dwelling houses to be protected are at a distance of about 500 m from the site).
excess noise load is not expected at the dwelling houses due to the construction works.
Impact of the construction on the flora and the fauna
*The projected site is currently under agricultural cultivation. thus no values can be
found in the area from the point of view of the flora and fauna. The construction and
assembly works shall not disturb natural habitats.

II/83.4 The operation and its impacts on the environment
The gas turbine power plant is one of the technologies of electric energy production
processes which causes the least environmental pollution. During its operation mainly
airborne emissions and noise mean a pollution load to the environment.
Air quality
Expected emissions of the power plant polluting the air
In Table IU/3.1.1-1 we compared the expected airborne emissions of the power plant
with  the  permissible  emission  limit  values  according  to  regulation
4/1986.(VI.2.)OKTH, respectively with the expected technological emission limit
values, known as projected values. By comparing the expected highest airborne
emissions with the limit values we have stated, that the emissions are below the
permissible values.
Changes in the air quality caused by the power plant
From residential point of view the air quality (immission) during operation is more
important than the emissions of the plant., since air quality has an impact both on
humans and the flora and fauna. In addition to the qualitative and quantitative
characteristics of the emitted flue gas, air quality depends on numerous further factors.
such as: the height of the stack, the meteorological zonditions (wind velocity and its
changes by height, wind direction, changes of the air temperature by height. etc). the
topography and the articulation of the soil surface (plants, buildings). The correlation
between the emissions and the air quality can be determined by propagation
calculation.
119



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
We have made propagation calculations according to the standard specifications for the
enviromnent of the power plant, in order to determine the data required for thie
estimation of the expected changes in air quality. The propagation of air pollutants is
decisively influenced by the stability of the atmosphere (mixing capability - S) and win
velocity. Therefore, we performned the propagation calculation for the lability category
(S=7) causing the highest concentration close to -the soil, and for the most
characteristic, normal stability category (S=6). In Hungary, the most unfavorable air
condition (S=7) occurs with a frequency of 6.5%, while the most characteristic air
condition (S=6) occurs with a frequency of 39.8%.
The results of the investigation are shown in Figs. 1113.1.2-I, -2, -3, and 4. In the
figures it is well shown, how much general increase is caused by the power plant in the
concentrations of pollutants at various distances from the stack.
The calculated values shall be added to the existing pollution level - basic load - of the
area. These aggregated values should be compared with the permissible limit values of
air quality. The expected changes in the air quality of the settlements of the impact area
are shown in Table I1/3.123.-1. Based on the data of the table it can be stated. that.
consideiing the periodical, short-time operation, and that the immission caused by the
gas turbine, even if superposed to the basic load, shall remain below the air qualitv
limit values in any of the settlements, the expected emissions of the power plant shall
not result in a pemicious pollution load to the environment.
Soil quality, quality of surface and subsurface waters
Soil quality may potentially be affected by the oil manipulations (transportation.
racking, storage and feeding), as well as by the contact with wastes. The nonnal
operation of the plant - thanks to the applied technical protective solutions - shall have
no negative impact on the soil.

Thanks to the geological conditions of the area, we need not to count with the
contamination of the subsurface waters, however, the technical solutions serving for
the protection of the soil shall also serve for the protection of the subsurface waters.
In the plant area there are no surface water flow, water extraction or water discharge.
The communal a.d fire water demand of the plant shall be satisfied by a branching
from the drinking water pipeline supplying the sub-station with water. Demi water.
required for the additional water supply used for the cooling system and, if required.
for the reduction of the NOx emission of the gas turbines, shall be transported by road,
in tank-trucks.
During the provisional stay of the operating staff in the power plant approx. I cu.m
communal waste water may produce per month. It shall be collected in a closed waste
water reservoir and then transported for disposal.
Communal wastes shall consist of the generating organic wastes and the packing
materials of the auxilAary materials. Their volume shall be about 2 cu.m per year. They
shall be collected together with the communal wastes of the sub-station. They shall be
transported for disposal by the local company of public hygiene.
The hazardous wastes generating during the operation of the power plant consist of
various used oils, oily rags, oil absorbents, used storage batteries and filter elements.
Hazardous wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall
temporarily be stored in a special hazardous waste storage place in the plant area. They
shall be disposed by licensed companies specialized for this activity.

Impacts of the noise emission during the operation of the power plant
The potential suppliers have been informed, that the sound pressure level measured at a
distance of I m from the container units to be installed, respectively from the buildings
may not exceed 85 dB(A). By this noise emission value we have determined the noise
load caused by the projected power plant. According to calculations, the noise
emission of the power plant shall increase the noise load of the dwelling houses to be
protected with respect to the current noise load, but it shall not cause excess values
neither in day-time nor during the night.
Impacts on human health in the environment
The environmental impacts of the projected power plant - taking into consideration tne
basic loads, too - shall remain below the limit values with respect to human health in
any of the settlements of the impact area. thus the operation of the projected power
plant shall not have a pernicious impact on the health of the residents.
Social-economical impacts
The development concept of the power plant is in harnony with the objectives of the
Hungarian energy policy.
In January 1996 - based on the approved "Public information program" - the investors
started the information of the great public. Based on the opinions voiced during the
public hearing of February 23, 1996 in Sajoszoged. and the data of the second follow-
up public opinion poll it can be stated, that the majority of the concemed population
supports the investment project.

With regard to the great interest of the public, the investor, during the licensing
procedure, shall keep informed the concerned municipalities about the most important
decisions associated with the projected power plant (for example the selection of the
technology, the fuel material, the final plant site, etc.) and shall ensure an access for
the municipality to the public documents in connection with the projected power plant
and for the public the possibility of inspection nd making comments.
Ecological impacts
Since the ecosystems are very complex systems, the estimation of the impacts caused
by the environmental changes is very difficult. The projected power plant may have an
impact on the flora and fauna through airborne emissions. The impact of the power
plant shall superpose on the impact of the air pollution originating from the
neighboring industrial areas, and cannot be separated from it.
Irnpacts on the landscape
The landscape shall not significantly be influenced by the sight of the power plant.
since the neighboring sub-station already gives an industrial character to the area. With
regard to the general appearance of the projected facility, it shall fit to the existing
buildings of the sub-station. The gas turbines shall have an 51 (40) m stack(s). After
the completion of the building works, the area shall be grassed.
11/8.3.5 Expected impacts of decommissioning
The projected life time of the power plant is 30 years. After the shut-down of the plant
the equipment shall be disassembled and transported from the site. The dismounted
machine equipment can be recycled (iron scrap). The underground concrete structures
shall remain in place. No waste shall remain on the site.

After deconmiissioning the area shall be arranged and grassed. The landscape shall be
restored according to the original status, however, the current use of land (ploughland)
can possibly not be restored.
The expected impacts of decommissioning are similar to those of the construction
period, but somewhat smaller. We have to count primarily with air pollution and noise
caused by dismounting works and transportation. During decommissioning no negative
impact or contamination may occur to the waters and the soil of the area.
Decommissioning and the cease of air pollution shall have a favorable influence on
the flora and fauna of the region by all means. After decommissioning only the
underground engineering structures shall remain in the site. In case of a complete
decommissioning these structures shall not mean "traps" which may cause damage to
the ecology of the region.

II/8A Environmental measures
Protection of air quality
In order to reduce the emission of nitrogen-oxides, water shall be injected into the
combustion chamber of the gas turbine, which shall reduce the temperature at the
critical points from the point of view of NOx generation. This solution may
significantly reduce the volume of the generating nitrogen-oxides.
The limit values of sulfur-dioxide emission can be met by the proper selection of the
fuel material.
Soil and water protection
The generating communal waste water shall be collected and treated in a closed waste
water reservoir, and then transported for disposal.
The technical solutions (oil-resistant tray at the oil racking station and under the
pipelines and fittings, a reinforced concrete protective ring for the tanks) shall prevent
thc oil from spilling onto the soil.
An oil trap shall be built for the collection of oily waters running down from the access
road of the racking station, as well as for the collection of the oils spilling at the gas
turbine units. Oily waters shall be cleaned in an oil separator. The oil concentration of
the water discharging from the separator shall not exceed 2 mg/l. The separated oil
shall be pumped into a container and then transported for disposal.

The applied technology and the monitoring system shall immediately detect the
leakages of the fuel and lubricating systems, and shall ensure the corrective measures
without delay, thus minimizing the losses and the possibility of the environmental
damages.
Wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall temporarily be
stored in a separate storage place in the plant. They shall be remediated by a licensed
company specialized for this activity.
Noise protection
In the projected power plant the noise protection shall be ensured by silencers, by
special sound insulations and by the light-structure casing.
