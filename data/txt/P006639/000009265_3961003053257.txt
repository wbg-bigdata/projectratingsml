OANDUM AND RIMRCOONDuATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECON     TION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILS
FOR A HNLMTH SECTOR IEFORM PRCJBCT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$90 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years, including 5
years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate and charges. The
Republic of Chile would be the Borrower and the Ministry of Health (HOH) would
be the executing agency.
2.                 T. he promotion of social justice with macroeconomic
stability and growth is the centerpiece of the Chilean Government's
development agenda. President Aylwin assumed office in early 1990 with a
platform focussed on poverty alleviation and economic growth. In 1991 Chile's
open economy, with robust private sector participation, grew by 6 percent; the
inflation rate declined significantly; the fiscal accounts were in surplus;
and the current account of the balance of payments for the first time in many
years also registered a surplus. This notable performance was fueled in part
by a strong growth in exports, mainly non-copper products. Within the
strictly guarded constraints of a balanced fiscal budget, the Government has
started to enhance the quality and efficiency of key social programs as a
means to assure access of the less privileged to select basic needs,
particularly health and education services. Public expenditures in 1991
increased at a real rate of 12 percent benefitting largely the social sectors.
3.        Chile's social development over the last three decades has been
impressive. While Chile's GMP per capita of US$2,129 in 1990 places it among
lower-middle-income countries, its social indicators are comparable to those
in developed countries. Chile's average life expectancy at birth is 72 years,
the infant mortality rate is 16/1,000, and less than 1 percent of children
under six suffer from moderate or severe malnutrition. In the 1980s, Chile
aspired to redefine the role of the state, decentralize primary health care
responsibilities to the municipalities, promote private sector participation,
and target public health and nutrition expenditures to low-income groups.
However, serious imbalances and resource use inefficiencies continue to
constrain health sector productivity, efficiency, and service quality.
4.        The Chilean health system has also been slow in responding to a
changing epidemiological profile characterized by a prevalence of chronic
diseases and injuries associated with an aging population. This emerging
demand for more complex care would further strain the sector' s scarce
resources. Major sector problems include the lack of complementarity between
the distinct levels of care; low internal efficiency in service delivery,
particularly within the public hospital network; distortions in pricing and in
the pattern of health services utilization resulting from the mode of
financing health services; and limitations in the institutional and manpower
capability of the IOH and its autonomous agencies. Imbalances in health
facility investmeats also emerged in the past decade. sector investments were
channelled mainly for expansion of the primary health care network,
emphasizing the construction of health facilities without matching efforts to



-2-
improve their technical capacity. In contrast, maintenance expenditures and
new inveetments in secondary and tertiary care facilities practically came to
a halt in the 1980s. The consequent physical plant deterioration and
equipment obsolescence in the hospital network and the lack of specialized
ambulatory facilities have resulted in inadequate backup for primary care and
dependence on emergency care at the tertiary level hospitals.
S.        In December 1991, the Bank approved a US$27 million loan for a
Technical Assistance and Hospital Rehabilitation Project (TAHRP) to assist the
Government in defining and pilot-testing health policy and institutional
reforms, as well as financing urgent small-scale hospital rehabilitation works
in Metropolitan Santiago. Part of the TMHRP financed the preparatory studies
for the proposed Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP). The Government has
accepted many of the recommendations of the TAHRP studies. Among others, the
Government would reorganize the health care delivery system to bridge the gap
between primary and secondary care by establishing specialized outpatient
services to support referrals from primary care levels. The new health care
model would provide a much needed sector investment framework. The Government
has also started to pilot test a new health financing scheme (i.e., payment
associated with diagnosis, PADs) for secondary and tertiary care. A proposed
finacing scheme for primary care (prospective per capita payment) has been
incorporated in a draft law being discussed in the Chilean Congress. Other
decisions on sector policy and strategy, as well as the facility investments
for a new health care model, would be implemented with the support of the
proposed HSRP.
6.        Rationale fo Bank Xnvolvement. The Bank would support the
Government's objective to develop a responsive and efficient health sector.
The Bank's major role, apart from provision of investment financing per se,
would be to encourage the Government to forge al'sad with its analysis, pilot
test, and subsequent implementation of many policy and institutional changes,
which are also of paramount interest to health sector development in many
other middle-income and developed countries.
7.        The Bank' s lediRg assistance to the sector is through a two-stage
operation. First, the TAMRP is assisting the Government in responding to
urgent, mall hospital rehabilitation needs in Metropolitan Santiago (e.g.
repair of pavilions, bathrooms, roofs, kitchens, laundry rooms, etc.) while
supporting the definition and pilot-testing of critical policy reforms for the
entire country. Second, a policy-based investment aperation, the proposed
NSRP would assist in the implementation of chosen policy and institutional
reform measures and in financing investment requ?rements for the modernization
of health services delivery in Metropolitan Santiago, Antofagasta and
Llanchipal. Through these operations, the Bank would actively participate in
the policy discussions in the sector. Also, the policy reforms being adopted
would serve as a framework for mobilizing complementary resources from other
donors, as well as for the Government's own investments in other areas of the
country. The Bank's involvement thus ensures that sector investments would be
accompanied by much-neaded system-wide policy reforms.
S.        The proposed project is in line with the country assistance
strategy to alleviate poverty within a tightly managed fiscal policy. It



-3-
would also enable the Bank to support the Chilean Government' s implementation
of sector reforms that are germane to health sector development in many
middle-income and developed countries. The Bank's interactions on policy
issues with the Government has been an essential focus of project development.
Project work has drawn extensively on Bank experience in other countries.
Dank staff from the Latin America Technical Department, the Asia Human
Resources Division, and specialists on health issues have participated not
only in the preparation of the project but also in intensive technical
discussions with Chilean officials. The project would help finance a slice of
the sector's investment program, complementing the ongoing nIB and bilateral
a         assistance, as well as Government-financed investments.  Bank assistance in
the projqct areas would benefit largely the indigent and low-income population
as these are the major users of the public hospital system. The public
-         hospitals in Metropolitan Santiago also cater to low-income patients from
other regions of the country. The improvement in the quality of health
services of the public hospitals would proceed in tandem with the
implementation of an improved cost recovery system.
9.        Proiect Objectives.  The project would assist the Government to
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of resource use in the public health
system, as well as improve the quality of health services in selected areas.
it aims, among others, to achieve an improved balance in the public health
care delivery system, continuing the traditional focus on maternal and child
health care while responding more effectively to the changing health needs of
adults and the elderly. Specifically, it would: (a) strengthen the
decentralization of he-lth services delivery partly through reforms in MOH's
mission and organizaticAal structure, delegation of service delivery to the
Health Service Areas (HSAs) through management contracts, and enhancement of
the sYstem of generating and transferring financing resources; (b) upgrade the
institutional organization and management capacity for procuring and
distributing drugs and food supplements, as well for the quality control of
drugs and food products; (c) improve the management and clinical skills of
health personnel, as well as the sector management and health information
system; and (d) implement a new health care model to develop specialized
ambulatory services at the secondary and tertiary levels, improve the
seriously deteriorated conditions of selected hospitals, and fill the health
services gaps in eight HSAs in Metropolitan Santiago, Antofagasta, and
Lianchipal. These proposed actions would integrate health services delivery
by effectively supporting primary care, and increasing the responsiveness of
the health care system to the changing needs of the Chilean population.
10.       Prolect Descrintion. The project has four principal components:
(A) Degentralization of Health serviaes Delivery (about 15 percent of the
total project costs), which would finance consultant services, computer
hardware and software, and operating costs for (i) the MOH reorganization;
(ii) the gradual implementation of annual management contracts (Service
Provision Agreement) between the MOH and selected HSAs establishing the type
and volume of services to be provided by the NSA and the level of resources to
be channeled to the HSA; (iii) the conversion of the Central Supply Pacility
(CSF) into an autonomous public enterprise; (iv) the strengthening of the
institute of Public Health (ISP); (v) training of sector personnel; and (vi)



-4-
the upgrading of sector management and health information system. (B) Facility
Znestmengs f_r a New Health Cga  Model (82 percent of the total project
costs) which would finance civii works, equipment and incremental recurrent
expenditures to enhance the integration of the health service6 delivery in
eight RSAs by: (i) establishing ambulatory care centers (Centro de Referencia
de Salud _CRS. and -Centro de Diganstico v Terapeutico.'CDT) at the secondary
and tertiary level complementing the primary care services; and (ii)
rehabilitating or constructing, as needed, hospital facilities to fill
identified gaps in the health services delivery network in Metropolitan
Santiago, Antofagasta and Llanchipal. (C) SuM=ort for S2ecial Programs (0.8
percent of total project cost) which would finance equipment and operating
costs for the implementation of two special programs: (i) enhancement of
coverage and quality of the Cervical Cancer Program; and (ii) pilot test of an
Environmental Health Education Program. (D) Prolect Adeiniatration (about 1.5
percent of total project cost), which would finance consultant services and
operating costs of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU).
11.       The project would be implemented over a six year period.  The total
project cost is estimated at US$298.8 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$124.6 million (42 percent of the total cost). The
Bank loan of USs90 million would finance about 37 percent of total project
cost net of ta.As and duties. Retroactive financing of up to US$5.6 million
(5* of the loan) would be granted for expenditures incurred after February 15,
1992. Retroactive financing would allow the early start of the detailed
design of some inotitutional and policy reforms, the hiring of short-term
consultants to supervise the design of medical facilities, the refurbishing of
some hospital facilities, e.g. emergency unit of the Hospital San Ramon, and
equipment purchase for ISP and the Cervical Cancer Program. A breakdown of
project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group cperations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Naps and Staff Appraisal Report No. 10987-CH are also attached.
12.       Prolect Sustainabilitv.  The required financing for the proposed
project including the incremental recurrent cost and the detailed expenditure
schedule has been reviewed extensively and agreed to by the Ministry of
Finance (80F). In fact, the Government chose to finance a higher share of the
project cost reflecting its ability to absorb a significant demand for both
local and foreign exchange resource requirements.  Chile's steady economic
expansion and record of tight fiscal discipline bode well for its continued
capacity to sustain the required expenditures beyond the project period.
During negotiations, the Government furnished the Bank a Health Policy Letter
outlining the Government's medium-term goals for the sector, the sector reform
program, and the implications of these reforms on sector financing. Also, a
financial simulation zodel developed for the sector using different
assumptions for macroeconomic and health financing parameters showed that
projected public financing for the sector to the year 2000 could support the
incremental recurrent expenditures implied by the programmed sector
investments.



13.       I=JemsntpJrM, xra=wments. MOM would be responsible for overall
implementation assisted by a PCU. The policy and institutional reforms,
personnel training, and information system upgrading would be implemented
nationwide. Implementation of the hospital and ambulatory care facility
construction and rehabilitation would be delegated to eight HSAs in
Metropolitan Santiago, Antofagasta, and Llanchipal.    -
14.      Agreed Actions. Durina neaotiatiqns, the Government furnished the
Bank: (a) a guideline for the execution and content of a prototype Service
Provision Agreement; (b) the above mentioned Health Policy Letter; and (c) a
Winisterial Resolution amending the PCU organixation and functions to include
its responsibilities under the HSRP. 2uring negiations. assurances were
obtained for the following actions, among others: (a) the new MOR structure
and functios vould be in operation on or before July 1, 1993; (b) the
Government would carry out specific actions and/or studies related to, among
others, the implementation of the Service Provision Agreement, the
transformation of CSF into an autonomous public enterprise, the modernization
of ISP's production functions and supply system, and the completion of the
manpower planning methodology for the HSAs, by the dates agreed with the Bank;
(c) no later than March 1, 1993 the Government would start carrying out a
program to recruit and reassign staff; and review with the Bank not later than
June 15 and December 15 of each year starting June 15, 1993 the progress of
carrying out such program; and (d) no later than August 31 of each year, the
Government and the Bank would review the availability of staff and the amounts
required to carry out the project for the following year; not later than
October 1 of each year, the Government would furnish the Bank for its comments
the proposed public sector health budget for the next succeeding year; and (e)
a hid-Term Review would be held no later than June 30, 1995. Agreement was
reached during negotiations on the principal monitoring and evaluation
indicators to be used for project implementation reviews.
15.       Conditions of Loan Effectiveness include- (a) adoption of the HSRP
Implementation Manual, the PCU Operations Manual, the Environmental Health
Bducation Program Implementation Manual and the Training Instructions Manual;
and (b) establishment of the MDR Training Secretariat. The signing of an
umbrella Subsidiary Agreement and a specific activity agreement between the
MOH and the participating institutions (e.g. RSAs, the CSF, and the ISP), with
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, would be a gondition of
disbursnent for each project activity.
16.        nvlrom ental Iact.  The project was classified as "El to draw
attention to the need for standard safety procedures to be followed in the
implementation of the civil works, and the installation and operation of the
medical equipment supplied under the project. The Government furnished the
Bank an action plan to address these concerns. Also, procedures for safe
handling of hazardous wastes and materials (e.g., disposable needles) would be
included in continuing education programs for health personnel. Moreover, the
project's environmental health ccmponent would enhance the public's awareness
of the health effects of environmental conditions in the country.
17.       Rxrected Benefits and Risks.  By supporting critical policy and
institutional reforms and priority health facility investments, the project,



-6-
in conjunction with the on-going TAMRP, would help lmprove the efficiency of
resource use in the public health sector, enhance the quality of ambulatory
and inpatient care, strengthen the capacity of the system to respond more
effectively to the health needs of an aging population, and increase the
complementarity of public and private providers. The project facility
investments are eptimated to benefit approximately 40 percent (about 5.0
million) of the Chilean population mostly belonging to the indigent and low-
ineome groups. The sector reforms intended to increase the health system'e
efficiency coupled with improvements in cost recovery measures would generate
benefits nationwide in the long-term. An integrated health services network
and improved delivery of cost-effective health c4re interventions would help
diminish mortality and morbidity from chronic diseases and injuries. Also, the
project's support for an increased coverage of the Cervical Cancer Program
would generate specific benefits directed towards women.
16.       The major risks include: (a) the complex reform3 in health
financing; (b) the reforms' long-term horizon with full implementation
anticipated towards the end of the Government' s tenure or during the next
administration; and (c) the lack of project implementation experience of some
H5As aad hospital managers. These risks would be minimized by the Bank's
close supervision at the different stages of reform execution; institution of
a Kid-Term Project Review by the Bank and the Government to evaluate
implementation progress; and technical assistance and supervision to be
provided by the PCM to the HSAs, as well as the training under the project.
Also, the ongoing TAHRP implementation is providing valuable hands-on training
on project management to HSAs that would be involved in this project.
19.       RecXmmendati2na.  I am satisfied that the propesed loan would
ccmply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and reccomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
