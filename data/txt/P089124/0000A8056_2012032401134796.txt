                         The team's overall impression is that the Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) remains on track towards reaching its development objectives. The implementation of the CEP
                         Additional Financing, which is focused on enhanced access to finance, has visibly gathered speed since the beginning of year 2011, as credit demand from exporting enterprises has
                         steadily built up. The Additional Financing (AF) has been experiencing strong demand from enterprises for its credit line component, as well as for the matching grant component, as
                         economic conditions in Moldova improved and enterprises enjoyed higher profitability. The strong demand for loans from the CEP AF credit line and the gradual streamlining of

                         procurement and environmental assessment procedures by the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) have pushed the implementation and disbursement time-line forward and by
                         the end of 2011 the credit line component has been fully completed, more than 6 months ahead of schedule. The process was also aided by the active involvement and coordination
                         activities of the Credit Line Directorate and the Project Implementation Unit. Due to these positive evolutions, the pace of the Project implementation has accelerated overall, and the
                         disbursements have been growing steadily as of end-2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Notwithstanding the progress to date and the CEP AF implementation ahead of schedule, in its communication with the client the team underscored the importance of accelerating
                         the implementation of ongoing activities under the original project in order to improve the lagging disbursement ratio. As of end of November 2011, approximately USD 8.9 million was
                         disbursed out of the USD 14.24 millionallocated to the CEP. That provides for a 63% disbursement rate, which remains well below expectations. The team agreed with the Ministry of
                         Economy (MoE) on a time-bounded list of actions to be implemented in the near term in order to accelerate CEP disbursements, including implementation steps to move forward with
                         procurement of metrological equipment for the flow, mass and length laboratories of the National Institute for Standards and Metrology.

                         In December 2011, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) requested an extension of the CEP closing date by one year, from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. In addition, following the
                         completion of the Credit Line under CEP AF and due to sustained high demand from enterprises for long-term competitively priced funding and eagerness of PFIs to continue working
                         with World Bank credit line resources, the MoE and MoF inquired about the possibility of topping up the current Credit Line, as part of the CEP project closing date extension request.
                         The World Bank, in close cooperation with the Client, will need to decide on whether such a project closing date extension can be granted and whether Additional Financing of the
                         Credit Line is possible.
