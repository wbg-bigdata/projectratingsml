SECOND LILONGWE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:       Republic of Malawi
Beneficiaries:  Lilongwe Water Board, Ministry of Local Government, and
Lilongwe City Council
Amount:         SDR 16.6 million (US$20.0 million equivalent)
Terms:          Standard IDA terms
Relending
Terms:          The Government will onlend US$19.4 million equivalent to
the Lilongwe Water Board (LWB) at a rate of interest of 11
percent per annum, for a period of 25 years, including six
years grace, during which period the interest due to the
Malawi Government would be capitalized. The Government
would bear the exchange rate risk. The onlending rate is
expected to be positive in real terms over the life of the
project.
Project
Description:    The objectives of the project are to extend and improve the
water supply system of Lilongwe, Malawi's capital city, to
strengthen LWB's management and operational efficiency, and
to study future options for Lilongwe's water disposal and
sanitation systems. The project includes construction of a
new earthfill dam, remedial works on an existing dam,
extension of the water treatment plant and of the water
distribution system, training and management staff support
for LWB, and feasibility sWudies on Lilongwe's sanitation
and sewerage systems. The project would provide safe water
for an additional 110,000 inhabitants of Lilongwe.
Risks:          The main risk is that LWB would not generate enough revenue
to ensure its financial viability. To minimize this risk,
the project is based on conservative demand forecasts. The
Government, in line with its overall policy regarding
financial self-sufficiency of parastatals, has agreed to
permit LWB to increase water charges as needed so as to be
financially self-supporting.

LILONGWE SECOND WATFR SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Country Background 1/
1.01      Malawi is a small, landlocked country in Southeastern Africa that
covers an area of 118,500 square kilometers with a population of 7.06
million in 1985. The country's major assets are moderately fertile soils,
substantial water resources and a climate that is ideal for crop
production. Three quarters of the land area of Malawi form plateau zones
(the southern extension of the Gxeat Rift Valley system) with altitudes
varying between 800 meters and 1,400 meters. Unlike its reighbors, Malawi
has no substantial explored mineral resources.
1.02      Although one of the world's poorest countries, Malawi, with a per
capita GNP of US$210 (1983), recorded significant achievements over the
last two decades. Between 1967 and 1979, the Malawi economy displayed
vigorous growth. Real GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5 percent per
annum, corresponding to a per capita income growth rate of nearly 3.0
percent per annum. During the same period, gross dorestic investment (GDI)
increased at an annual rate of 12.5 percent, raising investment's share of
GDP to 29 percent in 1979 from below 15 percent in lQ67. Meanwhile,
domestic savings rate rose from 4 percent of GDP in 1967 to 17 percent in
1979, increasing the share of investment financed from domestic rescurces
to about 60 percent. Over the 1967-79 period, export volume grew at an
annual rate of 4.5 percent, while import volume grew at 3.5 percent.
The impressive growth was achieved, despite limited natural and human
resources, through a realistic Government economic policy that encouraged
export-oriented agricultural and agro-industrial growth. The overall
policies of the Government provided an attractive environment for
investments by foreign capital and private entreprises.
1.03      However, in recent years the growth of the economy has been
checked by: (a) a rapid rise in import prices (particularly fuel, capital
goods, and intermediate goods) and swings in export prices of tobacco, tea
and sugar, resulting in a 40% fall in Malawi's terms of trade between
1977-1980; (b) droughts in 1980 and 1981 which caused a decline in export
volume and forced the country to import maize in large quantities; and (c)
the rising external transport costs dte to increasing ocean freight
charges, port congestion in Mozambique and Tanzania and disruption of rail
1/   The Bark's country economic memoranda of February 8, 1982 "Growth and
Structural Change: A Basic Economic Report (No. 3082a-MAI), and of
October 4, 1985 "Economic Recovery: Resource and Policy Needs, An
Economic Memorandum (report No. 5801-MAI) give a detailed analysis of
Malawi's economy and its future prospects. The following summary
country background Is drawn from both reports.



traffic from Beira and Nacala in Mozambique, Malawi's traditional
entry ports. As a result of these difficulties, between 1978 and 1981, the
country experienced a period of: rising current account deficits in the
balance of payments; a rising debt service ratio; a sharp decline in GDP
growth rates that reached a low of -5.2 percent in 1981; declining GDS and
GDI rates; and rising Government budgetary deficits.
1.04      The crisis revealed important structural weaknesses in the
Malawi economy. First, there was an acute lack of export diversification
with a high dependence on tobacco, tea and sugar whose prices on the
international markets are subject to wide fluctuations. Second, low
producer prices slowed down the growth in smallholder agricultural
production. Third, the finances and management of key parastatals and
quasi-public institutions deteriorated thereby placing an added financial
burden on the Government. Fourth, as tne fiscal position weakened, the
Government encountered difficulties in meeting recurrent costs of projects
financed by external assistance. Fifth, price controls weakened production
incentives in the manufacturing, service and agricultura', sectors.
Finally, public administration needed to be strengthened if it was to deal
efficiently and effectively with a crisis on this scale.
1.05      Tb cope with these problems, the Government prepared a structural
adjustment program in consultation with the Bank and the IMF, covering the
period 1981/82-1985/86.  The progrc  was supported by a series of
structural adjustment loans from the Bank and stand-by arrangements by the
Fund and was designed to: encourage diversification of production and
exports; improve performance of the productive sectors through the
formulation of appropriate policies and incentives; rehabilitate,
restructure and strengthen key institutions to achieve improvements in
planning and coordination; and, improve resource mobilization in the public
sector.
1.06      Malawi carried out the structural adjustment ptogram under SAL I
and SAL II with considerable success, and implementation of SAL III is well
under way. As a result of the improved policy environment, more favorable
climatic conditions and better export prices, the Malawian economy began to
recover in 1983/84. The balance of payments deficits on the current
account was steadily reduced, despite rising interest charges, increased
transportation costs, and declines in external capital flows. The
Government's budget as a percentage of GDP was also reduced significantly
with healthy revenue increases and fiscal discipline. Although estimates
indicate that Malawi's economic recovery eltwed in 1985, it is expected
that with continued implementation of the Government's SAL program, growth
of per capita income can resume and financial equilibrium restored.
Prospects over the next five years are for modest growth rates of per
capita income as the economy continues to face serious constraints whicb
include: scarcity of trained manpower; a fast rate of population growth
relative to GDP growth; very high transportation costs, and a very low
per capita income that limits the levels of domestic saving and
investments.

Water Resources
1.07      Malawi has substantial water resources.  About one quarter of the
country is covered by lakes, with Lake Malawi being by far, the largest.
Seventy percent of the country drains into Lake Malawi or the Shire River
(the lake's only outlet). Malawi has distinct wet and dry seasons. The
wet season lasts from November to May with slight regional variations.
Average annual rainfall is about 1,200 mm but varies widely, ranging from
around 600 mm to about 3,000 mm. Because of the variations in altitude
(from about 200 m to about 2,500 m above sea level), Malawi experiences a
wide range of climatic conditions from tropical to temperate, producing
conditions that are ideal for the production of a wide range of
agricultural crops.
1.08      There is ample surface water in the lakes (Malawi, Chilwa and
others), the Shire River system and other minor rivers. However, supply to
a great extent is dependent on the rainfall which has marked seasonality
and wide variation in total annual precipitation from year to year.
Apart from the lakes and rivers, surface water in Malawi is stored in
reservoirs of dams built for water supply and conservation purposes. These
include the water supply dams at Blantyre, Kamuzu Dam on the Lilongwe
River, small reservoirs at Kasungu, Zomba (Mulungushi), Lifupa, Tedzani
barrage and many other small dams in the tea growing areas.   However,
total storage capacity is not significant relative to the available water
resources.
1.09      Groundwater is widely available from dug wells and boreholes in
three hydrogeological zones: Plateau-Highland, Escarpment and the Rift
Valley alluvial Plains. Over most of the plateau areas, the geological
formation is basement complex that is largely drained by "dambos" (broad,
grass-covered, swampy areas with no defined channels). The highlands have
little potential for groundwater supplies due to the steep slopes. A study
"The Ground Water Resources of Malawi" was carried out in 1983 by ODA and
the Department of Water (then Department of Lands, Valuation and Water) to
assess Malawi's water resources. The study indicated that the available
groundwater resources in Malawi have sufficient recharge to support the
relatively low level of groundwater abstraction needed to meet present and
future medium-term domestic water requirements of smaller settlements. The
development of groundwater resources in Malawi has in the past been
primarily for rural domestic use and fringe irrigation from boreholes and
dug wells. By i982 there were, altogether, 5,500 boreholes (with about 10
percent having been abandoned), the majority of which were equipped with
handpumps (about 10 percent motorpumps). According to the report,
groundwater development in the immediate future will continue to be
principally for rural domestic supplies because due to a widely dispersed
population and the consequent high cost of distribution, only 25 percent of
the rural population can be served by the rural piped-water supply program
from surface sources.
Sector Legislation and Institutions
1.10      The provision of piped water in Malawi is governed by the
Waterworks Act of 28 April 1q26, The Act has, since then, undergone



- 4 -
several amendments, the latest having been made in 1971. Supplemental
legislative instruments, the Blantyre Waterworks Act and the Lilongwe
Waterworks Proclamation of 1984, provide guidance for the provision of
water in the cities of Blantyre and Lilongwe, respectively. The objective
of tb-i Blantyre Waterworks Act and the Lilongwe Waterworks Proclamation is
to strengthen the mandate of both Water Boards and provide them with
autonomy to be financially self-supporting organizations,operating on sound
commercial basis and be able to efficiently supply water to users in both
cities. Overall, the legislative instruments provide an adequate framework
within which the agencies responsible for water supply can operate
effectively, even though their budget and appointment of senior staff are
still subject to Ministerial approval.
1.11      The organization of the water supply and sanitation sector in
Malawi was until recently fragmented. Until about 1972, the low level of
activity hid the duplication of effort by the various Government of Malawi
agencies involved in the sector. However, the increase in the level of
activity during the 1970s highlighted the need to rationalize activities.
In 1979, the first comprehensive reorganization of the management of
activities in the sector was undertaken leading to the creation of the
Department of Lands, Valuations and Water (DLVW) in the Ministry of Works
and supplies (M4WS). DLVW later split up to the Department of Water (DOW),
and the Department of Lands and t'aluation (DLV) to become a separate
department within the MMWS. Currently, there are three major institutions
dealing with water supply in Malawi: the Department of Water; the Blantyre
Water Board (BWB) and the Lilongwe Water Board (LWB). The Ministry of
Health and the Office of the President and Cabinet have minor, mainly
supervisory, roles in the sector.
1.12      The Department of Water has primary responsibility for developing
and managing water resources throughout Malawi, except in the
municipalities of Blantyre and Lilongwe. The Department plans and
implements rural and urban water systems in other urban centers besides
providing untreated but protected piped water to rural areas wherever and
whenever feasible. The Department currently operates more than 59 urban
and institutionl water supply systems in the country and has constructed
more than 40 rural piped water supply schemes. The Department works
closely with the 24 District Development Committees in its rural water
supply schemes. Besides water supply, the DOW is r,sponsible for water
resource planning and water pollution control, provides training for its
lower level staff and technical assistance to the Lilongwe Water 'Roard.
The latter service to LWB is in the process of being phased-out. The
Department uses its own staff to plan and implement water supply projects
in the smaller towns and the rural areas, but needs to retain consultants
and/or external assistance at times, to do more extensive, complex works in
the larger cities. Currently, UNDP is assisting DOW draw-up a Water
Resources Master Plan for Malawi, while ODA in 1982 helped DOW carry out a
groundwater study.
1.13      The Blantyre Water Board (BWB) is an autonomous statutory body
responsible for water supply in the city of Blantyre. BWB has a reputation
for good management. It uses local staff, with a few expatriate managers,



to plan, design, supervise minor construction, operate and maintain a large
and fairly sophisticated water eupply system. BWB appoints or awards
contracts to consultants for larger engineering designs and supervision of
construction. BWB is responsible to DOW for the technical review of
development plans and to the Controller of Statutory Bodies in the Office
of the President and Cabinet for the review of financial planning, budgets
and expenditure.
1.14      The Lilongwe Water Board (LWB) has responsibilities for Lilongwe,
similar to BWB, except that DOW still provides some technical assis.ance in
planning, design, and construction supervision. The organization of LWB,
the executing agency of the project's water supply component, is described
under paras. 4.02-4.06. LWB's management has considerably imprived since
the beginning of the Water Supply Engineering Project. To further Improve
the situation, substantial management staff support and training components
will be included in the proposed project.
Water Supply and Sewerage Systems
1.15      Malawi's population is estimated at 7.06 million (in 1985), with
a population growth of about 3.2 percent per annum. The urban population,
contributing about 12 percent of the total population is growing at a rate
of about 6 percent. About A3 percent of the urban population has access to
safe water. In Blantyre, the Blantyre Water Board (BW`B) serven ahout
360,000 people through some 14,000 connections and 50 kiosks, produclng an
average of about 45,000 m3 per day water.  Piped water supply was made
available in about 50 smaller urban centers in the last decade.
1.16      About 42 percent of the rural population estimated at h.iq
mill :n has access to safe water from piped gravity systems, boreholes and
dug oells, and private or institutional supplies.  Self-help. schemes are
making a significar,t contribution to the improved wattr supplies in the
rural area. District development committees initiate a varie.y of small
scale projects, including gravity systems, wells and hand pump schemes.
While the committees rely on go ernment for advise and trainings, the key
to the success of the projects has been the active contr4butlon of the
community, providing labor, part of the funds and ma,ntenance of the
components, allocating responsibilities among villagers. Such projects
have been attracting substsntial external support from both go-vernment and
volunteer agencies.
1.17      About 15 percent of the urban population are connected to
community waste water systems, the remainder generally using septic tar.ks
and pit latrines. The Federal Republic of Germany has helpel to finance
Phase I and II of the Blantyre Sewerage Project. The city councils of
Blantyre and Lilongwe are responsible for providing sewer servicee to their
populations. In general, expansion of sewerage facil'ties has not kept
pace with urban development in Malawi.  To improve  nd expanLd alterrativJ,
low-cost sanitation (LCS) technologies, an LCS demonstration project has
been carried out under the Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Projert (Co
1272-MAI). Preparation of a Sanitation Feasibility Study for Lilongwe and
continuation of the LCS program is included in the proposed project, with
the full support of the government.



Cost Recovery
1.18      In accordance with Government's stated policy, the Blantyre and
Lilongwe Water Boards should be self supporting, including recovery of
capital costs. In order to achieve this goal, annual tariff increases were
introduced in Blantyre, coupled with measures to increase the operational
efficiency of the BWB. However, at an average tariff level of MK 0.62 per
m3, water sales grew only marginally in 1984 and 1985 in Blantyre. It was,
therefore, .eecded that no tariff increase would take place in 1985. The
rate of return on revalued net fixed assets varied between 3 and 5 percent
in the last three years. The recovery of construction and recurrent costs
in the rural areas has usually been limited to the provisioni of self-help
contribution. To improve cost recovery of groundwater based supplies, the
Government is modifying design and construction standards to minimize
investment and maintenance costs, supported by several externally financed
projects, including the Bank executed UNDP-financed Hand Pump Test
Project. Cost recovery for sewerage and sanitation is limited to Blantyre,
Lilongwe and Zomba, where costs are partially covered by direct charges on
households.
Manpower, and Training
1.19      The Government has, since independence, made considerable
progress in the provision of safe drinking water throughout rural and urban
Malawi. However, these developments have placed a severe strain on the
administrative and technical capabilities of the DOW, LWB, BWB and the
district water supply units, most of which are still heavily dependent on
expatriate staff and consultants. The strain is bound to increase when the
Government drafts an !.nvestment plan for the next decade based on the
proposals of the National Water Resourcts Master Plan that is being
compiled by DOW with assistance from the UNDP's Department of Technical
Cooperation for Development (final draft is expected in September, 1986).
The DOW does not have the administrative and technical capabilities to
coordinate with donor agencies for funding, and to supervise the
implementation of such a national water supply investment plan. There is
an urgent need to address at the national level the issue of manpower
training for the sector.   Although several manpower and training studies
of the sector have been conducted in recent years, little follow-up action
has been taken by central agencies to develop sector training capacity and
introduce needed local programs. However, the training program, developed
under the recently completed Blantyre Water Supply Project, has been
successfully implemented as part of a twinning arramgement with a U.K.
Waterwork Company, and assists, indirectly, the sector as a whole. To
strengthen LWB, the Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project(CR 1272-MAI)
included a technical assistance component aimed at improving management,
assist the Government to assess the sector's organizat!on, manpower and
training needs. The training component was a continuation of training
started under the credit for the Blantyre Water Supply 'roject (CR 711-MAI)
which also included an institutional development component. DOW and the
comptroller of statutory bodies, who also has supervisorr responsibilities



-7-
on budgetary and recruitment matters, carry co-ordinating functions for
training in the sector. The evolution and content of the training
component of the proposed project is described in more detail under paras.
4.11 through 4.13.
Previous Bank Group Projects
1.20      The Bank Group has, to date, financed a total of three water
supply and urban sector development projects. The first was in 1971, a
US$7.0 million Blantyre Water Supply Project (CR 711-MAI) for
the augmentation of water supply to Blantyre and strengthening BWB's
management and technical capabilities.   The project 's primary objectives
have been achieved and the credit was closed on September 30, 1984.
However, as highlighted in the Project Completion Report, due to the slower
than expected consumption growth, BWB's financial performance has been
below expectation. The financial rate of return for the years 1981-84 has
averaged 4.4% per annum and the economic rate of return 2.0% per annum as
compared with the projected 9.7% and 7.2% respectively. BWB's financial
viability was maintained through tightened management, and increased
operational efficiency, which were significant achievements during the
project implementation period. Average tariffs were raised from MK 0.20
per m3 in 1976 to MK 0.62 per m3 in 1986, which appears to be at the price
elasticity level. The Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project (CR
1272-MAI), which is currently under implementation, was designed to assist
the Government and LWB to formulate a long-range water supply, sewerage and
sanitation program for Lilongwe, prepare a feasibility study and detailed
engineering designs for the water supply extension, strengthen LWB through
improvements in management, financial and cost recovery capabilities, help
the Government develop low-cost technologies for sewerage and sanitation,
and assess the sector's organizational, manpower and training needs. The
First Urban Project (CR 1528-MAI) of November 27, 1984 focuses on sectoral
policy issues and provided for: development of market-based housing
alternatives; establishment of a financially viable basis for replicability
of the market-based program; strengthening of ancilliary functions in the
housing market; and assisting the Government to carry out a Housing
Subsidies and Wage Policy Study as a first step toward the phased
resolution of the issue of housing subsidies. The proposed Lilongwe Water
Supply Project is a demonstration of the Bank Group's continued support of
the water supply and urban sector in Malawi and will help provide the water
supply infrastructure necessary for Lilongwe's growth, and will assist to
lay the foundation of improved sanitation in Lilongwe and other urban
centers through the project's sanitation component. The Bank's further
role in the sector is discussed in paras. 1.21-1.22.
Sector Developments and Possible Constraints
1.21       In Malawi, domestic water supply is of primary importance in the
development and use of water resources. The Government made considerable
progress over the past 20 years in supplying water within reasonable
distance to the rural population. Current developments are expected to
extend water supply to nearly all the population of Blantyre and Lilongwe
by about 1990. However, due to rapid population growth new investment will



- 8 -
be required in the late 1990s. Recently completed and proposed water
supply projects will serve most of the population of the smaller urban
centers by the early 1990s. While it will be more difficult to provide
safe water in all the rural areas by the end of the decade the development
momentum of recent years is expected to continue. Progress will, however,
depend on adequate external financing and the ability of the Government to
allocate sufficient funds for recurrent expenditure. In spite of serious
budgetary constraints, the Government intends to ensure that essential
services are funded. The Bank will provide financial assistance for
high-priority, long-term water. supply projects, while increasing its
support for institutional development and for initiatives in low-cost,
low-maintenance technology. Assistance for institution building, which
began with the IDA-financed Blantyre Water Supply Project, and the Lilongwe
Water Supply Engineering Credit, will be extented in future Bank Group
operations, emphasizing manpower development, training and improvement in
administrative and financial management. The Bank will continue to
encourage the authorities to focus on cost-recovery issues.
II. THE PROJECT ARFA
Location and Features
2.01      The City of Lilongwe is situated at an elevation of 1100 m above
sea level in the central region of Malawi, some 130 km to the west of Lake
Malawi. In the early 1960's Lilongwe was a relatively small regional
center with a population of less than 20,000 people. A decision was made
in 1964/65 to relocate the Capital of Malawi from the Southern town of
Zomba to the more central town of Lilogwe. The decade following this
decision saw the population of Lilongwe rise to nearly 100,000 people and
current estimates put the 1986 population at 169,000. The City has been
planned as a fully integrated urban unit with provision being made for
government, commerce, industry, education, recreation etc. for a population
which it is projected, will approach 500,000 in the early years of the next
century. Physically the City is large covering 35 km from north to south
and 19 km from east to west. In 1983 a large, modern international airport
was opened in the northern suburbs and the steadily increasing volume of
air traffic has tended to accelerate the City's growth particularly in the
commercial sector.
2.02      The climate in Lilongwe is generally pleasant being without
extremes in the temperature and having two distinct seasons. The wet
season runs from October/November to March/April with an annual average
rainfall of 860 mm. Severe droughts are rare events and in 65 years of
records no year has had less than half the averge rainfall.
Existing Water Supply and Waste Disposal Systems
2.03      Lilongwe's principal source of water is an impounding reservoir
on the Lilongwe river some 26 km to the south west of the City. A number
of wells, boreholes and small streams providr some domestic water but in
terms of volume, though not, to their users, -heir contribution is
insignificant compared to that of the river. The reservoir was formed by



- 9 -
the construction of the Kamuzu dam in 1966 which is a composite structure
comprising a 15 m high central, free overfall, concrete gravity spillway
flanked by earthfill embankments. Concerns have been expressed over many
years as to the stability of the concrete section and the concerns have
been vindicated by investigations carried out in 1984/85. To achieve an
acceptable level of risk of structural failure the dam requires to be
strengthened and the crest level raised. The reservoir has an active
capacity of 4.5 million m3 and at the 1985 level of withdrawal (9.8 million
m3/annum for water supply and 5.3 million m3/annum for downstream users)
the frequency of failure to meet demand is about 1 in 4 years. The
drainage area upstream of the Kamuzu dam is about 760 kmZ and the river
system has a mean annual discharge of 4.8 m3/sec or 150 million m3/annum.
Thus with adequate regulation the river could satisfy water demands greatly
in excess of those currently being met.
2.04      Releases from the Kamuzu dam augment the river during times of
low natural flow and water is captured at the existing waterworks which is
situated in the Southern part of the town on the left bank of the river.
The works have a capacity (at overload) of 30,000 m3/day, which was
approximately the peak demand in 1985. The raw river water is treated by
conventional coagulation, upward flow clarification and rapid gravity
filtration followed by chlorine disinfection. The works were extended by
10,000 m3/day in 1984 and in 1985 the supply was virtually unrestricted for
the first time since 1978. Restrictions are likely to be necessary again
in 1986.
2.05      From the treatment works water is pumped east and west to two
distribution centers, Dedza and Livingstone. Each of these centers supply
local demand areas but in addition Livigstone despatches water by gravity
to the Northern booster station located near the new City Center. In turn
the Northern Booster station pumps water to Kanengo, the main distribution
center of the northern suburbs.
2.06      Part of the water received at Kanengo is again pumped northward
to a ground level service at Sandula which provides a gravity supply to a
ground level reservoir at the international airport and to a booster
station in the most northerly suburb of Lumbadzi. This recently
commissioned booster station pumps water to an elevated service tank which
then supplies Lumbadzi.
2.07      The existing and projected future service levels for sanitation
are shown below:



- 10 -
Current (1986)       Projected (1993)
Population    _       Population    %
Sewerage                 26,000    15           38,000    14
Septic Tanks             29,000    17           32,000    12
Pit Latrines             114,000    67         202,000    74
169,000   100         272,000   100
2.08      The Lilongwe City Council (LCC) is responsible for overall
development, operation and maintenance of the sewerage system and for
providing an emptying service for septic tanks and pit latrines. It is
also responsible in broad terms for ensuring that the city develops
adequate sanitation services to meet growth requirements. Construction of
latrines and septic tanks in the extensive Traditional Housing Areas are
the responsibility of the developer. There are LCC maintained separate
sewerage treatment plants currently in operation: three extended aeration
plants, two oxidation ditches and four stabilisation ponds serving about
26,000 people. There are also two privately operated extended aeration
plants.
2.09      The three major mechanical plants are in a poor state of repair
largely due to a lack of spare parts. This causes major pollution
problems: the Lilongwe river receives virtually untreated effluent from
these plants, which represents a major health hazard to many inhabitants
downstream who use the river water for washing and drinking. The septic
tank emptying fleet is not able to fully meet the demand due to
insufficient equipment. Many of the existing latrines are full or in an
unhygienic state due to poor maintenance.
2.10      Government is presently undertaking the first phase of an urban
cn-site sanitation demonstration program, funded partially from IDA Credit
1272-MAI, as part of the Master Plan activities. Support is provided by
the World Bank executed UNIP Project INT/81/047.  The first phase is
expected to finish by mid-1987 and would be followed by a second phase
under the proposed project.
Population Served and Standards of Service
2.11      Of Lilongwe's estimated population of 169,000 in 1986 about
100,000 people receive full water service from 9,000 metered private
connections. A further 50,000 purchase an average of 20 lcd from public
sales kiosks and some 20,000 rely upon wells and streams. Specific
consumption among the consumers with private connections varies widely with
garden irrigation in the dry season causing very high demands among the
more affluent. The overall annual average consumption for those using
piped water in 1985 was 136 lcd based upon sales recorded by the LW1.



- 11 -
2.12      The water quality is good and the incidence of water related
disease among those using pij.'d water is low. Since the completion of the
Kamuzu dam there has been no itOications of an increase in the incidence of
either bilharzia or malaria in th? Project area.
Population and Demand Projections
2.13      The Government Department of Toum and Country Planning and
Stanley International have conducted extensive studies of both current and
projected populations and the officially accepred figures are as follows:
Annual
Year      Population       Increase %
1982      134,000              6.0
1983      142,000              5.6
1984      150,000              6.7
1985      160,000              5.6
1986      169,000              4.8
1990      213,000              5.0
1995      272,000              5.0
2000      348,000              5.0
2005      444,000              5.0
The future water requirements of Lilongwe have been the subject
of detailed investigation by the engineering consultants (Stanley
International, Canada) and several scerarios were developed. The
projections adopted for the project (see also Annexes 1 and 7) are as
follows in terms of raw water abstraction from the Lilongwe river:
Average            Peak                           Average
Year      day x 103 m3       day x 103 m3       Z Loss         lcd
1985           21.8              30.5             29            153
1986           22.7              31.8             26            149
1987           23.4              32.8             23            144
1988           24.16             33.8             20            140
1989           24.9              34.9             17            135
1990           26.0              36.4             15            132
1995           38.7              54.2             15            142
1997           47.7              66.7             15            158
2000           61.1              85.5             15            175
2005           85.8             120.1             15            193
Important assumptions in the above projections are that average
per capita consumptions remain at their present levels untii 1990,.and that
ratio of peak to average demand is 1.4.  The LWB was able to provide an
unrestricted supply in 1985 for the first time since 1978 and recorded
sales averaged 19,400 m3/day with raw water abstraction averaging 26,900
m3/day and peaking at 32,000 m3/day. (These two figures are less accurate
than the first which is well substantiated.) This leads to the conclusion



- 12 -
that the averge demand for treated water in 1985 was corsiderably more than
projected in the above table.  The peak factor, on the other hand was only
1.2.
III.  THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      Malawi has made substantial progress since independence in the
provision of safe water but has given priority to Blantyre, to smaller
urban areas and to rural locations. The need for additional water supplies
for Lilongwe was first identified in 1978 through the Bank's Cooperative
Program with the World Health Organization (WHO) and a Cooperative Project
of the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) and WHO. As a
result, a number of short-term water supply extensions were implemented,
while the Government began to explore means of meeting Lilongwe's
long-range needs. Under the aegis of the International Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Decade, the UNDP in 1980 provided financing to carry
out prefeasibility studies for the long range development of Lilongwe's
water supply system and to prepare draft terms of reference for the
associated water supply master plan and feasibility studies. The
Government requested IDA assistance for the financing of the master plan
and feasibility studies and during a Bank mission to Malawi in September
1981, agrement was reached with the Government on an engineering project to
prepare a program for meeting Lilongw'~ 's long range water needs that IDA
would consider financing. The Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project
(CR 1271-MAI, of SDR 3.6 million) was approved in June 1982, and became
effective February 3, 1983.
3.02      Implementation of the engineering project (i.e preparation of the
proposed project) commenr.ed with the mobilisation of the consultants
(Stanley International Limited, Canada) early March, 1983 and was carried
out on schedule, except the low-cost sanitation (LCS) component of the
project. The start-up of the LCS component was delayed by about one year,
due to difficulties in finding a sanitation advisor acceptable both to GOM
and the Bank. In order to successfully complete this component and allow
for the tendering and evaluation of tenders by the engineering consultants
and to continue providing management staff support to LWB the closing date
of the credit was extended on GOM's request by one year to June 30, 1987.
3.03      The draft Master Plan was submitted on October 31, 1983, reviewed
by end-December and the revision was issued on February 24, 1984. The
consultants submitted the draft Feasibility Study Report to the Lilongwe
Water Board in August 1984. After the review of the Study the Bank
expressed concern that the cost of the proposed project identified in the
feasisility study (estimated at US$47 million) could exceed the
Government's investment capability. Concern was also expressed that the
projected annual tariff increases in the financing plan required to support
the proposed investment (40% in 1985 and decreasing to 11% in 1991) might
be beyond the affordability of a large segment of the population and would
not be politically acceptable to the Government. Based on these comments



- 13 -
the consultants were requested to investigate further alternatives adopting
the low demand projection and analysing the impact of these alternatives on
future levels of service.
3.04      As a result of the above request, a scaled down project proposal
was prepared and submitted by the Consultants on November 30, 1984 In form
of an addendum to the feasibility study report. The proposed project was
finally approved in early May 1985 by GOM and LWB was authorized to issue a
letter of intent to the consultants to commence work on the preparation of
the detailed engineering designs and bid documents. This work was
completed by early 1986 and field appraisal of the proposed project took
place in February, 1986.
Objectives
3.05      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to augment
and secure the water supply to Lilongwe, Malawi's rapidly developing
capital, through the construction of a new dam/reservoir and to expand
Lilongwe's water supply system to cater for the increased demand. The
additional capacity would meet Lilongwe's water demands up to about
1995-1997. The project also provides for management staff support and
training for LWB. The sanitation component provides for the continuation
of the on-site sanitation program currently being implemented under the
engineering project, and for a sanitation/sewerage feasibility study in
order to prepare a long-term sanitation investment program essential to
meet the waste water and excreta disposal requirements as the City grows.
Technical Alternatives
3.06      In preparing the project, the consultant examined some 16
potential dam-sites, run of the river abstractions, ground-water resources
and the Lake Malawi as a water source. The last three options were
eliminated respectively on grounds of being impractical, inadequate or
uneconomic. Cost and adequacy considerations eliminated all but four of
the damaites all of which are located within the Lilongwe river basin.
These four damsites were subjected to detailed examination and costed as
one and two stage constructlon programs. The two-stage construction of a
dam 6 km downstream of the existing dam was found to be most cost effective
with the first stage serving 1997 and the second until 2005. Tised in
conjunction with the existing dam which will be strengthened and raised by
about 1 a, the proposed dam will assure a virtually zero risk of source
failure until the demand exceeds that projected for 1997. The design of
the new dam and the proposed remedial works of the existing dam were
reviewed by a panel of dam experts, whose recommendations were incorporated
in the final designs. It was also agreed during negotiations that a dam
expert, preferably the one who had reviewed the design of the dam, would be
invited from time to time to review progress in implementation and to
review the completed dam, as and when agreed by the Borrower and the
Association. Details of the proposed dam are given in Annex 2.



- 14 -
3.07      The bid documents for the construction of the Water Treatment
Plant were based on performance specification, in agreement with Bank's
policy. Detailed civil engineering and structural designs will be prepared
by the consultants after the evaluation of bids and final selection of the
treatment process and equipment.

Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project, Credit
1272-MAI).
Location of the various sites are shown on IBRD Maps 19697 and 19698.
Cost Estimates
3.09      Total project cost (exclusive of interest during construction) is
estimated at MK 55.00 million (US$30.56 million). Goods and services
purchased outside of Malawi would not be subject to duties and taxes. No
exemption of local taxes would apply, however, to goods and services
purchased within the country.
Estimated costs of the proposed project are shown below and a more detailed
breakdown is given in Annex 3. Physical contingencies were calculated at



- 16 -
15X for the dam construction, 5% for supply of pipes and equipment, and 102
for civil works and other miscellaneous items, and were applied as a
weighted average to the base line costs given in mid-1986 prices. Price
contingencies reflect current international and Malawi price trends. 2,
Cost for expansion of the distribution system (except minor works for
infilling mains in the existing system, and for providing piped water
supply in the unplanned areas) has been excluded from the project
components and cost estimate. Under legislation currently in force, such
as the Malawi Housing Corporation Act and the Town and Country Planning
Act, developers of all new planned areas are required to pay for all water
reticulation and connections. In addition, all Government departments and
Ministries are required to pay charges for water connections.

Project Financing
3.10      The proposed IDA credit of 1T1M20.n million would cover 65.42 of
the total project cost. The remaining financing requirement of US$10.56
million would he provided through cofinancing of ahout TISSn.67 million
equivalent from the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), about US$6.5
million equivalent from the European Investment Bank (EIR), about tS9A2.23
million equivalent from LWR self-generated funds; and the balance of
US$1.16 million equivalent from GOM.
3.11      The IDA credit would be on-lent to the LWB at an interest rate of
liz (i.e. equivalent to 2% In real terms if inflation assumptions are
correct), for 25 years including 6 yaars grace during which period the
interest due to the Malawi government would be capitalised. The ODA
contribution (which would finance the training program and part of the
management staff support component of the project) would be 60% on grant
basis and 402 on-lent to LWB on terms similar to the on-lending of the IDA
credit to LWB, The EIB contribution would also be on-lent to LWB at 11%
interest rate. Out of the GOM contribution US$1.11 million equivalent will
be made as loan to LWB at 112 interest paid annually, and US$0.05 million
equivalent would be made available on grant basis to assist financing of
the sanitation component. The project financing is as follows:
US$ Million

Details are provided in Annex 10.
3.12      The IDA Credit of US$20.0 million together with the ODA and EIB
contribution would finance about 90% of the total costs (excluding IDC) or
1002 of foreign cost and 70% of local costs.
Implementation
3.13      LWB would be responsible for the implementation of the water
supply component of the project, and would retain engineering consultants
for construction supervision and for the detailed civil engineering and
structural design of the water treatment plant extension.
3.14      Project Implementation would begin with the construction of the
new dam and the remedial works of the existing dam in early 1987, thus
providing an adequate source of water by mid-I990. Other extension works
are planned to comence in 1990 and would be commissioned by end 1992. An
implementation schedule is included as Annex 4.



- 19 -
3.15      Implementation of the sanitation component would be carried out
by the Lilongwe City Council (LCC) under the supervision of the Ministry of
Local Government (tMW) over the 1987-1989 period.
Land Acquisltion aud Relocation
3.16      The construction of the dam at Masula and a new water treatment
plant, 25 km downstream, will involve a maximm area of 302 ha, affecting
30-40 families.  Under  iesign flood conditions, the inundation area would
cover 370 ha. Approximately 502 of the land to be inundated is currently
used for suallholder fallow farming. Acquisition of the land will be
carried out as prescribed by the Land Acqulsition Act, Chapter 58.04 of the
Laws of Malawi. The Act empowers the Minister whose portfolio covers land
matters, to acquire land within Malawi for public use and also provides for
valuation and ctapensation of such land. LWB will be required to pay for
21.5 ha which Is the proposed site (25 km. downstream from Nasula) for the
new water treatment plant. The Government has indicated that it does not
foresee difficulties of acquisition and relocation of the families. The
people affected and their traditional chiefs were consulted and agreed to
move away from the land needed for the project. Customary land for the
relocated people is available in the vicinity of the recent settlement and
they would continue to live under circumstances similar to their current
situation and under the same traditional Chief. However, to ensure the
Government's full commitment to the satisfactory handling of the land
acquisition, compensation and resettlement matters, Rorrower presented on
the Bank's request a resettlement plan during negotiations which was found
acceptable to the Bank. Current estimates by the consultants and the Bank
mission put the value of the land and the developments at no more than MK
200,000 (US$111,000), or approximately X3,700 (USA2,100) per hectare.
Assurances were also sought from Government that guarantees of indemnity
will be given to LWB for future land value litigations in excess of the
agreed compensation sum.
Procurement
3.17      Procurement would follow Bank guidelines for international
competitive bidding except for purchase of vehicles and minor
miscellaneous equipment. These items, whose total value would not exceed
US$300,000 could be procured through local competitive bidding.
Construction of individual waste disposal units included in the sanitation
component would be carried out by force account. Construction materials
for these individual waste disposal units that cannot be purchased as stock
items from the Ministry of Works and Supply would be procured under local
procedures acceptable to the Association.
3.18     A General Procurement Notice for the Lilongwe water supply
expansion works was published in the Business Edition of the Development
Forum on August 31, 1985, which called for prequalification for the
following major contracts:
(A) Construction of an earth dam, 24 m high, 750 m long with a
free overfall concrete spillway, requiring approximately
500,000 cubic meters of fill, with remedial works to an
existing dam;
(B)  Construction of a water treatment plent with a first phase
capaeity of 32,000 cubic meters per day;



- 20 -
(C) Supply and installation of water treatment process equipment
based upon a performance specification;
(D) Supply and installation of pumps, motors and associated
equipment;
(E) Construction of three reinforced concrete service
reservoirs, two of 2,000 cubic meters and one of 7.500 cubic
meters capacity; and two elevated storage tanks each of 650
cubic meters and 24 meters high, with four booster pumping
stations;
(F) Supply of pipes, valves and fittings (steel or ductile iron)
for transmission mains, approximate total length 23 km with
dia. from 300 mm up to 500 mm;
(G) Supply of pipes, valves and fittings - UPVC for distribution
mains;
(H) Laying steel and/or ductile iron transmission mains.
The response to the General Procurement Notice was substantial. A total of
113 companies from 24 different countries submitted applications. Most
contractors expressed interest in more than one contract and in all a total
of 350 applications were received for the eight contracts. Invitations for
bids for the dam construction (Contract A) were issued end-May, 1986 and
the tenders will be submitted by end-August, with six months validity of
the quoted prices.

Disbursement
3.20      The credit would be disbursed as follows:
(i) 70% .2 foreign and 60% of local expenditure of the dam
construction contract;
(ii) 100% of foreign and 70% of local expenditure of civil works
and supply contracts;
(iii) 100% of total expenditure for all consultancy and advisory
services;
(iv) 100% of foreign expenditure for Management Staff Support
(foreign cost of engineer/manager and financial controller).
Disbursement schedule is given in Annex 6 and Schedule of Withdrawal of
Proceeds of the Credit in Annex 7. In order to expedite the fleo of funds
for disbursement of small payments, a Special Account would be established
in US dollars with a commercial bank for the water supply component
(executing agency: LWB). 3/ For major payments for the construction
contracts, however, direct payments could be made to the contractors using
Procedure III. Reimbursement of expenditures for all items under contracts
or purchase orders of less than US$20,000.00 equivalent would be made
against statement of expenditure (SOE), documentation for which would be
held by the implementing agencies and be made available for inspection by
supervision missions.
3.21      ODA would disburse for 100% of the cost of the training component
and 100% of the foreign cost of management staff support other than that of
the engineer/manager and financial controller. EIB would disburse for 30X
of both the local and foreign cost of the dam construction and 100l of the
cost for the water treatment plant equipment and for the electrical and
mechanical equipment of the pumping stations.
3/   It was noted during negotiations that the Government was having
difficulty in utilizing Special Accounts in ongoing projects for
foreign expenditures because of the internal procedures currently
being utilized. Because of this problem it was agreed that until the
Special Account was operating smoothly, the threshold for direct
payment for foreign expenditures would be reduced from the normal
US$10,000 equivalent to US$5,000 equivalent.

Water Resource Aspects
3.22      The ability of the existing Kamuzu reservoir to satisfy
Lilongwe's water demands depends on three factors, namely:
a)   the amount of water required at source;
b)   the date when the natural river flows from both the Lilongwe
and Likuni rivers became less then the amount required and
stored water must be drawn upon;
c)   the date when rainfall (runoff) augments the flows in the
rivers, which will exceed the amount required (no further
stored water release is required).
The worst combinatioin of (b) and (c) is an early end to the rains and a
late start of the following wet season. Then depending upon the amount
required a shortage or source failure of some degree is likely. To
quantify the degree of failure the following criteria have been used in the
project:
- a minor shortage - only 75% of the demand can he satisfied
during a three month peak demand neriod from
mid-September to mid-December;
- a serious shortage - less than 75% of demand can be satisfied
over a period exceeding three months.
To assess the reliability of a given volume of stored water to meet a given
requirement the following criteria were used.
-    the frequency of a serious shortage should not exceed once in 100
years;
-    the frequency of any shortfall should not exceed once in 15 years
-    in a 60 years period over 99% of the 60 years total requirement
should be satisfied.



- 23 -
3.23      Applying these definitions and ceriteria to the existing Kamuzu
reservoir's 4.5 million m3 capacity, the probability of shortages are:
Requirement            Frequency of            Frequency of
m3/day                 Minor Shortage          Serious Shortage
20,000                1 in 7 years           I in 24 years
25,000                1 in 5 years           1 in 10 years
30,000                1 in 4 years           1 in 6 years
The amount of water required in Lilongwe in 1986 is estimated to be 26,000
to 27,000 m3/day and the source is therefore at a severe and increasing
risk of failure to meet requirements. Examination of records of river
flows for the 29 years from 1953 to 1982 shows that at the 19R6 level of
water requirement shortages would have occured in 1954, 59, 60, 68, 70 and
73. Of these six years 1954, 60 and 73 would have been years of serious
shortage and in 1960 for a period of about 6 months only 60% of the
required amount of water would have been available.
3.24      As the frequency of risk of failure substantially exceeds the
generally accepted frequency of source failure (i.e. once in 20 years),
construction of the new dam should commence without delay. This was taken
into account in preparation of the project implementation schedule. In
addition, the condition of the existing Kamuzu Dam also requires that the
remedial works be carried out urgently.  These works have been incorporated
in the dam-construction contract.
3.25      The proposed dam will assure a virtually zero risk of source
failure until about 1997.  By about this time the treatment plant and
distribution works will require a second phase extension.  The source works
can also be expanded, approximately doubling the storage capacity of the
reservoir, raising the crest level of the dam by 4 to 5 meters.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.26      The project would contribute to maintain the present high
standard of water supply and health conditions. It also includes a
sanitation component aimed to improve the on-site sanitation facilities and
to assist in preparing a long-term sanitation/sewerage program. The
project has no adverse environmental impact. The remedial works on the
existing dam which have been included in the project, will eliminate the
danger of accidental flooding caased by malor damage or burst of the dam.
IV. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
4.01      The borrower would be the government of Malawi who would relend
the proceeds of the IDA Credit to LWB (the implementing agency) on the
terms stated in para. 3.11.

Organization of LWB
4.02      In 1959 subsidiary legislation under Sections 3 and 4, the
Waterworks Act declared the Lilongwe Municipal Council to be the Lilongwe
Water Board "for the time being". The Lilongwe Municipal Council
officially ceased to act as LWB on March 31, 1982, and during the following
twelve months there were further changes assisting its operation as an
independent body. The staff moved to new offices in October, 1982 and in
early 1983 au Engineer/Manager and a Financial Controller, both expatriates
took up duties as provided for under the Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering
Project (CR 1272-MAI).
4.03      Until early 1984 assistance for technical planning, design and
construction management was provided by the Department of Lands, Valuation
and Water. This arrangement has been gradually phased out with the
completion of the water augmentation scheme. Apart from receiving the
Board's proposed capital development program each year for coordinating
with those of the remainder of the country prior to submission to the
Development Office of the President, the now Department of Water
(reorganized under the Ministry of Works and Supplies) has no active
involvement with the Board's affairs.
4.04.     Both the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards are responsihle to
government through the Controller of Statutory Bodies (in the Office of the
President and Cabinet). Financial plans and budget proposals are not
implemented until they have been reviewed by the Controller and a joint
presentation by the Controller and the Board is made to the Treasury for
its approval. Senior Staff appointments are also subject to the
Controller's approval.
4.05.     The Board comprises a non-executive Chairman and twelve members
(designated by the government) with an observer from the Department of
Statutory Bodies. Under the direction cf the Chairman the Board has the
responsibility of ensuring that the organization performs its functions
effectively to achieve its aims and objectives and that the decision of the
Board are compatible and in conformity with government policy at all times.
4.06.     The Engineer/Manager is the chief executive officer and reports
to the Board and to the Controller of Statutory Bodies on all matters of
policy.  In addition the Engineer/Manager is responsible for the following:
- day-to-day management and supervision of the organization;
- coordination and direction of functions in the various
departments; and
- direction and supervision of the planning and execution of all
development projects.
4.07.     The organizational structure (shown in Annex 9) recommended in
the Master Plan and refined in the Feasibility Study was reviewed and
approved both by government and the Board. The recommendation has been
prepared to represent the estimated requirement at the time when the
proposed project is commissioned. In the organizational structure, both at



- 25 -
present and recommended, the Engineer/Manager directs and coordinates
through a Deputy Manager the technical department , through a Financial
Controller heading the finance department and through the Administrative/
Personnel Manager the administrative department. The Internal Auditor
reports directly to the Chief Executive.
4.08.     The following are some of the more important changes planned in
the organizational structure:
(A) Engineering Department. The present arrangements would be
basically retained with a new division added to the
department: the Projects Division. This will take over the
Drawing Office and the Property Maintenance Section
(presently in the Distribution Division). The Planning
Section of the Division would he responsible for the design
and preparation of contract documents for new works
including the planning of extensions to the distribution
system (mains up to 150 mm diameter to he laid by direct
labour and over 150 mm by contract). This section will also
have the important function of collating and maintaining
records of the systems including the evaluation of
performance and recommendation of improvements needed. It
would produce a monthly analysis of production and
consumption for management, and generally provide the
planning input for the engineering department. When
consultants are engaged by the board, this section would
also provide the necessary liaison on matters related to
design, contract documents and the letting of contracts.
Another section of the Project Division would be responsible
for the supervision of contruction contracts including
liaison with consultants in this respect.
(B) Finance Department. The present unit handling purchasing
and stores will be separated into two as these functions are
different and improvement in their operations is needed.
Purchasing, in this case, would be responsible for buying
materials and chemicals including obtaining quotations and
annual tenders to ensure purchases are made at the most
economic prices. Stores would be responsible for the
receipt, safe keeping and issue of materials including
costing of issues and maintenance of stores records.
The Internal Audit when strengthened with an audit clerk
would report to the Engineer/Manager rather than the
Financial Controller as at present. An Internal Audit
Manual needs to be produced to formalise procedures. (The
Financial Controller has already commenced the preparation
of an Accounts Manual for his department.)
C. Administration Department. To improve the personnel
management a separate personnel section will be formed. At
present personnel records in the form of employee files are



- 26 -
being maintained for most senior staff. These need to be
extended to cover all staff and to include more information
(details of first appointment; subsequent actions including
promotions, transfers, and salary raises; records pertaining
to any disciplinary action; letters of commendation;
information regarding training courses attended; health
records; copies of certificates of education and subsequent
training, leaves requested and taken; and any performance
evaluation reports).   Recruitment for existing posts that
become vacant or for new posts that are created as part of
the programme for additional staff will be administrated by
the Personnel Section. Another important function of
Personnel Section will he to assist management in the
formulation and implementation of training programs and
their annual updating.4/
Institution Bullding and Localization
4.09.     The implementation of the proposed changes in the organizational
structure, improvements in the financial viability of the LWB and the
systematic planning and implementation of training programs is a continuous
process. LWB's management will prepare an action program which will be
reviewed and updated quarterly in consultation with the Bank and with the
cofinancier of the management staff support and training comportent of the
project.
4.10      At the moment, apart from top management, the Board has only one
qualified engineer. In recruiting for professional engineering staff, it
is unlikely that any local engineers will have experience in urban water
supplies. The organisation chart therefore, allows for experienced
expatriate engineers to occupy the three divisional engineering posts -
Distribution, Operations and Projects - and for relatively inexperienced
local engi',eers to be appointed to deputy divisional engineering posts.
The intention is that during the 1990s the deputy engineer posts shall be
phased out and the incumbents, assuming they have performed satisfactorily,
should tale over divisional engineers posts, with the expatriate's
departure. A parallel situation exists with the Chief and Deputy Chief
Scientific Officers in charge of the laboratories and water quality
control. Another temporary post is that of the engineer who will liaise
with the consultants during the construction of the new dam. In the
Administration Department the two leading accountants assisting the
Controller have deputies as shown on the organisational chart. Part of the
reasoning behind this is that there is a shortage of qualified accountants
in Malawi and the compensation offered in the private sector is often
double that which the Board can offer.   Hence some turnover at this level
can be expected. Also, as their local professional training for
accountants has been completed, they will spend more time overseas on
training scholarships to complete their qualifications.
4/   The training component of the project is described in paras. 4.11
through 4.13.



- 27 -
Training
4.11.     In order to develop into a  self-supporting organization, as
already discussed under the previous paragraphs 4.09 and 4.10, the
continuation of expatriate technical assistance (through management staff
support) and a substantial training program is required. The institutional
section of the Feasibility Study Report prepared by the consultants
(Stanley International, Canada) provides a satisfactoryassessment of
staffing, recruitment and training needs up to 1Q90. Based on these data
and recommendations, and in consultation with the British Development
Division of Southern Africa (a regional office of the ODA), LWR had
prepared a proposal for technical assistance and training. On the advice
of ODA Lilongwe,and with assistance from the Bank's water sector training
specialist during project preparation, the proposal was modelled on a
similar program prepared by the Blantyre Water Roard (BWB) and approved hy
ODA in September, 1983 (see para. 1.19).
4.12.     The proposal comprises three separate, but related, packages as
follows (described in more detail in Annex 13):
(i)  Long term institutional strengthening to include the
appointment of three expatriate engineers (12 man-years),
and provision of overseas professional level accountancy
training for two deputies to the Financial Controller;
(ii) Short term technical assistance and practical experience
programs both in UK and Malawi (twinning arrangements); and
(iii) training awards of 3-6 months duration to UK technical and
financial diploma level courses, to be administered under
the British Council's award scheme.
Priority will be given to the recruitment and training of a senior
personnel officer (under the twinning arrangement), who will be responsible
to the Administrative Manager for the overall coordination and
implementation of the Board's training program.
4.13.     The technical assistance and training package funded by ODA
(Annex 13), under a formal co-financing arrangement has been included as an
integral part of the proposed project. Detailed action program, terms of
reference for the training programs will be submitted to the Bank for
review and comment (see Annex 13, para. 2(d)).
Accounting and Audit
4.14      LWB's accounting system is now operating on a commercial basis.
It was converted from a municipal accounting basis in 1983. Present
accounting practices and procedures are adeQuate for recording
transactions, preparing financial statements and annual budgets. However,
the Board's management information system has, in the past, proven to be
weak, particularly in relation to the availability of statistical data on
tariffs which made relevant tariffs analyses very difficult. The need to



- 28 -
develop a stronger data base has been more acute since the switch from the
uniform tariff system to a block tariff system (para. 5.12). To overcome
this shortcoming, a data base on tariffs is currently being developed-a
task made easier by the recent computerization of the billing system.
4.15      The project will provide for the employment of an expatriate
financial controller until project completion.  LWB so far has not heen
successful in attracting and retaining qualified Malawian accountants
because of the non-competetiveness of public sector remuneration policies.
To overcome this difficulty, the training program provides required local
and overseas accountancy training.
4.16      LWB has an internal audit unit comprising of three positions, of
which only two are presently filled. The main responsibility of this unit
is, as of now, to systematically review all recorded transactions
foraccuracy. It is expected that the unit's responsibilities will be
broadened in the future to include performance of procedural reviews and
other usual audit functions as the Board reaches a full staffing stage.
4.17      LWB's external audit is currently conducted by the international
firm Coopers and Lybrand. This arrangement is satisfactory. LWB will
continue to have its annual accounts audited by independent accountants
acceptable to the Association, and the audited accounts will be submitted
to the Association within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
Auditing of the Project's Special Accounts and Statement of Expenses will
be carried out by the same auditors.
Billing and Collection
4.18      Meter readings are made monthly and bills sent out by mail.
Disconnections are normally made if payment is not made within 3n days of
billings. Past collection performance is difficult to evaluate because the
capacity of the old electronic accounting machine was inadequate for the
existing 9000 customers, leading to a significant lagging of billings (up
to four weeks). As a result past average collection periods derived from
the financial statements of the past three years (79 days in FY83, 99 days
in Fy84, and 88 days in FY85), do not reflect actual collection periods.
Collection performance is generally good, total accounts receivable do not
exceed on average 60 days.
4.19      A computer has been acquired (under the Engineering Project) and
the billing system is now being computerized so that after conversion it
will have the capacity to handle up to 25,000 accounts. LWB has also
significantly reduced the unaccounted for eater during the implementation
period of the Engineering Project.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
5.01      As mentioned above, LWB's accounts have been maintained on a
commercial basis, only since FY83. To make comparisons between years
possible, the accounts for the year ending March 31, 1983 have been
reformulated.
5.02      The audited income statements for the last three years, prepared
on a historical cost basis, are analyzed below. The estimated future
financing plan and the forecast financial statements have been prepared on
the basis of assets revalued to March 31, 1985. This revaluation has not
been done on a professional engineering basis and should therefore be
regarded as indicative only (para. 5.15).
LWB's Past Operating Results and Financial Position

- 31 -
It should be noted that the 1985 results overstate LWB's profitability,
because revenues from the 10,000 m3/day augmentation scheme 5/ are
included whereas the elated depreciation and financing costs are not.
Assuming a depreciation charge of 3% of cost of the scheme, depreciation
expense should have increased by MK 180,000 and the stated net surplus of
MK 35,000 would have been reduced to a loss of MK 145,000.
5.04      LWB's audited financial position for the 3 years ending March 31,
1985 is shown below. For comparative purposes, the position as at March
31, 1985 is also shown with the provisional revaluation of fixed assets,
and the inclusion of the augmentation scheme valued at K 6,000,000 which
is financed as an equity contribution:
5/   The augmentation scheme, physically completed during FY 1985,
increased capacity from 20,000 m3/day to 30,000 m3/day.

Financial Performance of LWB
5.05      LWB past financial performance has not been good mainly because
of the inadequacy of tariffs. In the 3 years ending March 31, 1985
operating ratio was in the unsatisfactory 98-107% range. Revenues rose on
average by 21% (mainly from a 33% increase in sales volume following the
completion of the augmentation scheme in 1986) while operating expenditures
including depreciation grew by 23.5%. Solvency was maintained only by a
slight improvement in collections, limited investment in current assets and
ar. increase in accounts payable. The return on revalued net fixed assets
was negative. As an initial n-easure, 1WB was granted a tariff increase of
approximately 23% effective June 1, 1985.
Financing Plan for LWB as an Entity
5.06      The financing plan covers the Lilongwe Water Board's fiscal years
ending March 31, 1987 through 1993. The physical implementation of the
project is expected to commence in January 1987 and to be completed by
March 1992 with retention money to be disbursed in the latter months of
calendar year 1992. The financing plan for LWB as an entity is summarized

-  5 -
5.07      The existing weak financial position of the Lilongwe Water Board,
together with the limited additional funding available from the Malawi
Government, implies that the proposed financing plan is highly dependent
upon the following factors:
1.   The implementation of annual tariff increases effective
April 1 designed to ensure an average tariff increase of at
least 14% (5% in real terms) each year until 1991. Such
additional tariff increases will be implemented as are
required to achieve a return of at least 5.0% on revalued
net fixed assets in FY1991 and 1992.
2.   The early implementation of the supplementary augmentation
scheme so as to increase production capacity by 5,000 m3/day
to 35,000 m3/day by June 1988. This project estimated to
cost 600,000 MK, is forecast to yield an increased annual
cash flow of approximately MK 1,000,000 and can be financed
by LWB's internal cash generation.
3.   The cost of the recently completed augmentation scheme will
be either an equity contribution by the Government to LWB,
or a subordinated loan requiring no repayment of principal
and no interest obligation until 1994 at the earliest.
4.   The on-lending of the IDA, ODA and EIR credits under terms
which defer all payments of interest and principal until the
earliest calender year of 1Q93 or one year after project
completion, with repayment of principal and deferred
interest to be amortized over the remaining life of the
loan.
5.   The rate of interest on the Government contribution of MK
2.0 million to the financing of the project will not exceed
the on-lending rate of the Credit and will be paid annually,
with principal repayments commencing in calendar year 1993.
Future Operations and Financial Position of Lilongwe Water Board
5.08           The limited financial capability of both the Government and
the Board have necessitate.d a conservative approach to both the demand
forecast and project cost forecast - which are also critical. Forecast
income statements, balance sheets, and funds flow statements for FY's 1986
through 1993 are presented in Annex 9.



- 36 -
5.09      Net revenues are forecast to increase from MY 2.8 million In 1986
to MK 8.4 million in 1992, with a further increase to MK 11.4 million in
1993 - the first year in which the Project will he fully operational. Out
of the 200% increase in revenues from 1986 to 1992, 42% is accounted for by
an increase in average daily sales volume from 18,520 m3/day in
1986 to 26,378 m3/day in 1992. The remainder of the increase is accounted
for by an increase in tariff from an average of MK 0.42 per m3 in 1986 to
MK 0.88 per m3 in 1992. As mentioned previously, not only are the present
tariffs totally inadequate to maintain financial viability of the LWB as
presently existing, but annual increases of at least 14% (to yield 5%
increase in real terms) are critical to its ability to finace the project.
A tariff of MK 0.88 per m3 in 1992 represents MK 0.52 per m3 in 1986 prices
- or a real increase of approximately 25%. This tariff will not only yield
a return of 5.8% on revalued net fixed assets in 1992 but will provide a
financial rate of return (net of inflation) of 4.6% on the new project.
5.10     The underlying demand forecast is based on the "Low Demand"
forecast prepared by the Consultants in early 1984. However, as a result
of the elimination of suppressed demand, consequent to the implementation
of the 10,000 m3/day augmentation scheme, estimated sales volume in FY 1986
is at a level 25% higher than was projected for this year. The estimated
sales volume for FY 1986 has been used as a base to which the annual
percentage growth of the consultants' low growth forecast has been
applied. Due to production capacity constraints, this forecast of demand
cannot be met in the years 1987, 1988 and 1990-1992, and the prolected
sales volume and sales revenue is therefore determined by the production
capability as indicated in the forecast income statement.
5.11      The financial assumptions (see Annex 9) with respect to expenses
result in a projected operating ratio of 110.8% in 1987 and 120.8% ir
1988. Only when the cumulative effect of the required 14% annual tariff
increases and increased volume from the supplementary scheme begin to take
effect in 1989 does the operating ratio fall to 88%, reaching a reasonable
76% in 1991 at which point the system should be earning about 5% on
revalued net fixed assets. Because of the size of the incremental
expansion and related incremental debt service requirement, it is projected
that internal cash generation will not be sufficient to meet debt service
requirements until FY95, in which year the debt service ratio will reach
1.1. By FY98 when the new facility is producing at capacity, the
debt/service ratio is projected at 1.8, and the rate of return at 8.1%.
Tariffs
5.12      In June 1985, Government approved the introduction of a block
tariff system, with tariffs set at levels which represented an overall 23%
tariff increase. Accordingly, an additional average tariff increase of 14%
was authorized as from September 1, 1986. The tariff structure by block or
class is as follows:



- 37 -
Tariff (Tambala/m3)
June 1, 1985 -         From
Aug. 31, 1986   September 1, 1986
Class/Block
-  Domestic -  1-lOm3/month                      30.0             31.5
- 10-40m3/month                      34.0             38.1
- excess over 40m3/month             42.0             50.0
-  Kiosk sales  6/                                38.4            40.0
-  Government/Institutional                       34.0            4n.o
- Commercial/Industrial
-  1-100 m3/month                       34.0             40.0
-  excess over 100 m3/month             42.0             50.0
Water rates are levied on all connections.  The combination of
consumption revenues and water rates is projected to result in revenue
equivalent to an average tariff of 42 tambalas/m3 in 1986.
5.13      An analysis of the composition of consumption by block by volume
for the month of June, 1985 indicated the following:
Tariff -
Class                        Tambala/m3      Consumption X
Block 1 and Kiosk  6/                  30                  22
Block 2 and Institutional              34                  48
Block 3 and Commercial                 42                  30
5.14      It should be stressed that annual tariff increases should not be
less than 14% (to yield 5% in real terms) if LWB is to maintain a sound
financial position. The existence of a block tariff system allows great
flexibility in the implementaion of tariff increases in the 15% per annum
overall average range.  In addition, computerisation of the billing system
will enable the LWB to target tariff increases more accurately to achieve
the desired results.
Revaluation of Assets
5.15      The audited accounts of LWB for FY 1985 were prepared on a
historical accounting basis. Because title has not passed to LWR for the
augmentation scheme, this was excluded from LWB's assets even though the
related revenue was included in income. The projected balance sheet
includes the augmentation scheme at a valuation of 6.0 million Kwachas. In
addition, provision has been made in the forecast for the revaluation of
fixed assets as at FY85 - based on valuations for insurance purposes, as
6/   Actual tariffs collected by the Board from kiosk sales are 38.4 t/m3
less remuneration paid to kiosk operators. Effective tariff on kiosk
sales is therefore about the same as the one paid by block 1
customers.



- 38 -
estimated by LWH management. However, the vatues determined on this hasis
are indicative only. It is proposed that LW8 be required to have its
assets professionally revalued in order to determine a realistic asset
valuation for rate-of-return covenant purposes. The 1985 assets
revaluation has then been projected to Increase by the local inflation
index in order to determine future net fixed asset values.
Rate of Return
5.16      On the basis of revalued net fixed assets, and corresponding
depreciation, the rate of return is projected to be negative in 1987 and
1988. This is clearly unacceptable for a system operating virtually at
capacity. A return on revalued net fixed assets of 5% ought to be about
the minimum acceptable return for a public utility operating at capacity
(i.e. when equipment is beig utilised at its most efficient). While this
return ideally ought to be achieved in 1987, this would require an
immediate tariff increase of about 65% (rather than the 14% now proposed)
which would be politically unacceptable.
5.17      It is therefore proposed that the achievement of a 5% return on
revalued assets for FY 1991 and 1992 be included as a covenant in the
credit agreement, in addition to the requirement for a minimum 14% p.a.
tariff increase previously referred to. It is recognised that, immediately
upon completion of the project in FY 1993 (which will result in an increase
in capacity which will initially be tunderutilised), the rate of return may
be expected to fall to 2.0%. However, by FY 1996 total capacity is
expected to be 80% utilised at which time the system should again be
earning 5.0% on revalued net fixed assets. In summary, it is proposed that
the following returns on revalued net fixed assets be covenanted:
FY 1qsq - ?.ny
190n - 3.0o
1991 - 5.0%
1992 - 5.0%
19Q3 - 2.0% a/
1994 - 3.0%
1995 - 4.0%
1996 - 5.0%
a/   (or in year following completion of project).
In order to achieve said objective Government shall, in consultation with
the Association, annually determine water tariff increases on the basis
inter alia, of an assessment of the effects on LWB's rate of return of the
water tariff prevailing in the period immediately preceding. It was noted
that present projections indicate that an annual increase in water tariffs
of 5% in real terms is necessary to achieve the above rates of return. In
the event that LWB is unable to achieve this target in any one year, the
Government shall take steps to ensure that in the following year measures
are implemented to recover the situation.
Alternative Project Phasing
5.18      Although the financial projections and resulting financing plan
have been developed on the basis of the Rank's standard six-year
disbursement profile for Malawi, two other approaches to the project
construction were also evaluated. Of the two approaches considered below
only the second one, is financially viable for LWB.



- 39 -
5.19      The first approach, a four-year construction/disbursement
program, was proposed by the consultants and LWB's management and would
result in lower costs of construction (48.1 million Kwachas, excluding IDC,
versus 33.8 million Kwachas over 6 years) and completion of the project in
FY 1991 thus eliminating water shortages or suppressed demand in FY 1992
and 1993. However, this approach requires funding in the early years - and
would involve either an immediate 50% tariff increase (with future annual
increases in line with inflation), or, alternatively, two annual tariff
increases of 20% and the renegotiation of an existing on-lending agreement
to defer payment of interest previously committed to Government.
Furthermore, the incremental demand which would be met in FY 1992 and 1993
is comparatively limited. For these reasons, this approach is not
considered to be financially viable.
5.,0      The second approach, a six-year construction/disbursement program
with two distinct phases to the project, is considered to be more desirable
by the appraisal mission. This would involve early completion of the dam,
followed by installation of the 32,000 m3/day additional capacity by FY
1993. This scheme is projected to cost MK 53.7 million, excluding IDC, and
is financeable with the same financing plan as proposed above, with
comparatively minor differences in timing of cash flow.
Affordability for Low Income Groups
5.21      The proposed financing plan for the project and water tariff
increases are in accordance with the Government's stated objective of
making LWB financially self-supporting, while at the same time not placing
an undue burden on the consumer. Assessment of affordability in Malawi
remains difficult due to lack of reliable statistics. For appraisal
purposes, income and consumption data are based upon socio-economic surveys
of 1982 by the project consultants and by the Malawi National Statistics
Office. The data was, wherever necessary, adjusted by the mission to
reflect changes in income, consumption and inflation. The average
household size in the low income groups (the Kiosk and High Density
Traditional housing area customers) was assumed to be 8.5 persons (see
"Malawi: Growth and Structural Change. A Basic Economic Report", Report
no. 3082a-MAI) with a household income of between MK 150 and MK 300 per
month, yielding a monthly per capita income of approximately MK 27. The
minimum wage for both Lilongwe and Blantyre, set in 1984 by the Government,
is MK 30 per month.  Analysis of the tariff structure shows that water
charges for the low income groups, constituting no more than 2.2 percent of
per capita income in 1992, are still affordable. Water expenditure as a
proportion of income is about the same for the higher income groups.
Comparisons between cities, indicate that Lilongwe's avPrage tariff of
tambala 42/m3 is below Blantyre's average of tambala 63/m3.  Both analyses
demonstrate that Lilongwe still has some flexibility for tariff adjustment
before consumption is affected by issues of affordability. 1owever, the
degree of flexibility is limited by the very low level of per capita income
in Malawi.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
6.01      The development of Lilongwe, as the country's administrative
capital and focus of the Central Region, has been given high priority by
the Government. Apart from the establishment of Government agencies in
Lilongwe, numerous financial institutions and companies are setting up
headquarters in the city, which is also a hub for agricultural services and
marketing, commerce and light industry. The proposed project would satisfy
the water demands up to about 1995-1997, thus providing the necessary water
supply infrastructure for the development of the capital city.
6.02      Demand in Lilongwe at present has already outstripped the safe
yield of the existing dam, which itself needs urgent strengthening. The
remedial works have been included in the project.
6.03      The Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project has not only helped
to prepare the physical components of the proposed project but considerably
contributed to the improvement of the operational and institutional
capability of the Lilongwe Water Board. In accordance with both the
Government's and the Bank's policy the proposed project was designed with
the aim to make LWB a self supporting organization. LWB is required as
part of its mandate to recover from existing water consumers all operating
and debt servicing costs. The introduction of the block tariff structure
which allows limited cross-subsidization between consumer groups helps to
alleviate the burden of rapidly increasing tariffs on the poorest segments
of the population. The proposed organizational development plan and
training program is expected to have an impact not only on LWB but also on
the sector as a whole.
Least Cost Solution
6.04      Based upon available information the proposed project represents
the least costly of the several technical alternatives considered. The
two-stage construction of a dam 6 km downstream of the existing dam was
found to be most cost-effective. Used in conjunction with the existing dam
which will be strengthened and raised by I meter the proposed solution will
assure a virtually zero risk of source failure until 1997.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Pricing Considerations
6.05      The project economic rate of return (ERR) calculations include
the sanitation component which is not expected to generate directly
quantifiable benefits. The component was included because at K1.05 million
(US$0.6 million) it accounts for only 1.9 percent of the total project
cost, and is therefore not large enough to have a significant impact on the
ERR. The incremental investments in the water supply component, accounting
for 98 percent of the project cost, yielded a 5.5 percent ERR on the entire
project (Annex 12). The ERR would be more if other non-quantifiable
benefits (improved health for users, fish farming potential, environmental
and social benefits such as time savings) had been taken into account. A
sensitivy analysis on the rate of return, using a 10 percent reduction in
benefits produced on ERR of 4.6 percent. A similar analysis, using 10%
reduction in costs yielded an ERR of 6.2 percent.



- 41 -
6.06      Incremental investment costs were estimated at constant 1986
prices plus appropriate physical contingencies, and adjustments for local
unskilled labor and foreign exchange shadow prices. The cost stream
included the costs for construction of the new dam, remedial work on the
existing dam, system expansion, distrihution network expansion, civil
works, management staff support, training, and the low-cost sanitation
component (Annex 12). Renefits from the additional Investments in the
project were calcuslated using incremental water sales at an average tariff
rate of MK 0.52 per m3 in real terms.
6.07      The average incremental cost estimates of water supolied under
the proposed project ranged from MK 0.71 at a discount rate of 8 percent to
MK 1.47 at a discount rate of 15 percent. The average incremental cost at
a discount rate of 8 percent is higher than the average tariff rate of 1K
0.52 per m3 in constant terms over the entire life of the pro.ject. A
sensitivity analysis was done, and indicated that the incremental cost and
the average tariffs rate converge at a discottnt rate of about 6 percent.
Rowever, the incremental cost is in line with the highest block tariff.
The long term marginal cost of the water, i.e. including the second phase
of the long-term development plat, for water supply in the Lilongwe area
(Master-Plan, prepared under the Engineering Project) is about ecual to the
average tariff level projected for 1992.
Project Risks
6.08      The risk involved in the project are: (a) that LWB will not be
able to generate sufficient revenue from incremental water sales for debt
service, maintenance, and needed additional investments; (b) that project
implementation would suffer due the difficulty of attracting and keeping
Malawian staff and implementation supervision expatriates; (c) that the
Government may be unahle to authorize the necessary tariff increases; and
(d) that the Government may he unable to finance its share of the project
costs in a timely manner due to budgetary constraints. The first risk is
,offset by the relatively rapid population growth of Lilongwe (the country's
new capital and potential center of commerce) which ensures that demand for
water supply will continue to grow at projected rates. To offset the
second risk, both the Government and T.WR (which alreadv has a good
management team in place) have made an undertaking to retain qualified
personnel over the implementation period, which will be supported bv a team
of consultants. The Malawi Government has a policy of not subsidizing
parastatals on the premise that they should be financially self-supporting
and has in principle agreed to increase LWB's water charges over a number
of years, thereby offsetting risk number (c) above. In addition, LWB's
tariff structure will be under constant review to ensure that it provides
for sufficient revenue to make LWB a financially viable and independent
institution. To offset risk (d) above, the Governmeat has an undertaking
to include its share of the project cost into the annual budgetary
estimates, as indicated in the Public Sector Investment Program.
Project Monitoring System
6.09      The most important monitoring aspects concern physical
implementation of the proposed project, realization of the training
component and actions on tariffs. Suitable indicators for monitoring
project implementation and for measuring performance against project goals
are set out in Annex 14. After completion of the proposed project, LWB



- 42 -
will prepare a "Project Completion Report' on the basis of an outline to be
agreed with the Bank.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached
7.01      During negotiations assurances were received from Government
that:
(a) it would take all measures necessary to enable LWR to earn
an annual return on the average current net value of LWB's
fixed assets in operation of not less than indicated in the
following table (para. 5.17):
FY 1989 - 2.0%
1990 - 3.0%
1q91 - 5.0%
1992 - 5.0%
1993 - 2.0% a/
1994 - 3.0%
1995 - 4.0%
1996 - 5.0%
a/   (or in year following completion of project).
(b)  the cost of the augmentation scheme will be either an equity
contribution by the Government to the Board, or a
subordinated loan requiring no repayment of principal and no
interest obligation until 1994 at the earliest (para. 5.07,
clause 3);
(c)  it would, not later than June 30, 1987 enter into an
agreement with ODA for financing of the cost of three
expatriate engineers (12 man-year), and for financing the
training component (paras. 4.12 and 4.13);
(d)  the on-lending of the IDA funds to LWR would he made under
terms which defer all payments of interest and principal
until the earliest calendar year of 1993 or one year after
project completion, with repayment of principal and deferred
interest to be amortized over the remaining life of the loan
(para. 5.07, clause 4);



- 43 -
(e) it would make available to LWR funds in an aggregate amount
of MK 2.0 million for the partial financing of Parts A
through E of the Project, not later than June 30, 19R7. The
rate of Interest on this loan shall not exceed the
on-lending rate of the Credit, payment of interest shall he
made annually and repayment of principal shall commence not
earlier than January 1, 19A3 (para. 5.07, Clause 5);
(f) it would ensure that all families to be displaced as a
result of lantd acquisition by LWB for purposes of the
project shall be adequately compensated and relocated in
accordance with the resettlement plan submitted to the
Association during negotiations. Government would reimburse
LWB for any land acquisition costs in excess of MK 200,000
(para. 3.16);
(g) it would open and maintain a special account for the
water supply component of the Project, in a commercial bank
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association
(para. 3.20).
7.02      During negotiations assurances were received from LWB that:
(a) LWB would retain engineering consultants for project
implementation whose qualifications, experience and terms
and conditions of employment would be satisfactory to the
Association (para. 3.13);
(b) LWB would take all reasonable measures to ensure that the
execution and operation of the Project are carried out with
due regard to ecological and environmental factors (para.
3.16 and 3.26);
(c) LWB would continue to emply an Engineer/Manager and a
Financial Controller whose qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment would be satisfactory to
the Association (para. 4.07);
(d) LWR would annually revalue its fixed assets, using methods
acceptable to the Association (para. 5.15);
(e) LWB would submit its audited accounts together with the
auditors' report not later than six months after the close
of each financial year and would continue to employ
independent auditors, acceptable to the Association (para.
4.17);



- 44 -
(f)  LWB would prepare timely requests for the annual tariff
increase in each year, in accordance with Government
regulations. The tariff increases will be designed as
described in para 7.01(a);
(g)  LWB will implement the supplementary augmentation scheme so
as to increase production capacity of the treatment plant by
5,000 m3/day to 35,000 m3/day by June 1988 (para. 5.07,
Section 2);
(h)  LWB will obtain the Association's prior agreement before
incurring any debt if the cash generation for the previous
year is less than 1.5 times maximum future debt servicing
requirement (para. 5.11);
(i)  LWB would submit quarterly reports on the basis of an
outline to be agreed with the Association (para. 6.0Q and
Annex 13); and
(j) LWB would prepare, after completion of the proposed project,
a "Project Completion Report" on the basis of an outline to
be agreed with the Association (para. 6.09).
Recommendations
7.03      The completion ef all conditions of effectiveness for the EIB
cofinancing would be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed IDA
credit.
7.04      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an
IDA credit of US$20.0 million equivalent. Approximately US$19.4 million
equivalent will be on-lent to LWB at a rate of 11%p.a., with six years
grace during which interest would be capitalised and 25 years repayment
period.

Source Works
1.        The source works consist of the construction of a new earthfill
dam and remedial works on the existing dam. The two-stage construction of
the new dam, located 6 km downstream of the existing dam, proved to be the
most cost effective with the first stage serning until 1997 and the second
until year 2005. The source work also includes the relocation of the Runda
college water supply intake works. Dimensions of the principal features of
the source works are dasted below:

3.        Water will be released from the reservoirs to augment the flows
in the Lilongwe and Likuni rivers, and will be extracted approximately 26
km downstream of the new dam, where the intake structures and the water
treatment plant are located at the southern edge of Lilongwe.
The Water Treatment Plant
4.        In sizing tie capacity of the proposed treatment works account
has been taken of:
a)   The peak demand projected in 1977   -  67,0no mV/day
b)   Existing capacity in 1986             -  30,000 m3/day
c)   Proposed supplementary works utilizing
the treatment plant equipment available
surplus from the augmentation project   5,000 mI/day
5.        The additional capacity required from the project is therefore
32,000 m3/day. The principal components of the plant, which will be
located adjacent to and just upstream of the existing plant, are:
a)   river intake and raw water pumps;
b)   raw water holding and pre-settling tank;
c)   chemical coagulation;
d)   sedimentation and rapid gravity filtratAon;
e)   chlo.l1nation;
f)   treated water storage (balancing) tank; and
g)   high lift pumping to Dedza and Livingstone reservoirs.
6.        The bid documents for the construction of the Water Treatment
Plant are based on performance specification, in line with Bank's policy.
Detailed civil engineering and structural designs will be prepared by the
consultants after the evaluation of bids and final selection of the
treatment process and equipment.
Transmission and Distribution system
7.        As designed, the project would provide reinforcement to the
existing system by increasing pumping, storage and pipe capacities.
Storage capacities are based upon 18 hours of average daily demand in Iq7
for ground level reservoirs and a maximum of 2 hours demand of peak hour
demand for elevated storage. The various components of the system
extension are (shown on maps IBRD 19697 and 19698.
i)    Transmission mains:
- 3,650 m long new main (diameter 350 mm) from the
treatment plant to the Dedsa reservoirs;
- 22,410 m long (500 m diameters) new main from the
treatment plant to the Livingstone reservoir and 6,420 m

ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 4
long, 500 m diameter main from there to the Capitol Hill
booster station. This new transmission main continues
from the booster station to the Kananga reservoir and
booster station (8,310 m, diameter 500 mm);
-  transmission main extensions from the Livingstone booster
station to the new water-tower in Area Q (1,620 m,
diameter 300 mm) and from there another 1,000 m long
primary distribution main (diameter 20O mm) within Area
9;
-  transmission main extension from the Tsabango reservoir
(300 m long, diameter 300 mm) to the new water-tower in
Area 23.
ii)   Booster station extensions:
- 3,400 m3/day capacity at the Livingstone reservoir;
-  22,500 m3/day capacity at Capital Hill;
-  7,900 m3/day capacity at the Kanengo reservoir;
-  2,000 m3/day capacity at the Dedza reservoir;
-  2,550 m3/day capacity at the Tsabango reservoir;
iii)   Reservoirs:
- 7,500 m3 capacity at Kanengo.
-  2,000 m3 capacity at Sandule.
-  2,000 m3 capacity at Dedza.
-  650 m3 capacity elevated storage in Area 9.
-  650 m3 capacity elevated storage in Area 23.
8.        In addition to reinforcing the transmission system the project
will provide for additions to the existing distribution system by the
provision of 200 mm, 150 mm and 100 mm diameter pipes to the value of YK
250,000.

Ass   tions
with Respect to Expenses in Financial Projections
For 1987, LWB's internal budget has been used in the expense
projection. Thereafter, operating expenses are projected to increase in
line with local inflation (as forecast by the Bank at 11% for FY 1987, 10%
for FY 1988, and 9X in subsequent years) with additional adjustments to
each item of expense as follows: Personnel and administration expense are
projected to increase at 2% p.a. in real terms, reflecting the addition of
lower-level staff related to the increased customer base and the new dam
until additional personnel are hired for the new treatment plant in the
last quarter of FY 1992. Chemicals, power and fuel are proportional to
production volume. Maintenance and materials are set at 1.65% of revalued
gross fixed assets until 1992, from which point onwards they are
proportional to production. Commencing in FY 1987, depreciation is based
on a rate of 3S of revalued gross fixed assets.

Economic Rate of Return Calculation
Assumptions
The economic rate of return analysis is based on the
financial costs and benefits data used for the financial rate of return
(FRR) calculations with the following adjustments:
1.               Capital expenditures (in conatant prices) are computed
using 1986 base line costs plus physical contingencies and include:
a)      Cost of new dam and remedial works on existing dam;
b)      Costs of water treatment plant, reservoirs, pump
stations and land acquisition;
c)      Expansion of distribution/transmission network;
d)      Other costs, consisting of management staff support,
training and the sanitation component.
2.               Operating costs.  Incremental operating costs are based
on actual 1985 costs and increase generally in line with water production
and connections. They are expressed in constant 1985 prices.
3.               Tariffs.  The average tariff is assumed to increase in
real terms up to 1991, thereafter it only increases in nominal terms.
4.                Incremental Benefits.   Incremental benefits are derived
from the value of incremental water sales calculated at the proposed
average tariff in real terms.
5.                Construction Schedule. The project completion
assumptions are the same as those used in FRR calculations.
