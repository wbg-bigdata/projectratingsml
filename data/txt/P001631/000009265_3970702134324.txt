SECOND LILONGWE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:       Republic of Malawi
Beneficiaries:  Lilongwe Water Board, Ministry of Local Government, and
Lilongwe City Council
Amount:         SDR 16.6 million (US$20.0 million equivalent)
Terms:          Standard IDA terms
Relending
Terms:          The Government will onlend US$19.4 million equivalent to
the Lilongwe Water Board (LWB) at a rate of interest of 11
percent per annum, for a period of 25 years, including six
years grace, during which period the interest due to the
Malawi Government would be capitalized. The Government
would bear the exchange rate risk. The onlending rate is
expected to be positive in real terms over the life of the
project.
Project
Description:    The objectives of the project are to extend and improve the
water supply system of Lilongwe, Malawi's capital city, to
strengthen LWB's management and operational efficiency, and
to study future options for LUlongwe's water disposal and
sanitation systems. The project includes construction of a
new earthfill dam, remedial works on an existing dam,
extension of the water treatment plant and of the water
distribution system, training and management staff support
for LWB, and feasibility studies on Lilongwe's sanitation
and sewerage systems. The project would provide safe water
for an additional 110,000 inhabitants of Lilongwe.
Risks:          The main risk is that LWB would not generate enough revenue
to ensure its financial viability. To minimize this risk,
the project is based on conservative demand forecasts. The
Government, in line with its overall policy regarding
financial self-sufficiency of parastatals, has agreed to
permit LWB to increase water charges as needed so as to be
financially self-supporting.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TRE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR THE SECOND LILONGWE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi for SDR16.6 million (US$20.0 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance the Second Lilongwe Water
Supply Project.
PART I - THE ECONGIY
2.        A Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 5801-MAI) dated October
4, 1985, was circulated to the Executive Directors on October 15, 1985.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
Background
3.        Malawi is a small (118,500 sq km), densely-populated (about 7
million people in 1985), landlocked country in southeastern Africa. Its
main assets are moderately fertile soils, good water resources and a
climate favorable to crop production. Unlike its neighbors, Malawi has no
known substantial mineral resources.
4.        With a GNP per capita of US$170, Malawi has been identified by
the United Nations as one of the world's poorest countries. Nevertheless,
from independence in 1964 until 1979, Malawi had steady economic growth,
averaging 6 percent per annum in real terms (3 percent per capita). The
leading sectors were agriculture and manufaccuring. Investment rose from
9 percent of GDP at independence to 33 percent in 1979, financed by
increased domestic savings (from nil to 14 percent of GDP in 1979), and
rising official and private capital inflows. In 1980 and 1981 Malawi met
with serious difficulties drie to world economic conditions, and GDP
contracted by 6 percent over those two years. Consumption fell somewhat,
but savings and Investment were reduced drastically. Recovery began in
1982, with growth averaging 3.2 percent through 1985.
5.        Malawi's economic growth has been due in large part to the
pragmatic policies of the Government. Malawl has adopted an outward
looking strategy based on agriculture, consistent with the country's
resource endowment. Government investment has concentrated on provision of
infrastructure, utilities and support services to encourage private
initiative. The Government has also emphasized smallholder agriculture, a
sound policy given that 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas
and depends on agriculture for its livelihood. Traditionally, more than
half of the development budget has been directed towards agriculture and
transport.



6.        Malawi's economy is heavily dependent on three primary commodity
exports (tobacco, tea, and sugar) and is highly vulnerable to international
price fluctuations. In 1980-85 these three commodities averaged 70 percent
of total exports and 16 percent of CDP. Since 1974, there have been
periodic balance of payments problems of increasing severity due primarily
to (a) rapid escalation in import prices, particularly of fuel and
intermediate and capital goods; (b) cyclical swings in export prices of
tobacco, sugar and tea; (c) significantly higher costs of transport for
exports and imports owing to rising ocean freight charges, port congestion
in Mozambique, and, more recently, severe disruptions of overland transport
routes through Mozambique resulting in complete severance of direct rail
links to Mozambique ports in 1984; and (d) an increasing debt service
burden.
Economic Crises 1978-81
7.        Beginning in 1978, Malawi's chronic balance of payments problems
became less manageable. The current account deficit rose from a level of
8-9 percent of GDP in the mid-1970s to 18 percent in 1978 and 23 percent in
1979. Import prices rose by 39 percent over this period, primarily due to
petroleum price hikes. Conversely, export prices declined by 16 percent
(due mainly to falling tea and tobacco prices). In 1980 and 1981, a
drought led to reduced agricultural exports and necessitated increased
Imports of subsistence crops (maize). Nevertheless, by 1981 Malawi enjoyed
a surplus on the merchandise trade balance thanks mainly to a contraction
In Imports and has increased this surplus steadily since 1981. Continuing
current account deficits were due to a large deficit on the service
accounts. Transport costs for imports and exports were greatly increased
due to continuing problems with traditional export routes through
Mozambique. Debt servicing also contributed to the deficit on the
invisibles account.  These current account deficits were initially financed
by sharply increased private capital inflows. These were still not
sufficient to finance the current account deficit and the country drew down
its foreign reserves to less than one month of imports by end 1983. In
1984, the current account deficit was greatly reduced to three percent of
GDP and reserves were increased by US$65 million. This was due to
improvements in the terms of trade, led by record tea prices, and a sharp
increase in exports, as previous stocks of tobacco and sugar were moved out
of the country, resulting in a large trade surplus, nearly matching the
deficit on the services account. By contrast, in 1985 terms of trade
experienced a drastic downturn, mainly owing to a sharp drop of tobacco
prices, which in conjunction with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies
provoked a current account deficit of 9 percent of GDP. The outlook for
1986 is of a slight reduction in the deficit to about 8 percent of GDP.
8.       The economic difficulties of 1980-81, as well as problems with
public corporations, led to an increase in the Government budget deficit
reaching 16.5 percent of GDP in 1981, double historic levels. This was due
primarily to a rapid increase in government expenditures, attaining 35
percent of GDP in that same year. Much of this was made up of recurrent
expenditures, especially interest payments. Revenues did not increase
commensurately, given the recession, hence the large fiscal deficit. These
deficits were financed by government borrowing, primarily domestic. Public



-3-
sector credit represented 60 percent of total domestic credit in 1984 and
as a percentage of GDP it increas2d to 13 percent in 1984 as compared to 9
percent in 1974. The fiscal position has improved since, with increased
revenues and restrained spending, so that the deficit was reduced to 8.9
percent of GDP by FY84185 and 10.9 percent by FY85/86, an improvement,
though still above target levels. Improving expenditure control is a key
element to continuing Malawi's economic recovery. Inflation has been
within a range of 10-15 percent since 1981.
9.        Given Malawi's early stage of development, foreign capital
inflows, especially of a public nature, have been important in development
financing. In the pre-recessionary period (1969-79), foreign
savings financed approximately half of domestic investment. During the
recession (1980-81), public and private capital inflows were used to
maintain consumption levels, and domestic savings fell. Since 1981,
domestic savings have been increasing, while private inflows have virtually
ceased. Public transfers continue, financing approximately 50 percent of
all investment. While multilateral assistance, led by World Bank Group
loans and credits, has increased, grants and bilateral transfers have
declined from past levels, and have not kept pace with Malawi's needs.
Stabilization and Adjustment Programs
10.       Initially, the country attempted to offset the economic downturn
of 1979-1980 by increased external borrowing, mostly on commercial terms,
in order to maintain Import levels and thus production, employment and
consumption. It soon became evident that with increasing inflationary
pressures and fiscal and balance of payments disequilibria, more stringent
adjustment efforts were needed. The Goverrnment, therefore, launched a
stabilization effort designed to reduce short-term fiscal and balance of
payments disequilibria and a structural adjustment program designed to
improve efficiency of resource use and ensure that positive growth of per
capita income can be reestablished and sustained over the medium and
longer-term within the context of a manageable balance of payments current
account deficit. The structural adjustment program 's broad-based; aimed
at encouraging diversification of production and exports, improving
performance of productive sectors, rehabilitating, restructuring and
otherwise strengthening key development lnstitutions, and improving
resource mobilization and allocation in the publlc sector.
11.       The Government and the IMF egreed to a standby program for SDR 22
million in August 1982. A first phase of a multi-year stabilization
effort, the program aimed at reducing both the balance of payments current
account deficit and the budgetary deficit. As part of the program, the
Goverrment devalued the kwacha against the SOR by 15 percent in April
1982. The other performance criteria involved phased ceilings on net
domestic assets of the banking system and on net credit to the Government
and a limit on government external commercial borrowing. The standby was
implemented satisfactorily, and the Government and the IMF concluded a new
multi-year program. A three year Extended Fund Facility was approved in
September 1983 and, was successfully implemented until April 1985. In
early 1986 due to a combination of unfavorable terms of trade and
inadequate domestic policy response, the programmed targets for public



- 4 -
sector deficit and domestic credit expansion were not achieved. As a
result, the Extended Facility became inoperative. Under the Extended
Facility program an active foreign exchange policy was pursued. Thus, in
September 1983 the Government devalued the Kwacha against the SDR by 12
percent and in January 1984 the Kwacha was pegged to a basket of seven
currencies. In April 1985, the Kwacha was depreciated again by 15 percent
in terms of the 'reference basket to reverse a real appreciation which had
taken place since late 1983. Recently the Government has agreed with the
IMF on a new 19 months stand-by, totalling SDR 24 million, for the period
ending March 1988, and a three year SAF program. The program aims at
bringing the current account into a sustainable path, increasing foreign
reserves and curtailing inflationary pressures. As an initial step, the
Government devalued the Kwacha by 10% In August 1986.
12.       The Bank's first Structural Adjustment Loan in support of the
Government's program was made in June 1981, for US$45 million. After
initial difficulties, good progress was made in implementing the
Government's adjustment program. Additional funds were allocated to the
agricultural sector, certain agricultural prices were adjusted, public
utility tariffs were increased and the budget for 1982-83 was trimmed, with
sufficient resources provided for major development sectors. The second
tranche was released in April 1982. However, during 1982 the country's
efforts were set back by increased disruption of the traditional transport
routes and continued depressed demand for Malawi's export products.
Nevertheless, the country was able to hold its current account deficit to
11.3 percent of GDP in 1983, reduce the budgetary deficit for FY1982183 to
9 percent of GDP, and meet its IMF standby borrowing ceilings.
13.       The second phase of the structural adjustment program was
supported by a Second Structural Adjustment lending operation approved by
the Board in December 1983. The second phase builds upon the reforms of
SAL I, focussing on measures to improve the mobilization and management of
resources, to strengthen key institutions, and to upgrade the performance
of the public sector.  The program has been successful in achieving most of
its objectives. Among the achievements of the program have been (a)
increased smallholder export production following an increase in price
incentives; (b) increased industrial production and investment incentives
resulting from a program of price decontrols; (C) increased domestic energy
production; (d) a strengthening of the financial position of key public and
private enterprises; and (e) a reduction in the budgetary and balance of
payments deficits. Efforts to improve the control and allocation of pub'lic
expenditures and to reduce the overall size of Government have been slow,
but steps in the right direction have been taken. While the economy has
grown at a moderate rate in 1983-85, prospects are for continued economic
difficulties and the need for continued adjustment to balance of payments,
fiscal and transport constraints.
14.       An IDA Credit for US$30 million equivalent and a US$ 40 million
equivalent African Facility Credit for the Third Structural Adjustment
Operation were approved by the Board on December 19, 1985. The program is
designed to encourage productivity and efficiency, diversify the export
base and promote exports, strengthen the Government's policy making
capability, and improve the performance of development institutions. The



- 5 -
Government has taken actlon, inter alia, to reduce subsidies, complete the
price deregulation process, strengthen its policy and planning units,
reduce parastatal deficits, and rationalize the role of the Agricultural
Development and Marketing Corporation. Second tranche release is expected
in October 1986, about three months behind schedule principally because of
delays in preparing the Government's three year public sector investment
program and setting up an export promotion program.
External Debt Restructuring
15.       By the end of 1985, Malawi's external public debt outstanding and
disbursed totalled US$786 million. In late 1982, Malawi rescheduled both
its official and commercial debts. Otherwise its debt servicing, including
repayments to the IMF, would have amounted to over US$130 million,
equivalent to about 48 percent of exports of goods and services. This
compares to a level of about 10 percent in the mid-1970s. A second year of
rescheduling was agreed to in October of 1983, keeping the debt service
ratio to 28 percent in 1983. The Government has indicated that it will not
be asking for any further rescheduling, and the debt service ratio is
expected to be 38 percent in 1986 before falling to about 26 percent in
1989. Because of this high debt service ratio, commercial bank borrowing
will have to remain sharply curtailed and the balance of payments gap
should be closed by concessionary financing. Similarly, constraints on
local borrowing would indicate the need for local cost financing to be
provided by donors.
PAT II - BANK GROUP OEnRATEONS IN MALAWI
16.       Over the past 20 years, Malawi has received 35 IDA credits and
one Special Fund credit, totalling about US$492 million, and 10 Bank loans
totalling US$124 million, of which 2 were oa third window terms. Malawi
has also rcceived one African Facility Credit totalling US$40.0 million
equivalent. The first Bank loan to Malawi was made on third window terms
in June 1976 and the first standard Bank loan in April 1977. Of the Bank
Group assistance, some US$182 million (29 percent) was for agriculture,
US$108 million (18 percent) for education, USS114 million (18 percent) for
roads, US$168 million (21 percent) for structural adjustment, US$39 million
(6 percent) for power, US$11 million (2 percent) for water, and the ba'ance
of US$35 million (6 percent) for health, development finance, technical
assistance, and urban housing. In FY86, a credit of US$11.6 million
equivalent for an Agricultural Extension and Planning Support Project, a
US$30.0 million equivalent IDA Credit and a USS40.0 million African
Facility Credit for the Third Structural Adjustment Operation, a US$7.6
million loan for an Industrial and Agricultural Credit Project, and a loan
of US$16.7 million equivalent for a Second Wood Energy Project were
approved. For FY87, lending operations are planned in water supply,
transport, health, and education. IFC's equity participations and lending
commitments in Malavi total about US$27.9 million and include investments
in textiles, sugar, a Development Finance Corporation (INDEBANK}, tourism,
the manufacture of alcohol from molasses and a leasing and finance
company. In addition, a US$0.5 million equity subscription and USS3.2



-6-
million loan investment in the Viphya Plywoods and Allied Industries United
were approved in August 1984 and August 1986. Annex II contains a Summary
Statement of Bank Group Operations as of September 30, 1986.
Bank Lending Strategy
17.       Support for the Government's structural adjustment program vill
continue to remain a focal point of the Bank's lending and economic and
sector work program. Greater emphasis will be placed, however, on new
initiatives designed to achieve more effective productivity gains, and to
bring about more vigorous production and export diversification results.
Equally important will be efforts to help the Government strengthen its
institutions in charge of economic management with a view to solidifying
the policy changes that have been made and expanding the capacity for
taking future policy initiatives. Another area of emphasis will be human
resource development. Malawi's life expectancy, infant survival, primary
school enrollment and completion, and secondary school enrollment rates are
among the lowest in the world, while the population growth rate is among
the highest in the world. Finally, Malawi needs support in its efforts to
further improve the efficiency of resource use, identify potential sources
of future growth and promote resource conservation. Increased aid
coordination and mobilization will be needed for Malawi to reach its growth
potential.
18.       Our economic and sector work will focus on helping the Government
formulate its medium and longer tern development strategy. The next CEM
(FY87) will focus on this topic. Other ESW will complement the program
related to institutional and human resource development and
diversification. Identifying areas of development management that need
strengthening will contribute to helping the Government to institutionalize
the reforms that it has been making. To help develop a strategy for
diversification and privatization will require in depth looks at the
National Rural Development Program (NRDP) and the agricultural sector as a
whole as well as defining an industrial development strategy. As progress
has been made in the SALs to improve the industrial policy environment, the
focus of the industrial sector work would be on institutions and policies
which affect investment incentives and opportunities. The recommendations
of a report on the parastatal sector, to be completed shortly, will provide
a basis for the Government's restructuring of parastatals. Sector work on
local governments will focus on increasing cost recovery for urban services
and on strengthening the role of local authorities in providing for urban
services.
19.       A Consultative Group meeting was held in January 1986 with the
objective of improving donor coordination and increasing the level of
resources needed to support Malawi's adjustment process.  Local aid
coordination efforts have been increasing and a second CG is expected in
1987.
External Debt
20.       The Bank Group's share of Malawi's external debt (disbursed and
outstanding) at the end of 1985 was about 52 percent (IBRD: 10 percent,
IDA: 42 percent), and its share in debt service was about 12 percent.



-7-
Because Malawi is one if the least developed countries, may other donors
give aid on grant terms. Other major donors have been the United Kingdom,
the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Economic Community, and the
African Development Bank.
Disbursements
21.       The levels of disbursements for Malawi, including program
lending, were as follows: in 1982, US$70.1 million; in 1983, US$33.2
million; in 1984, US$58.2 million; In 1985, US$46.4 million; and in 1986,
US$68.3 million. Disbursements of the Bank Group loans and credits in
Malawi have generally been good and compare favorably with other countries
in the region and even on a Bank-wide basis. The disbursement rate on
loans and credits to Malawi (excluding the effect of non-project lending)
has averaged about 26 percent per annum, significantly higher than the
Eastern Africa Regional average of 19 percent and the Bank-wide average of
about 21 percent.
Project Inplementation
22.       Overall, implementation of Bank projects continues to be good.
The Audit and Project Completion Reports underscore Malawi's sound
development record and progress in extending nationwide the benefits of its
investments. During the period 1983-85, there were problems due to
inadequate budget provisions, but since then these problems have been
satisfactorily resolved.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
23.       About one quarter of the area of Malawi is covered by lakes, with
Lake Malawi being by far the largest, and 70 percent of the country drains
into Lake Malawi or the Shire River (the lake's only outlet). There is
ample surface water in Malawi; however, supply is dependent, to a great
extent, on rainfall which has marked seasonality and wide variation in
total precipitation from year to year. Apart from the lakes and rivers,
surface water in Malawi is stored in reservoirs or dams built for water
supply and conservation purposes near Blantyre, the largest city, and
Lilongwe, the rapidly growing capital, as well as near smaller towns and
cities and agricultural areas.
24.       The two major cities of Blantyre and Lilongwe have adequate water
supplies. The Blantyre Water Board (BWB) serves 90 percent of its
population of 360,000. Of Lilongwe's estimated population of 169,000,
about 100,000 people receive full water service from direct connections, a
further 50,000 purchase water from kiosks provided by the Lilongwe Water
Board (LWB), and some 20,000 people rely upon wells and streams. Based on
Lilongwe's expected population growth, piped water supply will need to
increase from 22,000m3 per day in 1985 to about 67,000m3 per day in 1997.
In addition to the two main cities, over the past decade piped water



- 8 -
supplies have been made available in about 50 smaller urban centers. Over
40 percent of the rural population has access to safe water from piped
gravity systems, boreholes and dug wells, and private or institutional
supplies. Self-help schemes are making a significant contribution to
improved water supplies in the rural areas.
25.       About 15 percent of the urban population is connected to
community waste water systems, with the remainder using septic tanks and
pit latrines. To improve and expand alternative, low-cost sanitation (LCS)
technologies, an LCS demonstration project is being carried out under the
Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project (Credit 1272-MAI).
26.       In 1979, a comprehensive reorganization of the management of
activities in the sector was undertaken, leading to the creation of the
Department of Water (DOW) in the Ministry of Works and Supplies.
Currently, the three major institutions dealing with water supply in Malawi
are DOW, BWB, and LWB. The DOW has primary responsibility for developing
and managing water resources throughout Malawi, except in the
municipalities of Blantyre and Lilongwe. It currently operates about 60
urban and institutional water supply systems in the country and has
constructed more than 40 rural piped water supply schemes. It is also
responsible for water resources planning and water pollution control and
provides training for its lower level staff. Currently, UNDP is assisting
DOW to draw up a Water Resources Master Plan for Malawi.
27.       BWB is an autonomous statutory body responsible for water supply
in the city of Blantyre. BWB has a reputation for good management. It
uses local staff, with a few expatriate managers, to plan, design and
supervise minor construction and to operate and maintain a large and fairly
sophisticated water supply system. A "twinning arrangement with a UK
waterworks company has helped BWB to strengthen its internal management.
28.       In 1982 an autonomous Lilongwe Water Board was formally
established. LWB's financial plans and budget proposals are reviewed by
the Controller of Statutory Bodies and a joint presentation by the
Controller and the Board is made to the Treasury for its approval. Senior
staff appointments are also subject to the Controller's approval. A
Chairman and 12 members designated by the Government, with an observer from
the Department of Statutory Bodies, constitute the Board. The
Engineer/Manager is the Chief Executive Officer and is also responsible for
day-to-day management, coordination and direction of functions in the
various departments. Despite being relatively young, the LWB has become an
efficient and relatively well-managed institution. However, assistance is
required to further strengthen its management, including support for high
level managers and engineers, training, and short-term technical
assistance.
29.       LWB's accounts have been maintained on a commercial basis since
FY83. From that time to the end of FY85, revenues rose on average by 21
percent (mainly from a 33 percent increase in sales volume following the
completion of an augmentation scheme) while operating expenditures
(including depreciation) grew by 23.5 percent. There was limited
investment in current assets and an increase in accounts payable. The



- 9 -
operating ratio was unsatisfactory and the return on revalued net fixed
assets was negative. ro help put its finances on a sound basis, and In
line with the Government's overall policy to establish financial
self-sufficiency of parastatals, LIB was granted a tariff increase of 23
percent effective June 1, 1985 and a tariff increase of 14 percent
effective September 1, 1986.
Bank Strategy in the Sector and Experience with Past Lending
30.       The Bank Group has, to date, financed three water supply and
urban sector development projects in Malawi. The first (Credit 711-MAI),
signed in 1977, provided US$7.0 million for the augmentation of the water
supply to Blantyre and for strengthening BWB's management and technical
capabilities. The technical aspects of the project were successfully
implemented. BWB's institutional development and organizational
performance improved considerably and BWB has earned a reputation as one of
the best managed water supply organizations in the region. However,
because the growth of water consumption was lower than anticipated, BWB's
financial performance has been significantly below expectation. This
experience has been taken into account in the proposed project, which is
based on conservative estimates of consumption increases compared to
expected population growth.
31.       The Lilongwe Water Supply Engineering Project (Credit 1272-MAI),
signed in 1982 for US$4.0 million equivalenc, and due to close June 30,
1987, is assisting the Government and LWB to formulate a long-range water
supply program for Lilongwe, prepare a feasibility study and detailed
engineering designs for the water supply extension, strengthen LWB through
improvements in management, financial, and cost recovery capabilities, and
assess the sector's organizational, manpower, and training needs. The
project also provides for a pilot project on low-cost technologies for
sewerage and sanitation. The project is being effectively implemented and
the feasibility studies and engineering design work form the basis of the
proposed project.
32.       The First Urban Project (Credit 1528-MAI), for USS15.0 million
equivalent, signed in 1985, focuses on development of maraet-based and
financially feasible housing programs, and also provides for strengthening
of management in the sector. The project has had a slow start because of
management weaknesses but corrective measures are being taken to speed
implementation.
33.       The Bank Group's strategy in the sector is to strengthen key
institutions so as to ensure their financial and management viability while
at the same time providing support for essential capacity expansion.
Future Bank Group operations will continue to emphasize training and
improvement in administrative and financial management, including
implementation of adequate cost recovery policies, and can be expected to
focus, in particular, on strengthening urban sector management and
developing low-cost sanitation/sewerage systems.

PART IV - THE PROECT
34.       A master plan and feasibility study report for expansion of
Lilongwe's water supply, financed under the Engineering Project, was
submitted to the LWB in August 1984, and was revised and resubmitted in
November 1984. Subsequently, the Government of Malawi and LWB approved the
proposals and work on the detailed engineering designs and bid documents
was completed by early 1986. Appraisal of the proposed project took place
in February 1986. The project was negotiated in Washington, D.C., from
September 9 to 12, 1986. The Malawi delegation was led by Mr. J.C. Idbeye,
Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Finance. A credit and project
summary is given at the beginning of this report and a supplementary
project data sheet is provided in Annex III.
Proj ect ObJectives
35.       The principal objective  of the proposed project is to expand
Lilongwe's water supply system in order to meet Lilongwe's water demands up
to about 1995-1997. The project is also designed to strengthen LWB's
management and to help determine an appropriate strategy for Lilongwe's
long-ternm sewerage and sanitation requirements.
Project Description
36.       After review of some 16 potential dam-sites, the two-stage
construction of a new dam 6km downstream of the existing dam was found to
be most cost-effective. The first stage, to be financed under the project,
would serve needs through 1997, and the second, to be put into operation
shortly after 1997, would meet needs through 2005. In conjunction with the
raising of the existing dam, there would be a virtually zero risk of source
failure until 1997. In addition to dam construction, the water treatment
plant and related works would be expanded to meet expected demands through
1997. Management staff support as well as a comprehensive training
program, including a twinning arrangement with a UK waterworks firm, would
continue the process, begun under the Engineering Project, of strengthening
LWB's management. A pilot on-site sanitation project initiated under the
Engineering Project, and designed to illustrate LCS technologies, would be
continued, and a feasibility study of Lilongwe's long-term sanitation and
sewerage options would be prepared. The proposed project would include the
following components:
(a) construction of a new earthfill dam on the Lilongwe River
near Masula, which would be 24 meters high and 750 meters
long, including site clearance, earthworks, concrete works,
instrumentation, pipework, and fencing, and road and water
pipeline diversions;
(b) remedial works, including the raising of the crest level by
one meter, on an existing dam serving Lilongwe;
(c) extension of water treatment plant capacity by 32,000
m3/day;



- 11 -
(d)  extension of the water transmission and distribution system,
including the laying of transmission mains, and construction
of new service reservoirs, elevated water tanks and booster
pumping stations;
(e)  supply of vehicles and equipment to LWB;
(f)  consultancy services for engineering and construction
supervision;
(g)  strengthening of LWB through management staff support and
training; and
(b)  implementation of the on-site sanitation scheme and
preparation of the feasibilitv study of Lilongwe's long-term
sanitation and sewerage options.
Project Costs
37.       Total prolect cost (exclusive of interest during construction) is
estimated at MK55 million (US$30.5 million), and is provided in detail in
the cost estimate table of the project summary. Physical contingencies are
estimated at 15 percent for dam construction, 5 percent for supply of pipes
and equipment, and 10 percent for civil works and other miscellaneous
items. Price contingencies reflect current international and Malawi price
trends. The Government and the Malawi Housing Corporation will finance
expansion of the water distribution system, as planned development of
Lilongwe proceeds; therefore distribution costs have been excluded from the
project, with the exception of minor works for infilling mains in the
existing system, and for providing piped water supply in the unplanned
areas. In accordance with legislation currently in force, developers of
all new planned areas are required to pay for all water reticulation and
connections. Since these regulations are strictly enforced, tlae expansion
of the water distribution system will be ensured.
Financing Plan
38.       Details of project financing are provided in the project
summary.  The proposed IDA credit of USS20.0 million equivalent would cover
65 percent of the total project cost. The European Investment Bank (EIB)
would provide US$6.5 million equivalent, or 21 percent of total project
costs, to finance a part of dam construction costs as well as water supply
and other equipment. The Overseas Development Administration (ODA) would
finance training and support for expatriate engineers at an estimated cost
of USS670,000, or 2 percent of total project costs. About USS2.2 million
equivalent would be financed from LWB's self-generated funds and US$1.1
million equivalent would be provided by the Government of Malawi.
39.       An amount of US$19.4 equivalent of the IDA credit would be
on-lent to the LWB at an interest rate of 11 percent for 25 years,
Including six years' grace during which period the interest due to the
Malawi Government would be capitalized. The EIB loan is expected to be



- 12 -
on-lent to the LWB at the same rate as that of the IDA credit. For the ODA
contribution 60 percent would be on a grant basis and 40 percent would be
on-lent to LWB on the same terms as that of the on-lending of the IDA
credit to LWB. Out of the Government of Malawi contribution, USS1.1
million equivalent would be lent to LWB at 11 percent interest, paid
annually, with principal to be repaid beginning in 1993, and US$0.05
million equivalent would be in the form of counterpart funds for the
sanitation component. These lending terns conform to standards for lending
to revenue-generating entities in Malawi. The on-lending rate would be
positive in real terms over the life of the Project. The signing of the
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government of Malawi and LWB, and
fulfilllment of all conditions for effectiveness of the EIB loan agreement,
are conditions of credit effectiveness.
Project Implementation
40.       LWB would be responsible for the implementation of the water
supply component of the project, and would retain engineering consultants
for construction supervision and for the detailed civil engineering and
structural design of the water treatment plant extension. Project
implementation is underway. Bids have been received and a contract for the
construction of the new dam and the remedial works of the existing dam will
be signed in early 1987. Expansion of the water treatment plant, which is
needed by end 1992, would commence in 1990. Imple;aentation of the
sanitation component would be carried out by the Ministry of Local
Government and the Lilongwe City Council. The qualifications, experience
and terms of reference of the LWB's engineer/manager and chief accountant
would be acceptable to the Association. A training program acceptable to
the Association has been prepared. A dam expert would review progress in
implementation of dam construction to ensure that the dam concept and
design is being adequately implemented.
Land Acquisition and Relocation
41.       The construction of a new dam will require the relocation of
about 35 families, most of whom are involved in smallholder farming. A
plan acceptable to the Association for acquisition of the land, relocation
of affected families, and adequate compensation has been prepared. The
value of the land to be purchased is estimated at no more than 1K200,000.
The Government would indemnify LWB for future land value litigations in
excess of the agreed compensation sum. Implementation of the plan would be
rev'ewed during supervision missions.
Procurement
42.       Procurement of goods, works, and services is summarized as
follows:

43.       Procurement would follow Bank guidelines for international
competitive bidding, except that purchase of vehicles and minor equipment
estimated at less than US$50,000 equivalent and not totalling more than
US$300,000 equivalent would be procured through local competitive bidding.
In addition, construction of individual waste disposal units included in
the sanitation component would be carried out by force account and
construction materials for the sanitation component up to an aggregate
amount of US$100,000 equivalent would be supplied directly from stock items
of the Ministry of Works and Supplies or under local procedures acceptable
to the Association. A General Procurement Notice calling for
prequalification for the Lilongwe Water Supply expansion works was
published in the Business Edition of the Development Forum on August 31,
1985. The response was substantial and bids for the first phase of the
project, construction of the new dam and related works, were received in
August, 1986.



- 14 -
Disbursement
44.       Proceeds from the proposed credit would be disbursed as follows:
70 percent of foreign and 60 percent of local expenditures for dam
construction; 100 percent of foreign and 70 percent of local expenditure of
eligible civil works, supply, and equipment contracts; 100 percent of total
expenditures for all consultancy and advisory services; and 100 percent of
foreign expenditure for the engineer/manager and financial controller. EIB
would finance 30 percent of foreign and 30 percent of local expenditures
for dam construction and 100 percent of total expenditures for mechanical
and electrical equipment for the project.
45.       In order to expedite the flow of funds for disbursements of small
payments, a Special Account with an initial deposit of US$1.5 million would
be established in US dollars with a commercial bank for the water supply
component. All disbursement requests would be fully documented, except
that disbursements against contracts for items under contracts or purchase
orders of less than US$20,000 equivalent would be supported by Statements
of Expenditures, documentation for which would be held by the implementing
agencies and be made available for inspection by supervision missions.
Monitoring and Evaluation
46.       Project monitoring guidelines have been establi;hed and
monitoring of the LWB's acrounts and expenditures has been adequate. LWB
would submit a Project Co-mlretion Report six months after completion of the
project.
AcrIit and Accoiunts
47.       LWBts annual financial statements are published promptly and
independent auditors have conducted external audits satisfactorily. LWB's
audited accounts, as well as accounts for the sanitation component, would
be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of each fiscal
year.
Environmental and Health Aspects
48.       The project would help maintain the present high standard of
water supply and health conditions in Lilongwe City, and would have no
adverse environmental impact, except for loss of about 300 ha of farmland
for dam construction. There would be no significant effect on the quantity
or quality of water discharged from the Lilongwe River into Lake Malawi,
and the riparian states of Mozambique and Tanzania have been so informed.
The remedial works on the existing dam would eliminate the danger of
accidental flooding caused by major damage or dam collapse. LWB would take
all reasonable measures to ensure that the project is carried out with due
regard to ecological and environmental factors.



- 15 -
Financial Analysis
49.       The limited financial capability of the LWB Board (para. 29)
reinforces the need for a conservative approach to forecasts of demand as
well as costs. Out of an expected 200 percent increase in revenues from
1986 to 1992, 42 percent would be accounted for by an increase in average
daily sales volume, while the remainder would be met by an increase in
tariffs from MK0.42 per m3 in 1986 to MK0.88 per m3 1992, for an average
increase of 14 percent per annum or 5 percent in real terms. By 1992,
tariffs will have increased by approximately 25 percent in real terms. The
increases in volume and tariffs would yield a return of 5.8 percent on
revalued net fixed assets in 1992 and would provide an internal rate of
return (net of inflation) of 4.6 percent on the proposed project. By FY98,
when the new facility is producing at capacity, the debt/service ratio is
projected at 1.8, and the rate of return at around 8 percent.
50.       The existence of a block tariff system in which different
categories of consumers are charged at a different rate allows flexibility
in the implementation of tariff increases and limited cross-subsidization
among income groups. a. this basis, water tariffs are expected to be
affordable by the lowest income groups, 2 percent of whose income would be
expected to pay for water tariffs as compared to an international standard
of 3.5 percent of income. Computerization of the billing system, currently
underway, will enable LWB to target tariff increases more accurately as
well as to speed up payments.
51.       In order to ensure the financial viability of LWB, the Government
would grant the necessary annual tariff increases to enable the LWB to
achieve at least the following rates of return on annually revalued net
fixed assets: FY89, 2 percent; FY90, 3 percent; FY91, 5 percent; FY92, 5
percent; FY93, 2 percent; FY94, 3 percent; FY95, 4 percent; and FY96, 5
percent. Based on present projections, annual Increases of 5 percent in
real terms would be necessary to meet this objective. The Government
intends to grant such increases, subject to an annual review of the effect
of the existing tariff on LWB's financial performance. If for any reason
LWB fails to achieve the agreed upon rate of return in any one year, then
in the following year the Government would take the necessary steps to
recover the situation. To help meet these targets, LWB would prepare
timely requests for annual tariff increases and !fould annually revalue its
fixed assets using methods acceptable to the Bank.
52.       By June 30, 1988, LWB will increase production capacity by 5,000
m3/day to 35,000 m3/day.  The cost of this scheme, estimated at MK600,000,
would be financed principally by LWBi's internal cash generation and would
result in annual revenue Increases of about MKI.0 million per annum. By no
later than June 30, 1987 the Government of Malawi will lend to the LWB MK2
million which would be used by LWB for the counterpart financing of the
project. Interest on this loan would be no higher than the on-lending
terms of the IDA Credit and would be repaid annually. Repayment of
principal would begin January 1, 1993. Ownership of a recently completed
augmentation scheme which increased the daily capacity of LWB from



- 16 -
20,000m3 to 30,000m3 has been transferred to LWB. The terms and conditions
of payment by LMB to the Government for the cost of this scheme would be
acceptable to the Association and repayment of interest and principal would
not begin until December 31, 1994.
Project Benefits
53.       The project would prevent water shortages in Lilongwe from
becoming progressively more severe and enhance the further development of
the rapidly growing capital city of Malawi by providing the required water
supply infrastructure to meet demands up to 1995-97. Substantial
management staff support and training would contribute to the long-term
institutional development of LWB. The pilot project and feasibility study
would assist in providing a least cost solution to Lilongwe's long-term
sewerage and sanitation needs.
54.       In estimating the economic rate of return (ERR) of the proposed
project, capital and operating costs and all measurable benefits
attributable to the investment were taken into account in the cost and
benefit streams. Incremental water revenues, calculated on proposed
average tariff charges in real terms (based on 1986 price levels), were
taken as the best proxy of the benefits. On this basis, the project's
estimated economic rate of return is 5.5 percent. In addition
unquantifiable benefits would accrue from improved health, and
environmental conditions and increased labor productivity. A sensitivity
analysis, using a 10 percent reduction in benefits, produced an ERR of 4.6
percent. A 10 percent reduction in costs yielded an ERR of 6.2 percent.
The long-term marginal cost of the water, i.e., including the second phase
of the long-tens development plan for water supply in the Lilongwe area, is
about equal to the average tariff level projected for 1992.
Project Risks
55.       The main project risk is that LWB would not be able to generate
sufficient revenue from incremental water sales for debt service,
operation, maintenance, and minor investments. To minimize this risk, the
project is based on conservative estimates of demand. The Government, in
line with its overall policy regarding self-sufficiency of parastatals,
has agreed to permit LWB to increase water charges as needed so as to be
financially self-supporting.
