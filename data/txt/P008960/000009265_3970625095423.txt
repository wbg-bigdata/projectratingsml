ELBISTAN OPERATION & MAINTENANCE (O & M) ASSISTANCE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
The 1974 Elbistan Thermal Power Project
1.01     Lignite and hydro are Turkey's most significant indigenous energy
resources. With about three billion tons of proven reserves, Afsin-Elbistan
is by far the most important lignite deposit in Turkey. Even before the oil
crisis of 1973, the development of Afsin-Elbistan was the centerpiece of
Turkey's energy development program. Success or failure of Turkey's energy
self-sufficiency policy depends largely on the successful utilization of
Afsin-Elbistan lignite. The 1974 integrated Elbistan Thermal Power Project (a
4x300-MW power station-and a 20 million ton/a (Mt/a) associated lignite mine)
is the first attempt to exploit Afsin-Elbistan. It accounts for a substantial
share of Turkish investment (36% and 132 of investments in the power sector
during 1975-1980 and 1981-1985 respectively) and is a highly visible operation.
Preparation and Appraisal of the original (1974) Elbistan Project
1.02     The first contacts regarding Elbistan were made in August 1969. The
original Project was appraised in October 1973 and subsequent missions visited
Turkey again in February and March 1974 to follow up the appraisal and prepare
negotiations. Bank representatives also attended meetings of potential
multilateral and bilateral financing agencies in Paris in January and March
1974 and in Frankfurt in April 1974 to discuss financing and procurement
arrangements. Further discussions on the financing arrangements, followed by
negotiations, took place in Mav in Washington. The Bank provided about 24% of
the foreign financing through a loan approved on June 27, 1974 (Loan 1023-TU)
for US$148 million (US$123 million for the power station to Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK) and US$25 million to Turkish Coal Enterprises
(TKI) for the lignite mine). Annex 1.1 shows the total cofinancing package at
the time of appraisal, which consisted also of German Aid (KfW), European
Investment Bank (EIB), US EXIMBANK, Japanese EXIMBANK, Italy and France.
1.03     During the early stages of preparation of the 1974 Project, a mine
output of up to 15 Mt/a and a 600-MW power plant (4 x 150 MW) were
considered. In an effort to achieve economies of scale--a necessary move to
reach the economic threshold of acceptability at a time when fuel oil price
projections were only a fraction of present levels-TEK, with support of its
consultants, decided to increase the power plant rating to 1200 MW (4x3OO MW)
and the mine design output to 20 Mt/a, with most of the lignite intended for
power generation.



(2728P)                               - 2 -
1.04     Because of its size and conplexity, anl intensive scrutiny of the
technical aspects of the Project was completed before appraisal. The
appraisal concentrated on organizational, managerial, financial and economic
aspects. The preappraisal work included, inter alia, engineering studies
subject to independent technical opinion by a Bank consultant, additional
geological and hydrological investigations and lignite burnability tests, and
endorsement by independent consultants of methods of excavation recommended by
the engineering consultants. The boiler design was based on solid experience
gained elsewhere with low grade lignite.
Loan Effectiveness, Loan 1023-TU
1.05     The loan was signed on June 28, 1974.  Loan effectiveness was delayed
by about two years (from the original date of November 1, 1974 to June 1,
1976) on account of non-compliance with conditions of effectiveness which
related to (i) improving TEK's finances (revaluation of TEK's assets, increase
in tariffs); (ii) establishment of satisfactory project coordination
arrangements; (iii) cross-effectiveness clauses because of joint financing of
discrete project components with other agencies; and (iv) submission of legal
opinion. Of all these, the tariff issue held up the effectiveness condition
the longest, followed by the cross-effectiveness clause. After much
deliberation, a tariff increase was eventually enacted in May 1976 and, after
extending the deadline six times, the loan was declared effective June 1, 1976.
Description of the original (1974) Elbistan Project
1.06     The 1974 Elbistan Thermal Power Project was designed to supply
electric power using low grade lignite from the Kislakoy mine in
Afsin-Elbistan as part of a balanced program of power development utilizing
Turkey's fuel and hydropower resources. It also provided an opportunity for
the Bank's first involvement in the mining sector. Other project objectives
were to address institutional problems (organization, management, personnel
and finances) that were apparent in TEK and TKI and which proved to be the
main causes of delays in the execution of the Project. The original Project
included the following components-.
(a)  a thermal power station with four 30e-MI lignite-fired units
delivering, after meeting the pno;er station and mine loads, an
estimated 1,048 MW and 7,030 ,Wh p.a. to TEK's interconnected system;
(b)  380-kV transmission lines, about 540 km long, connecting Elbistan
with Kayseri and Ankara by 1978 and 1979 respectively;
(c)  an open-cast lignite mine with a planned capacity of 20.7 Mt/a, 17.9
Mt/a for the power station and 2.8 Mt/a for processing for sale as
domestic fuel; the Project included the cost of land and restoration
of the worked-out mining area;
(d) separate pennanent housing for power station and mine staff and roads
between these and the works as well as Afsin-Elbistan towns; and
(e) consultancy services.



2728P                                  - 3 -
The domestic fuel drying plant estimated to cost about US$75 million in 1974,
intended for processing lignite for sale as domestic fuel, was excluded frcu
the Project at appraisal for lack of sufficient engineering information.
Implementation Problems
1.07     Several agencies were involved in the execution of the supporting
infrastructure, e.g., roads, telecommunications, etc. Since each of the
involved agencies had its own identity, commitments and priorities, the
coordination required to successfully implement a project as large and complex
as Elbistan, probably the largest single project in Turkey, became difficult
to achieve. The coordinating committee set up by Government to coordinate
activities of all organizations associated with the Project proved to be
ineffective.
1.08     TEK and TKI had difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient
numbers of suitably qualified and experienced salaried personnfl for the
execution of the Project because of the remoteness and poor living conditions
of the site and the low and rigid civil service salary structure. Project
site supervision ran into difficulties due to inexperience of the site staff
of TEK and TKI, their limited executive authority, since the project
management remained essentially in the hands of headquarter's staff in Ankara,
and poor coordination between the two entities. These root problems led to
technical and administrative problems such as delavs in procurement of
equipment for the lignite mine and in payment to contractors for work carried
out, lack of supervision and control of civil works, and failure to develop
and implement dewatering procedures.
1.09     Moreover, delays in the provision of local funds by the Government
have seriously affected implementation of the Projezt. This state of affairs
was a result of both shortage of funds and unsatisfactory disbursement
arrangements.
Changes in Project Scope
1.10     Aside from increasing the nameplate rating of the power units from
300 MW to 340 MW to accommodate a standard design and adding a 30-km water
supply pipeline, no major changes were made in project scope. However, in
1981 TEK agreed to increase expatriate support for: (i) construction
supervision, (ii) project management, and (iii) startup, operation and
maintenance (0 & M) activities. Lately there have been slight design
modifications to the boiler and ash handling plants to reflect operating
experience with Units 1 and 2.
Past Procurement and Disbursements
1.11     All procurement under the Bank loan (Loan 1023-TU) took place through
ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.  No major
procurement issues arose. Annex 1.2 shows a summary of the contracts financed
under the loan and Annex 1.3 compares the actual disbursements with the
appraisal estimate. Due to delays in loan effectiveness and project
implementation, actual disbursements lagged behind estimates by about three
years. The loan Closing Date was June 30, 1983. The Loan Account was kept



2728P                                 - 4 -
open to permit TEK and TKI to complete disbursements against contracts awarded
before the closing date. The loan was fully disbursed by September 15, 1983.
Ongoing contracts have been financed in 1983-1985 by KfW, EIB and the
Government.
Adverse Project Cost Factors
1.12     The severe delays in the execution of the Project (para. 1.13) are in
great part attributable to labor disputes and periods of political and social
unrest during 1977-1980, particularly in the remote Kahramanmaras province
where the Project is located. The delays resulted in cost overruns, more than
doubling the original cost estimate. A revised cost estimate is shown in
Annex 1.4. The following factors also contributed:
(a) Exchange Rate Variation: The bulk of equipment was procured from
countries whose currencies appreciated substantially during project
implementation: DM during the late 70's and Yen in the 80's.
(b) Increased Cost of Engineering and Administration: When the project
ran into difficulties, additional expatriate technical assistance was
brought in starting in 1981 (para. 1.10); actual man months of
engineering and administration are more than double the appraisal
estimate. This is further reflected in the relatively large amount
estimated for Engineering and Administration in Table 4.1.
(c) Interest During Construction: The length of the execution period for
the Project coupled with massive borrowings to cover the financing
gap substantially increased the amount of interest during
construction.
Status and Operating Performance of -he Original (1974) Elbistan Project
1.13     The Project is about seven years behind schedule but there has been
no slippage since 1983. The present situ.tion can be summarized as follows:
(a) Power Station; All the main plant and equipment for the four 340-MW
units are procured and on site. The cooling towers, chimney and the
bulk of the civil works are complete. Since July 1982, erection work
has been proceeding satisfactorily. Unit 1 went into commercial
operation in January 1985. Unit 2 went into trial operation in May
1985 and is going into commercial operation in January 1986. Units 3
and 4 are to follow at one year intervals. Operating performance
data for Units 1 and 2 in September 1985 is given in Annex 1.5.
(b) Lignite Mine: The mine is fully operational, but the quantities of
material moved at the mine over the past three years have been well
below planned levels. However, by March 1985, the mine had
thoroughly uncovered the lignite seam for the first time, with an
inventory of about 4.3 Mt available for immediate mining. Data
gained from the seam showed improved geological conditions compared
to those previously assumed from exploration results, resulting in
more lignite available within power station specifications and a
lower overall stripping ratio. Although no mine planning based on



(2728P)                               -5-
the new parameters has been done as yet and further verification is
required, the Bank is satisfied that the design of the existing main
equipment is adequate to handle the required quantities of material
without major overburden backlogs over the next two-three years
provided, however, that corrective action is taken to renmve the
following major operational constraints: insufficient numbers of
managerial and skilled personnel, lack of training personnel and
programs, insufficient spare and wear parts, inadequate maintenance
arrangements, and inefficient removal of hard strata.
(c)  Domestic Fuel Drying Plant:  In the light of the problems encountered
to supply lignite for the power station, TKI has decided not to
proceed with the lignite drying plant associated with the original
Project (para. 1.06(c)). The Bank has agreed to this decision.
(d) Transmission Lines; Of the two 380-kV lines under the original
Project, Elbistan-Kayseri has been in operation since 1983. The
other, Elbistan-Ankara, is under construction and scheduled for
completion in time to accommodate commercial operation of Unit 3
starting in January 1987 (see Map IBRD 19045).
Rationale for Continued Bank Involvement
1.14     The Elbistan Project is almost complete.  Project implementation is
under control and progressing well. The mine is fully operational and
construction on the fourth and last unit in the power station is scheduled for
completion by the end of 1986. Moreover, in line with the agreed energy
sector strategy (para. 2.01), the government is committed to introducing
adequate measures at the lignite mine to ensure the long term availability of
sufficient lignite for efficient operation of the power plant (para. 4.14).
1.15     Throughout the implementation of Elbistan, starting in 1974, the
three major cofinanciers, KfW, EIB and IBRD, have acted in close coordination,
always maintaining a common, unified position. A great deal of the recent
favorable turn of events can be attributed to the persistent, concerted
efforts of the Bank, KfW and EIB. In addition to participating with the Bank
in the proposed project, KfW and EIB also plan to fund a parallel project to
assist TKI carry out operation and maintenance improvements at the lignite
mine (para. 4.06). Now that a solution to Elbistan's long standing technical
and institutional problems is, at last, in sight, it would be highly desirable
for the Bank to stay on with KfW and EIB to see the project through. Although
modest in financial terms (US$10 million), the proposed project would provide
for the Bank's continued presence in this key thermal power project in Turkey,
consistent with the ongoing effective sector dialogue (para. 2.05).

II. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Sectoral Context
2.01     The importance of Elbistan to Turkey's energy development is still
high in spite of the severe delays experienced in the Project. Furthermore,
present Bank strategy in the energy sector is to focus on projects that can be
brought on stream rapidly. The proposed Project fits in well with the energy
policy of the current Five-Year Development Plan. Turkey's present energy
policy, as endorsed by the Bank, establishes, inter alia, that priority is to
be given to development of domestic sources of energy, especially hydro and
lignite, provided that they are economically justified.    The magnitude of
the looming energy supply gap dictates that priority be given to completion of
projects at an advanced stage of construction, such as Elbistan Units 3 and
4. An in-depth discussion of the Turkish energy s :ctor and the current Bank
strategy for energy lending is given in Annex 2.1.
Role of the Bank and Past Lending Experience in the Power Subsector
2.02     The proposed Project would be the eighteenth Bank operation in the
power subsector in Turkey. The Bank has made thirteen loans and a technical
assistance grant (total US$921.7 million), and IDA has granted three credits
(total US$55.7 million). These comprise loans/credits for four hydroelectric
projects; two thermal power stations (oil- and lignite-fired); a lignite mine;
and several for transmission and distribution networks. The technical
assistance grant helped reorganize Turkey's power subsector. The first five
loans/credits were for projects in the Cukurova Electric Company (CEAS)
concession area.  The Bank has made six previous loans to TEK, for the First,
Second Third and Faurth Power Transmission Projects, for System Operations
Assistance, and for the 1974 Elbistan Thermal Power Project (Loan 1023-TU).
2.03     A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR), distributed to the Board
in November 1981, on the Keban Transmission (Loan 568-TU) and the first TEK
Power Transmission (Loan 763-TU) projects found that these projects had met
their physical objectives despite implementation delays and cost overruns. A
Project Completion Report on the Istanbul Power Distribution Project (Loan
892-TU), distributed to the Board in December 1982, also reported physical
completion of the Project after considerable delay. Major constraints to
timely project completion were identified as shortage of local counterpart
finance and, in the case of Loan 892-TU, late preparation of bidding
documents. A major conclusion of the TEK II (Loan 1194-TU) Project Completion
Report circulated to the Executive Directors on October 29, 1984 was the clear
need for a single project management unit within TEK to be accountable for
project implementation. Such a monitoring unit has now become a feature of
project design in Bank-financed power projects in Turkey. For example,
ELTEM-TEK, a Turkish consultant assisted by foreign specialists, was hired by
TEK to assist in monitoring all aspects of the Third TEK Transmission Project
(Loan 2232-TU). Procurement and physical implementation of this project, which
includes about 1500 km of 380-kV lines, are proceeding with only minor delays.

2.04    The Bank played a major role in the consolidation of the power sector
and in the creation of TEK. The Bank has since then continued to advocate
needed institutional reforms and has met with some success in its endeavors to
assist in strengthening the institutional capabilities of the subsector.
Substantial progress has been made in some areas, e.g., improvements in TEK's
accounting system, in system planning, and in procurement procedures.
Furthermore, the Bank has assisted in attracting funds from other bilateral
and international financing agencies (e.g., EIB, US EXIMBANK).
2.05    The Bank has, through its sector work program, provided guidance and
assistance in sector planning and pricing policy, including discussions with
the Government and energy sector agencies (e.g., TEK). These have provided a
useful forum for a policy dialogue on the issues and constraints facing the
subsector. Policy level discussions with MENR, TEK and State Planning
Organization (SPO) have continued to increase the awareness of those problems;
and Bank guidance and advice have frequently been sought on a number of
operational and policy questions.
2.06    Since it is not possible to address the full range of issues facing
the subsector it was recommended that attention be given to a selected number
of high priority issues where the Bank could have an appreciable impact. T.ie
strategy for assisting the power subsector is in line with the overall planned
strategy for the energy sector as outlined in Annex 2.1 (para. 15) and
includes focusing resources on investments which yield quick returns (e.g.,
completion of priority ongoing investments, upgrading of existing facilities,
reduction in losses, improvements in efficiency etc.); ensuring a balanced
electric power development program with respect to adequate investment in
generation, transmission, distribution and general plant; strengthening,
through technical assistance, capabilities in planning, financial management
and manpower development; investment in new generation options such as those
based upon imported coal and natural gas; and increasing the role of the
private sector in the production of electricity.
2.07    The Bank has made a major effort at defining jointly with Government a
series of potential investments which would address the above medium-term
issues. In particular the Bank proposes to finance, inter alia, an urban
distribution component of a proposed Energy Policy Loan, a project (Sir Hydro)
with a private utility, Cukurova Elektrik A.S. (CEAS), and a high priority
hydropower pr-cW: (Kayraktepe).  Project lending aimed at alleviating the
medium-term' problems faced by the subsector will be supported judiciously by
technical assistance and sector work in a number of key areas such as planning
and financial management.

III. THE PROJECT ENTITY:TEK
3.01     TEK has primary responsibility in Turkey for design and
construction of thermal generating plants, for operation of both thermal and
hydroelectric generating plants, and for design, construction and operation
of the national transmission system and distribution systems. The
organization and scope of responsibilities of TEK have been altered recently
by a number of significant legal changes. TEK is now authorized to invest
in and operate lignite mines and geothermal fields to supply its power
plants; previously TKI was the only public enterprise authorized to own and
operate lignite mines. In parallel, the opportunities for private sector
investment in electric power have been expanded, removing TEK's previous
near monopoly on electricity generation and sales. TEK will continue to
require the Bank's assistance in institution-building. TEK is presently
receiving technical assistance in four areas as part of Loan 2322-TU (TEK
Transmission III), as follows: demand management and load analysis;
administration and standardization of distribution operations; manpower
planning and training; and, improvements in accounting and management
information systems.
Legal Context
3.02     TEK presently operates as a Public Economic Establishment (PEE)
defined under Law 233 as a venture owned entirely by the Government which is
"public service-oriented and founded to produce and market basic goods and
services of a monopoly nature". As part of the reform in public
enterprises, TEK's legal structure and organization were redefined
effective January 1, 1985. TEK was originally established in 1970 with its
current mandate, but excluding urban electricity distribution, which had
been the respousibility of the municipalities. Urban distribution was then
legally transferred to TEK in 1982, with actual operation and control of
these distribution facilities being assumed in stages during 1983 and 1984.
The objective of public enterprise reform in Turkey has been to permit
greater aut.miomy and improved productivity, and in fact the Government has
recently been taking significant steps toward increasing TEK's financial
self-sufficiency. However, TEK continues to be subject to the State
Personnel Law (No. 657), which restricts management decisions on hiring,
firing, salaries, and internal transfer of staff. Revised legislation for
government employees is being drafted but the timing for implementation is
uncertain.



(2728P)                             - 9 -
Organization and Management of TEK
3.03      Notwithstanding the recent reforms affecting public enterprises,
important managerial and organizational decisions continue to require
Government approval, and thus are not dealt with as quickly as would be the
case in a more autonomous utility. Furthermore, there are no board members
from the private sector who could represent the concerns of TEK's industrial
and private consumers. In the past fifteen years, TEK has had seven general
managers, normally appointed from within the company. The Board of Directors
of TEX is chaired by the General Manager, and includes five members; two
nominated by the MENR, one nominated by the Minister of Finance and two
nominated from among the six Assistant General Managers (AGMs) of TEK by the
Minister of Energy. The present organization of TEK is shown in Annex 3.1.
The responsibilities of the six AGMs were shifted in early 1985, and are
currently divided as follows:
(a)   Operations:  Generation, Transmission and Distribution;
(b)   Design and Construction of Generating Plants;
(c)   Design and Installation of Transmission Lines and Substations;
(d)   General Administration and Distribution Studies;
(e)   Planning, Training and Data Processing; and
(f)   Finance.
3.04      Some of the activities reporting to the AGM for Operations have
recently been classified as part of an "Operations Enterprise" within TEK,
which is to include generation and transmission operations and responsibility
for wholesale electricity sales to high voltage customers and to TEK's
distribution enterprises. It is too soon to determine whether this recent
change will have a visible impact on TEK's operations.
3.05      Having historically emphasized centralized operations and
construction of new generating facilities in particular, the management of TFK
is still adjusting to the new requirements of overseeing distribution where
highly centralized decision-making is not desirable. Eighteen regional
electricity distribution enterprises were created in 1983 as separate
departments of TEK after the takeover of distribution from the
runicipalities. While, officially, each enterprise manager reports directly
to the General Manager, in practice they are required to report to two AGMs,
to one with regard to operations and to the other with regard to distribution
studies and project design. It would be advantageous to reallocate the
responsibilities of the AGMs so that one would be fully responsible for
coordinating distribution activities.
3.06      TEK's central office provides continuous monitoring and inspection
of the distribution caterprises, approves all personnel decisions, and
determines the allocation of investment resources among the regions. The
distribution enterprises are presently not authorized to seek outside
financing. They are charged by the parent company for electricity purchased
at wholesale tariff rates and for part of the overhead headquarters expenses
associated with distribution. Each enterpri-e is responsible for preparation
of its annual operating budget, drafting annual and long-term investment and
plans, and preparation of annual financial statements. Full responsibility for
the design, execution and control of urban distribution and rural



(2728P)                               - 10 -
3.07      A number of distribution enterprises are presently receiving
technical assistance on a pilot basis. A master plan for reduction of losses
and network expansion is being developed for the. te Enterprise (Izmir);
improvement of the customer billing system is being introduced in one district
of the Bosphorus Enterprise (Istanbul); and, improvements in stock control,
general and customer accounting are being introduced to two enterprises, Ege
and Central Anatolia (Ankara).
Manpower Development and Training
3.08      The rapid expansion of electricity supply in Turkey has been
accompanied by an almost equally rapid increase in the number of people
employed by TEK. The total number of staff as of October 1984, was just over
55,000, of which 33,000 worked for TEK's Distribution Enterprises. This
represents an increase in staff of 15,000 over a two-year period, of which
11,000 were new distribution staff and 4,000 were added to other departments
of the utility. After distribution the next largest group, about 13,500, work
in operations. A breakdown of TEK's staff by department and by level of
training is shown in Annex 3.2.
3.09      Manpower planning for TEK as a whole is presently carried out only
one year at a time, although staffing requirements for new generating plants
are identified further in advance. The Personnel Department and the Training
Department do not report to the same ACM, which complicates coordination. TEK
has three technical training centers, the largest of which is located in Soma
and has extensive laboratory capacity and models related to thermal
electricity generation. However, much of the equipment is out of date and the
training center is used at less than full capacity largely due to the shortage
of instructors. Training materials dealing with transmission, distribution
and overall system reliability are lacking.
3.10      Some of these weaknesses are being addressed under TEK Transmission
III (Loan 2322-TU) which includes a thirty-four man-month contract with
Ontario Hydro. This technical assistance component is addressing: mnwpower
planning for generation, overseas training of master instructors (in operation
of generating plants, transmission and control), training on plant
commissioning; Lnd improvement of t':e equipment at the Soma training center.
General Characteristics of the TEK Power System
3.11.     The large magnitude of the TEK power system can be appreciated by
considering the volume of the electric load supplied and the extension and
size of its physical facilities. In 1984 the peak load in TEX power system
reached 5,450 MW and gross generation was 26,000 GWh (net 23,600 GWh). In the
same year TEK imported 2,500 GWh from Bulgaria and the USSR which gave a total
electric energy delivered to the TEK power transmission grid of 26,100 CWh.
Total rated capacity of TEK power plants in commercial operation in 1984
amounted to 6,330 MW. Adding the peak supply from Bulgaria and the USSR -
285 MW - the total capacity available reached 6,615 MW, to meet a system
constrained peak demand of 5,450 MW.



(2728P)                              - 11 -
3.12      TEK's bulk transport system consists of a 380-kV National Grid
System that feeds into 154-kV grids. These 154-kV grids supply major power
users and feed into 66-kV, 35-kV, and 15-kV subtransmission grids. In 1984
there was a total of 46,135 km of transmission and subtransmission lines.
TEK's substation plant in the transmission grids consists in 1984 of 368
transformer substations with 593 transformers, having an aggregated capacity
of 15,798 MVA. Besides power transformers, in these substations there were in
1984 a total of 34,569 major switchgear apparatus.
3.13          Low voltage distribution throughout Turkey is done at 50 Hz
220/380 V three-phase with neutral grounded. Primary distribution voltages
are 35 kV, 15 kV, 6 kV and 3 kV. In the 18 regional distribution enterprises
under TEK, the distribution systems consisted in 1984 of: 19,500 km of
primary distribution feeders at 35 kV, 15 kV and 6 kV; 64,000 km of
secondarLes at 220/380 V; and 6,289 distribution transformers with an
aggregated capacity of 4 730 MVA (more than half of this distribution
transformer capacity is installed in the Bogazici Distribution Enterprise,
which includes the city of Istanbul with 1,600,000 consumers).
3.14          The level of technical losses in distribution is between 12% and
15%, which is high by modern standards 1/. These losses can be reduced by
increasing the capacity of the distribution facilities, particularly
distribution transformer and feeders. Preparation of master plans is underway
for reduction of losses and expansion of the distribution systems. It is
considered economically feasible to reduce losses to about half of wnat they
are now, but this will require considerable investment in the coming years.
TEK is already programming substantial investments in this area in the next
five years.
TEK's Power System Operation Performance
3.15          During the last ten years, TEK's transmission system proved
stable in spite of the long transmission distance; voltage and reactive
power were satisfactory. Operation experience with the substations
equipment has been satisfactory, although maintenance problems have led to a
considerable number of outages. A major problem was in connection with the
lightning arresters but TEK has taken measures to improve insulation
coordination and lightning protection in the subst-tions. With regard to
transmission lines, TEK faced a more serious problems of mechanical failure
during the first 5-year operation of the 380-kV system, due to insufficient
knowledge of the very severe weather conditions in certain areas where there
was no prior experience of transmission line operation. Since then, TEK has
introduced more adequate mechanical design for the lines, as well as the
reinforcement of the existing lines exposed to heavy ice and wind loads in
winter.
1/ In most developed countries, the level of technical losses in the well
operated distribution systems is about 6%.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01     The proposed Project would provide for the Bank's continued
supervision oZ Elbistan. The main objectives of the proposed Project would be
to complete the Elbistan power station (4 x 340 MW) and to ensure the
station's adequate operating availability and efficient operation.
Project Description
4.02     The proposed Project includes:
(a) completion of construction and commissioning of Elbistan's Units 3
and 4; and
(b) improvement in the Borrower's project management and operation and
maintenance capabilities at Elbistan.
Project Cost Estimate
4.03     The total cost of the proposed Project, including physical and price
contingencies but excluding interest during construction, is about TL 152.7
billion (US$237.8 million), of which US$87.6 million is in foreign exchange.
Details of the project cost estimate are given in Annex 4.1 and a sumnary is
shown in Table 4.1. The project cost estimate is based on early 1985 prices
from detailed data provided by TEK, TKI and their consultants. The resulting
figures were reviewed and found reasonable by the Bank. Total physical
contingencies are about 3.0% of base cost. This is reasonable given the
advanced state of construction of the power plant. Price contingencies have
been calculated assuming a three-year implementation period (1985-1987)
consistent with the latest estimates of TEK and their consultants as reviewed
and found reasonable by the Bank. Specific annual increases in domestic and
international prices were applied as follows:
1985       1986       1987
Domestic (Z)                             35        30           25
International (Z)                         5         7.5         8
The resulting price contingency expressed in US$ equivalent is about 5.7% of
the total base cost plus physical contingencies and reflects the relatively
large expenditures projected for 1985 compared to the last two years, 1986 and
1987. Annex 4.2 shows details of the price contingency calculations.

strengthen the site organization starting in 1981. Table 4.2 shows the large
number of expatriate and local Engineering and Admainistration personnel required at
the job site to ensure adequate implementation p'ogress.

construction and commissioning.
Project Financing Plan and Lending Arrangement
4.05     The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million would be made to TEK with the
guarantee of the Republic of Turkey on standard Bank terms. The proposed loan
would finance about 4% of the total financing required (US$247.8 million) and
about 102 of the foreign exchange portion (US$97.6 million). The remaining
US$87.6 million would be covered from loans and credits being provided by EIB,
KfW, MANTRUST, and own resources from TEK and Government. A summary of the
Project financing plan is shown in Table 4.3.  The foreign exchange risk on
the Bank loan would be borne by TEK.

Given the recent improvements in TEK's financial performance (para. 5.04), no
difficulties are foreseen in TEK's meeting its share of the local currency
costs of the Project. The Goverment is deeply committed to complete
Elbistan. No shortages of Government funds for the Project are anticipated.
During negotiations, the Government gave adequate assurances that local
currency funds will be made available to TEK as required.
Project Implementation
4.06     Success of the proposed Project depends on the availability of
adequate supply of lignite to the power station from the Kislakoy mine at
Afsin-Elbistan. To this effect, TKI is carrying out during 1985 certain
improvements at the mine with financial assistance from KfW and EIB. A cost
estimate of the KI project is shown in Table 4.4. EIB and KfW are
co-financing the foreign exchange requirements. Now that the mine is fully
operational (para. 1.13), TKI should have no problem meeting the relatively
modest local currency (TL4.2 billion) required.

2.5 million) are proprietary items obtainable only from one source and will be
procured through direct contracting with each applicable supplier, in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Installation and Erection services (US$103.4 million) will be
procured through extension of existing contracts awarded through ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Civil works (US$ 12.7 million) will be
procured as extension of existing local contracts. Contracts for
miscellaneous items costing the equivalent of US$ 50,000 or less, up to an
aggregate of US$ 1,000,000 equivalent may be procured under contracts awarded
on the basis of comparison of price quotations solicited from a list of at

Special Account
4.10     The establishment of a Special Account in the Central Bank will
permit payment of Bank-financed expenditures with a minimum administrative
delay. This Special Account would be replenished in the same currency, and
would have a ceiling of US$2.0 million, which is equivalent to a four-month
average of the total expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Bank loan. The procedure for withdrawal of funds from the Special Account was
agreed during negotiations. Central Bank statements showing the transactions
in the Special Account will be submitted to the Bank. Applications for
replenishment will be accompanied by appropriate documentation or Statements
of Expenditures. Replenishment will be made in the amount equal to payments
made out of the Special Acco'mt for eligible expenditures, but only to the
extent that the amount of any such deposit together with any amount remaining
on the deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such request, does not
exceed the equivalent of the agreed ceiling.

Environmental Aspects
4.11     The Elbistan power station is located in a sparsely inhabited area
(see Map IBRD 19081). The power plant provides for ash removal from flue
gases by means of electrostatic precipitators designed for 992 removal
efficiencies. At this level, fly ash emissions are in compliance with World
Bank Guidelines for Dust and Electrostatic Precipitators. In addition, the
plant will meet Bank Guidelines for Sulfur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxides. Under
Loan 1023-TU, TEX has agreed to establish pollution monitoring stations and to
inform the Bank of recorded pollution levels and any corrective actions taken
should they be necessary. The covenant is being complied with and the
Government has agreed to take measures to ensure the continued application of
these pollution controls.
4.12     The mine site area is treeless and at best sparsely cultivated.  It
affords no shelter to wildlife such as would need to be conserved, and TKI
under Loan 1023-TU is carrying out necessary reclamation to allow resettlement
and reuse.
4.13     The lowering of the water table in the mining activity has produced
no ill effects and extracted water is used for irrigation. Sewage is being
treated appropriately. Noise pollution does not arise.
Project Risks
4.14     Except for uncertainty as to the mine's ability to meet the lignite
needs of the power station beyond 1986, no major project risks remain.
Although the lignite supply situation is at present satisfactory and likely to
remain so at least through end-1986, continued satisfactory supply beyond that
date will be dependent a great deal upon the improvements being made in the
mining operation in parallel with the proposed project (para. 4.06).
Moreover, the Government confirmed during negotiations that it will take all
measures necessary to ensure that minimum requirements acceptable to the Bank
for the supply of lignite to the Borrower are fulfilled.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Financial Performance of TEK
5.01     At the time of the Elbistan Project in 1973, TEK had been in
existence only a few years, having been formed in 1970 to centralize planning
and operation of Turkey's power generation and transmission facilities. At
that time TEK's financial position was weak, due, inter alia, to: the
Government's decision not to approve adequate tariff increases, less than
expected load growth and delays in the completion of a major hydroeLectric
station (Keban). Earning about a 3Z return on revalued assets in 1973, TEK
was far from meeting the 8% return set out in its law and agreed to in
previous Bank loans. Furthermore, TEK had begun to encounter difficulties in
collecting payments from municipalities and from Government enterprises, and
receivables were equivalent to four months of sales revenues.
5.02     Establishment of TEK's financial viability was one of the goals of
the Elbistan Project. With this in mind, the following financial objectives
were agreed upon during negotiations for Loan 1023-TU: (i) two tariff
increases of 22% in nominal terms in 1974 (a condition of loan effectiveness)
and 31% in 1975; (ii) an 8% rate of return on revalued assets from 1976
onwards; (iii) reduction of accounts receivable from municipalities. The
Government was to cause municipalities and its own agencies to pay outstanding
debts to TEK promptly in order to ease the working capital shortfall. It was
estimated at the time that fulfillment of these objectives would have enabled
TEK to cover 56% of its capital expansion requirements--of which Elbistan
represented a major share (67%)-from internal sources after taxes, on average
over the project implementation period. Adding the State Hydraulic Works
(DSI) construction program for hydroelectric plants to TEK'S forecast
investments, power subsector self-financing was expected to average 39% for
the period 1973-1981. Debt service coverage was forecast to increase from 1.3
in 1973 to 3.2 by 1981. The anticipated level of internal cash generation
would also have eliminated the need for direct Government transfers to TEK to
finance the investment program after 1975.
5.03     During the 1970's, TEK's actual financial performance was far from
meeting these targets. This period was characterized by dramatically rising
international fuel prices, higher than expected inflation in Turkey rising to
a peak of over 10OX in 1980, and an unstable political situation which made it
difficult for the Government to implement tariff increases. From 1973-1981,
tariffs increased only 11Z in real terms as compared with the appraisal
estimate of 47%. Although the Bank ultimately agreed to lower return on
assets targets in the light of the Government's economic stabilization
program, the return on revalued assets averaged less than 3Z during the
1970's. TEK continued to rely on injections of Government equity to meet its
expanding construction requirements, with the Government contribution reaching
50% of TEK's investments by 1981. The municipalities continued the practice
of retaining revenues from retail electricity customers to divert to other
public services, and TEK's receivables reached a high of nine months of
salesat the end of 1982. In the face of a serious cash shortage, TEK had few
options but to postpone payments to its own suppliers, including TKI.



(2728P)                               - 21 -
5.04     A two-stage turnaround in TEK's deteriorating financial situation
started in 1982. First, to resolve the problem of arrears from
municipalities, the Government transferred electricity distribution to TEK,
allowing it to collect directly from retail customers. TEK's working capital
situation did not immediately improve however. Electricity tariffs dropped in
real terms by almost 20Z in 1983, and TEK continued to divert available cash
to its investment program instead of paying its fuel suppliers. Then, in
1984-85, the Government launched a program of regular real tariff increases,
which more than offset the preceding drop in electricity prices. By April
1985, the average bulk electricity tariff was estimated to have reached about
85-90Z of the long-run marginal cost of supply. Debts between TEK and other
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) including TKI, were converted to equity by
the Government in mid-1984, clearing up TEK's balance sheet, and TEK began
paying for lignite and fuel oil on a timely basis. The self-financing level
for power subsector investments (including both TEK and DSI) is estimated to
reach about 162 in 1984 and over 35% in 1985. Annex 5.1 gives a su!  ry of
TEK's most recent financial forecasts
Audits
5.05     As with other public enterprises, TEK's financial statements follow
the Uniform Chart of Accounts, and are audited by tue High Control Board
connected with the Prime Ministry. TEK is required by Law 233 to submit its
balance sheets and final accounts to the Prime Ministry for auditing no later
than the third month following the year to which they pertain. TEK is then
meant to submit its annual audited accounts to the Bank no later than five
months after the close of the year. However, there are shortcomings with both
the scope and the timing of the present audit reports. The auditors rarely
coimment on the reliability of the presentation of the accounts, or on
significant events which occurred during the year. The audit reports
concerning 1981 and 1982 were received more than a year after the close of the
fiscal year.  Similarly, the audit report for 1983 had not yet been received
as of April 1985.
5.06     Most likely it will not be possible to meet the five month target for
submission of the audit report, until the 1987 report. Under Loan 2322-TU,
TEK consultants are giving priority to improving the timeliness and accuracy
of TEK's financial statements. Furthermore, an upgrading of TEX's computer
center, presently being studied, should improve TEK's ability to prepare and
correct the annual financial reports. During negotiations agreement was
reached on a gradual schedule of improvement for submitting audit reports,
with the 1985 and 1986 audit reports being expected within 10 and 8 months,
respectively, after the end of the given fiscal year, and within 5 months for
1987 and afterwards.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Growth of TEK's System
6.01     The proposed Project would form part of the interconnected power
system operated by TEK. TEK's system is projected to expand rapidly over the
next ten years in order to meet a fast-growing demand and close the still
prevailing electrical energy deficit. In connection with Bank sector work, a
set of demand projections was prepared for discussions with TEK. These
projections were updated for the purpose of this appraisal. A base case was
derived assuaing that a limited demand management program would be implemented
by TEK through direct load management and tariff increases. Results for the
1985-1995 period indicated an annual growth in peak demand and energy of 6.5Z
and 8.5Z respectively. A low-demand case was also considered assuming a more
dramatic improvement in energy efficiency (through reduction in losses) and
resulted in an overall growth of 5.9Z p.a. in peak demand and 7.9% p.a. in
energy.
6.02     The latter scenario was used to develop TEK's balance of energy and
capacity (Annex 6.1, Attachment 1). It is very unlikely that the projected
generation expansion to 1990, which includes Elbistan units 3 and 4, will be
able to meet the system's energy requirements (GWh), even under average
hydrological conditions and with continued imports from Bulgaria and the
USSR. Any delay in commissioning of Elbistan 3 and 4 would therefore increase
the projected supply gap. The proposed Project is thus justified as necessary
to meet projected incremental demand on TEK system.
Least-Cost Analysis
6.03     The remaining question is whether any other type of plant could meet
the projected requirements at less cost than the Project. Of the available
alternatives, only combustion turbines could conceivably be installed in time
to avoid the energy deficits which would prevail in 1988 and later years
without the Project. Adoption of one of the other feasible options would be
justified, therefore, only if it showed sufficient economic advantage over the
Project to offset the costs to the economy in terms of unserved demand which
its longer completion time would involve. Evaluation of all the alternatives
showed that, on the contrary, both the capital and operating costs of the
Project were lower than those of any alternative (Annex 6.1, Attachment 2).
Sensitivity testing confirmed that the Project would still be the least-cost
option on the TEK projection of system growth, and even on the highly
improbable assumption of a doubling of all its costs (capital, fuel, O&M),
without any change in the costs of the alternatives.
Rate oc Return on the Overall Sector TEK/DSI Expansion Program
6.04     The overall TEK/DSI expansion program for 1985-1990 (Annex 6.2),
which includes the proposed Project, was evaluated in conjunction with the
appraisal of the Fourth TEK Transmission and the Power System Operations
Assistance projects (Loans 2586-TU and 2602-TU respectively) and indicated a
rate of return of 11.3%, marginally below the estimated opportunity cost of
capital of 12Z; reflecting the fact that electricit;- tariffs are slightly
below the economic cost of supply as measured by the loig-run marginal cost.



(2728P)                                - 23 -
However, it understated the real economic return on the program since the
measurement of benefits underestimated the willingness to pay for electricity
(para. 6.06).
Recalculation of the Rate of Return on the 1974 Elbistan Project
6.05     The rate of return on the Elbistan project was recalculated. The
period used for the calculation was 1973-2014, covering the start of
construction of the power station and mine and their estimated economic lives
of 30 years from the start of commercial operation in 1985. The costs are the
capital and operating costs of the mine and power station together with the
associated transmission facilities. The benefits comprise the revenues from
the incremental bulk sales of electricity attributable to the power station.
6.06     Incremental sales were valued at the average prices projected for
bulk consumers (at 1985 prices), which are as follows:
1985     1986      1987     1988     1989   1990 onwards
TL/kWh        26.87    28.21    29.62    31.10    33.10         36.83
Electricity tariffs were assumed to increase at regular intervals to reach and
maintain LRMC, and to ensure an adequate level of self-financing for the power
subsector, reflecting the Government's commitment to reduce public
expenditures. Since the tariffs used in the calculation were estimated as a
proxy for consumers' willingness to pay, all taxes' were included. Given
the large unmet demand, the willingness to pay for electricity is likely to be
higher than the current average tariff, but it cannot be readily quantified.
1/ VAT presents some difficulties, since it is repaid to industries, which
use electricity as an intermediate good. However, repayment may take up
to a year, and the "effective price" co industrial consumers is therefore
taken as including VAT. Excluding VAT in these cases would slightly
reduce the rate of return.



(2728P)                               - 24 -
6.07     A comparison of the Elbistan's costs and benefits results in a rate
of return of about 6% (see Annex 6.3). This compares with an estimate of
nearly 18% in the original (1974) appraisal. This is well above the
recalculated rate of return of 6%, again mainly because of the great delay
experienced in completing Elbistan and the resulting lengthy period of time
which has elapsed between incurring its heavy investment costs and reaping the
benefits of its output. Nevertheless, Elbistan is worth completing as the
rate of return calculated on the proposed Project is over 40% (see Annex 6.1,
paras 4-6 and Attachment 3), which reflects the fact that a large part of the
costs related to Elbistan units 3 and 4 were incurred prior to 1985.



(2728P)                             - 25 -
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations the Government agreed to make available local
currency funds to TEK in a timely manner (para. 4.05).
7.02     During negotiations, TEK agreed (a) to continue to employ project
management consultants up to commercial operation of Unit 4, or December 31,
1987, whichever comes later (para. 4.07); and (b) to submit the 1985 and 1986
audit reports within 10 and 8 months respectively after the end of the given
year, and within 5 months for 1987 and afterwards (para. 5.06).
7.03     Subject to the above, the proposed Project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$10 million to TEK with the guarantee of the Republic of
Turkey, for a term of 17 years at the standard variable interest rate,
including a four-year grace period.

THE ENERGY SECTOR
The Role of the Energy Sector in the Economy
1.       In 1977, four years after the first of the major oil price increases,
Turkey's oil import bill was equivalent to 84% of its merchandise export
earnings. By 1980, the situation was even more precarious: oil imports stood
at 124Z of total merchandise export earnings. As a result of remedial actions
that the Government implemented as part of its structural adjustment program,
the situation had, by 1984, improved and the above ratio had declined to 53%.
The improvement was a resuit of both strong performance of merchandise exports
as well as a policy of holding the growth in imports of crude oil and oil
products to a more moderate level (oil imports grew by an average annual rate
of 3.6% between 1981 and 1984). However, despite this improvement the need to
move away from an excessive reliance on oil imports remains crucial to
Turkey's medium-term development strategy, as the latter is dependent on the
economy's ability to mobilize foreign exchange.
2.       High priority was assigned to the energy sector by Government during
the 1980-83 period of structural adjustment. Energy policy was geared to
increasing the domestic supply of energy, primarily through increased capital
investment to about 35Z of total public investment compared to about 20Z
during the 1970's. In parallel, greater attention was given by Government to
energy pricing policy as a means of restraining demand and mobilizing
resources. In particular Government has ensured that petroleum products
reflect economic costs as reflected by world prices, and electricity tariffs
have increased in real terms over the period. Although lignite prices
declined slightly in real terms in 1981-83 a turnaround in lignite pricing
policy during 1984 resulted in a 30% increase in April 1984 and a further
29.6% in January 1985 thus exceeding inflation over the 12-month period.
The Resource Base
3.       Turkey has substantial untapped lignite and hydropower resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
geothermal potential. Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW under average hydrological conditions and
corresponds to an annual production of about 100,000 GWh. Only 15% has been
developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30% by 1990. Proven
recoverable reserves of oil are about 16 million tons. However, potential
reserves that may become economically recoverable using enhanced oil recovery
techniques currently being tested could be as high as 30 million tons. Oil
production has been declining over the last decade, as few discoveries have



- 34 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 5
been made in recent years; in 1983 production was about 3 million tons.
Proven recoverable gas reserves are about 400 billion standard cubic feet.
Domestic gas will, however, be supplemented, beginning in 1987, by large scale
imports of natural gab from the USSR. Total known reserves of hard coal are
estimated at about 1 billion tons, all located in the north of Turkey
(Zonguldak). Coal production has been declining as operations move to deeper,
less accessible seams; in 1983 production was about 3.5 million tons,
equivalent to 2.2 million tons of oil equivalent (toe). Proven and probable
lignite reserves are about 8 billion tons, but about half of this is of
extremely low quality (950-1,000 kcal/kg). Lignite production in 1983 was
about 20 million tons, equivalent to about 4.6 million toe. The economic
costs of domestic lignite appears to be very high, and, in some mines, not
competitive with imported coal. There is potential for geothermal
development, for both space heating and electricity generation. A foreign
company with extensive experience in geothermal power has recently undertaken
a technical review of a number of promising geothermal sites, and discussions
with the Government on possible terms and conditions for developing one of
these sites are currently in progress.
Main Agencies
4.       The energy sector in Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
government-owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources in
Turkey. Under MENR, the Turkish Lignite Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Hard
Coal Enterprise (TTK), the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO), and the Mineral
Research Institute (MTA) have responsibility for the extraction of fossil
fuels and radioactive minerals. Identification, design and construction of
hydro projects is entrusted to the State Hydraulics Works (DSI). The Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK) is responsible for the generation, transmission
and, since November 1982, the distribution of almost all the electricity sold
in Turkey. TEK is also responsible for the implementation of the Government's
program for rural electrification and the construction of all generating and
transmission facilities, with the exception of hydroelectric plants for which
DSI has responsibility.
5.       Private sector participation in the supply of electricity was until
1983, confined to two small semi-private utilities (CEAS and KEPEZ) and
industrial companies which generated power for their own use, often in
conjunction with the production of steam for process heat. However, recent
shifts in government energy policy now give greater encouragement to private
sector participation in the development and production of energy.
Demand and Supply
6.       Total gross energy consumption was about 38 million toe in 1983, of
which commercial energy consumption amounted to about '0 million toe.
Petroleum made up the most significant share of primary commercial energy
(60%) with the balance made up of lignite (18O), hydropower (11%), coal (10%)
and imported electricity (1%). About 24% of final commercial energy



- 35 -
ANNEX 2.1
Page 3 of 5
consumption was in the form of electricity. Non-commercial energy production
(primarily fuelwood, but also other biomass) was an important energy source,
accounting for 232 of total energy consumption. Imported energy (petroleum,
hard coal and electricity) represents about 452 of total energy supply.
7.       The most notable change in the pattern of energy consumption over the
past two decades has been the decrease in the relative share of hard coal in
total energy. This was accompanied by a rapid growth in consumption of
petroleum until the mid-1970s, peaking at over 50% in 1977/78; and a rapid
rise in the share of lignite (primarily for thermal power production) and
hydroelectric power consumption starting in the second half of the 1970's.
During this period, hard coal consumption stayed relatively constant in
absolute terms, while traditional biomass energy sources increased slightly in
absolute terms, but decreased steadily as a percentage of total energy
consumed.
8.       The most important factors in the growth of energy demand will be the
growth rate of the economy as a whole, the growth rate of the energy-intensive
industrial sector of the economy, and the extent to which Government
implements an energy conservation and demand management program. Bank
estimates indicate that the growth rate of the economy would average about
5.6% per annum during the 1980s and that the industrial sector would grow
slightly faster at about 7%. Under these projections and in the absence of a
vigorous demand management program, electricity demand is expected to grow by
over 200% between 1980 and 1990 to about 60,000 GWh; lignite demand for
thermal power plants would grow by almost tenfold to about 50 million tons;
and petroleum products demand would grow by 110% to 30 million tons of oil
equivalent. In total this would represent approximately 58 million toe, an
increase of over 8% per annum from 1983 (38 million toe). However supply
constraints, especially in the lignite sector, will result in demand not being
met, at least to 1990. The energy deficit is estimated by 1990 to be ;-i the
region of 7-8 million toe.
9.       There is, however, considerable scope for conservation of energy
particularly in the industrial sector which currently accounts for 40% of
total energy consumption and this is expected to rise to 45% by 1990. he
industrial sector also consumes 64% of total electricity supplied.
Furthermore eight industries 21 account for 40% of total industrial ene ;y
consumption, from which it has been estimated that almost 1 million toe could
be saved through investment in conservation. The total estimated potential
energy savings in the industrial sector, including a large number of
energy-inefficient small industries, is about 2.4 million to!. There is
therefore an urgent requirement for an energy conservation program in Turkey.
10.      The Government is in the process of developing a program for the
conservation of energy by encouraging efficient use in existing and new
industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and legislation have been

aluminum, copper.

ANNEX 2.1
Page 4 of 5
evaluated by both the MENR and the SPO, and legislation has already been
passed which allows for tax credits for various types of investments in energy
efficiency improvements. The Government has initiated programs to assist
industrial firms to learn how to improve their energy efficiency in existing
operations. The Bank included technical assistance for energy audits in
selected manufacturing facilities as part of the assistance to the Government
untder Loan 1916-TU. These audits have now been completed and the Bank is
currently reviewing their findings with a view to financing a conservation
project. TEK has also hired consultants to assist in the development of an
energy conservation and load management program.
Energy Policy
11.      To meet its energy requirements Turkey launched a massive program in
the late 1970's to increase the domestic production of electricity and
lignite. This program tended to stretch the implementation capabilities of
the state energy agencies, and spread the resources available too thinly over
too many projects, with resulting long delays in completion schedules. This
has, in turn, resulted in an energy deficit which is likely to remain a
feature of the Turkish economy at least through the 1980's. MENR and TEK are
currently in the process of improving their energy planning capabilities and
MENR has produced Turkey's first energy policy paper. T.e recent Five-Year
Development Plan!' contains the following energy sector objectives:
-    priority is to be given to domestic sources of energy, especially,
hydro and lignite, provided that they are economically justified;
-    imported energy including, but not limited to oil, will be considered;
-    renewable and nonconventional resources such as geothermal, solar and
biogas are to be supported; and
-    private sector financing, both local and foreign, will be sought for
participation in energy development.
12.      One feature of Government which represents a departure from previous
energy policy concerns the expanded role of the private sector in the
development and production of energy. Government policy is now quite clearly
to encoura',e private sector participation in the energy sector. There are now
no legal constraints to private sector generation, and private utilities
(KEPEZ and CEAS) have plans to increase their capacities. In addition, the
State Planning Organization (SPO) is currently undertaking, with assistance
from consultants, preliminary studies to assess whether private financierr
could be sought to construct and operate thermal plants based upon imported

fuels (coal, nuclear) and geothermal. Over the long term this could have a
fundamental bearing on the financing, staffing and planning of the subsector.
Bank Strategy
13.      The Bank has prepared and discussed with Govermnent an Energy
Assessment Study as well as subsector studies on electricity and lignite. In
addition, under SAL V Government agreed to develop and discuss with the Bank
an energy action plan and MENR has instructed the individual energy
institutions to prepare detailed medium term action programs. As an ongoing
part of our policy dialogue the Bank prepared an energy sector strategy paper
on strategy and actions required in the energy sector. In discussions of this
paper agreement was reached with the Government and related energy
institutions on the content, analysis and scope of the issues facing the
energy sector.
14.      The strategy for Bank lending and operational work in the energy
sector is to focus on selected key issues in the medium term in order that
projects may be brought on stream as rapidly as possible and the efficiency of
existing energy producing fa^ilities be maximized. The magnitude of the
looming energy supply gap is such that priority should be accorded to projects
aimed at reducing the deficit as soon as possible. Projects with relatively
short gestation periods such as improvement of efficiency within existing
facilities, industrial conservation, reduction of energy losses, and
utilization of energy resources which can be brought on stream rapidly, should
have priority. Furthermore the private sector may well offer opportunities
for developing energy resources more rapidly than the public sector, and
emphasis will be given to investments which may increase private sector
participation.
15.      In conjunction with the strategy to -4ddress the key medium term
issues the Bank will also emphasize the stre:'gthening of the various energy
institutions through technical assistance in training, manpower developnent,
technical, economic and financial planning and project management. Final'y,
the open and constructive policy discussions between Government and the Bank
undertaken in conjunction with SAL V will be continued on a regular and
sustained basis and should provide a continuing policy framework within which
both project lending and the development of a robust project pipeline can
proceed.

TURKEY
ELBISTAN 0 & H ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Major Issues Faced by the Turkish Authorities in
Establishing Appropriate Long-Term Arrangements at Elbistan
Background
1.       The Turkish authorities have indicated to the Bank their intention to
involve the private sector in the operation of Elbistan to provide a permanent
solution to the technical and institutional problems of this project. The
Government would seek a lease/joint venture arrangement including TEX and TKI
participation. Other joint venture partners, including foreign participants,
would be selected preferably through a competitive process.
objective
2.       The primary objective of a lease joint venture arrangement would be
to ensure a smooth and more efficient management and operation of the mine and
the power plant, through technology transfer and effective utilization of the
existing plant and proven coal deposits.
Issues
3.       The following issues, among others, will need to be addressed in the
process of leasing Elbistan to a joint venture:
(i) Legislation. The legislative framework within which the
proposed leasing arrangement would be effected.
(ii) Proportional Participation. The level of participation in
the joint venture by TEK and TKI in relation to the domestic
and foreign joint venture partners.
(iii) Joint Venture Framework. Selection procedure of private
sector partners (i.e., competitive or non-competitive);
Criteria for eligibility (financial responsibility and
technical know-how); Qualifications, Objectives,
Capitalization, Voting Rights, Financing Plan, etc.
(iv) Lessing Conditions. Asset Ownership, Leasehold Coverage
(Plant and Equipment, Period, Areas, etc.); Tax Law
Provisions; Investment Code Advantages; Operation and
Maintenance Standards; Safety and Pollution Regulations;
Disposition of Existing TEK and TKI Personnel; Lease (Rent)
Payments Due TEK, TKI, etc.

(v) Terms and Conditions of Power Supply Contract Between Joint
Venture and TEg. rrice/Iwh; Supply Schedule tDlDspatch);
Reciprocal Penalty Clauses (Take-or-Pay, Supply-or-Pay); etc.
4.       Another issue is whether the Joint Venture will include both the
power plant and the mine from the start or whether the takeover will be done
in two stages: first, the mine and then the power plant.

TURKEY
ELBISTAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Forecasts
General '..sum1tions
1.       Starting in 1983, the financial statements show the situation of
TEK as a consolidated utility selling electricity to customers on both the
wholesale and retail level, therefore, including the eignteen new
distribution companies. However, the value of distribution assets in service
has not been included, because it has not yet been determined by the
concerned authorities.
2.       The forecasts were made in Turkish Lira in current orices applying
the following inflation rates:
1985   1986   1987   L988   L989   L990
(2 ) --______
Local Inflation                 35    30       25     20      15      10
International Inflation          5     7.5      8      8       8       8
The exchange rate prevailing in January 1985 (TL 450 = US$1) was used as a
base rate. In order not to understate the TL cost of the foreign component
Of expenditures. however, it was assumed that depreciation of the Turkish
Lira would occur, equivalent to the differential bet-ween forecast local and
international inflation rates.
income Statement
3.       The forecast for sales of electricity was derived from the
miscion's forecasts of capacity available for electricity generation. Given
the expectation that an electricity deficit will continue, and that TEE will
not be able to meet forecast demand in 1985-1989, the sales forecast was not
based on the demand forecast in Annex 2.L. Available high voLtage supplv
would be sold 50Z to EV industrial customers, and 502 to TEK's distribution
enterprises for on-sale at the LV Level. The resulting growth rates ia total
electricity sales (HV and Li) are as follows:
1985     1986      L987      1;88     1989
3       16        13        L8        9

4.       Tariffs  were increased as needed to meet financing requirements,
and so as to reach LaMC by L989. The actual average tariffs effective
1/1/85 are assumed to be TL L9/kWh on the bulk level, and TL 27/kWh on the
retail level, resulting in an average tariff for HV and LV combined of about
TL 23/kWh. Adjustment of tarif's to reflect any real changes in fuel prices
has not been included in the forecasts, but would be assumed to occur
automacically.
5.       The forecast income statements do not reflect the value-added tax
of LOZ which was introduced effective January 1, 1985.  While TEK's -
customers will pay 10Z more for electricity, the VAT is expected to have no
net financial impact on TEK, as TEK will transfer to the Government the net
cf value added taxes collected and paid. Similarly, the 3.SZ charge
collected by TEX on behalf of Turkish Radio and Television starting March 1,
1985 has been omitted from the forecasts.
6.       Fuel expenses were projected by applying che expected price paid by
TEK for fuel to the average specific consumption rates and :he number or
kilowatt hours to be generated by thermal plants with each tvpe of fuel as
shown below.

7.      The cost of imDorted power was estimated by applying the early 1985
rate of US$.04/kWh, increasing with domestic inflation, to annual imports
from Bulgaria and the USSR of 2,500 GWh.
8.      Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated at 2.5% for hvdro plants,
4.0% for thermal plants, and 3.11 for transmission lines and related
assets. The overall average for TEK is 3.5%.
9.      Other exoenses, including material other than fuel, wages and
salaries and miscellaneous expenses. are asswned to increase at the same
rate as unit sales growth, plus the local inflation rate. As a result of
the Power System Operations Assistance Project, a reduction in T-EK's
maintenance and operating costs is expected, resulting in financial savings;
however, these benefits would not be apparent until about L990-91.
10.     Income taxes are 40% of the net income of previous year. after
deducting all operating expenses and net interest expense.
II.     TEK's payments to the PPF in conjunction with the Keban
revenue-sharing certificates are included as an operating expense, based on
annual generation of the Keban Hvdro Plant of 5647 GWh multiplied bv a price
oer kWh which is 604 of the average wholesale electricity tariff.  TEK's
present obligations to make these pavments cease in L989, but it is !ikely
that TEK will continue these oavments arterward :or addit:onal revenue
sharing certificates.
Balance Sheet
12.     Additions to work in progress and to fixed assets in service are
made at current prices. Assets in service have not been revalued in the
.orecast. because of lack of adequate information on age and composition of
assets. However, asset revaluation. and the corresponding additions to the
revaluation reserve, which were included in TEK'5 past audited financial
s:atements are reflected.
13.     Transfers .rom DSI:  Hvdroelectric pro,ects, once comDleted bv DSI,
are transferred to TEK through a government equity contribution and added
directly to fixed assets in service. (The Bank requested under Loan 1844-TU
that the Government consider a change in accounting procedures, such that
the asset %'aLue of completed hycroelectric power olants transferred from DS:
to TEK would be offset by a combination of both eau.ity and the related
debt. This change in procedures has noc vet occurred, however, and the
forecasts assume tne current practices will continue.) The forecast assumes
-ransfers of DSI assets valued as 'ollows (in bil'ions of TL):

14.      The interest rate on new borrowings is estimaced at 301% for local
credits and 9Z for foreign credits, with repayment periods of 3 and 8 years,
respectively.
1.      Outstanding foreign debt and related debt service have been
restated in line with the expected devaluation of the Turkish Lira. The
counterpart of the adjustment to long-ter.n debt has been added to
work-in-progress.
Incernal Cash Generation
L5.      The calculation of inteEnal cash generation is shown in Annex 5.6:
(a) Treatment of Taxes
Income taxes payable by TEK out of its profits are added back as
part of sector internal cash generacion, according to the definitions
agreed in 1980. Nwo other types of taxes or charges introduced in early
1985 -  the value added   -"AT) and the Turkish Radio and Television
(TRT) charge - have not been included in the caiculation of internal
cash generaticn.  The Bank's understanding is thac both will be passed
through without having a direct financial impact on TEK. In the case of
the TRT charge, these funds are specifically earmarked for use outside
the power subsector. rn the case of the VAAT, information is aot vet
available to est-mace the net difference between the amount of VAT
ollected by IEK from its customers and the amount paid bv TEK on its
purchases.
(b) Treatment of Debt Ser-vice
For purposes of estimation of subsector internal cash generation,
the debt service associated with DSI's investments in hvdroelectric
plants has been shown as an indicative amount otvly. (Because these
borrowings .or DS! oroj'ec:s are aggregaced with other public borrowing,
and many DSI projects are mulci-purpose, .: has been difFicult to
isolate the amounts related to DSI energy investments only.)

Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)
ELBISTAN 0 & M ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Economic Justification
Least-cost Analysis
1.       Without the proposed Project, alternative generating capacity would
have to be installed to meet the projected demand. The question is whether
any of the available technical alternatives could do this at lower cost than
the Project. These technical alternatives comprise combustion turbines,
combined cycle plants and steam generating plants utilizing fuel oil, hard
coal, lignite or uranium fuel. None of these could be available on the same
timescale as Elbistan units 3 and 4, which are expected to be in full
commercial operation at the beginning of 1987 and 1988 respectively. Only
combustion turbines, with a lead time of about two years, could conceivably be
installed in time to reduce the energy deficits which would prevail without
the two Elbistan units. For combined cycle plant a three to four year
construction period would be necessary, for conventional steam plant (fuel
oil, coal or lignite) five years and for a nuclear power plant about 10
years. Adoption of any of these options in preference to the completion of
Elbistan 3 and 4 would be justified, therefore, only if they showed sufficient
economic advantage over the Proiect to offset the costs to the economy in
terms of unserved demand which their longer completion time would involve.
2.       Evaluation of the alternatives showed that none of them would have
such an economic advantage. The method adopted was to calculate for each
option, on the basis of its capital, fuel and operating costs, the cost of
generation per kWh over a wide range of plant factors (20% to 90%). As shown
at Attachment 2, the Project hcs the lowest generation cost per kWh
irrespective of the plant factor assumed. This is not surprising, since both
its capital and operating costs (including fuel) are lower than those of any
of the alternatives.
3.       To allow for uncertainty, the comparison of the Project with the
alternatives was tested for sensitivity to changes in the values of the main
variables of capital costs and fuel costs. It was found that, even on the
highly improbable hypothesis that all the costs associated with the Project
(capital, fuel and 0 & M) were twice as high as currently estimated, while the
costs of all the alternatives were the same as assumed in the base case, the
project would still be the least-cost solution at all plant factors except
20%, when it would be fractionally more expensive than combustion turbines (TL
38.62/kWh against TL 38.34/kWh).

Rate of Return
4.       Having established that the Project is the least-cost means of
meeting the projected power requirements the next step in the analysis was to
determine whether the Project showed an acceptable rate of return. The costs
are the incremental investment and operating costs of completing Elbistan
units 3 and 4, including fuel costs, calculated on the basis of the average
incremental cost of lignite (TL 4.4/kwh).
5.       The benefit is taken as the value of bulk sales attributable to the
Project. Assuming 10% station use and 3% transmission losses, these amount to
3,405 GWh out of the Project's gross annual generation of 3,900 GWh (at 65%
plant factor). These sales were valued at the price projected for TEK's bulk
consumers (at 1985 prices, including the TRT tax of 3.5% collected by TEK for
Turkish radio and television and V.A.T. at 10), as follows;
1985      1986      1987       1988      1989     1990 onwards
TL/kWh     2.7       28.21      2V:&r     31.10     33.10         36.83
6.       The streams of costs and benefits are shown at Attachment 3 and
result in a rate of return on the Project of over 4O0.  This high return
reflects the fact that most of the costs associated with Elbistan units 3 and
4, and for development of the lignite to supply them, were incurred prior to
1985, and are therefore regarded as sunk costs for the purpose of the economic
evaluation. Sensitivity tests indicated that, even if the power station costs
are increased by 20%, and the lignite mine costs, which are subject to greater
uncertainty, by 100l, the rate of return is still 31%.

TURKEY
ELBISTAN 0 & M ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Rate of Return on TEK/DSI 1985-1990 Expansion Program
Introduction
1.       The rate of return analysis on page 3 of this annex was carried out
on the basis that the project forms an integral part of TEK/DSI's 1985-1990
expansion program. The program is estimated to have an economic rate of
return of 11.9%, compared to an opportunity cost of capital of 12X. Key
assumptions are presented below.
Benefits
2.       Incremental revenues plup net fuel savings derived from investment in
improved efficiency of thermal plants were taken as the benefits of the
program. Electricity tariffs were assumed to increase at regular intervals to
ensure an adequate level of self-financing for the power subsector, reflecting
the Government's commitment to reduce public expenditures.  Tariffs include
taxes to reflect the prices faced by consumers. 1/ The average revenue (in
1985 prices) would be as follows:
1985      1986       1987      1988       1989    1990 & onwards
TLIkWh      30.55      31.04      31.8      3Y735     3373          33.82
New fuel savings were calculated on the basis that investment in improved
efficiency of existing thermal plants (Tuncbilek A a-d B, Anbarli, Seyitomer,
Soma B and Yatagan) would increase their average efficiency by one percentage
point as a minimum and result in an annual net fuel savings of TL 5.9 billion
starting in 1991. Given the fact that these plants would be retired at
different dates, net fuel savings would progressively diminish over the entire
30-year period considered for the life of the entire program.
1/  This includes VAT (10%) and a television tax (3.5X).  VAT presents some
difficulties for economic analysis since for industries (which use
electricity as an intermediate good) a tax rebate will be given. However,
since such rebates may take upwards of one year, the "effective price"
faced by these consumers is estimated to include VAT. Excluding VAT in
the analysis results in a rate of return of about lOZ.

Capital and Operating Costs
3.       The capital costs of TEK/DSI's discussed expansion program were taken
from the 1985-1990 investment program presented in the Staff Appraisal Report
for the Fourth TEK Transmission Project (Loan 2586-TU) 1/ and updated to
Janiary 1985 prices. Operation and maintenance costs were estimated at IZ of
cumilative capital costs for generation and transmission, and at 2Z for
distribution.
Fuel Costs
4.       The incremental generation from thermal plants was taken from the
projected balance of energy and capacity for TEK (Annex 6.1, Attachment 1).
The cost of fuel was estimated on the basis of the following assumptions:
(a)  specifiz consumption (ton/GWh):
-    lignite-fired steam plants: 1,450 (for a lignite with an average
calorific value of 1,725 kcal/kg);
-    coal-fired steam plants:  700 (for a coal with an average
calorific value of 4,200 kcal/kg);
-    gas-fired combustion turbines: 302;
-    gas-fired combined cycle plants:  226.
(b) Economic cost of fuels (US$/ton):
-    lignite:  20(equal to the weighted average long-run marginal
cost of lignite in Turkey);
-    coal:  60 (equal to the estimated CIF price of imported coal);
-    natural gas:  180 (equal to 9O0  of the border price of fuel oil).
5.       All benefits and costs were expressed in January 1985 prices, with an
exchange rate of TL 450/US$. The life of the program was taken at 30 years.
