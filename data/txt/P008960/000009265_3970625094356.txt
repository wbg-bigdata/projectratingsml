INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AMD RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
FOR AN
ELBISTAN OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) with the guarantee of the Republic of
Turkey for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to help finance the foreign
exchange cost of an Elbistan Operation and Maintenance Assistance Project.
The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey: The Vth Five Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.      Turkey's area is about 781,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a population of around
50 million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984. The density of population is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more
recently, to the Middle East), there is still substantial unemployment which,
including disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about
19 percent of the civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no
absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There are
considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable increase in income inequality
since the 1970s, especially a relative deterioration of the position of wage
and salary earners and an improvement in the position of the trading and
commercial classes, and, more generally, of capital-owners. Educational
enrollment has expanded greatly, but the level of adult literacy remains
relatively low compared to the European average for middle income countries.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Small and Medium Scale Industry Project
(P-4148-TU) dated December 12, 1985.



-2-
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of- external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize import.;, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
front, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans and an agricultural sector adjustment loan,
involves far-reaching changes in attitudes, institutions, and the legal and
policy framework, all of which require time to be put in place. Major
structural changes have been made in the exchange rate system, the export and
import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and selective credit policies
and the public investment program. Implementation of the adjustment program
started in January 1980, continued under a military regime during the period
September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been carried out by an elected
government.
The Structural Adjustment Program - 1980-85
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual outcomes met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. The overall performance deteriorated
in 1983 due to a combination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages
in the monetary program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved
again, except in the area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The
improvement has been maintained in 1985, as evidenced by a slowdown in
inflation and a reduction in the budget deficit.
8.       After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports, and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.7 percent growth) and industry (9.3 percent growth).



-3-
Exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar terms. In
1985, the growth rate of the economy is, according to the latest estimates,
expected to be about 4.9 percent, as against the program target of
5.5 percent. The slowdown of growth is apparent across the board, but is most
significant in agriculture (2.3 percent growth) and manufacturing
(5.6 percent), due respectively to less favorable climatic conditions and
slackening domestic demand.  On the expenditure side, the average annual real
rate of growth of public fixed investment over the period 1980-85 has been
fairly stable, at less than 3 percent p.a., while the growth rate of private
investment has recovered, following a 17.3 percent decline in 1980, and rose
by 7.1 percent in 1984 and an estimated 5.2 percent in 1985. Private
consumption, after declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by
5 percent in 1983 and 1984 before slowing down to an estimated 3 percent in
1985. Strict budgetary discipline contributed to a steady decline in the real
rate of growth of public consumption from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent
in 1983; however, it increased to 3.8 percent in 1984 and an estimated
4.4 percent in 1985.
9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation by a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in thte wholesale price index decelerated to 37 percent in
1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. Inflation accelerated further in 1984, and
reached 50 percent. The major factors that brought about the worsening of the
inflationary situation in 1984 were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant-
increase in agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other contributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases
of SEE prices - since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to
set their prices freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues.
10.      Inflation is expected to decline to 43-44 percent in 1985.  This
average annual inflation rate would be the net result of a period of high
inflation during the first quarter of the year, followed by a period of
deceleration starting in April 1985. Deceleration occurred despite
significant increases in prices of goods produced by SEEs; it was rendered
possible by the maintenance of high real rates of interest, a decline in the
prices of a number of agricultural goods (mostly fru_ts and vegetables), and
an overall siackening of domestic demand. The slowdown of inflation in the
second half of 1985 reinforces the expectations of a further decrease in the
average rate in L986, bringing it close to the Government's target of
25 percent.
11.      In the fiscal area, the progress achieved between 1980 and 1982
(during which time the budget deficit declined from 5.3 percent to 2.1 percent
of GNP) was not sustained in 1983 and 1984. Due to a steady decline in



-4-
consolidated government revenues ag a percentage of GNP, l/ the budget deficit
increased to 3.2 percent of GNP in 1983, and reached almost 5 percent of GNP
in 1984. The somewhat disappointing performance in the raising of revenues
was accompanied, however. by significant improvements in the control of public
expenditure. Overall, government expenditures decreased from 22 percent of
GNP in 1983 to an estimated 16 percent in 1985, essentially due to a
curtailment of personnel expenditures and government transfers to SEEs, with
the latter declining from 2.5 percent of GNP in 1983 to an estimated
0.8 percent of GNP in 1985. However, the fact that improvements in the area
of government expenditures were not matched by commensurate gains in the
reduction of the budget deficit highlights the urgency of mobilizing
additional public resources. As a step in this direction, the Government
introduced a Value Added Tax in January 1985, replacing previous indirect
taxes based on the value of output. The new tax has resulted in raising the
share of taxes on goods in total government revenues from around 12 percent in
1983-84 to an estimated 20 percent in 1985. As a result of these measures,
the budget deficit is expected to improve to about 2.5 percent of GNP in 1985.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system. Commercial bank deposit interest rates, which
were deregulated in July 1980, are positive in real terms. Time deposits have
been yielding a positive real return since early 1984, with interest rates
presently ranging between 45 to 55 percent depending upon the term of the
deposit. Positive deposit interest rates have resulted in a steady increase
in deposits: in 1984 private non-commercial deposits grew by 8 percent in
real terms, and in 1985 the growth has continued at a rate of about
10 percent. Improvements in incentives for savings were accompanied by
administrative reforms of the banking system. A new banking law was enacted
in June 1983. It included many of the recommendations made in the Bank's
report on the Financial Sector (No. 4459-TU), including measures to reduce the
undercapitalization of banks and the interlocking between banks and
corporations. The legal basis of the banking reform was strengthened with the
enactment of a revised banking law in April 1985, which introduced
standardized accounting for banks and specified improved procedures for
handling of non-performing loans. The Government also took a major step
towards reducing the cost of bank intermediation by reducing in December 1983
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
infrastructual facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge, and two dams).
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 60 to 80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the high intermediation costs of the commercial banks and the prevailing
practice of requiring compensating balances. The Government has taken a
number of steps in 1985 to reduce the interest rate differentials between
1/       Although total government revenues (inclusive of extra-budgetary
funds introduced in 1984) have not declined as sharply.



-5-
preferential and non-perferential credits: in particular, the perferential
interest rate for export credits was discontinued in January 1985, while
interest rates for agricultural short-term loans and for loans to SEEs have
been increased in 1985 to 30 percent (from 28 and 24 percent respectively).
The narrowing of the gap between interest rates on preferential and
non-preferential credits, together with the decrease in the amount of
preferential credits, is expected to increase the general availability of
credit and exert a downward pressure on non-preferential interest rates.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982. In
1983 the current account deficit increased, to $1.8 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion. Remittances, too, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 20 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports, fueled by high growth as well as a more liberal import
regime put in place in 1984, grew by more than 16 percent to reach
$10.8 billion (or almost 22 percent of GNP). As a result of these
developments, both the trade and the current account deficits declined as
compared to 1983: the trade deficit by $50 million, and the current account
deficit by $350 million, to reach $1.4 billion or about 2.9 percent of GNP.
Projections for 1985 indicate a further strong improvement of the current
account situation. Merchandise exports, after a sluggish start in 1985, have
grown by 13 percent (in dollar terms) in the first nine months of 1985, while
merchandise imports have grown at a moderate 5.3 percent. Among the
invisibles, tourism revenues and investment income from abroad have increased
significantly compared to 1984 and previous years. Similarly, workers'
remittances have continued to rise at a rate of about 10 percent per annum.
It is now estimated that the current account deficit in 1985 would be in the
range of $650-800 million (about 1.3 - 1.6 percent of GNP).
15.      Merchandise export performance has been impressive throughout the
1980-85 period, during which exports registered an average annual rate of
increase of about 22 percent in dollar terms. This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of expor_s to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods and textiles, have risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to
more than three-quarters in 1985. These results were achieved by a
combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization)
and direct (tax rebates, preferential credits) measures to enhance the
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the volume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased by 16.1 percent in dollar value.
The increase was most pronounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and



-6-
consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization in terms of
both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of quantitative
restrictions. In 1985, as domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of
pent-up demand for importables released by import liberalization weakened, the
rate of import growth decreased to one-third of the level recorded in 1984.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Fifth Five Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand National Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989; and
(v)    a decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear ambitious and
likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public sector) as well
as to have an adverse impact on the external balance. Accordingly, the
Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that they remain
compatible with the fight against inflation and with a growth strategy
commensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.      The Bank's projections indicate that GDP growth of 5.7 percent p.a.
on average for the 1985-90 period may be more realistic. In the first phase
of this period (1985-87), growth might be relatively slow (5.3 percent p.a.),
gradually accelerating in the outer years with an average rate of 6.0 percent
p.a. in the period 1988-90. The inflation targets in the Bank's projections
are also more conservative, implying a reduction from about 40 percent in 1985
to around 18 percent in 1990. Key economic variables in the Bank's
projecticis for the period 1985-90 are presented in Table 1: 1/
1/ The Bank's estimate for 1985 may differ slightly from the Government's
latest estimates for 1985 discussed above.

20.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment of about 3.8 percent p.a. on average for the
1985-90 period, starting with a more modest increase of around 3.5 percent
p.a. in the early years. The comparable figure for the growth of private
fixed investment (for the whole period) is 10.0 percent p.a. These figures
are consistent with the need to meet the infrastructural requirements of the
economy through the public investment program, while providing for the
capacity expansion of the private sector necessary to meet the output and
export targets. The projections allow for a modest increase of per capita
consumption of about 3.0 percent p.a. on average over the period 1985-90.
21.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
8.5 percent per annum in real terms during 1985-90, while merchandise imports
are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.8 percent. This is
consistent with the import liberalization program of the Government. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1988
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the outer years of the period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through 1990. For the year 1990, the projections show a deficit of
$810 million as compared to an estimated 1985 figure of $750 million. The
projected capital account would remain manageable throughout the period, even
in the face of some sharp increases in amortization payments arising from the
debts rescheduled during 1978-80.
22.      On the external front, the current expectation of lower oil prices in
the next period is likely to have a positive impact on the balance of
payments. The savings on direct petroleum imports could be as much as
$275 million in 1986 alone. Lower oil prices will no doubt have some negative
consequences for Turkey's exports to oil-exporting countries as well as on
profit and workers' remittances from construction activities in these
countries. Nevertheless, the overall effect on the current account is likely
to be positive, due to the stronger effect of the import savings.
23.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a strong growth of Turkish exports, the
GNP growth projected in the medium-term base case scenario could be exceeded
if slightly higher export growth rates were achieved and there was an
improvement in the mobilization of public resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a i'ownside risk case has also been developed. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such as the
world economic conditions and movements in international prices, a slower



-9-
growth of merchandise exports (an average of about 6 percent p-a. over the
1985-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources
(3 percent lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would
lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a
lower GDP growth (averaging about 4.7 percent p.a.) and a higher debt service
ratio (averaging 26.7 percent during 1986-90 against 25.1 percent in the base
case scenario). In such a situation the Government would have less chance of
absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. However, if the Government in such circumstances were to resort to a
high growth strategy, then it could witness a repeat of the situation which
prevailed in the 1970s, and which led to a debt crisis. It is unlikely that
the Government would risk such a situation. It is therefore more probable -
even if exogeneous developments are unfavorable - that the Government will
continue with the structural adjustment program as implemented to date, so
that the scenario of high growth fuelled by increased external borrowing seems
at present unlikely.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7 0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources - OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks have outstripped those from official sources and are
likely to reach an estimated level of $2.5 billion by end-1985. Of the
estimated total debt outstanding of $22.3 billion (including IMF) at end-1984,
medium and long-term debt accounted for about 79 percent. Short-term debt as
a percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
21 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme 1/. At end-1984,
the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme amounted to
$1.8 billion, constituting 39 percent of short-term external obligations.
Based on the growth scenario outlined in paras. 19 to 22, debt outstanding and
disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an estimated
42 percent in 1984 to 37 percent in 1990. This translates into a total debt
outstanding forecast for 1990 of $28.8 billion, with short-term debt
constituting about 25 percent of the total.
26.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estimated 31 percent in 1985, mostly as a
1/       Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish
workers in West Germany and automatically places these funds at the
disposition of the Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the
deposits and pays an interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market
rate.



- 10 -
result of large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due. Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.0 billion a year during
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt. However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
a level of about 25 percent during 1986-1990, due largely-to improvements in
the current account of the balance of payments. The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive support from international
comnercial and official sources. Confidence in Turkey's overall economic
performance, its stable record in meeting debt servicing obligations and its
improved debt management, encouraged commercial banks to commit about
$1.3 billion in 1985. Several major American, European, Japanese and Middle
Eastern banks were involved in these operations, including a $500 million
syndicated loan in support of the balance of payments signed in April 1985.
27.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government has not asked
for a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the
view that the favorable economic developments in 1985 constitute proof of
Turkey having "graduated" from the IMF's program and that the IMF presence
through Article IV consultations should suffice for purposes of maintaining
international confidence.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.      Through September 30, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent
$6185.8 million 11 to Turkey, through 88 projects. Agriculture accounts for
21 percent of the funds lent, industry and DFCs for 22 percent, power for
16 percent, structural adjustment and program loans for 27 percent, and urban
development, transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for
the remaining 14 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged
63 percent of appraisal estimates at the end of September 1985, which compares
favorably with other countries in the region. As of September 30, 1985, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $246 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1985.
29.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was completed in June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program. Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current plan involves the broadening and deepening of the
adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments have
underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program without
1/       Net of cancellations.



- 11 -
giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank
lending in the post-SAL period would be on striking an appropriate balance
between sectoral adjustment lending designed in part to be quick disbursing
and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and carefully
formulated project lending focussing on high priority projects principally in
the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
30.      A series of sectoral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
planned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. Further lending of this kind would support measures to address the
structural problems of the financial sector and enhance the utilization of
industrial capacity in the public and private sectors, keeping in view the
scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held assets in the manufacturinF
subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral adjustment loans are likely to ae
developed include energy and transport, and it is expected that there wo'Ad be
a follow-up loan in agriculture.
31.      This would be the third loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Other projects being processed include Kayraktepe
Hydropower, a loan for drainage and on-farm development, and a financial
sector adjustment loan.
32.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the public investment
program and studies of housing finance, engineering industries, transport
investment, telecommunications and electronics. Topics expected to be covered
in the future include a study in domestic resource mobilization, a country
economic memorandum focussing on inflation, reviews of the health and
education sectors and a study of private sector adjustment to liberalization
action.
33.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1986-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 13.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 14 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to $13.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.2 billion in 1984 to $7.5 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 18 percent in 1989.
34.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.



- 12 -
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
35.      Turkey has substantial untapped lignite and hydropower resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
geothermal potential. Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW under average hydrological conditions and
corresponds to an annual production of about 100,000 GWh. Only 15 percent has
been developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30 percent by
1990. Proven recoverable reserves of oil are about 16 million tons; however,
potential reserves that may become economically recoverable, using enhanced
oil recovery techniques currently being tested, could be as high as 30 million
tons. Oil production has been declining over the last decade, as few
discoveries have been made in recent years; in 1983 production was about
2.3 million tons, equivalent to 13 percent of total consumption. Proven
recoverable gas reserves are about 400 billion standard cubic feet. Domestic
gas will, however, be supplemented, beginning in 1987, by large scale imports
of natural gas from the U.S.S.R.
36.      Total known reserves of hard coal are estimated at about 1 billion
tons, all located in the north of Turkey. Coal production has been declining
as operations move to deeper, less accessible seams; in 1983 production was
3.5 million tons (2.2 million toe). Proven and probable lignite reserves are
about 8 billion tons, but about half of this is of extremely low quality
(950-1,000 kcal/kg). Lignite production in 1983 was about 20 million tons,
equivalent to about 4.6 million tons of oil. There is potential for
geothermal development, for both space heating and electricity generation, and
a review of promising geothermal sites is under way.
Energy Consumption and Supply
37.      Total gross energy consumption was about 38 million toe in 1983, of
which commercial energy consumption amounted to 30 million toe. Petroleum
made up the most significant share of primary commercial energy (58 percent),
with lignite (20 percent), hydropower (9 percent), coal (11 percent),
asphaltite and imported electricity making up the balance. Overall, about
23 percent of final commercial energy consumption was in the form of
electricity. Non-commercial energy production (primarily fuelvood, but also
other biomass) was an important energy source, accounting for 37 percent of
total domestic energy production. The most notable change in the pattern of
energy consumption over the past two decades has been the decrease in the
relative share of hard coal in the total. This was accompanied by a rapid
growth in consumption of petroleum until the mid-1970s, peaking at over
50 percent in 1977/78; and a rapid rise in the share of lignite (primarily for
thermal power production) and hydroelectric power consumption starting in the
second half of the 1970s. During this period, hard coal consumption stayed
relatively constant in absolute terms, while traditional biomass energy
sources increased slightly in absolute terms but decreased steadily as a
percentage of total energy consumed.



- 13 -
38.      Trends observed in the growth and pattern of energy consumption
during the latter part of the 1970s are expected to continue during the 1980s
and 1990s. The most important factor in the growth of energy demand will be
the growth rate of the economy as a whole and the growth of the relatively
energy-intensive industrial sector. The demand for lignite is expected to
grow rapidly, both for direct consumption by households and industry and, even
more importantly, for the power sector. The growth in demand for petroleum
will be moderate due to the much higher price of imported oil and petroleum
products and its substitution by other energy sources.
Organization of the Energy Sector
39.      The energy sector in Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
Government owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources in
Turkey. The Turkish Hard Coal Enterprise (TTK), the Turkish Lignite
Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO), and the Mineral
Research Institute (MTA) have responsibility for the extraction of fossil
fuels and radioactive minerals. Identification, design and construction of
hydroelectric projects is entrusted to the State Hydraulics Authority (DSI).
The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) is responsible for the generation,
transmission and, since November 1982, the distribution of almost all the
electricity sold in Turkey. TEK is also responsible for the implementation of
the Government's program for rural electrification and the construction of all
public sector generating and transmission facilities, with the exception of
public sector hydroelectric plants for which DSI has responsibility.
40.      Private sector participation in the supply of electricity was, until
1983, confined to two small private utilities (CEAS and KEPEZ) and industrial
companies which generated power for their own use. However, recent changes in
Government energy policy now give greater encouragement to private sector
participation in the development and production of energy (para. 42). The
Government is actively seeking ways to encourage both local and foreign
private sector participation in geothermal development, lignite mining,
hydroelectric projects and the construction and operation of power plants
fired by imported fuels.
Energy Sector Policy
41.      To meet its energy requirements, Turkey launched a massive program in
the late 1970s to increase the domestic production of electricity and
lignite. This program tended to stretch the implementation capabilities of
the State energy agencies, and spread resources too thinly over too many
projects, with resulting long delays in completion schedules. This has, in
turu, resulted in an energy deficit which is likely to remain a feature of the
Turkish economy at least through the 1980s. MENR and TEK are in the process
of improving their energy planning capabilities; and MENR has produced
Turkey's first energy policy paper. Furthermore, the current Five Year
Development Plan (1985-89) contains some broad objectives relevant to the
energy sector including the following:



- 14 -
- Priority is to be given to domestic sources of energy, especially
hydro and lignite, provided that they are economically justified;
- Imported energy including, but not limited to, oil will be
considered;
- Renewable and nonconventional resources such as geothermal, solar
and biogas are to be supported; and
- Private sector financing, both local and foreign, will be sought
for participation in energy development.
42.      Two features of Government policy appear to represent a departure
from previous energy policy. The first is that Government policy is now quite
clearly to encourage private sector participation in the energy sector. There
are now no legal constraints to private sector electricity generation, and
existing private utilities like KEPEZ and CEAS have plans to increase their
capacities. In addition, the State Planning Organization (SPO) is currently
undertaking, with assistance from consultants, preliminary studies to assess
whether private finance could be sought for the construction and operation of
thermal plants based upon imported fuels (coal, nuclear) and geothermal
sources. The second shift in policy focus is increased concern that
indigenous resources be developed only when economically justified. Improving
efficiency in the lignite mining subsector at least to levels at which
marginal production costs are competitive with imported coal, or conversely
abandoning such mining ventures if such economies cannot realistically be met,
has become a major energy policy objective for the Government.
43.      A less explicit but no less important component of the Government's
energy policy relates to the pricing of energy products. Regular increases in
the prices of petroleum products to maintain them at economic levels has been
a feature of the Government's pricing policy for the past five years.
Electricity tariffs have been increased sharply since early 1984. As of
April 1, 1985 bulk power tariffs had caught up roughly with the level of long
run marginal cost. Prices of petroleum products are being maintained at
international levels. Lignite prices, which had shown a threefold increase in
real terms in the seven years up to 1983, declined slightly in real terms in
1984.
44.      The Government is also in the process of developing a program for the
conservation of energy by encouraging more efficient use in existing and new
industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and legislation have been
evaluated by both the MENR and SPO, and legislation has been passed which
allows for tax credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency
improvements. The Bank included financing of energy audits in selected
manufacturing facilities under Loan 1916-TU. These audits have been
completed, and recommendations are expected to be implemented. TEK has
engaged consultants to assist in the development of an energy conservation and
load management program. MENR has requested Bank assistance in the
development and implementation of a comprehensive energy conservation program.

Electricity Supply and Demand
45.      The present installed power capacity in Turkey is about 7,600 MW of
which 3,500 MW (50 percent) is thermal and the balance hydro. The share of
hydroelectric power has increased over the past ten years from 33 percent in
1972 to about 50 per cent in 1984. On the thermal side, lignite has made an
increasing contribution to the production of electricity.  Total gross
generation in 1984 was about 30,000 GWh, of which TEK accounted for almost
90 percent. Imported electricity from Bulgaria and the U.S.S.R. accounted for
a further 2,500 GWh. Total availability was less than the potential effective
demand, estimated at 35,000 GWh. There is considerable evidence that power
shortages have caused cutbacks in production in industries such as cement,
textiles and paper. In addition to the capacity constraint, the high level of
total system losses (technical losses plus energy unaccounted for), estimated
at about 20 percent, contributed to the supply shortages.
46.      Growth in demand for electricity averaged about 9 percent per annum
over the period 1965-1983. Between 1970 and 1983, the percentage of
population with public electricity supply rose from 51 percent to 78 percent.
Per capita consumption of electricity is currently about 550 kWh. TEK's
latest long-term generation plan (1987-2005) is based upon a projected overall
growth in energy demand of about 11 percent per annum, with peak demand
increasing at about 9 percent per annum. This represents a considerable
sustained annual increase in demand, particularly as the base from which the
demand is extrapolated (1987) appears to be high.
47.      For more than two decades the Turkish power subsector has been
confronted with major problems. Electricity supply has been insufficient to
meet demand in every year since 1971, resulting in high costs to the economy
as imports increased and supply interruptions continued.  Many of the issues
facing the subsector can be traced to institutional problems in the public
sector agencies responsible for planning and implementing the subsector's
investment program. This has resulted in project delays, consequent
substantial cost escalations, power shortages, frequent and protracted plant
breakdowns due to inadequate maintenance, and relatively high system losses,
especially in the urban networks. The shortage of qualified staff in TEK
resulted in resources, human and financial, being spread too thinly over too
many projects in the investment program.
48.      The Government agrees that closing the supply gap will require a
sustained coordinated effort by the major agencies in the subsector. It plans
to emphasize increased supply in parallel with managing demand and improving
efficiency of existing facilities. To illustrate the magnitude of the task,
it should be noted that Turkey would have to bring on stream three times more
capacity in the 1980s than in the 1970s and that the momentum would have to be
sustained throughout most of the 1990s. Also, scarce resources will be tied
up in technologies new to the country, such as nuclear, and in projects of an
unprecedented size. TKI and DSI will have to meet their respective production
targets commensurate with TEK's plans. Even if a lower growth rate in
electricity demand is assumed, and optimistic assumptions are made about the
sector's implementation capacity, except for 1986 and 1987 some power
shortages are likely to continue throughout the 1980s.

Bank's Role in the Power Subsector and Experience with Past Lending
49.     The proposed project would be the eighteenth Bank operation in the
power subsector in Turkey. The Bank has made thirteen loans and a technical
assistance grant (total $921.7 million), and IDA has granted three credits
(total $55.7 million) for four hydroelectric projects, two thermal power
stations (oil- and lignite-fired), a lignite mine, and several transmission
and distribution networks. The technical assistance grant helped reorganize
Turkey's power subsector. The first five loans/credits were for projects in
the CEAS concession area. All these projects were completed successfully,
although often with long delays. The Bank has made six previous loans to TEK,
for the First, Second, Third and Fourth Power Transmission Projects, a Power
System Operations Assistance Project and the power component of the 1974
Elbistan Thermal Power Project (Loan 1023-TU).
50.     A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) distributed to the Board in
November 1981, 1/ on the Keban Transmission (Loan 568-TU) and the first TEK
Power Transmission (Loan 763-TU) projects, found that these projects had met
their physical objectives despite implementation delays and cost overruns. A
Project Completion Report on the Istanbul Power Distribution Project (Loan
892-TU), distributed to the Board in December 1982, 2/ also reported physical
completion of the project after considerable delay. Major constraints to
timely project completion were identified as shortage of local counterpart
finance and, in the case of Loan 892-TU, late preparation of bidding
documents. A major conclusion of the TEK II (Loan 1194-TU) Project Completion
Report was the need for improvement in the monitoring and coordination of the
project. The report recommended the establishment of a single unit within TEK
to be accountable for project implementation. Such units are now regularly
used in Bank financed power projects in Turkey. Implementation of the Third
TEK Transmission Project (Loan 2322-TU) is satisfactory. The loan for the
fourth TEK Transmission Project (Loan 2586-rU) was signed on June 27, 1985.
The Power System Operations Assistance Project (Loan 2602-TU which was signed
on July 8. 1985) is the first project to focus directly on improving the
efficiency of existing facilities for producing, transmitting and distributing
electricity.
51.     The Bank has been able to assist the Government in the consolidation
of the power sector and in the creation of TEK. The Bank has also supported
efforts to bring about other institutional reforms. Considerable progress has
been made in areas such as TEK's accounting system, system planning, and
procurement procedures. The Bank has also assisted in attracting funds from
other bilateral and international financing agencies (e.g. EIB, German Aid
(KfW), US Eximbank).

Planned Strategy for Assistance to the Sector
52.      Sector policy discussions, which recently have been held twice a year
with the Government and energy sector agencies, have provided a valuable forum
to discuss the issues and constraints facing the sector. The Bank is
generally in agreement with the Government's strategy for the energy
subsector.  Detailed agency by agency action programs have been prepared and
will be discussed with the Bank. Current and future Bank lending would be
based on these action programs. For the electric power subsector, it has been
agreed that attention be given to a selected number of high priority issues.
The strategy includes focus on (a) investments which yield quick returns, such
as completion of priority ongoing investments, upgrading of existing
facilities, reduction in losses, and improvements in maintenance procedures
and efficiency; (b) programs to ensure a balanced electric power development
program through appropriate investment in generation, transmission,
distribution and general plant; (c) improved demand management including
identification of energy saving investments and enactment of energy
conservation legislation; (d) technical assistance to strengthen capabilities
in planning, financial management and manpower development; (e) investment in
new generation options such as those based upon imvorted coal and natural gas;
and (f) an increased role for the private sector in the production of
electricity.
53.      The Government has identified a series of investments which would
address the above medium-term issues. The Bank agrees with the size and
structure of Turkey's 1986 power sector investment program and generally with
the investment strategy proposed for subsequent years. The Bank will have
opportunities to express its views on detailed future energy sector investment
programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
54.      The proposed project would help finance the completion of the
Elbistan Power station and would help ensure its adequate operating
availability and efficient operation. The project was identified in December
1984 and appraised in April/May 1985. Loan negotiations were held in
Washington in November/December, 1985. The Turkish delegation was led by Mr.
Hikmet Ulugbay, Chief Financial and Economic Counselor of the Turkish Embassy
in Washington and included representatives of the Treasury and TEK. A Staff
Appraisal Report entitled "Elbistan Operation and Maintenance Assistance
Project" (No. 5774-TU), dated December 31, 1985 is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. The main features of the project are given in the
Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III.
Background of the 1974 Elbistan Thermal Power Project (Ln. 1023-TU)
55.      The 1974 integrated Elbistan Thermal Power Project is the first to
exploit the Afsin-Elbistan lignite deposit. It accounts for a substantial
share of Turkish power investment (36% and 13% in 1975-1980 and 1981-1985
respectively) and is a highly visible operation. The Project is designed to
supply electric power using low grade lignite from the Kislakoy



- 18 -
mine in Afsin-Elbistan as part of a balanced program of power development
utilizing Turkey's fuel and hydropower resources. Other project objectives
are to address institutional problems (organization, management, personnel and
finances) that were apparent in TEK and TKI and which proved to be the main
causes of delay in the execution of the project. The project originally
included the following components:
(a) a thermal power station with four 340-MW lignite-fired units
delivering, after meeting the power station and mine loads, an
estimated 1,048 MW and 7,030 GWh p.a. to TEK's interconnected
system;
(b) 380-kV transmission lines, about 540 km long, connecting Elbistan
with Kayseri and Ankara by 1978 and 1979 respectively;
(c) an open-cast lignite mine with a planned capacity of 20.7 Mt/a,
17.9 Mt/a for the power station and 2.8 Mt/a for processing for
sale as domestic fuel; the project included the cost of land and
restoration of the worked-out mining area;
(d) separate permanent housing for power station and mine staff and
roads between these and the works as well as Afsin-Elbistan
towns; and
(e) consultancy services.
56.      The Bank provided about 24Z of the original foreign financing.  Loan
1023-TU for $148 million, ($123 million for the power station and $25 million
for the lignite mine) was approved in June 1974. Cofinancing was provided by
German Aid (KfW, Hermes), European Investment Bank (EIB), US Eximbank,
Japanese Eximbank, Italy and France. Loan effectiveness was delayed nearly
two years largely on account of delays in implementing a tariff increase to
improve TEK's finances. The loan was finally declared effective on June 1,
1976. The Closing Date of the loan was June 30, 1983. This loan was fully
disbursed by September 15, 1983. Ongoing contracts under the project have
been financed through 1985 by KfW, EIB and the Government.
57.      Initially a mine output for a 600-MW power plant (4 x 150 MW) was
planied.  In an effort to achieve economies of scale TEK, with support of its
consultants, decided to increase the power plant rating to 1200 MW (4x300 MW)
and the mine's design output to 20 Mt/a, with most of the lignite intended for
power generation. This decision proved to be critical since it overloaded
TEK's and TKI's manpower and financial resources.
Implementation Problems
58.      TEK and TKI had difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably
qualified personnel because of the remoteness and poor living conditions of
the site and the low civil service salary structure. Project site supervision
ran into difficulties due to the inexperience of TEK and TKI's site managers
and the limited authority delegated to the field staff. There was also a
problem of coordination between the two entities. These issues led



- 19 -
delays in the procurement of equipment and in payments to contractors and lack
of supervision and control of civil works. Delays in the provision of local
funds also af.fected the implementation of the project.
Status and Operating Performance
59.      The project is about seven years behind schedule but there has been
no further slippage since 1983. The present situation can be summarized as
follows:
(a) Power Station: All the main plant and equipment for the four
340-MW units are on site. The cooling towers, chimneys and the
bulk of the civil works are complete. Since July 1982, erection
work has been proceeding satisfactorily. Unit I went into
commercial operation in January 1985.  Unit 2 went into trial
operation in May 1985 and is going into commercial operation in
January 1986. Units 3 and 4 are to follow at one-year intervals.
(b) Lignite Mine: The quantities of material moved at the mine over
the past three years have been well below planned levels.
However, by March 1985, the lignite seam had been uncovered for
the first time, with an inventory of about 4.3 Mt available for
immediate mining. Data gained from the seam showed improved
geological conditions compared to those previously assumed from
exploration results, resulting in more lignite available within
power station specifications and a lower overall stripping
ratio. No mine planning based on the new parameters has been
done as yet and further verification is required. But the Bank
is satisfied that the existing mine equipment is adequate to
handle the required quantities of material without major
overburden backlogs over the next two to three years provided,
however, that corrective a-tion is taken on the following major
operational constraints: insufficient managerial and skilled
personnel, lack of training, insufficient spare and wear parts,
inadequate maintenance arrangements, and inefficient removal of
hard strata.
(c) Domestic Fuel Drying Plant: In the light of the problems
encountered in suppLying lignite for the power station, the
lignite drying plant associated with the original project has
been dropped by TKI. The Bank agreed to this decision.
(d) Transmission Lines: Of the two 380-kV lines under the original
project, Elbistan-Kayseri has been in operation since 1983. The
other, Elbistan-Ankara, is under construction and scheduled for
completion this year in time to accommodate the commercial
operation of Unit 3 starting in January 1987.
60.      The severe delays in the execution of the project led to a more than
doubling of the original cost estimates (as shown in the table below). The
following factors also contributed:



- 20 -
(a)  Exchange Rate Variation:  The bulk of equipment was procured
from countries whose currencies appreciated substantially during
project implementation.
(b)  Increased Cost of Engineering:  When the project ran into
difficulties, more engineering supervision was called for;
actual man months of engineering and administration are more
than 2002 of the appraisal estimate.
(c)  Interest During Construction:  The length of the execution
period for the project coupled with borrowings to cover the
resulting financing gap substantially increased the amount of
interest during construction.

Rationale for Continued Bank Involvement
61.      The Elbistan Project is almost complete.  Project implementation is
now under control and progressing well. The mine is fully operational and
construction of the fourth and last unit in the power station is scheduled for
completion by the end of 1986. Moreover, the government is committed to
introducing adequate measures to ensure the long term availability of lignite
for the power plant.
62.      Throughout the implementation of the Elbistan project, starting in
1974, the three major cofinanciers, KfW, EIB and! L;le Lank, have acted in close
coordination to help bring about a more favorable turn of events. In addition
to participating in the proposed project, KfW and EIB are also funding a
parallel project to assist TKI carry out operation and maintenance
improvements at the lignite mine. An additional remedy is provided for under
the Bank loan agreement in the event that the KfW or EIB financing for this
parallel project is suspended. One of the reasons why it is considered
desirable to make this modest (in financial terms) loan is that it would
enable the Bank to continue to work with KfW and EIB now that a solution to
Elbistan's long-standing problems is in sight.
Project Objective
63.      The main objectives of the proposed project would be to complete the
Elbistan Power Station and to ensure the station's adequate operating
availability and efficient operation.



- 21 -
Project Description
64.     The project would include:
(a)   the completion and commissioning of Units 3 and 4 at Elbistan
power station (4x340 MW); and
(b)   improvement in the Borrower's project management and operation
and maintenance capabilities at Elbistan.
Project Implementation
65.     TEK would implement the project.  To ensure adequate technical support
at the power plant TEK has agreed to continue to employ a project management
firm to provide supervision of construction and assistance in operation and
maintenance of the power plant up to December 31, 1987 or the commissioning of
Unit 4, whichever comes later. The project would be implemented over three
years (1985-1987) and is expected to be completed by December 31, 1987.
Project Financing Plan and Lending Arrangement
66.     The proposed Bank loan of $10.0 million would be made to TEK.  It
would finance about 4% of the total financing required ($247.8 million) and
10% of the foreign exchange portion ($97.6 million). The remaining costs of
$237.8 million would be covered from loans and credits being provided by EIB,
KfW, US Eximbank, and own resources from TEK and the Government. Retroactive
financing would not be required. A suimnary of the project financing plan is
shown below. Details of the items that would be financed out of the Bank loan
are given in para. 68. The foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan would be
born by TEK.

Given the recent improvements in TEK's financial performance, no difficulties
are foreseen in TEK meeting its share of the local cost of the project. TEK
suffered a net operating loss in 1983, hut the situation improved sharply in
1984 and 1985. As of April 1985 bulk rates had roughly caught up with long
run marginal cost. The Government is committed to the completion of the
Elbistan complex and has agreed to make available local funds to TEK for the
proposed project in a timely manner.
Audits
67.      TEK's financial statements are audited by the High Control Board in
the Prime Ministry. TEK is required by law to submit its balance sheets and
financial accounts to the Prime Ministry for auditing no later than the third
month following the year they pertain to. TEK is then required to subait its
annual audited accounts to the Bank no later than five months after the close
of the year. However, there are shortcomings in both the scope and the timing
of the present audit reports. The auditors rarely comment on the reliability
of the presentation of the accounts, or on significant events which occurred
during the year. The audit reports concerning 1981 and 1982 and 1983 were
received more than a year after the close of the fiscal year. The report for
1984 has not yet been received. Most likely it will not be possible to meet
the five month target for submission of audit reports until the 1987 report.
TEK's consultants are giving priority to helping TEK improve the timeliness
and accuracy of the financial statements. Furthermore, an upgrading of TEK's
computer center, presently being studied. should improve TEK's ability to
prepare and correct the annual financial reports. It is expected that the
quality and timely submission of audit reports will improve gradually. The
1985 and 1986 reports are expected within ten and eight months, respectively,
after the end of the given fiscal year, and within five months for 1987 and
afterwards.

- 23 -
Plant and Equipment up to an amount of $45.6 million equivalent would be
co-financed by KfW and EIB and procured through extension of existing
contracts with eligible suppliers under KfW and EIB rules. Spare parts to be
financed by the Bank ($2.5 million) are proprietary items, obtainable only
from one source and would be procured through direct contracting, in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Installation and
erection services ($103.4 million) would be procured through extension of
existing contracts, awarded under ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Civil works ($12.7 million), which would not be financed by the Bank would be
procured as an extension of existing local contracts. Contracts for
miscellaneous items costing the equivalent of $50,000 or less, up to an
agregate of $1,000,000 equivalent may be procured under contracts awarded on
the basis of comparison of pr:ce quotations, solicited from a list of at least
three suppliers, eligible under the Bank's guidelines, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bauk. Engineering services ($15.4 million) would
be procured through extension of existing consultancy contracts, awarded under
the Bank's guidelines. Administration would be done by force account not
financed by the Bank. All bidding packages for goods over $250,000 to be
financed by the Bank would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documents, resulting in about 90% coverage of goods contracts.
The balance of contracts would be subject to selective post review by the Bank
after contract award.
69.      Disbursement of proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be made for:

in EMENA as a whole is not appropriate.
Special Account
70.      The establishment of a Special Account in the Central Bank would
permit payment of Bank-financed expenditures with a minimum of administrative
delay. The initial deposit would be $2 million.

Environmental Aspects
71.      The Elbistan power station is located in a sparsely inhabited area.
The power plant provides for ash removal from flue gases by means of
electrostatic precipitators designed for 99Z removal efficiency. At this
level, fly ash emissions are in compliance with World Bank Guidelines for dust
and electrostatic precipitators. In addition, the plant will meet Bank
Guidelines for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Under Loan 1023-TU, TEK
agreed to establish pollution monitoring stations and to inform the Bank of
recorded pollution levels and any corrective actions taken, should they be
necessary. This covenant is being complied with and the Government has agreed
to take measures to ensure continued application of pollution controls. The
mine site area is treeless and at best sparsely cultivated. It affords no
shelter to wildlife. Moreover, TKI is carrying out, under Loan 1023-TU,
necessary reclamation to allow resettlement and reuse. The lowering of the
water table in the mining area has produced no ill effects and extracted water
is used for irrigation. Sewage is being treated appropriately. Noise
pollution does not arise.
Project Benefits and Risks
72.      The only remaining project risk is the uncertainty of the mine
meeting the lignite needs of the power station beyond 1986. The Government
has confirmed that it will take all measures necessary to meet minimum
requirements of lignite for the efficient operation of the power station. The
proposed project would form part of the interconnected power system operated
by TEK. TEK's system is projected to expand rapidly over the next ten years
in order to meet a fast-growing demand and close the still prevailing
electrical energy deficit. It is very unlikely that the projected generation
expansion to 1990, which includes Elbistan 3 and 4, will be able to meet the
system's energy requirements, even under average hydrological conditions and
with continued power imports from Bulgaria and the USSR. Any delay in
commissioning of Elbistan 3 and 4 would therefore increase the projected
supply gap. The proposed project is justified and necessary to meet projected
incremental demand on TEK's system.
73.      The remaining question is whether any other type of plant could meet
the projected requirements at less cost than the project. Of the available
alternatives, only combustion turbines could conceivably be installed in time
to lessen the energy deficits which would prevail in 1988 and later years
without the project. Other feasible options would be justified, only if they
showed sufficient economic advantage over the proposed project to offset the
costs to the economy in terms of unserved demand which their longer completion
times would involve. Evaluation of all the alternatives shows that both the
capital and operating costs of the proposed project are lower than those of
any alternative. Sensitivity testing confirmed that the project would still
be the least-cost option in TEK's projected system growth.
Rate of Return on the Overall Sector TEK/DSI Expansions Progra'
74.      The overall TEK/DSI expansion program for 1985-1990, which includes
the proposed project was evaluated in conjunction with the appraisal of the
Fourth TEK Transmission and the Power System Operations Assistance projects



- 25 -
(Loans 2586-TU and 2602-TU respectively) and indicated a rate of return of
11.3Z, marginally below the estimated opportunity cost o.f capital of 122.
This reflects that average power tariffs are near long run marginal cost of
supply. However, it understates the real economic return on the program,
since the measurement of benefits underestimates the willingness to pay for
electricity.
Recalculation of the Rate of Return on the 1974 Elbistan Project
75.      The rate of return on the Elbistan project has been recalculated.
The period used for the calculation was 1973-2014, covering the start of
construction of the power station and mine and their estimated economic life
of 30 years from the start of commercial operation in 1985.  The costs are the
capital and operating costs of the mine and power station together with the
associated transmission facilities. The benefits comprise the revenues from
the incremental bulk sales of electricity attributable to the power station.
Incremental sales were valued at the average prices projected for bulk
consumers (at 1985 prices), which are as follows:
1985     1986     1987     1988      1989     1990 onwards
TLIkWh        26.87    28.21    29.62    31.10    33.10         36.83
Electricity tariffs were assumed to increase at regular intervals to reach and
maintain LRMC, and to ensure an adequate level of self-financing for the power
subsector, reflecting the Government's commitment to reduce public
expenditures. Since the tariffs used in the calculation were estimated as a
proxy for consumers' willingness to pay, all taxes 1/ were included. Given
the large unmet demand, the willingness to pay for electricity is likely to be
higher than the current average tariff, but it cannot be readily quantified.
76.      A comparison of the Elbistan's costs and benefits results in a rate
of retura of about 6X. This compares with an estimate of nearly 18% in the
original (1974) appraisal. The difference is due largely to the delay
experienced in completing Elbistan and the resulEing lengthy period of time
which has elapsed between incurring its heavy investment costs and reaping the
benefits of its output. The Elbistan project is worth completing because the
rate of return estimated for the proposed project is over 407,given that a
large part of the costs of units 3 and 4 were incurred before 1985-
1/  VAT presents some difficulties, since it is repaid to industries which use
electricity as an intermediate good. However, repayment may take up to a
year, and the "effective price" to industrial consumers is therefore taken
as including VAT. Excluding VAT in these cases would slightly reduce the
rate of return.
