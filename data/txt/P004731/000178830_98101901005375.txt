THAILAND
PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
PROVINCIAL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Consumption
1.01      Total commercial energy consumption in Thailand has increased from
5.9 million tons of oil equivalent in 1970 to over 16.2 million tons of oil
equivalent in 1981, an average annual growth rate of 8.8%. In 1981, petrol-
eum products accounted for 71% of total energy. Indigenous resources have
accounted for the rest of total energy consumption, with fuelwood/charcoal,
bagasse, hydro, and lignite forming 13%, 7%, 5% and 4% shares, respectively.
The price of crude oil has increased almost twelvefold since 1972 and has
become a heavy burden on the Thai economy. After the second oil shock, the
share of Thailand's energy imports in total imports increased to 31%, and 45%
of the economy's export earnings were required to finance energy imports alone
in 1980.
B. Energy Resources
Natural Gas
1.02      Natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand are currently esti-
mated to amount to about 20 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of which about 4 tcf
are proven. Gas production began in September 1981 in the Erawan field at a
rate of 70-80 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD). During 1982
production gradually increased to about 130 MMSCFD, but remained short of the
200 MMSCFD which had originally been expected. The shortfall is attributable
to technical difficulties and to the fact that the gas reserves are
distributed over smaller than expected reservoirs. Proven reserves are
currently being reassessed. With the addition of further production capacity
in other fields, production would increase to 600 MMSCFD by 1987. The Bank
made a loan of $107 million (Loan 1773-TH) in FY80 for the development of the
first phase of the natural gas pipeline, and a Bank loan of $90 million (Loan
2184-TH) to help finance a gas separation plant and marketing facilities was
signed on August 17, 1982. It is expected that by 1990, about 40% of EGAT-s
projected total generation of 32,950 GWh would be from thermal stations using
natural gas, thereby reducing substantially the demand for fuel oil.
Oil
1.03      The exploration for oil in Thailand has recently led to improved
expectations of domestic oil production beyond what was thought possible
during the preparation of the Fifth Plan. Current finds are all in Northern
Thailand. Three small oil fields in the Fang area currently yield about
400 bpd, while production at Sirikit is expected to begin in 1983 at a rate of
5,000 bpd, increasing to 8,000 bpd by the! end of 1983, and to 17,000 bpd by
1986. Subject to positive results elsewhere in the concession production
may reach 50,000 bpd by late 1990s.  Finally, oil shae deposits have been



2-
found in Tak province near the Burmese border, which could yield an
estimated 10 million tons of oil. The Department of Mineral Resources, with
the assistance of the German Government, has initiated studies to determine
the technical feasibility and economic viability of developing these oil
shale resources. At present prices, however, oil shale development is
unlikely to be economically viable.
Lignite Reserves
1.04      Substantial increases in Thailand-s lignite deposits have been
indicated by recent drillings. Lignite is relatively uneconomical to trans-
port because of its high moisture and ash content, while :Lts tendency to
decompose and self-ignite in open air makes it unsafe to store. Hence, in
Thailand as elsewhere, lignite is used almost exclusively for large-scale
power generation at the mine site. The present lignite reserves totalling
770 million metric tons (mt) are located at Mae Moh (650 million mt), Krabi
(100 million mt), and Li (20 million mt). Of the reserves at Mae Moh, 350
million mt are proven and probable reserves, sufficient to sustain a total
generating capacity of about 1,725 MW for about 25 years. It is estimated
that by 1990, about 25% of EGAT's total generation would be from lignite
fired thermal stations.
Hydro Potential
1.05      The total hydropotential of Thailand's rivers is estimated at about
9,300 MW, not including the international rivers (Mekong aLnd Salween), whose
development of 25,000 MW is currently beyond reach due to major political
and social obstacles. About 1,380 MW of hydropower are now in operation,
2,100 MW are under construction, and about 2,500 MW in 25 projects are at a
stage of identification or feasibility study. Mini-hydro potential is
estimated at about 3,290 MW at over one hundred sites. According to current
plans, hydropower production will increase at an average annual rate of
about 13% between 1981 and 1995.
Other Energy Resources
1.06      Thailand's other energy resources include fuelwood and possibly
geothermal energy. Fuelwood resources, once plentiful, are rapidly
depleting and deforestation is becoming a serious problem. Geothermal
exploration is being carried out by EGAT in the northern part of Thailand
near Chiangmai.
Energy Supply Alternatives
1.07      Prospects for reducing Thailand's dependence on imported energy in
the 1980s are good, at least for its electricty sector. The Government's
policy is to reduce Thailand-s dependence on imported energy by (a) develop-
ing indigenous energy resources such as natural gas, lignite and hydro potenr-
tial; (b) pursuing a rational pricing policy; and (c) conservation programs.



-3-
Based on the development of natural gas and lignite resources proven to date
and on the continued expansion of its hydro potential, Thailand should be
able to reduce its share of imported energy for the electricity sector from
about 71% in FY81 to less than 20% in FY90. However, without a substantial
increase in the natural gas and lignite reserves or the development of
international hydro potential, Thailand will re-emerge in the 1990s as a
major importer of energy for its power sector. In the other large energy
consuming sectors, i.e., transportation and industry, the prospects for
converting to other forms of energy are rather limited in the near term.
Thus, there is a need to focus on curtailing energy demands and encouraging
greater energy conservation.
C. Energy Investment Program.
1.08      The Thai Government reacted in recent years to the growing energy
demands of the Thai economy, the increased cost of foreign supplies, and the
discovery of domestic energy resources by rapidly expanding its expenditure,
especially capital spending, in the energy sector. This expansion has been
particularly rapid since 1980, with the result that energy is now the
single most important sector for public spending, having increased its share
of total public expenditure from 12.5% in 1977 to 22.1% in 1981. For the
Fifth Plan period, NESDB projects that the energy sector will contribute
about 26% to total governmental spending, up from the average of 18% during
the Fourth Plan period. Energy sector spending weighs even more heavily
in total public investment, reaching a share of 31.9% in 1981, up from 13.5%
in 1970 and 13.7% in 1977. As a percent of state enterprise investment,
the energy sector enterprises have in recent years accounted for more than
50% and are expected to do so during the Fifth Plan period. Four agencies
in particular have contributed the bulk of these investments: EGAT accounted
for 55-75% of total public investment in the energy sector, MEA for 5-15%,
and PEA for 10-25%.  PTT-s investments were minor as recently as 1979, but
were very sizable in 1980 and 1981, when they accounted for almost a quarter
of total public investments in the energy sector in connection with the
construction of the gas pipeline. For the Fifth Plan period, EGAT is
expected to retain its large share in energy spending, with PTT continuing
to grow in importance as it is involved in further gas and oil development
and utilization projects.
D. Role of the Power Sector in the Economy
1.09      Electricity revenue accounts for only about 1.9% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 20.8% and 1.7% of GDP respectively.
1.10      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Thailand's
economic development. Between FY76 and 81, when GDP grew at an average rate
of about 7.3% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an average
rate of about 9.9%.

E. The Power Sector Organization
General
1.11      The power sector consists of eight government agencies (para.
1.18), three state utilities, the ministries to which they report, and four
small private franchises (para. 1.17). The three state utLilities supply
nearly all of the electricity consumed in the country, the private
franchises and self-generating industries represented 12.9% of the installed
capacity in FY81 (Table 1.1).
1.12      The state-owned utilities are EGAT, the Metropo:Litan Electricity
Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Highlights
of the EGAT, MEA and PEA operations are shown in Annex 1.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
1.13      EGAT was established in 1968 as a wholly-owned Government corpora-
tion for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of electricity supply
throughout the country and coordinating the generation and transmission
systems and is responsible to the Prime Minister's Office. EGAT generated
94.6% of all electric energy in Thailand in FY81; the balance was generated
by PEA, NEA, private franchises and self-generating industries and a small
amount was purchased from Laos and Malaysia.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
1.14      MEA was established in 1958 as a wholly-owned Government corpora-
tion under the Ministry of Interior with responsibility for supplying elec-
tricity to the Bangkok Metropolitan Area covering the provinces of Bangkok,
Thon Buri, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In FY81, 8,182 GW'h were sold to
793,000 consumers. Compared with FY80, energy sales and number of consumers
increased by 4.0% and 7.4% respectively. Distribution losses were about
3.7% in FY81. All of MEA's power is purchased from EGAT. The Bank has
never been asked to assist MEA, as foreign funds requirements were provided
by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and commercial banks, in the past.
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
1.15      PEA was established in September 1960 as a wholly-owned Government
corporation under the Ministry of Interior with responsibility for providing
and distributing electricity in all provinces of the country except in the
areas served by MEA. PEA purchases most of its energy in bulk from EGAT but
also generates small quantities in areas not yet connected to the grid. In
FY81, PEA purchased 5,761 GWh and generated 45 GWh; 5,210 GWh were sold to
2.3 million consumers.  Compared with FY80, GWh sold and the number of con-
sumers connected increased by 11.0% and 20.4%, respectively. System losses
were about 10.2% in FY81. This is acceptable considering the size and load
density of its service areas.



- 5 -
1.16       PEA is the Government agency responsible for implementing the
accelerated rural electrification program (para. 1.29). The program only
substantially began with Loan 1527-TH made by the Bank to PEA in 1978 for the
first major phase which will provide electricity to about 4,560 villages by
the end of 1983. Another loan (1871-TH) was made in 1980 to assist in the
electrification of about 7,800 villages by 1986.
Private Franchises
1.17       Following the fuel crisis and the Goverrment's policy of restrict-
ing tariff increases, most of the franchises asked to be taken over by PEA.
Since FY76, 52 franchises have been purchased leaving four in private hands
at the end of FY81; two of them purchase their power needs in bulk from PEA
and one directly from EGAT. The remaining franchise had an installed
capacity of only 18 KW and generated 11.5 MWh in FY81.
Government Agencies
1.18       Eight Government agencies which have a direct interest in the
power sector: Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD); Budget
Bureau; Tariff Rate Committee (TRC); National Economic and Social Development
Board (NESDB); Ministry of Finance (MOF); National Energy Administration
(NEA); Foreign Loan Committee (FLC); and Petroleum Authority of Thailand
(PTT). These agencies review: tariff recommendations; capital project
proposals and budgets for submission to the Council of Ministers; annual
financial performance; and requests for Government equity and loans. None
of them has overall policy responsibility; decisions on the sector are
arrived at after all the agencies including the state utilities reach a
consensus. The system is designed to ensure that sector capital expenditures
are rigidly controlled. The interest of PTT in the sector arises from the
fact that EGAT, as the utility responsible for generation, will be for some
time to come, the predominant customer for natural gas and is the largest
customer for fuel oil.
F. Power Sector Coordination
1.19       Coordination among the different government agencies concerned
with the electricity subsector is achieved through close working relation-
ships promoted by two separate arrangements. The first is the Load Forecast
Working Group, made up of representatives from the NESDB, the NEA, EGAT, PEA
and MEA. The working group ensures that the subsector market development
and the utilities' investment program requried to support it are consistent
iP size, technical characteristics and timing. The second arrangement is
manifested by the current procedure for setting electricity rates whereby
attention is given to the cross-funding necessary to ensure that each
utility generates an adequate proportion of its capital investment and to
prevent cash imbalances among EGAT, PEA and MEA.

1.20      The Government has been promoting further subsector coordination
in other ways. In 1977, the CPPD was formed to oversee the functioning and
development of the subsector and to provide overall coordination. In
recognition of the importance of energy issues, the Ministry'of Science,
Energy and Technology was established in 1979. Coordination in the power
subsector is satisfactory while possibilities for further strengthening of
policy coordination of the energy sector as a whole are being pursued
through continuing dialogue with the Government and under the Structural
Adjustment loans to Thailand.
G. Tariff Levels
1.21      Tariff levels were adequate throughout the late 1960s and the early
1970s, and the financial position of the sector remained strong. During
that period, the electricity sector enjoyed substantial economies of scale
through shifts to hydroelectric and large steam generation coupled with
rapid increases in the demand and number of consumers. Tariffs were reduced
from time to time during these years. However, the fuel crisis and economic
slowdown of 1973/74 necessitated large increases in tariffs, but only par-
tial adjustments were politically feasible.
1.22      Severe droughts in 1977 and 1978 adversely affected the thermal/
hydro generation mix, while in 1979 fuel oil prices increased some 115%.
In an attempt to prevent higher energy costs from accelerating inflation,
the Government chose to delay passing the rising costs of electricity to
consumers. By mid-1979, the Government, faced with mounting criticism of
its handling of the economy, introduced direct budgetary subsidies on elec-
tricity tariffs, costing an estimated $9.0 million a month. In 1980, how-
ever, the government agreed to a Plan of Action to remove subsidies and
restore the sector's financial viability, in connection with EGAT-s Mae Moh
Lignite Project (Loan 1852-TH). This plan was implemented through a
surcharge for heavy consumers established in August 1980 and tariff
increases in October 1980, January 1981 and April 1981. Thus, despite a
difficult political climate and rapid inflation, the Government implemented
overall increases in EGAT's electricity tariff of 158% between February 1980
and April 1981, and eliminated oil subsidies.
1.23      The present tariff structure contains a substantial subsidy from
large consumers in favor of small consumers. Although in general this is
desirable, tariffs for lower brackets group of residential consumers are
unnecessarily low. As mentioned in para. 5.02, this is affecting PEA's
earning power. Both PEA and the Government are aware of this situation.
A Subcommittee on Tariff Structure was formed recently to look into this
matter. It is expected that adjustments will be gradually introduced as
the political and social realities of the country allow thLem.

H. Bank Participation in the Sector
1.24      The Bank has made two loans totalling US$100 million to PEA to
finance its Accelerated Rural Electrification Projects, and eleven loans to
EGAT and its predecessor totalling US$542 million to help finance power
plants and transmission facilities. Another loan of US$72 million (Loan
1852-TH, Mae Moh Lignite Project) was made to EGAT in June 1980 for lignite
production. The first eight projects made to EGAT have been completed and
are operating satisfactorily. The Ninth Power Project (Loan 1690-TH, 550 MW
Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project) is about 46% complete. The Tenth Power
Project (Loan 1770-TH, Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project) is about 43%
complete. The last loan (US$100 million) to EGAT was the Power Subsector
Project (Loan 2000-TH) which was approved by the Bank on May 21, 1981 and
became effective on October 26, 1981. PEA's first Accelerated Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 1527-TH) of $25.0 million became effective in
June 7, 1978. Of a total of 4,560 villages, 2,970 have been electrified and
in another 1,060 villages construction and installation work has started. A
loan of US$75 million for PEA's Second Accelerated Rural Electrification
Project (Loan 1871-TH) was made in FY80 but did not become effective until
August 20, 1981 due to delays in complying with cross-effectiveness
requirements with co-lenders. The project will cover about 7,800 villages;
construction has started in the first 480 villages. Continuation of Bank
financial assistance to PEA's development program is considered necessary to
pursue the support to improvements in PEA's operation.
I. Power Market and Supply
1.25      Annex 1 presents the highlights of EGAT, PEA and MEA operations.
As shown in Table 1.1, at the end of FY81 EGAT represented about 83% of the
country-s generating capacity.

1.26      From the viewpoint of sources of electricity (Table 1.2), in FY81
thermal plants represented more than half of Thailand's installed capacity
and generated three fourths of the total electricity available. About 71%
of the electricity generated during FY81 came from imported sources of
energy.

1.27      Total electricity consumption was 13,845 GWh in FY81 or 289 kWh per
capita; 3,192.6 GWh (23.0%) were used by residential consumers; 1,564.4 GWh
(11.3%) by commercial consumers; 8,968.1 Gwh (64.8%) by industrial consumers
and 119.9 GWh (0.9%) by street lighting and others. Total losses were about
17.9% including station services.
J. Degree of Electrification
1.28      Regional imbalances exist in the degree of electrification as well
as in per capita consumption as presented in Table 1.3.

/a  Including self-generating industries and private franchises.
K. Rural Electrification
1.29      Provision of power to the provincial areas began on a planned
basis only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. Since 1969 the number of
consumers increased at an annual average rate of 14.6% and the energy sales
rose by 19.7% p.a. The proportion of population electrified in PEA's area
increased from 9.5% in 1968 to 35.7% in 1981. PEA expects this rapid growth
rate to continue for some time due to its large village electrification
program and the acceleration in conversion of diesel engines to electric
power brought about by increases in fuel prices and shortages of diesel fuel.
1.30      RTG directed PEA to plan an Accelerated Rural Electrification
Program in 1973 and to give priority to the more backward areas. The annual
rate of villages connected rose from 940 in 1974 to 5,155 in 1981. In accor-
dance with the directive, PEA originally planned to electrify most of the
villages in Thailand in about 25 years but now plans to do so by the late
1980s. In view of the magnitude of PEA-s rural electrification programs now
under implementation, this target is believed to be feasible. It is
expected that by 1985 and 1988 respectively, PEA's peak demand and energy
sales will exceed those of MEA, reflecting the progress made in the
provincial areas in general and in rural electrification in particular.



- 10 -
L. Project Performance Audits
1.31      To date no project performance audit reports (PPAR) have been pre-
pared in respect to PEA's operations. PPARs have been prepared on three of
the early loans to EGAT, the First Power Project (Loan 65i5-TH), the South
Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH) and the Ban Chao Nen
(Srinagarind) Hydroelectric Project (Loan 977-TH). The PPARs concluded that
the major objectives of the project had been met. EGAT complied with all
the covenants, and its financial performance was satisfactory.
1.32      PEA has conducted its own post-evaluation of two projects already
completed (not financed by the Bank). Both projects met or exceeded their
objective and had Economic Rates of Return in excess of 23%.
II. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower would be PEA, established in September 1960 under
the Provincial Electricity Act (BE2503) as a state enterprise reporting to
the Ministry of Interior. PEA is responsible for the distribution of
electricity throughout the country except in the Metropolitan Bangkok area
which is served by MEA. At the end of FY81, PEA had 965 offices grouped in
twelve regional areas. In FY81 96% of PEA energy requirements were
purchased from EGAT, about 3% from MEA and NEA and the balance generated
from diesel plants.
A. Organization and Management
2.02      PEA's Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers
and consists of up to nine members. For its operations, PEA is organized
into three functional areas: Administration, Operations and Techniques,
each headed by a Deputy General Manager. In addition, there is a small
staff of senior officials who act as assistants to the General Manager.
Annex 2 presents PEA's organization chart.
2.03      During the past five years PEA has experienced a rapid growth.
The number of customers has more than doubled, the annual investment program
has increased threefold and revenues from sales in FY81 were about four
times those of FY77. It is expected that this pace will continue in the
coming four or five years in order to meet the RTG rural electrification
targets.
2.04      Early in 1982 PEA retained a group of professors from a local
university to prepare a diagnosis of its operations and to indicate the
adjustments required to improve PEA's efficiency in handling its growing
volume of activity. The diagnosis, in summary, shows that PEA needs to
take actions to:



- 11 -
(a) strengthen the corporate planning system;
(b) modernize procedures for planning, purchasing and controlling
construction materials;
(c) improve coordination in project planning and implementation;
(d) modernize the billing and collection procedures and improve
cash management;
(e) strengthen and expand PEA's internal controls;
(f) improve budgeting and planning procedures; and
(g) modernize the electronic data processing equipment and expand
its applications.
2.05      As part of the project, PEA is taking action to introduce adjust-
ments in its operations to improve its efficiency (para. 4.14).
B. Manpower and Training
2.06      PEA personnel is experienced and well qualified.  Table 2.1 shows
the growth of staff and the break-down by academic qualifications during the
last five years. Although the number of employees has grown at about the
same rate as the number of customers, the sales per employee has decreased
slightly reflecting the characteristics of PEA's expansion program.
2.07      PEA operates a modest training center which in FY81 trained about
1,100 lower level staff. In addition, staff is trained in local and foreign
universities. PEA is aware that, as the butlk of its rural electrification
is completed in 1986-87, its main activity will shift from construction to
operation and maintenance. This change will be reflected in the require-
ments of PEA's work force. The Bank has provided guidance to PEA on the
preparation of a training program which is expected to be part of PEA's
institutional development program (para. 4.14).

C. Billing and Collections
2.08      Billing is made in the 12 regional offices usirLg electric
accounting machines which, although efficiently operated, lack the required
memory to properly record accounts receivable and are slow for the present
volume of operations. A mini-computer is planned to be installed in Chiang
Mai as a pilot project to develop procedures to modernize PEA's billing
system. PEA-s collections are efficient. Accounts receivable at the end of
FY81 represented 42 days of billings in spite of the slow collection from
Government entities. During negotiations, the Government agreed to make
arrangements for the prompt payment of electricity bills rendered by PEA to
its departments and agencies.
D. Accounting and Audit
2.09      The accounting system is adequate and the staff are competent.
Accounting is carried out centrally in Bangkok, supported by 12 regional
accounting centers.
2.10      PEA'a accounts are audited by the National Audit Council (NAC),
the government entity responsible for auditing all state enterprises in
Thailand. In 1979 the Bank reviewed the auditing standards of the NAC as
applied to PEA. Most of the recommendations made at that time have been
implemented. Nevertheless, there are translation difficulties which have
resulted in delays in the presentation of the auditors reports to the Bank
and lack of clarity in some portions of the same. This situation will be
followed closely in the future to determine if alternative arrangements are
needed.



- 13 -
2.11      The head of the internal audit office reports directly to the
general manager. It is expected that as part of the activities mentioned in
para. 4.14, PEA will review its internal control procedures in order to
bring them in line with the present complexity of its operations.
E. Taxes
2.12      PEA pays custom duties (from 8% t:o 40%) on imported material and
equipment. Its Act also provides that any surplus funds be remitted to
Government in lieu of corporate tax. Due to the size of PEA's investment
program and its needs for funds, PEA has not made any remittances and is not
expected to do so in the future.
F. Insurance
2.13      PEA carries adequate insurance protection against fire for
buildings and their contents. No third party liability insurance is
carried.  This is the generalized practice in most public enterprises in
Thailand and given the characteristics of the risk for PEA it is
acceptable. Insurance policies are reviewed and updated once a year.
G. Existinig Facilities
2.14      The energy sold to PEA from EGAT's 81 substations is distributed
by PEA in 69 provinces by a radial type of distribution system of 11, 22 and
33 kV design. PEA steps the high tension voltage down to low tension at
400/230 volt, 3-phase, 4-wire; 230 volt, 1-phase, 2 wire or 460/230, 1
phase, 3-wire (including one neutral) for supplying the energy to
customers. Medium sized business and industrial loads are supplied at the
voltage level of 11, 22 or 33 kV.
2.15      At the end of FY81, the electric distribution systems in PEA
service areas totaled 50,650 circuit-km of primary distribution lines and
3,538 MVA of transformer capacity.
III. PEA's POWER MARKET

3.02       PEA's power market has had a long history of rapid growth, the
average annual increase in peak demand and energy sales being 16% and 19.7%,
respectively, over the period FY70-81. Growth was stimulated by an expanding
economy and Government's emphasis on improving the standard of living in
the rural areas. A breakdown of PEA's sales is shown in Table 3.1 and PEA's
growth rates in energy sales and peak demand are presented in Table 3.2.
Annex 3 presents the historical evolution of PEA's market by type of
consumption as well as the growth of different groups of customers.

B. PEA's Load Forecast
3.03       PEA's load -orecast is normally reviewed at least once a year.  It
is derived from a study of trend analysis of sales to different categories
of consumers, market surveys of new industries and the rural electrification
program. The review is carried out by the Load Forecast Working Group
(LFWG) which is chaired by NESDB and consist of Representatives of NEA and
the three utilities.
3.04       The Bank considered that the June 1982 forecast prepared by
the LFWG did not fully take into account the recent demand slowdown.
Accordingly, it was revised slightly downwards. The revised forecast is
summarized in Table 3.3 and presented in detail in Annex 3.

3.05      PEA's energy sales and peak demand are expected to increase from
5,842 GWh and 1,364 MW in FY82 to 14,963 GWh and 3,311 MW in FY91 at an
average annual growth rate of 11.0% and 10.3%, respectively.
C. Project's Load Forecast
3.06       The load forecast for project villages under the proposed
Provincial Power Distribution Project based on estimated energy requirements
for households, small business, rice mills, water works and street lighting
is summarized in Table 3.4 and is available in detail in the Project File.
These estimates were derived from the existing backlog of applications for
the Normal Rural Electrification Program (NREP) (para. 4.13) and the
experience gained from on-going projects.

3.07      Energy requirements in the project villages are expected to
increase from about 19 GWh in FY 1983 to 1,498 GWh in FY 2012, an average
annual growth rate of 16%; and peak demand from about 20 MW in FY 1983 to
about 580 MW in FY 2012, an average annual growth rate of 12.4%. Growth is
expected to be rapid in the early years and would then taper off as connec-
tion of the majority of the premises (about 80% of households) is achieved
by FY 1993.
IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. PEA's Development Strategy
4.01      PEA's electrification strategy envisages development of the sector
in four consecutive stages: L.ist to electrify provincial centers and major
cities; second district centers; third, TAMBON /1 centers and fourth rural
villages. The first two stages are completed and an effort is now being
directed towards the last two. At the end of FY81 about 24,000 (46%) out of
a total of 52,000 villages had electricity.
/1 Thailand's lowest administrative unit consisting of a group of
villages.



- 18 -
4.02      In developing its system PEA undertakes two groups of activities:
(a)  the Power Distribution System Reinforcement program, to
improve the capacity and reliability of the backbone distribution
system; and
(b)  the Village Electrification Programs, to extend the electric
services to the population in rural areas.
4.03      There are three types of village electrification programs currently
being carried out by PEA: (a) Projects prepared to address the need for
electrification on a regional basis, PEA selects the villages to be electri-
fied under each particular project. This group includes the First and Second
Accelerated Rural Electrification Projects (ARE I, ARE II) and the Village
Electrification Project (VEP); (b) the TAMIBON project (TEP) is intended to
give power to all TAMBON headquarters and surrounding villages that can be
connected at a reasonable cost; and (c) the Normal Rural Electrification
Program (NREP), carried out by the regional offices connecting villages
which are not included in other programs and request to be electrified. In
addition, the NREP extends the electric services to groups of households in
villages partially electrified under other projects.
4.04      In the past, the extension of PEA-s system has been carried out
on a piecemeal basis under different projects. As part of a program for
institutional development, PEA is planning to start a process of modernizing
its Distribution System Planning in order to improve reliability, safety and
economy (para 4.14).
B. PEA's Development Program
4.05      Under the National Plan for Total Electrification of Thailand,
approved by the Council of Ministers on August 28, 1973 PEA orginally planned
to electrify all villages in Thailand in about 25 years. Later PEA embarked
on a greatly accelerated program which plans to reach most villages by the
late 1980s. A summary of the projects undertaken by PEA is presented in
Annex 4 and PEA's Village Electrification Program is shown in Table 4.1, and
Map IBRD 16683 shows the regional distribution of PEA's rural electrification
projects.

4.06      While the NREP and the TAMBON project cover all regions of Thailand,
the ARF projects are geographically oriented. ARE I primarily covers the
16 provinces in the Northeast and four other sample provinces; ARE II includes
the 16 provinces in the South, five provinces in the North and six provinces
in the Central and Eastern Regions. The NREP complements other rural
electrification projects by extending electric services to villages which were
not included in those projects.
C. The Project
Background
4.07      In 1964 PEA introduced a scheme by which villages that requested to
be electrified should provide electric poles, cross arms and half of the
labor needed. This became known as the Normal Rural Electrification Program



- 20 -
(NREP) (para. 4.03). Tn recent years the practice has been for the villages
to make a monetary contribution equivalent to those materials and labor,
which facilitates compliance with technical specifications. This
contribution represents about 25% to 30% of the project cost.  The balance
was originally financed from government budget contributions. Later it was
decided that subsidized domestic loans from the Krung Thai Bank and the
Ministry of Finance to PEA should replace such grants.
4.08       The NREP is open-ended since it depends on applications from
villages from all over the country. It complements other rural electrifica-
tion projects. Typically villages under the NREP were not originally included
in other on-going programs because, at that time, they were too distant from
the grid. However, since the transmission lines have been extended through
different schemes, the electrification of these villages has become feasible.
4.09       During the last 4 years the NREP has electrified close to 9,000
villages and extended electric service in another 2,000 partially electrified
villages.
4.10       In recent years, the demand for electrification under the NREP has
increased but the availability to PEA of local loans, the major traditional
source of financing for the NREP, has become scarce. In view of this, PEA
structured a five-year programr (1983 to 1987) which would facilitate access
to foreign sources of financing. Following the advise of the National
economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the programa was divided in two
phases. The first phase, to be implemented from 1983 to 1986 is expected to
cover about 3,000 unelectrified villages and the extension of electric
service in another 3,000 partially electrified villages. The second phase
would electrify about 2,000 villages, expand the electric service in 2,000
other villages and would be implemented from 1985 to 1987. To reduce its
financial cost, PEA decided to divide the First Phase into two identical
projects to be implemented in parallel and to request the Bank to finance one
of them and the OECF of Japan to finance the other.  (OECF interest rate is
3.0% p.a. with a repayment period of 30 years including 10 years grace
period).
Description
4.11       The proposed project has two parts.  Part A, as explained above,
constitutes the electrification of about 1,500 new villages and the
extension of electricity to another 1,500 partially electrified villages.
Part B, described in para. 4.14, includes the implementatlon of a group of
actions for strengthening PEA-s operations.
PART A - Village Electrification
4.12       The number of villages, extensions and households under IBRD and
OECF projects and by phases are shown in Table 4.2.  The estimated

Subproject Selection Criteria
4.13       The following criteria was agreed during negotiations for selecting
the villages to be financed under the proposed loan. Subprojects with an
investment cost per connection equal to or less than the average investment
cost of all the different rural electrification projects now being undertaken
by PEA would be eligible for financing under the project. This average
investment cost is about B/.8,000 ($348) per connection at 1982 prices and
would be adjusted yearly for inflation. Subprojects exceeding that average
cost could be accepted provided they have an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of
not less than 10%. (PEA has developed a computer program to calculate the ERR
using the information routinely collected at the time of processing the
applications from the villages.) A preliminary review indicates that of the
present backlog of 7,640 applications, (see Annex 6), about 5,400 villages
have a cost per connection lower than B/.8,000).

Part B -  Strengthening of PEA's Operations
4.14       Part B of the project includes the implementation of a group of
actions aimed at strengthening and modernizing PEA's operations as mentioned
in paras. 2.04, 2.07 and 4.04. As a step in this direction, PEA has
prepared, in cooperation with the Bank, terms of reference to retain
consultants to assist PEA in four main areas of activities as follows:
(a) preparation of an Operations Development Program, aimed at
improving PEA's corporate planning, modernization of its
procedures for materials management and improvement in the
effectiveness of its project planning and implementation
(para. 2.04);



- 23 -
(b) review of PEA's electronic data processing activities in order
to modernize them and to expand its applications;
(c)  preparation of a Training Program to help develop PEA's staff and
to make the necessary adjustments in PEA's manpower in response
to the changing role of the organization (para. 2.07); and
(d) preparation of a Distribution System Planning Program to improve
the reliability, safety and economy of PEA's distribution network
(para. 4.04);
4.15      It is envisaged that the consultants will work closely with PEA's
staff. Also, during the implementation process a good amount of training on
the job is expected.
4.16      The consultants cost is estimated at US$1.0 million.  It provides
for 108 man-months of consulting services. The average man-months cost,
including salary, costs, fees, international travel and subsistence is
US$9,200. PEA has requested a grant equivalent to US$1.0 million from the
Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB). The Australian Government
has approved in principle this cofinancing.
4.17      During negotiations PEA agreed that in the unlikely event that by
September 30, 1983, the grant from ADAB has not materialized, PEA will
furnish to the Bank, by December 31, 1983, for Bank comments, a Plan of
Action. Such Plan would contain the alternate arrangements for introducing
the necessary adjustments in PEA-s operations to improve its overall
efficiency. PEA also agreed that in such event, the Plan of Action would be
carried out in a timely manner, taking into account the Bank's comments.
Cost Estimate
4.18      The cost estimate for the NRE Program was derived from the analysis
of the existing backlog of applications for which surveys and cost estimates
have been prepared. Table 4.4 presents the total financing required for the
project, including the front-end fee on Bank loan. Annex 7 presents total
estimated costs for both Phase I and II.

4.19      Physical contingencies were assumed to be about 8% based on PEA's
past experiences in distribution projects. Price contingencies for foreign
costs were derived by applying the following annual rates of escalation: 8%
for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985, and 6% for 1986 and thereafter. The
price contingencies for local costs were assumed to be 7% for 1983, 1984, and
1985, and 6% for 1986 and thereafter. Price contingencies represent about 20%
of basic cost, including physical contingencies. It is PEA's policy not to
capitalize interest during construction due to the usually short construction
period of its projects. The total cost, excluding taxes and duties, estimated
at B 77.5 million (US$3.3 million), is B 1,109.1 million (US$48.3 million).
Financing Plan
4.20      The proposed Bank loan of US$30.6 million would finance the foreign
cost of Part A of the project and the front-end fee. The cost of consultancy
services for Part B of the Project, estimated at US$1.0 million, will be
financed by the ADAB (para. 4.16). The local cost of US$20 million would be
financed from consumers' contributions in an amount estimated to be US$12.6
million and the balance from PEA's internally generated funds.
4.21      The proposed Bank loan is equivalent to 59% of the total financing
requirements. During negotiations it was agreed that front--end fee will be
capitalized. Villages customarily pay their contribution to PEA at the time
their applications are approved. These conl:ributions are normally collected
by the village headman from the potential initial customers, historically
about 60% of the total number of households.
Implementation
4.22      As mentioned in para. 4.10, the new villages to be electrified under
the First Phase of the NREP as well as the extensions to households in
villages already partially electrified, are intended to be distributed in two
projects by equal parts for financing by the Bank and OECF. Under this
arrangement each party would help finance the electrification of about 1,500
unelectrified villages and extensions in another 1,500 partially electrified
villages (see Table 4.2).
4.23      The planning, engineering and construction of the project will be
coordinated by PEA's Project and Planning Division and the subprojects will
be implemented by the regional offices. To avoid initial delays in the
starting of t-he project construction PEA is preparing the necessary actions
to ensure the availability of human resources and equipment in the provinces
where the project will be implemented. Procurement is expected to start
in June 1983 and construction will begin in January 1984, using materials
from PEA-s inventories if necessary. The total implementation period will be
from mid-1983 through December 1986 (see Annex 8 for implementation schedule).



- 26 -
4.24      Most of the distribution lines would follow main or village roads.
For lines which cross private land no compensation is pa:Ld although such
compensation is provided for in PEA's Act, as the experience has been that
villagers welcome the provision of electric services. PEA has experienced
little difficulty in obtaining easements over farmland.
Procurement
4.25      Except for concrete poles and minor items, all equipment and
materials to be financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines. A preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price of iimported goods, or
the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to quali-
fied local manufacturers. Local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to
the Bank would be applied to: (a) concrete poles (as shipping charges would
not warrant concrete poles being procured internationally); and (b) other
minor items costing less than $100,000 each and up to an aggregate amount of
$2.5 million. Bidding packages for equipment and materiaLls over $500,000
will be reviewed and commented on in advance by the Bank.
Disbursement
4.26      Disbursement from the proposed loan would be made against:
(a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment
and materials;
(b) 100% of ex-factory cost for equipment and material manufactured
locally;
(c) 65% of total expenditures for imported equipment and materials
procured locally; and
(d) 47% of total expenditures ex-factory for concrete poles.
Since the proposed loan will finance a time-slice of an on-going program,
there are no disbursement profiles available that could be compared with the
one prepared for the proposed loan. The disbursement schedule presented in
Annex 9 was derived on the basis of the Implementation Schedule (Annex 8)
and PEA-s experience with on-going projects. The closing date of the loan
would be June 30, 1987.
Monitoring
4.27      PEA has established an effective system to moniltor its investment
in the two Accelerated Rural Electrification projects and to assess the
impact of such projects in the electrified villages. A similar system will
be used to monitor the proposed project. Details on PEA's monitoring system
are presented in Annex 10.



- 27 -
Risks
4.28      The project risks are acceptable.  The two accelerated Rural
Electrification projects financed by the Bank faced start-up delays.
Nevertheless, since the NREP is an on-going program, such delays are less
likely to occur. The sensitivity analysis shows that if project _osts
increase by 20% the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) would be reduced from 14%
to 12%. On the other hand, if benefits are reduced by 20% (due to less than
expected connection rate, load or savings) the ERR would be 11%.
Environmental Effects
4.29      The project is not expected to cause any significant environmental
problem.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  PEA's Financial Performance FY77 through FY81
5.01      As shown in Table 5.1, during the past five years PEA's revenues
increased rapidly at an annual average rate of 38% reflecting the expansion
of PEA's market and the large tariff adjustments implemented in FY80 and
FY81. This increase in revenues was largely offset by a substantial
increase in the cost of power purchased from EGAT which grew at an annual
average rate of 50%.  This and the fact that PEA's yearly investment trebled
during the period, explains the downward trend of PEA's rate of return
(Table 5.1) and self-financing ratio (Table 5.2).

- 28 -
5.02      It is also worth noting that PEA's operating cost per connection
increased to match the revenue from electricity sales per connection by
FY81, as shown at the bottom of Table 5.1. This is the result of PEA's
expansion into the rural market where customers are main:Ly in the lower
tariff brackets. In other words, during the past few years, in order to
produce a positive net income, PEA has relied mainly on revenues from
sources other than its electricity sales such as installation and inspection
fees, construction for customers, interest, etc.
5.03      To complement its internally generated funds, (luring the period
under consideration PEA made extensive use of its borrowing capacity and
relied on some contributions from consumers. Equity contributions from the
Government were limited as shown in Table 5.2.
5.04      PEA has customarily relied largely on soft foreign loans from the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, the Kreditanstalt Fur
Wiederaufbau (KFW) of West Germany, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (KFAED), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OEEC) Fund for
International Development. In addition, the Government h,as subsidized the
interest rate paid by PEA on domestic loans, mainly from the Ministry of
Finance and the Krung Thai Bank.

5.05      This conservative financing policy is reflected in a debt service
coverage ratio which, although declining, has remained above 1.6. During the
period PEA's long-term debt as a percentage of its capital structure was
always below 41%. (See Table 5.3.)

5.06      During the past five years PEA's current ratio exceeded 1.3 at all
times. However, the quick ratio (current ratio excluding inventories) has
been declining reflecting the large accumulation of inventories. At the end
of FY81 PEA's inventory was equivalent to 17 months of investment. This is
considered on the high side. In addition,, the inventory is not properly
balanced presenting shortages of some key materials. PEA expects to
modernize its materials management systems as part of the program for
strengthening its operations (para. 4.14).
5.07      Detailed historical financial sltatements are presented in Annex
11.
B. Future Profitability
5.08      A summary of PEA's projected income statement is presented in
Table 5.4. PEA's rate of return on net revalued assets for FY82 is
estimated at 7.3%.

/a Including depreciation on revalued assets.
5.09       Present covenants require EGAT and the sector to produce rates of
return on net revalued fixed assets of not less than 2% in FY81 and 8% in
FY82 and thereafter, and PEA to earn rates of return consistent with the
sector-s requirements. In FY81 the sector rate of return was 8.8% and
EGAT's was 8.3%. It is now estimated that for FY82 the rates of return
for ECAT and the sector will be 9.2% and 8.9% respectively. These covenants
as applicable to future years will be continued in the proposed loan. Under
the assumptions followed, the covenanted rates of return can be accomplished
with modest tariff increases (para. 5.14). PEA would need to generate funds
equivalent to a rate of return of about 6% during the period FY83 through
FY86 to meet its financial requirements in terms of operating expenditures,
investment, debt service and liquidity. After FY86, when the investment
program is expected to be substantially smaller, PEA's cash generation
requirements will decrease gradually.
5.10      The financial projections assume that some cross-funding will take
place among EGAT, PEA and MEA by EGAT charging higher bulk tariffs to MEA
than to PEA.
C. Tariffs
5.11      PEA's Act provides that the Board of Directors has the power to
fix the rates it charges for electricity. In practice, the Cabinet decides
on the tariff adjustments, based on the recommendations of the Tariff Rate
Committee. Under previous loans it was agreed to incorporate a fuel/power
purchase cost adjustment clause in the Sector's and PEA-s tariff schedules.
Such clause will be repeated in the proposed loan.



- 31 -
5.12      Tariffs were increased in February 1980 and, on the basis of a
Plan of Action agreed under Loan 1852-TH, were further adjusted on October
1, 1980, January 9, 1981 and April 1, 1981. In addition, a surcharge for
heavy consumers was established in August 1980. These tariff adjustments
represent an increase of about 158% between February 1980 and April 1981 on
the tariffs charged by EGAT to PEA, MEA and large direct consumers; 111% for
PEA's consumers and 131% for users in MEA's service area. To reflect the
recent drop in oil prices, minor reductions (about Baht 0.02 per kWh) in
some categories of consumers were introduced in April 1, 1983.
5.13      Under Loan 1871-TH PEA agreed to review by April 30 every year the
adequacy of its tariffs to produce the required rate of return. Similarly,
under Loan 2000-TH the Government undertook to have periodic reviews of the
tariffs of the three utilities to ensure that: (a) they are adequate to meet
the covenanted rates of return; and (b) they accomplish the required cross
funding among the three utilities as needed to enable them to carry out
their respective investment programs. These covenants will be repeated in
the proposed loan.
5.14      The projected tariffs of EGAT, PEA and MEA (Baht per kWh) at
current prices are presented in Table 5.5.

5.17       Under the assumptions followed, PEA-s contribution from internally
generated funds to its total investment program is expected to be 16.6%.
If consumers  contributions and deposits are included, the participation of
consumer-related revenues rises to 27.6% of total investment.
5.18       PEA is expected to continue depending on foreign borrowings to
finance the foreign cost of its projects. Most of these loans have been
contracted, on very favorable terms, with the OECF, KFW, the KFAED, CIDA and
OPEC Fund. Excluding CIDA loans which are interest free, interest rates on
loans from these sources range from 2% to 6% p.a. Exchange risk on foreign
loans is normally assumed by PEA. Because of the short investment period of
most of its projects, it is PEA's policy not to capitalize! interest during
construction.

5.19      PEA expects to use in its investment program part of the inven-
tories accumulated in recent years (para. 5.06); this will result in a
reduction of PEA's working capital.
5.20      Equity contributions are assumed to be limited to the reimburse-
ment of the cost of projects sponsored by the Government for defense and
security purposes. As in previous loans, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government will provide adequate funds to cover any
shortfalls in financing the project.
E. Debt Control
5.21      Present covenants provide for the Bank to review PEA's borrowings
when long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization exceeds 60%.
PEA is also required to limit its short- and medium-term debt (debt which
on issue matures within five years) to 10% of its total debt outstanding.
In the past PEA has complied with both covenants and, under the assumptions
followed, PEA is expected to remain within these limits. It is intended to
repeat both covenants in the proposed loan.
F. Liquidity Position
5.22      Under the assumptions followed, during the forecast period PEA's
liquidity is expected to remain adequate with a current ratio in excess
of 1.3.
5.23      Detailed financial projections for PEA, EGAT and MEA are
presented in Annex 12 as well a consolidated projected income statement for
the sector. The assumptions followed are presented in Annex 13.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01      The Government of  Thailand places a high priority to the rural
development as a key element supporting its dual objective of promoting
economic growth and alleviating poverty. In this context, rural electri-
fication in Thailand has played a decisive role in promoting economic
development in rural areas. On the other hand, the NREP, by complementing
other on-going rural electrification projects which extend the distribution
network to formally remote areas, enhances the benefits of the capital
investment in those projects.
Economic Rate of Return
6.02      Since the project to be financed under the proposed loan covers a
time-slice of PEA's NRE Program, the economic analysis was made for the whole
program. The methodology followed is substantially the same as that used
for evaluating the Second Accelerated Rural Electrification (Loan 1871-TH).



- 34 -
6.03       The economic rate of return of the project (ERR) is the discount
rate that equalizes the economic costs and the direct and indirect benefits
attributable to the project over its life. In evaluating Rural electrifi-
cation projects, in an attempt to better reflect the benefits of the project,
it is customary to include in the ERR not only the direct benefits (derived
from the sales of electricity) as is done in other power projects, but also
the so called indirect benefits. The indirect benefits are an estimate of
the impact of the project in terms of cost savings and productivity
increases for the different groups of consumers intended to be served by the
project.  The ERR so calculated is 14%.  Details on the ERR calculation are
presented in Annex 14.
6.04       Sensitivity tests for variations in costs and benefits give the
following results:
ERR
(a)  On basic assumption                            14
(b) Project cost increased by:
10%                                      13
20%                                      12
(c) Energy cost increased by:
10%                                      13
20%                                      11
(d) Direct benefits decreased
(due to lower sales than expected) by:
10%                                      13
20%                                      LO
(e) Indirect benefits decreased
(due to overestimation of savings) by:
10%                                      13
20%                                      Li
6.05       If only direct benefits are included (including consumers contri-
butions), the ERR would be -5%. This is normally the situation in rural
electrification projects, due to the fact that they serve mostly
residential consumers in the lower tariff brackets. In the particular case
of Thailand, as mentioned in para. 1.23, although a certain degree of cross
subsidization is desirable, it appears that tariffs for that group of
consumers are unnecessarily low. This situation is expected to be
gradually corrected.

6.06      Finally, it is worth mentioning that the villages that form part of
the NREP, by contributing to its investment cost are demonstrating their
willingness to pay for electric services. They are also contributing to
mobilize domestic savings towards a development project that will directly
benefit them. The NREP in its two phases will benefit about 10,000 villages
covering about 425,000 customers and about: 2.5 million people. In addition
to the above mentioned benefits from sales of electricity and indirect
benefits (savings in fuel costs, increased productivity), the project will
generate other social benefits derived from improvements in communications,
education and hygiene.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a) With the Government
(i)  Government to arrange for prompt payment to PEA of electricity
bills owed by Government agencies (para. 2.08);
(ii) the sector to earn a rate of return on net revalued fixed
assets of not less than 8% every year (para. 5.09);
(iii) Government to make the adjustments necessary in the sector's
tariffs to reflect changes in the price of all fuels and in
the price of purchased electric power (para. 5.11);
(iv) Government to continue reviewing tariff levels periodically
to ensure they are adequate to meet the rate of return
covenant and the three utilities' investment requirements
(para. 5.13); and
(v)  Government to make available to PEA any funds necessary
for carrying out the project (para. 5.20).
(b)  With PEA
(i)  PEA to continue employing independent auditors (para. 2.10);
(ii) Villages to be financed under the loan to be selected
in accordance with criteria described in para. 4.13;



- 36 -
(iii) in the event that the grant from the ADAB cloes not materialize
by September 30, 1983 PEA to prepare a Plan of Action to
introduce improvements in its operation and to submit such
Plan for Bank-s comments by December 31, 1983 (para. 4.17);
(iv)  PEA to earn a rate of return consistent with the sector-s
requirements (para. 5.09);
(v) PEA to continue the fuel/power purchased ccst adjustment
clause in its tariffs schedule (para. 5.11);
(vi) PEA to continue reviewing the adequacy of its tariffs
by April 30 each year (para. 5.13); and
(vii) PEA to secure Bank's approval if long-term debt exceeds
60% of the sum of equity and debt and to limit its
short- and medium-term debt to 10% of its total debt
outstanding (para. 5.21).
B. Recommendations
7.02      With the agreements reached on the above, the project forms a
suitable basis for a loan to PEA of US$30.6 million for a period of 20 years
including 6 years grace, with the guarantee of the Royal Thai Government.

Description of PEA's Monitoring System
1.        At the time the village is selected for electrification a survey
is prepared by trained staff. The following data is collected:
(a) Village Data
- Population
- Number of households
- Potential number of customers
- Potential number of street lights
- Agricultural land (in Rais)
- Number and types of animals
- Number of water pumps
- Number of trucks, tractors and other vehicles
- Information on water supply
- Public buildings
- Commercial shops
- Number of farms by types
- Rural industries
(b) Household data (sample of about 10% of the village)
- Size of the family
- Sources of income
- Financial information
- Present consumption of energy by sources
- Potential consumption of electricity
(c) Business Data
- Type of commercial activity
- Financial information
- Number of workers employed
-  Present consumption of energy by source
- Potential consumption of electricity

2.        One or two months after the village is electrified information
begins to be updated. Every village headman, shop, business, ricemill and
public building is interviewed as well as 10%' of the households. Information
on energy assumption and number of consumers is collected on a monthly
basis. The balance of the information is collected once a year.
3.        Data collected is processed in a computer and significant data is
summarized.
4.        When the project is completed, the impact of the project is
assessed in terms of number of customers connected, energy consumption by
type of use. Benefits including savings to the consumers are estimated
and economic rate of return of the project is calculated.
5.        The results of the post-evaluation is submitted to the NESDB and
to the Project Operation Auditors of the Prime Minister Office.
6.        Post-evaluation has been done for two projects aLready completed.
The Village Electrification Project in three :Southern Prov:Lnces (VES-3),
implemented between 1977 to 1980, had an estimated economic rate of return
(ERR) of 5% calculated at the time of appraisal. The post--evaluation showed
an ERR of 23%. The second project, the Village Electrification Project in
10 Northeast Provinces (VENE 10), implemented in the same period, had a ERR
of 12% estimated at the time of appraisal and the post-evaluation resulted
in a ERR of 28%.
7.        Copies of the forms used by PEA to monitor its projects are
available in the Project File.

ANNEX 13

THAILAND
PROVINCIAL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Assumptions in Financial Forecast of PEA
Price Escalation
1.        The following are the rates used for escalating foreign and local
cost:
Foreign        Local
1983                                        8.0           7.0
1984                                        7.5           7.0
1985                                        7.0           7.0
1986 and thereafter                         6.0           6.0
Revenues
2.        For financial projection purposes a load forecast slightly lower
than PEA's projections was used. It was considered that: PEA-s estimates
were on the high side in view of the recent slowdown in electricity demand.
3.        Revenues for EGAT, PEA and MEA were first calculated at the level
required to yield a rate of return on net revalued fixecd assets of 8% each
year. This allowed the calculation of average tariffs at the consumer level
for each utility. Next, keeping these tariffs unchanged, the excess cash,
if any, in PEA and MEA was transferred to EGAT by increasing EGAT's bulk
tariffs to PEA and MEA. This is expected to result in a more rational use
of the sector financial resources.
4.        Other operating resources include mainly sales of electrical
equipment, installations and inspection fees and construLction for customers.
Purchased Power
5.        The tariffs to be charged by EGAT to IEA are based on the
following pricing assumptions for estimating EGAT's fuel cost:
(a)  Heavy Oil and Diesel Oil:  FY82 prices of 4.46 and 7.26 B/per
liter respectively will remain unchanged in FY83. In FY84 both
prices were escalated at the international inflation rate; for
FY85 and thereafter prices were escalated at 2% in real terms.
(b)  Natural Gas:  the gas pricing formula with PTI (based on the
following escalation factors: 40% Singapore Oil Price level;
30% on the domestic inflation rate in Thailand; and 30% on USA
inflation rate) was applied. International inflation was used in



- 63 -
ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 3
lieu of U.S. inflation. For FY83 the current FY82 prices of
87.09 B/MMBTU was escalated at 4.5% which implies that there is
no change in oil prices. It was assumed that oil prices will
increase in FY84 at the rate of inflation and from FY85 onwards
at 2% in real terms.
6.         It was also assumed that availability of gas to EGAT will be
restricted up to FY87 as follows; (Million cubic feet per day)
83     84      85      86      87
Total gas available to EGAT        150    160    230    280    295
7.         Lignite was priced at B/398 (US$:L7.30) per ton and escalated at
2% in real terms.
8.         EGAT's tariffs to PEA will continue to be about 24% lower than
those charged to MEA (before the cross funding referred to in para. 3).
Depreciation
9.         Depreciation is calculated on revalued assets using a rate of
4.4% which reflects the average life of assets of about 23 years.
Borrowings
10.        The weighted average interest is about 6.5% due to the large
proportion of soft loans used by PEA. Because of the short construction
period of its projects, PEA does not capitalize interest.
Equity Contributions
11.        Equity contributions are assumed to be restricted to Government
funding of projects related to national sec:urity.
Asset Revaluation
12.        Current covenant requires PEA to revalue its fixed assets in
accordance with the fixed capital formation deflator used for public
investment in Thailand. Accumulated depreciation and consumer contributions,
also revalued in the same manner, are deduc:ted from the gross revalued fixed
assets to obtain the net value of fixed assets in service. For financial
projections the average of local and foreign inflation ratio was used as
revaluation index.

Work in Progress
13.       Work in progress reflects the estimated commissioning dates of
different projects. On average, it represents about one year of investment
which is consistent with the usual completion period of PEA's jobs.

Rate of Return Calculation
1.        Capital Costs.  The capital costs include all the capital invest-
ment during the NREP (Phase I and II) implementation period and for the
investment required for subsequent years for additional primary and
secondary lines, transformers and services to new consumers up to 30th
program year. (Only 70% of the capital costs for equipment and vehicles was
allocated to the project, as part of these equipment would be transferred to
other uses upon completion of the project.) All costs are at December 1982
price levels (taxes and duties were excluded).
2.        O&M Costs.  Operating costs were calculated on the basis of 0.5%
of the average cumulative investment of the system in service at the
beginning and ending of each year. Maintenance expenses were also related
to the average cumulative investment of each year but increasing from 0.5%
to 1.0% over the 30-year period.  Consumer billing and collection costs were
calculated at the current level of B 30 per customer per year but decrease
to B 20 at the end of 20th program year.
3.        Energy Costs.  Energy costs were calculated at B 1.26 per kWh,
the present purchased rate from EGAT.
4.        Direct Benefits.  The direct benefits were derived from sales of
electric energy based on 1982 PEA's tariff rates plus connection fees which
PEA charges to consumers.
5.        Indirect Benefits
The indirect benefits were derived on the following basis:
(a) Residential households: cost saving compared to lighting
fuels; agricultural labor savings;/l increased productivity
of cottage industry activities;
(b) Rural shop electrification: cost saving benefits and
increased productivity benefits;
/1 Interviews reveal that electrified rural households can do housework
during morning and evening nondaylight hours, leaving extra daylight
time for agricultural activities.



- 66 -                            ANNEX 14
Page 2
(c) Rice mills: cost savings comparing diesel engines with
electric motors in annual maintenance, capital recovery
cost, and improved rice recovery;
(d)  Agricultural pumps:  cost savings comparing diesel engines
with electric motors;
(e) Rural water works: cost savings comparing diesel engines
with electric motors.
6.        In addition to these indirect benefits, some additional benefits
may accrue from savings in using electricity for cooking. To be on the
conservative side,these benefits were not included in the ERR calculation.
7.        The indirect benefits so derived are summarized below and details
are available in the project file:
