PROVINCIAL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 2312-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Provincial Power
Distribution Project in Thailand, for which Loan 2312-TH in the amount of
US$30.6 million was approved on June 9, 1983. The loan was closed on June 30,
1988, one year behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement was on June 26, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division,
Department II of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III). The Borrower, the Provincial Electricity Authority,
prepared Part 'iI which has been included in the PCR without editing or other
alterations; its contents are the sole responsibility of the Borrower.
Preparation of this PCR started in August 1989 after a PCR mission to
Thailand and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports and correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower.

PROVINCIAL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 2312-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPuRT
Evaluation S"mmary
Obiectives
1.       The project comprised two parts:  Part A assisted the Government to
finance a portion of the first phase of its Normal Rural Electrification
Program scheduled for implementation over the 1983-86 period, and Part B
included measures to strengthen and modernize PEA's operations. The chief
objective of Part A was to electrify 1,500 villages with no previous access to
electricity and to extend electric service to another 1,500 villages already
partially electrified. Altogether 127,500 households were expected to be
supplied with electricity. Part B's objectives were to: (i) improve corpo-
rate planning, materials management and project planning and implementation;
(ii) modernize and extend electronic data processing; (iii) prepare a training
program; and (iv) improve the distribution network (Part I, paras. 3.1 and
3.2).
Implementation Experience
2.       Project implementation was well planned, organized and supervised.
During project appraisal it was estimated that construction could get underway
by June 1983; however, construction work started only in January 1984 when the
Bank loan became effective. This six-month delay was reflected in a corres-
ponding delay in completing, during June 1987, about 99g of what was origi-
nally defined to be the project. At this point US$12.7 million, 42Z of the
loan amount, had not been disbursed or committed. On July 21, 1987, the Bank
formally amended the Loan Agreement by extending the closing date to June 30,
1988 and increasing the electrification targets from 1,500 to 2,100 villages
and extending electric service in 4,500 instead of 1,500 partially electri-
fied villages. Project implementation continued until June 1988 when the loan
was fully disbursed and even the revised electrification goals were exceeded
(Part I, para. 5.1 and 5.2).
Results
3.       Part A:  As a result of the loan extension the project overachieved
the original electrification targets by the following wide margins (project
appraisal targets are in parenthesis): 2,330 (1,500) new villages were
electrified; service was extended to 10,021 (1,500) villages partially
electrified villages; and 224,741 (127,500) households were supplied with
electricity. All this was accomplished at an increase in project cost of
about 25Z. The larger volume of work was possible within the loan amount
because of the substitution of locally available materials for imports.
Part B: The institutional development study was carried out in accordance
with terms of reference prepared by PEA and the Bank.  Implementation of its
findings and recommendations to strengthen and modernize PEA's operations has
produced good results (Part I, paras. 6.1 anA 6.2).



- iii -
Sustainability
4.       Barring unanticipated adverse developments the project benefits
should be sustainable over the foreseeable future because: (i) PL'4 is
competent to successfully maintain and operate its facilities; (ii) its
facilities have been installed in accordance with strict design and con-
struction standards following international practices; (iii) the Government
has a long-standing power sector policy to supply adequate electricity to all
segments of the population; and (iv) villagers prefer, and are willing to pay
more for electricity than any substitute energy (part I, para. 7.1).
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.       The foreign exchange requirements for the original scope of the
project were greatly overestimated; however, no proceeds of the loan had to be
cancelled because disbursements could be channelled to eligible expenditures
for an increased project scope. This illustrates the importance of providing
such flexibility in the content and scope of a project where the volume of
work required for planned electrification targets cannot be accurately gauged
at the initial plaining stage (Part I, para. 13.1).

Subsector:                     Electric Power
2. Background
2.1      Three government-owned utilities generate and distribute all the
electricity consumed in Thailand except for a relatively insignificant amount
bought and distributed by one franchise operated by the Thai Navy and captive
power generated by a number of industries for their own use. The three
utilities are the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)> and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA). EGAT is responsible for the generation and high voltage
transmission of electricity to MEA, PEA and a number of large industrial
consumers; MEA is responsible for electricity distribution in the greater
Bangkok metropolitan area; and PEA distributes electricity throughout the rest
of Thailand not served by MEA. In addition, PEA generates a small amount of
electricity in certain isolated areas.
2.2      Distr3bitLior of power to the provinces began on a planned basis in
1963 with the formation of PEA. In 1964 PEA introduced a scheme known as the
Normal Rural Electrif.caticn Program (NREP), whereby villages requesting
electrificatLon had to provide some materials (e.g. wooden poles and cross
arms) and half of the labor needed. In later years this practice was dis-
continued to facil.itate compliance with stricter technical requirements and
specifications, and ill its place a monetary contribution amounting to about
25-30Z of the cost of village electrification was substituted. The balance
was first funded from government budget allocations and subsequently from
subsidized local loans to PEA by the Krung Thai Bank and the Ministry of
Finance.



2.3      The NREP is open to villages from all over Thailand and complements
other rural electrification projects,l/ The program was such a success that by
1982 there was a backlog of around 7,600 villages which had applied and were
still awaiting electrification. The lucal loans available to PEA could not
cope with the strong demand for electrification. Consequently, PEA structured
a five-year program (1983-86) which would facilitate access to foreign sources
of finsnce.  Following the advice os the National Economic and Social Devel-
opment Board, the program was divided into two phases. The first phase was to
be implemented during 1983-87 and covered 3,000 unelectrified villages and
extension of electricity in another 3,000 partially electrified villages. The
second phase was to be implemented during 1985-87 and covered electrifying
2,000 villages and expanding electrical services in an additional 2,000
villages. PEA divided the first phase into two identical projects: one
financed by the Bank under this project and the second financed by OECF of
Japan.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1      The objectives of the project were to assist PEA's ongoing rural
electrification program for providing electricity to rural consumers and to
strengthen PEA's operations.
3.2      The project consisted of two parts.  Under Part A, the project was to
help finance a portion of the first phase of the NREP five-year program to be
implemented from 1983 to 1986. It provided for the electrification of 1,500
villages which had no access to electric services and the extension of
electric services in another 1,500 partially electrified villages. Altogether
about 130,000 households were expected to receive electricity under the
proJect. Part B of the project included the implementation of measures to
strengtnen and modernize PEA's operations. It provided for the retention of
consultants to assist PEA in four main areas of its activities: (i) the
improvement of corporate planning, materials management and project planning
and implementation; (ii) the modernization and extended application of
electronic data processing; (iii) the preparation of a training program; and
(iv) the improvement of the reliability, safety and economy of the
distribution network.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1      The project was well conceived, designed and organized.  Part A gave
financial support to a program which supplied electricity to rural area where
it was in much demand and where villagers were willing to pay a part of the
installation cost. While rural electrification was fully in accord with the
1/ The regional accelerated rural electrification (ARE) projects partly
financed by the Bank under Loans 1527-TH and 1871-TH and the Tambon
program aimed at electrifying all Tambons (Thailand's lowest
administrative unit consisting of a group of villages) headquarters and
the surrounding villages which can be connected at reasonable cost.



Bank's lending policy of helping the rural poor, it rightly required villages
to meet minimum economic connection crit"r.e to qualify for electrification
under the project. This measure was meant to prevent excessively remote low
revenue installations from overburdening PEA's financial position.
4.2      Part B of the project was an important complement to Part A.  It
provided consui ing services to assist PEA improve and modernize its
operations and undertake institutional reforms needed for PEA's transition
from a construction oriented organization to a service utility.
4.3      Planning, engineering and construction activities were coordinated by
PEA's Project and Planning bivision, and the electrification subprojects were
implemented by PEA's regional offices. These arrangements were satisfactory.
PEA avoided land easement problems by routing its distribution lines along
mair. roads and by keeping encroachment on farm land to an absolute minimum.
5.  P-oiect implementation
5.1      Project implementation was well planned, organized and supervised.
During project appraisal it was estimated that construction would get under
way by June 1983; however, construction work only started in January 1984 when
the Bank loan became effective. As can be seen from Annex 1 progress chart,
this six-month delay was reflected in a corresponding delay in completing
about 992 of what was originally defined to be the project. At this point
US$12.7 million (422 of the loan amount) had not been disbursed, nor
committed.
5.2      On July 21, 1987 the Bank approved PEA's request to utilize the
remaining US$12.7 million amount to finance additional village electri-
fication.   Accordingly, the loan agreement was amended to include the
electrification of about 2,100 (was 1,500) villages and the extension of
electrical services in 4,500 (was 1,500) partially electrified villages over
the 1984-88 (was 1984-86) period. When the loan was fully disbursed in June
1988, even the revised electrification targets were exceeded by a significant
margin.
6.       Proiect Results
6.1      Part A: Project objectives were fully achieved.  As a result of the
loan extension enabling the full utilization of uncommitted loan proceeds, the
project exceeded the original electrification targets as follows (project
appraisal targets are in parenthesis): 2,330 (1,500) villages were elec',i-
fied; service was extended in 10,021 (1,500) partially electrified villages;
and 224,741 (127,500) households were supplied with electricity. This much
greater thar. estimated volume of work at an increase in project cost of only
about 252 was possible because of an overestimate of the quantity of material
and labor, as well as unit costs. The increased work could be accomplished
within the loan amount due to the substitution of locally available material
for imports.



6.2      The villagers who have been supplied with electricity will share such
benefits as cost and labor savings and increased productivity through the use
of electric lighting, tools and machinery. In time, there should follow
social and other benefits such as, to name a few, a better standard of living,
new employment ar.d business opportunities and more opportunities for education
and personal advancement.
6.3      Part B:  The institutional development study included (i) strategic
planning; (ii) project planning and implementation, (iii) materials manage-
ment; (iv) distribution system planning; (v) electronic data processing and
(vi) manpower development. Findings and recommendations of the study have
been implemented with good results. A noteworthy example is PEA's corporate
planning system which has developed into an effective tool for articulating
corporate responsibilities and objectives and managing corporate activities.
6.4      As detailed in Part III, Section 6 and Annex 2 of this report, the
reevaluated internal economic rate of return (IERR) from the project is about
12X, essentially the same as the opportunity cost of capital in Thailand. The
reevaluation takes into account the quantification of benefits similar to the
methodology used in the SAR except for the use of updated socio-economic data
obtained from PEA's surveys. An IERR of 142 was estimated in the SAR for the
entire NREP progra.r. comprising this project, the OECF funded project and all
of Phase II. The PCR calculated a reevaluated IERR for only the project, for
which data on costs and benefits could be compiled with a good degree of
accuracy. The slightly lower rate of return is mainly due to lower actual and
fo.ecast consumer density compared to assumptions in the SAR.
6.5      PEA's financial performance improved steadily over the project
period. All financial covenants were complied with except for the debt to
debt plus equity ratio which by FY88 was reduced to 60.5X only marginally
higher than the 602 maximum required by the Loan Agreement. PEA's financial
performance should continue to be satisfactory in the foreseeable future
barring any adverse developments.
7.       Project Sustainability
7.1      The project's benefits should be sustainable in the foreseeable
future for the following reasons:
(a) PEA has amply demonstrated that it has the technical and
administrative capability to continue to competently maintain and
operate its facilities;
(b) PEA's facilities have been installed in accordance with strict design
and construction standards follcwing international practices;
(c) The Government's energy sector policies have in the past and continue
to emphasize the objective of extending an adequate electricity
supply to all segments of its population; and



-5 -
(d) Villagers have shown their definite p:eference for and readiness to
pay for electric services in lieu of such energy substitutes as LPG
and kerosene.
8.       Bank Performance
8.1      For many years, the Bank has played an important role in assisting
the Government's programs on behalf of the poorer segment of its population.
r .e project exemplifies the Bank's ongoing efforts to improve the lot of the
rural poor. The Bank's associations with PEA goes back to the first rural
electrification pruject (Loan 1527-TH) approved in February 1978. In the
ensuing yea-s, the Bank supported PEA's growth into a full-fledged electric
power distribution utility by providing funds and advice. The Bank's
insistonce on institutional development was responsible for including in the
project the ADAB financed study which was influential in strengthening PEA's
operations.
8.2      A cooperative workirg relationship was maintained by Bank staff with
PEA and Government officials throughout the project cycle. Since the project
was the third of its kind with an experienced borrower, project preparation
and appraisal were relatively straightforward tasks. Eight supervision
missions were fieldec during the implementation period.  These missions along
with well-prepared progress reports submitted quarterly by PEA were adequate
for effective supervision of the project. The Bank's performance in all these
aspects of the prcject can be rated as completely satisfactory.
9.       Borrower's Performance
9.1      Making allowance for the expansion of the project in order to be able
to fu_y disburse the Bank loan, PEA implemented the project according to
plan, on schedule and within the budget. At least some credit for this
relatively faultless performance must be due to the experience gained in
carrying out the previous two rvral electrification projects. This shows that
PEA's project implementation skills are increasing with the increasing skills
gained by its employees through training and on-the-job experience.
9.2      Regarding project implementation, it must also be mentioned that PEA
effectively employed local and expatriate consultants to assist with desigi,
engineering and construction supervision of various components of the project.
The selection and assignment of consultants fully qualified for the tasks at
hand is considered an essential element in the successful implementation of
the project. This fact can be applied as a general lesson to illustrate the
importance of recognizing the need for and taking advantage of outside
expertise in project implementation whenever necessary.
9.3      PEA's operating efficiency and productivity has benefited from the
introduction of modern technology and computer-assisted techniques. During
the 1980-88 period customers per personnel almost doubled and revenues per
personnel more than doubled by a substantial margin. Despite these favorable



-6-
statistics, however, PEA must still address two basic issues in its
distribution network: (i) maintaining a voltage drop which does not exceed
10X; and (ii) reducing power outages to more acceptable levels. As PEA moves
toward supplying ever increasing loads, especially on the outskirts of the
Bangkok metropolitan area, it will have to:
(a) gear up to a higher distribution voltage;
(b) work to improved standards of service quality and reliability, and
(c) further strengthen its institutional capabilities to meet the
challenge imposed by the currently anticipated rapid growth in aemand
in Thailand.
10.      Project Relationships
10.1     In the course of the Bank's extensive lending operations in
Thailand's electric power sector, Bank staff have established especially
cordial working relationships with sector entities including PEA, and the
government officials concerned with the sector. The atmosphere of mutual
respect and trust which has been engendered has made it possible to amicably
settle the various issues which arise during a lending operation, including
such sensitive issues as electricity tariffs and financial performances.
Neither the Bank nor the Borrower have any adverse comments regarding their
relationship throughoutt the project cycle.
10.2     Bank staff also maintained good relationships with ADAB, its
consultants on institutional development and other participants in the
project. As far as could be observed, PEA remained on equally good terms with
ADAB, consultants and contractors.
11.      Consulting Services
11.1     PEA engaged consultants to carry out the institutional development
study financed by ADAB and to assist in the different phases of project
implementation. The study was successfully executed and laid the groundwork
for the development of an effective corporate planning system for PEA
(para. 6.3). The project assistance consultants contributed to the expe-
ditious completion of the electrification project through their design,
engineeritlg and construction supervision efforts (para. 9.2). PEA reports
that all consulting services performed on the project were satisfactory.
12.      Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1     The staff appraisal report was comprehensive and well prepared.  It
gave an excellent account of all aspects of the rural electrification program
and the project's rcle in the program. Moreover, it precisely defined the



project, its objectives and execution, all of which were accurately reflected
in the legal agreements. The legal agreements provided sufficient flexibility
in the definition and scope of the project to allow an expansion of eligible
disbursements within the intent of the loan. This feature is important when
the volume of work required for planned electrification targets cannot be
accurately gauged at the initial planning stage.
12.2     Both the supervision reports and the Borrower's quarterly progress
reports were informative and useful. However, for both there is room for
improvement in format and content to make them more suited for the purpose of
preparing PCRs. In general, it can be observed that too much emphasis and
effort goes into details which are necessary but not entirely relevant to an
analytic approach to project evaluation. This is particularly true of the
quarterly progress reports which contain many pages of procurement and
contracting details which are important for record purposes but have
practically no value to the person preparing the PCR. It should be a standard
requirement that the quarterly reports include the statistical data required
for Part III of the PCR.
13.      Findings and Lessons Learned
13.1     The project, the third of its kind with the same borrower, proceeded
fairly smoothly except for the large overestimate of the foreign exchange
cost. It would not be fair to be overly critical of the appraisal estimate
because the villages to be electrified were not identified (there was only a
maximum investment per connection eligibility criterion) and it was difficult
to judge beforehand which of the project's imported equipment and goods could
be substituted from local sources. However, it was not necessary to cancel
about 402 of the loan because of the framing of provisions in the project and
legal documents which permitted disbursement of uncommitted proceeds of the
loan to other eligible expenditures. This illustrates the importance of
providing such flexibility in the content and scope of a project when the
volume of work required for planned electrification targets cannot be
accurately gauged at the initial planning stage.

The   original   Normal   Rural   Electrification
Project (NREP) was identified and formulated during
1981-1982.   Th-  scope of works of the project  aims  at
electrifying  a  total  number   of  5,000  unelectrified
villages and 5,000 extension jobs in partly electrified
villages throughout the country. The project is splitted
into 2 phases as follows:
I     Scope of Works
Phase             I--------------------------
I Villages I Extension jobs
----------------_-------------+…_-----------------_______
NREP Phase I  QiRZP I)         I  3,000  1    3,000
NREP Phase Ir (NREP II)        I  2,000  1    2,000
Total               I  5,000  I    5,000
On December 14, 1982, the implementation of NRBP
I was approved by the Cabinet while NREP II was postponed
for another years.   In 1983, the World Bank and the OECF
agreed to finance US$ 30.6 million and Y 6,580 million
for  NREP I.  The NREP I was then divided into  two  (2)
identical   projects   to  be  implemented  in   parallel
accordingly.    The  NREP  I part  1  which  is   called
"Provincial Power Distribution Project (PPD)" was so
formulated   on  condition  that  its  foreign   currency
components are to be financed by the afore-mentioned loan
of USS 30.6 million and its scope of works is aimed at



- 9 -
electrifying   1,500  unelectrified  villages  and  1,500
extension jobs in partly electrified villages tiroughout
the  country.   The rest is to be implemented  under  the
NREP I part 2 which is concentrated in the northern and
northeastern parts of Thailand and its foreign currency
components are financed by the OECP of Japan.
After  the  World  Bank  Appraisal  Mission   had
conducted the Project study and appraisal, it was agreed
that   PEA   prepare  a  Plan  of  Action  to   introduce
improvements in PEA's operation and submit such a Plan
for the Bank's comments.
Under   ADAB   assistance,    the   institutional
development plan was organised aiming at strengthening
and modernizing PEA's operations subject to the World
Bank Appraisal Mission's recommendations.
Consequently, the Provincial Power Distribution
Project (PPD) contains two components which are;
Part A - Village Electrification
Part B - The institutional development (as details
shown in Part I Para. 3.2)
2. PROJECT RESULTS
The   project   was  well   planned,   organized,
supervised and cooperated between PEA, the Bank and
consultants.   Therefore,  the project implementation and
construction   were   wholly  accomplished  as   desired.
Details of its successful results are shown in the
following Summary Sheet for Project Review and Completion
Report.

A. OVERALL SUMMARY (PROJECT PERFORMANCE)
1. Prolect PurDose and Goals
The goal of the project was initially the
expansion  of  rural   electrification   for  1,500
unelectrified villages and the extension of electric



- 11 -
service   to   another   1,500   villages    partially
electrified.    The   project  implementation   period
covered 5 year span in the PEA's entire service area.
2. Accomplishment
Attainment of the goals was done through, the
following construction activities:
Planned Actual %Difference
Primary lines   (cct-km.)   3,300    2,963        -10
Secondary lines (cct-km.)   5,250    6,648        +27
Distribution
Transformers    (kVA.)      63,000   85,600       +36
Service Meters   (set)    127,500  224,741        +76
Construction labor (*)         100       116      +16
and overachieved the originally planned electrification
target as follows
Planned  Actual  %Achievement
Villages to be electrified   1,500   2,330        155
Extension service works       1,500  10,021       668
3. Finarrcial Svendina
The project was both cost-efficient and cost-
effective in respect of accomplishment it made to
cover the greater than planned volume of work within
the approved loan amount. The comparison of the final
project cost was summarized in Part III Table A.
4. Lesson Learned
Summary of lessons learned during and after
the project implementation :



- 12 -
1. Flexibility in the provision and allowance
for loan extension to be fully utilized in line with
sensibly increased project scope enabled the project
to overachieve its originally planned electrification
target.
2. The key factor in the success of the
project  is  administration.    The  project  received
overwhelmingly strong support from all level from both
the  Government and IBRD.   A close collaboration  and
consultation made the project proceed easier and able
to overachieve the target resulting in the larger
benefits derived by the rural people than expected.
3. The technical advisor, consultant staff,
also worked well in contributing to strenghthening
PEA's operations.
4. The project benefits has gone to 225,741
households  under the project.   Effects and impact of
the project were reported to be very satisfactorily
constructive as it provided rural people access to
power   utility,   opportunity  for  local  socio  and
economic development and increased standard of living.
5. Conclusion
The  project  was  implemented  smoothly   and
successfully.   Eventhough  there  existed a delay  at
the early stage of project implementation, it was
manageable and had no major negative or adverse
impact.
Overall conclusion is that the project was
very successful in terms of project performance,
input, output and project environment.

6.       Project Results
A. ECONOMIC IMPACT
6.1      The PCR reevaluated the internal economic rate of return (IERR) as
the discount rate which equates the economic costs and benefits of the project
over its 30 year life. The IERR thus calculated in Annex 2, Table 1 is 12Z.
Annex 2, Table 2 shows the number of the different category of consumers,
actually developed upto 1989 and forecast to develop upto 2,013, on which the
reevaluated IERR is based. The associated costs and benefits are discussed
below.
Cost
6.2      The economic costs comprised the following:
(a) the capital investments in the project and in primary lines,
transformers, secondary lines and services to new consumers upto the
30th year of the project's life; and
(b) the operating and maintenance costs over the project's 30 year life.
All cost are net of taxes and duties, and local expenditure on equipment,
goods and labor are shadow priced at 0.92 times their actual costs. The cost
of electric energy was assumed at the long run marginal cost (LRMC) of
B 1.92/kWh.



- 22 -
Benefits
6.3      Table 6.1 summarizes the benefits which are quantified as follows:
(a) Households
- Savings in lighting. This saving was evaluated as the
difference between (i) annual capital recovery costs of
kerosene/battery lightning plus annual fuel cost before
electrification and (ii) annual capital recovery cost plus the
cost of electricity (LRMC) after electrification.
- Agricultural labor serving. An additional 1.5 hours labor made
possible by electric lighting during 30 days per year of the
peak agricultural labor season; based on 73.5? of village
households whose major occupation is in agriculture and a
marginal value of labor of B 57.7 per 8 hour day.
- Increased productivity of cottage industries. The weighted
annual benefit from a longer working day in basket making, cloth
weaving and mat and pillow making; based on the percentage of
households having people engaged in cottage industry activities
for 120 days in the year.
(b) Shops: the weighted annual benefits realized by, tailor, food and
composite shops due to the availability of electricity based on the
average percentage of shops in villages.
tc) Agricultural pumps: the capital, operating and maintenance cost
saving from the use of a 3 hp electrified pump compared to a diesel
engine drive 5.0 hp unit, both operating 300 hours per year.
(d) Rice mill: the capital, operating and maintenance cost saving from
the use of 7.5 hp electrified mill operating 869 hours per year
compared to a diesel engine driven 15.0 hp unit operating 1,159 hours
per year.
(e) Potable water pump: the capital, operating and maintenance cost
savings from the use of a 3.0 hp electrified pump compared to a
5.0 hp diesel driven unit, both operating 300 hours per year.
(f) Power tools: the labor saving from the use of a 1.0 hp electrified
wood planner used for 3.6 hours per day for 50 days per year compared
to accomplishing this work manually.

B. FINANCIAL IMPACT
6.6      PEA's financial performance, comparing actual results with project
appraisal forecasts for the period FY82 to FY88 is given in Annex 3 and
summarized in the following Table 6.3. Financial performance improved
steadily over the past few years, and in this context, FY88 was an
exceptionally good year. In that year, the rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets reached 10? (substantially exceeding the 8? required for the
sector as a whol.e); there was no operating loss since FY84; and the shock
produced on TK4-s  capital structure by the 1985 devaluation of the Baht was
overcome as the debt to debt plus equity ratio was reduced to 60.5X, only
marginally higher than the 60? covenanted in the Loan Agreement. PEA's
financial performance should continue to be satisfactory over the foreseeable
future barring any adverse development.
C. STUDIES
6.7      The project included ^ne study which had the objective of
strengthening PEA's operations. It has already been noted (para. 6.2) that
the ADAB study played an important role in PEA's development of effective
corporate planning methods and procedures. The consultants' contribution
comprised the development and implementation of the following basic
components:



- 25 -
(a)   acquisition and distribution of electricity;
(b)   customer  service;
(c)   operations  and maintenance;
(d)   finance and accounts;
