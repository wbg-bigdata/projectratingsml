           Key Development issues and Rationale for Bank Involvement

1.     Having successfully become an upper middle income country, Mauritius now strives to
become a high income nation1. Ranked only behind South Africa in the Africa Region on The
World Economic Forum; Mauritius is recognized as one of the most competitive and business-
friendly destinations2. Mauritius has moved from an import substitution strategy which was not
very successful given its small local economy towards greater export diversification through
industrialization. From being a predominantly agricultural economy based on sugar production it
has been able to diversify into textiles exports, tourism and more recently financial services,
offshore global business and ICT which have developed as the economy’s new pillars. However,
achieving the high income nation status requires keeping up to and surpassing the pace of
reforms set by its competitors.

2.     The manufacturing sector in Mauritius is facing increasing competitive pressure from
increasing global competition in the export markets especially in light of the ongoing European
slowdown which being the country’s main export market is taking a toll on Mauritius’ economy.
GDP growth is estimated to be 3.3 percent in 2012, vis-à-vis the 3.7 percent projection made
when the first operation of this DPL series was approved (March 2012), and below government
budget projections of close to 4.1 percent. The European economic downturn has had a
significant impact on Mauritian exports in 2012 with declines both in tourist arrivals and export
earnings from the major European markets.

3.     The competitiveness agenda thus remains centre piece to achieving the Government’s
program of reforms. With a view to weather the slowdown accompanied by the current global
economic crisis; to boost economic growth through higher productivity and to increase high
value added exports, the new Government Program adopted in April 2012, and the 2013 Budget
Speech astutely remains committed on continuing to support the competitiveness agenda for
development of the manufacturing and services sector. It emphasizes the need to gain greater
global competitiveness through the need to promote technology investments to improve quality
of Mauritian exports to enable entry into new markets abroad and also reemphasizes the need to
prioritize the SME sector which is an important source of job creation and growth.

4.    There has been encouraging progress in implementing the reform program since the PSC
DPL1; with reforms in some sectors going beyond what was initially envisaged. These include
more substantial regulations being passed to operationalize the Mauritian Insolvency Act 2009
making debt resolution regimes more effective; the development of a National Broadband Policy
(NBP) and the implementation of policy reforms to increase competition in the ICT sector.
Through the Bank’s non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) technical assistance and support
was provided to help develop a pipeline of financial and private sector development policy
reforms for this Second PSC DPL. This proved to be a very useful tool, as it helped provide
technical expertise and global best practice on policy and institutional issues informing policy
dialogue.

       Proposed Objectives

5.       This development policy objective of this DPL series is to strengthen the policy and
institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and enterprise development.
The operation will achieve this by supporting reforms in three integrated and mutually
reinforcing pillars (i) improving competitiveness and growth of enterprises, (ii) improving access
to finance, and (iii) promoting ICT and e-Gov for enhancing competitiveness and transparency.

       Preliminary Description

6.      The proposed Second PSC DPL (PSC DPL2) is being designed in coordination with the
Second Public Sector Performance (PSP) DPL. Both the DPLs are designed to be mutually
reinforcing to address complementary aspects of the Government’s reform program. The PSP
DPL focuses primarily on the performance of the public sector, while this PSC DPL focuses
primarily on strengthening the policy and institutional environment for private sector
competitiveness. It is the combination of the reforms supported by these two operations that will

                                                2
help Government improve its competitiveness, increase its resilience, and prepare it for the next
phase of rapid and inclusive economic growth.

For each of the three pillars that will be supported by this operation, prior actions have been
identified that create the basic institutions to unlock reforms. The specific measures that have
been agreed to as prior actions for the Second PSC DPL are presented in Annex 1.

       Risks and Risk Mitigation

7.      The implementation of the proposed reform program entails a number of risks that had
been identified at the preparation of the First DPL and are still relevant: (a) the challenge of
maintaining macroeconomic stability under growing uncertain global developments; (b) a
slowdown in the momentum of reforms, exacerbated by the slim government majority in the
parliament; and (c) limited institutional capacity within sector ministries to lead and implement
the reforms. The more detailed identification of these risks and the proposed mitigation measures
are provided below.

8.      The first and perhaps the most important risk is that the macroeconomic stability may be
affected given the growing uncertainty in the global economic climate, particularly in the
European economies to which Mauritius remains highly exposed. These global economic
uncertainties represent a significant threat to a small open economy such as Mauritius. Overall,
the Mauritian economy has proven its resilience in 2012 with an estimated GDP growth of 3.3
percent, despite all the headwinds to growth on the external front and lowers than expected
expansionary fiscal policy. Furthermore, on the external front, the increasing levels of foreign
exchange reserves (projected to be at six months of imports in the medium term) provide an
additional buffer against a potential deterioration in the balance of payments. Mauritius’ floating
exchange rate also facilitates correction of external imbalances in the medium term. The recent
trend towards reorienting exports towards new markets (particularly Africa) will also help. On
the fiscal front, the slowdown in the growth of public revenues is being more than compensated
by the containment of public expenditure, with a reduction of the fiscal deficit and public debt.
Should revenues dip, this would require an acceleration of efficiency gains in the public sector,
and additional use of the remaining funds from the National Resilience Fund created in 2011.
The government is also extending the maturity of the public debt further reducing roll-over risks,
as the majority of debt is domestic and there is currently excess liquidity in the domestic capital
markets.



                                                3
9.      The second risk is that a narrowing political reform space affects the pace of the reform
program at a time when the need for reform is most urgent. The pace of reform in Mauritius has
slowed in recent years and the appetite for further aggressive reform appears modest at this time.
There are several ways to mitigate this risk. To the extent that the proposed program has been
designed to mitigate this risk by supporting reforms where consensus exists, helping to put in
place building blocks to expedite the reform program in the medium term. First, the
Government’s focus on growth of SMEs shall support its inclusion agenda. Moreover, over the
medium-term the acceleration reforms for engendering competitiveness and growth will generate
better conditions for job creation. Finally, better communication will be key to building
consensus around the reforms, using visits to Mauritius by high level practitioners and
management to raise awareness and understanding about the reforms and their benefits, both
within the Cabinet and more broadly. This has been useful in the implementation of the reforms
supported under this operation.

10.     The third risk is that of institutional constraints, including limited capacity in sector
ministries, which might make it more difficult to effectively design, implement and monitor the
reforms. Underlying institutional political economy constraints and the narrowing reforms space
identified above combined with limited institutional capacity in some sector ministries can limit
the effectiveness and progress of reforms. This is evident from the different pace of reforms
across line ministries. The Bank is supporting the government to help mitigate this risk by
bringing specialized staff to complement the DPL dialogue in selected areas, and promoting a
public debate through articles and technical notes. Additionally, the DPL itself is a catalyst
between the different ministries involved in the reform program, thereby enhancing coordination.
Also, the Bank’s portfolio in Mauritius is designed to help strengthen capacity tailored to the
needs of a Middle Income Country (MIC).

       Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects

       Poverty and Social Impacts

11.     The DPL supported reforms are expected to have in general a positive impact on the poor
and the vulnerable in the following ways: (i) strengthening the SME programs that will enable
SMEs to become more productive, (ii) increasing access to finance to firms that do not have
access to immovable collateral and alleviating this constraint by further facilitating movable
collateral, (iii) the introduction of a specialized MSME bank and (iii) increasing competition in
the telecom sector making mobile services more affordable. Combined, these measures are
aimed at raising private sector competitiveness and increasing investment, including FDI, are
designed to support a virtuous cycle of growth, employment generation and productivity gains.
Reform measures supported by the three pillars are targeted at decreasing business costs and
creating better conditions for private local and foreign investments and ultimately leading to job
creation.

       Environment Aspects

12.    None of the reforms supported by the DPL series are likely to have a direct effect on the
environment, natural resources, or forestry. Beyond the immediate focus of the DPL, other
Government policies and development objectives such as increasing tourist arrivals by 2015,

                                                4
expanding the port and airport, relieving traffic congestion, and making the business climate
more investor friendly may have an environmental impact. Historically, the record of
environmental management, though not perfect, has been relatively good.3 The Safeguard
Diagnosis Review carried out in October 20104 shows that Mauritius’ environmental policies are
sufficiently robust and are being implemented satisfactorily.
