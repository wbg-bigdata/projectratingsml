INT3RNATIONAL DEVELOWENIT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND REC00ITEDATION OF THE PRESIDMNT TO
THE ZEXECUTIVE DIRBCTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOWIENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONaSIA FOR A
BEEF CATTLS DEVELOPMENT PROJ3CT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$ 3.6
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for beef cattle
development.
PART I - THE ECONVOMY
2.        The most recent Bank report on Indonesia (25-IND of December 1, 1972)
dealt princi7ally with longer-term development issues for the Indonesian economy
but also contained a discussion of recent economic developments. Country data
are presented at Annex I. Indonesia's economic progress continues to be satis-
factory. The rate of growth of GDP, averaging 5 percent from 1965-1970, accele-
rated to 6-7 percent in 1971 and this momentum appears to be sustained in 1972.
The production of rice, the basic commodity, increased substantially for four
successive years, although this year's crops are being seriously affected by
drought conditions and rice imports are being expanded to over 1 million tons
in 1972/73a/ (about 8 percent of total domestic requirements) to meet the current
shortages. In the industrial sector, there has been further substantial growth
in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and industrial goods.
The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by a continuing
inflow of private investment and commitments of official aid for several major
industrial projects, suggests that the prospects are good for further industrial
growth from the present small base. Infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion
is underway, financed in large measure by project aid, including IDA credits.
Deficiencies in the transport, power and telecommunications sectors, however,
could become a constraint on agricultural and industrial growth unless special
efforts are made in project implementation.
3.        In the public sector, Government revenues in 1971/72 were 20 percent
higher than in the previous year. A much larger increase, 33 percent, is fore-
cast for 1972/73. The largest item in this increase would be taxes on expected
higher earnings of foreign oil companies. Other revenues could increase by 16
percent. The expected increase in revenues of Rp 136 billion (US$327 million)
after financing increases in salaries and material expenditures in the routine
budget would allow for nearly a doubling (to Rp 116 billion or US$328 million)
of the surplus available for the development budget.   Together with counterpart
funds generated by program aid (estimated at Rp 95 billion or USp229 million),
this would provide for a development budget in 1972/73 of Rp 211 billion (US+508
million), which is 45 percent more than in 1971/72.
4.        The balance of payments situation has improved steadily.   An important
factor has been debt rescheduling and the financial assistance provided by the
a/ Indonesian financial year, April 1 - }'arch 31.



- 2 -
Inter-Goverrnmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI). acDorts, led by oil, have
expanded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but irmports have also
risen rapidly.  Recorded exports from Indonesia rose by nearly 30 percent
in the Last two years, and they are expected to rise even more in 1972/73,
reaching US.1,235 million, largely as a result of sharp increases in the
volume and value of oil exports. Foreign exchange reserves, usually nega-
tive on a net basis, increased rapidly in the first iline months of 1972,
mainly because of a substantial inflow of private capital attracted by high
Indonesian interest rates, and reached a net level of US2238 million at the
end of 3eDtember 1972.
The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia's past
performance and future economic potential as part of its projections for the
second five-yTear plan, which is to come into effect in April l974.  Thfis plan
is exoected to address itself more directly than was possible in the rehabili-
tation phase to the issues of employment, income! distribution ard regional
development.  Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to formulate
and implement nlans, programE and projects has i.mproved, the lirited managerial
capacity presents a serious obstacle to more rapid gro-th.   ..is probler, as
well as the need to continue to improve the mobilization o- domestic savings,
will also have to be considered in the formulation of the .lan.
6.        Bankf QrouD assistance to Indonesia is a part (f the interttational
support being given in increasing arounts through the 11(11.  Aid commitments
have risen from USt200 million equivalent in 1967 to well over U3:1600 million
for 1972/73.  The proportion of project aid has steadily increased over this
period, but suostantial program aid remains essential as support for the balance
of paynents and - in spite of st:ong domestic revenue efforts - as a source of
additional funds for the developmient budget.  For 1972/73 the Government re-
quested IGGI aid of US$670 rillion equivalent, of which USp350 million was for
program aid, inicluding Udall0 million in food supplies.  At its meeting in
Amsterdam in December 1971, the IGGI accepted this request, endorsed by the
Bankc and the ?wnd, as appronriate in the light. of Indonesia's requirements.
At the subsequent pledging session in April 1072, express or implied cormitments
made by IGrGI members amounited to some U.3p72 rnillion equivalent, approximately
meeting the request for food and non-fcod program aid and su-bstantially exceeding
the arount sought in project aid.   In addition, Japan has provided the equivalenrt
of US'!200 million of untied aid on concessional terms outside the IGG-rI frame-
worlk or the development. of the oil sector.   l.l aid fromo the IGGI members has
been given on concessional terms approximating the st.andards  set by the
alvelorment kissist-ance Commiittee (DAG) of the 05C.  The QII met agean on
}e_cnber 21', 7, to consider the Indonesian aid request for new cormrnt,ments
OD UJ3.p760 rLillion in project and program aid for the 1973/7. financial year.
This request was a.rreed by the IG0I to be reasonable and realistic in terms
of Indonesiats requirements.

7.        The rescheduling negotiations for pre-1966 external debt, which
culminated in April 1970 in an agreement on long-term settlement of the
debts held by '4estern creditors and Japan, and in a subsequent agreement
on similar lines with several Eastern &iSropean countries, resulted in a
low ratio of external debt service to exports of about 11 percent.   It will
rise appreciably through the 1970's as grace periods expire on aid received
after 1966, but should remain manageable during the decade if exports in-
crease at projected rates, restraints on medium-term borrowing are maintained
and new aid is made available on concessional terms similar to those at pre-
sent obtained from the IGGI.



PART TI - 3ANK GROUP OPGi_A7ICGNS IJ EDOiZS`IA
8.        In order to   accelerate the pace of econoTic development,
Indonesia will recuire, in addition to continued substantial external surnort,
some change in emphasis frorm rehabilitation and iriprovement of i:afrastructure
to the expansion of its production capabilities in agriculture, minerals,
forestry and manufacturing. It will also require continued strengthening of
the institutions for the planning of development and the management of the eco-
nomy.   Jelf are and income distribution, including family planning, as well as
regional development and related patterns of employment and population novement,
also need to be given an important place in Indonesia's development strategy.
9.        The work at both, the [Resident Ijssion in Indonesia and at Headquarters
and the lending activities of t.he Bank Group have been oriented towards these
developm;ent objectives.  Tfie focus of the 3ank's economic work in providing as-
sistance to the CGovernment in the current preparation of Indonesia's next five-
year plan is also along these lines.
10.       Consistent with Indonesia's large external resource requirements and
difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank Group's le- iJing to Indonesia
(aside from IFC investments) has been and will most probali2 continue in the fore-
seeable future  to be in the form of IDA credits.    In recognition of the urgent
need for institutional reforms, most IDA-financed projects have been associated
with major reorganizations of existing institutions or the establishment of new
ones, and most credits have included appropriate provisions for consultants'
services and other technical assistance.
11.         riorlty projects in Indonesia commoalyL involve a high proportion of
local costs. Tlven iath the substantial program assistance rnade a-vailable thLrouFh
the IGGI, and Indonesia's improving sarings effort, it would be dif'Licult to reet
her need for capital if external capital lenders were to lend only for the imnort
conlponent of projects.  X oreover, the foreign  exchange component of projects in
the agriculture and social sectors is frequently low and local currency finanicing
is necessary if tne Association is to increase its involvement in these important
sectors.  The 3ank Group has therefore covered some local expenditure in its
financing and will continue to do so in future in cases where the foreign ex-
changce com-ponent of project expenditure is low.
12.       Indonesia has received   24 IDA credits amounting to  US$332.9
rillion.  Annaex II contains a sumaiary statement of IDA credits and IF' investments
as of November 30,1972, and notes on the execution oL on-going projects'   The
composition of this lending reflects the prioritiLes for rehabilitation and de-
velopncnt established by the 3overnment.  Indonesia's P?irst Five-Year Plan (1O9_
19Th) gives highest oriority to agriculture.   The Association has already extended
four credits to heln rehabilitate and develop planitations in the 6,overnment
estates sector. Other credits for agriculture include four to assist rehabilita-
tion of irrigation systems, one for fisheries, a-nd one to help increase rice
yields throughout Indonesia bv establishing a seed multiplication program for
hi h-yZiolding rice varieties.  jTne Association also organized a consortium of
lenders to finance a .ajor euzansion of Lhe IT;IIJ fertilizer nlant.  Aiese 11
credits account for more than half of the ;ssociationls lending to Indonesia.



-5-
13.        to assist in the rehabilitation of other priority sectors, credits
have also been extended for highways, power, telecom-ruications, industrial
financing, education, inter-island fleet rehabilitation, and population. In
additic) n, thlrce technical assistance credits have been made to finance rre-
investrent; studies undertaken by the Governm-ent, which have 1helped to establish
investr.eLt priorities over a wride range of activities.
11        ' he first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968,
and  16  of the  24 credits have been made since July, 1970.   The  progran
is t.lus new, and the undisbursed portion of the credits is thereforc relatively
lar-o. Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institutional
reforins involving, inter alia, the creation of new project autlhorities, drafting
of nClw charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of wihich have taken, irn
most cases, much time. Several credits - including the first t-wo for agricul-
tural estates projects - have experienced delays in disbursement because of
rana7.ement problems (Annex II).
15f.      A credit for a smallhol-derdevelopment project has been negotiated.
In addition, projects for snallholder and private tea estate developrent, sugar
industry rehabilitation, lhighways, a the2mnr.al power station, telecommunications,
an indust-rial estate, and education are expected to he presented to the I>ecutive
3Lrectors in the next several montths. i.rh ects in fisheries, irr-gat-ion and
ragrioultural est-ates, as well as in toumisi., wJer suaupply, and urban development
are also bein- prepared for IDA financing.
PAYT III - THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR IN IP!D01]3IA
10.       Agriculture is thle mainstay of the Ind(onesian economy, accounting for
50 pe-cent 2f OTN?, 60 percent of total exports, man  70 percent of employment.
, agricultural production is low in relation to the country'vs potential,
du, in par; to the uneven regional distr-ibution of Indonesia's population.  La3!d-
inol-dings on the den,ely pcpulated islands of Java ano Dali are very small and
fragnmented, and highly intensive rice cuvlture predoninates.  The unfavorable
physical environment and the lack of infrastructure havc limited agricul7tural
development on large parts of the sparsely populated oiter islands to estate
aaricu] tii.re Ihaspd on tree crops and to smaliholder far-ing based largely on
shif tiru cultivation of rice and subsistence crops com;bined with perennial tree
crops.

nroduction has :lccou-ited for only 3 percent of G;NE1 and less than 2 perr'er-L of
total exports. Ulthough a few large commercial enterprises have been organi;zed
-;n recent years, most livestock production is still carried out or! srallho-irMri.lrs.
Poultry, pigs, and goats are raised mainly as family "side" undertakings
About 6.1 million of Indonesia's 9.5 million cattle and buffalo are on t'le island
of Java and are kept as draft animals for crop cultivation and transport, with
meat as a by-product. Icceptions to this general pattern of cattle production
are found in the sparsely populated grassland savarnna. and forest areas of Last
1!usa Ti. l.tra, SUlawesi and Suratra where larger herds are cept primarily for

20.       The lack of lon--term credit has been a major constrairnt on livestcrk
development.   It was nol0t; until 190 thlat the Gover-muent-owned Banks (Bank Xa-.a'.t

and Pank Dananc, Indonesii' which are the princiDal instituLional sources of
cr.dit, for a-7riculSture, began to grant long,-tern- loans for livestock develorr;:ent.
At the end of 1971, outstanding long-termn loans amounted to only about :Lr !..oc
million (abouit U" a.0 mJ.llion), about 2 percent of all long-terni loans to a-nri-
c-ulture.  The short-term  credit situation has been sontolwhat better as the out-

PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project was prepared by the Asia New Zealand Develop-
ment Consultants Limited with New Zealand Government assistance and in close
collaboration with IDA's Resident Staff in Indonesia. An IDA mission appraised
the project in January/February 1972. Negotiations for the proposed credit
were held in Washington in October 1972. The Government's delegation to the
negotiations was led by Mr. J. H. Hutasoit, Director-General of Livestock
Services.
23.       The project is designed to develop systems of livestock production
and of mixed farming, through field trials, which could serve as the basis for
increasing livestock production in the outer islands. A wholly-owned Government
corporation would establish and operate six breeding-fattening ranches in South
Sulawesi and one in Sumba, of about 12,000 hectares each. These ranches would
adapt technology developed elsewhere, and would apply new techniques for con-
verting low quality grassland and scrub forests into productive mixed grass and
legume pastures and for establisbing integrated systems of crop-pasture rotation.
The project also provides for a small pilot program of credit to medium income
farmers who would utilize the technological results developed on the Government
ranches for developing their private farms. Finally, the project includes
provision for preparation of another livestock project in similar areas else-
where in Indonesia. The appraisal report "Indonesia - Beef Cattle Development
ProJect" (PA-153a) dated November 29, 1972, is being circulated to the Executive
Directors separately, and a summary project description is attached as Annex III
to this Report.
24.        After consultation with the Association, the Government has established
a Livestock Development Corporation and will appoint the members of its Board of
Managers, including the President Director who will head the Board. An Executive
Assistant to the President Director of the Corporation would manage the Department
of Animal Production and Technical Assistance and be responsible for technical
aspects of the project. It is a condition of credit effectiveness that the
members of the Board of Managers and the Executive Assistant have taken up their
responsibilities under the project. The Government would also appoint, as needed,
three ranch managers who would be responsible for the operation of the individual
Corporation ranches. The Executive Assistant to the President Director and the
ranch managers, who must be acceptable to the Association, would probably be
expatriates, given the lack of necessary expertise in Indonesia. Qualified
Indonesians would be appointed as Deputy Executive Assistant and deputy ranch
managers. These Indonesians would receive foreign training, financed by the
IDA credit, to enable them eventually to assume full responsibility for the
technical aspects of the project.
25.       The Corporation ranches would be established over three years: two
each year in South Sulawesi and the one in Sumba during the second year of the
project. The Government would lease the land required for the ranches to the
Corporation and the grant of the leases for the first two ranches would be a
condition of effectiveness. The first years of development would be mainly
devoted to resolving technical problems such as finding the most effective
means of pasture development, animal feeding and care, as well as crop and



- 8 -
pasture rotation. Investments for machinery, equiipment, pasture development,
livestock and other items for each ranch would extend over a five-year period.
lisbursements for the entire ranch development program would be spread over
seven years.  WIhile the Corporation would be heavily involved in experimenting
with new production techniques, particularly during the early years, the beef
production from the seven ranches is expected to be sufficient to allow the
Corporation to operate profitably.
26.       Reliable technical results of the field trials from the Corporation's
ranches would become available two or three years after starting the project.
Accordingly, a small pilot program of credit to the private sector would be
included in the project which would commence in about the fourth year and be
completed in the seventh year of the project. Under the program, the Government
would develop the institutional and financial arrangements necessary to transfer
the new technology to a small number of selected cattle producers of medium
income who would be willinc, and able to use the new techniques. The Covernment
would provide credit through the State-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia under arrange-
ments to be agreed with the Association. The Directorate General of Livestock
Services would provide the necessary supporting extension services. The Cor-
poratio: wc.uld assist this program by training extension officers and advising
the Bank Rakyat on technical matters. In order to ensure the proper phasing
and operation of the credit program, it would be a condition of disbursement
for tlhis part of the project that the Association agrees t'hat the form and
conditions of agriculture loan agreements are acceptable. -<he provision for
extension services are adequate, and the technical resl,j;is obtained by the
Corporation are sufficiently advanced to support, the private sector program.
27.       About 30 to 40 selected beef cattle producers are expected to participate
in the prorram. These farmers will, on average, control about 250 to 500 ha of
grassland, althou7h a few, especia-lly in South 'Sulawesi will have frorm 1,000 to
2,000 hectares. The scale of operations is compatible with the potential pasture
carrinc capacity in the project areas.    Parmers expected to participate are
presently Frazing relatively unproductive grasslands in South Sulawesi and Sumba,
which is unEuitable for alternative forms of development, and are earninc family
incomes of about $85O equivalent (say $170 on a per capita basis).   Inves'ments
would be made in pasture establishment and maintenance, fencin.c, water and stock
handlinr facilities, machinery and equipment and purchase of feeder steers. This
program would constitute a pioneering effort to develop a private livestock industry
in the outer islands.
28.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be UTS$7.2 milliorn o
which the foreign exchange component would be about $3.0 million.   The proposed
ID, credit of US$3.6 million wrould finance about 50 percent of total project
co,st, inclLdinf US$C06 million of local costs. For the developmient of the seven
Government ranches, the Coverrnmenc would pass on to the Corporation US$3.2 million
of the IDA credit in the forn cf equity ($2.6 rmillion) and a loan ($o.6 million)
under the  terms of a subsidiary financing agreement, acceptable to the Association.
That agreement would also commit the Government to provide the remaining cost of
the ranch development project through a lon,-term loan. The IDA contribution
would finance slightly more than half of the cost of the Corporation's ranch
development program includine the foreian exchange costs of consultarts' salaries
and overseas training of Corporation staff. The balance of the IDA credit,
US$004 million, would finance about 45 percent of the total cost of the Govern-
micnt' s private sector credit program and 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the project preparation study. The Government would also finance about



- 9 -
l45 percent of the credit program, and project farmers would cover the remaininr
10 percent through contributions in cash or in kind to their farm development
projects.
29.       Contracts in excess of US$25,000 for vehicles, machinery, equipment and
mpterials for ranch development would be subject to the Association's normal
requirements for international competitive bidding.   Contracts will be bulked
to the extent possible for procurement of fencing materials (aggregating about
Us$100,000), materials for pasture development (about US$1.1 million), vehicles
(about US$110,000),watering facilities (about US$230,000) and machinery and
equipment (Us$160,000). However, since such contracts for machinery and equip-
ment under the last two categories would be small and foreign firms are well-
represented in Indonesia, the advertisement of such contracts could, at the
option of the Government, be limited to newspapers of general circulation in
Indonesia. Purchases of livestock (aggregating about US$1.7 million) would be
made locally, as development would be based on local cattle breeds available
only in Indonesia. Minor civil works (aggregating US$1h0,000) would be phased
during the disbursement period and would be small and geographically scattered.
They would not be subject to international competitive bidding. The Corporation
in these cases would procure by domestic competitive bidding or prudent shopping,
whichever would be most appropriate to obtain a competitive price.   Procurement
under the pilot program would be by individual cattlemen through normal commercial
channels.
30.       Under current Indonesian law, imported goods for projects financed by
official aid are exempted from customs duties and there are no duty arrangements
favoring any country for goods procured under the project. Whenever international
competitive bidding is required under the project, a preference margin of 15 per-
cent or the actual tariff, whichever is less, would be granted to qualified local
manufacturers of these goods.
31.       The project will contribute to the development of livestock production
in Indonesia. At full development annual production would amount to 10,000
steers for export, 1,200 tons of carcass beef for the domestic market, 2,500
breeding heifers and 180 bulls. The value of annual incremental production
under the project would amount to about US$1.8 million, of which about US$1.0
million would be for export (about 9 percent of the present value of annual
exports of all livestock and livestock products). However, the principal
justification of the project is that it provides for the adaptation of advanced
livestock production technology to Indonesia conditions. The modern livestock
and mixed farming techniques to be developed by the Corporation and the institu-
tional arrangements set up under the private credit program are expected to
provide the basis for the longer-term development of an efficient livestock
industry in the outer islands of the country. The substantial demonstration
benefits expected to be derived from the project cannot be quantified at this
time. But even without accounting for these benefits, and charging the costs
of developing the new technology to the project as an investment just to
increase production, the return to the economy would be at least 10 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit, are being distributed

the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

C.      PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 127 - Irrigation Rehabilitation
This project has progressed well and irrigation works are scheduled for
completion in March 1974.   In order to obtain full economic benefits from the
project the remainder of the drainage works must be completed, and this is
expected to take until mid-1975 which is about one year behind schedule.   At the
time of appraisal of the irrigation rehabilitation project a sensitivity
analysis was carried out allowing for a two year delay in construction.   In no
case did the economic return drop below 20 percent.
Credit No. 135 - Technical Assistance
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing satis-
factorily and the credit is nearly fully committed0
Credit No. 154 - Highways
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and a specific
highway rehabilitation program,   Initial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank pr -urement procedures
and administrative inefficiencies in disbursement of loc a funds.   The project
is now progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 155 - Agricultural Estates
This project is about one year behind its original schedule due to delay
in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors.    The project develop-
ment program is now being followed satisfactorily with the exception of oil palm
planting and replanting programs, which have been restricted by an unforeseen
lack of suitable planting materials.   However, suitable material is now being
produced.   The project also suffers from weak management and inadequate Government
control of the estates involved.   A timetable of specific improvements and
managerial changes is being discussed with the Government.    The Government is also
reviewing the findings of a management survey report (financed under Credit No. 216)
covering all Government agricultural estates, and is discussing with the Association
the implications of the consultants' recommendations for estates in which IDA
credit funds have been, or are being, invested.
Credit No. 165 - Electricity Listribution
Tnis project is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 193 - PUSRI Fertilizer E&pansion
This project is nearly a year behind schedule because of the time required
to select contractors and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all parties.
Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I (construction of an ammonia-urea
fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons of urea) has
progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus arrangement,
are now ahead of the new schedule.   Part II (construction and installation of a
natural gas gathering system and a 65-mile transmission line to the fertilizer
complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other industrial users) is



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 5
lagging somewhat due in part to the difficulty that Pertamina has had in working
with the contractors that it has selected.
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about 15 percent
over the Appraisal Report figures.   Part I shows an increase of between 5 and
10 percent, largely due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as
detailed design progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became
known.   Part II has been enlarged to increase traismission of gas, in part bo
meet the needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased
(60 percent) usage by other industries.   This has increased the cost of Part II
by about 60 percent but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer complex.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in increased
foreign exchange costs of $11.5 million equivalent, including contingencies and a
potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes the facilities ahead
of the agreed schedule. In accordance with its loan agreement with the co-lenders
the Government is responsible for covering the additional financing required to
complete both parts of the project.   As coordinator of the lenders, IDA has
been asked to provide additional financing and to encourage the other lenders to
also contribute. IDA has informed the Government that it will not make additional
financing available for the project, Some of the other lenders are considering
the Government's request. Alternative sources of financing are also being
explored by the Government with IDA's assistance.
Additional fertilizer production is still badly needed in Indonesia and
IDA has assisted the Government in initial steps in preparing a feasibility study
for a second fertilizer plant. The PUSRI project continues to have a satisfactory
economic rate of return and still provides a suitable basis for the IDA credit.
Credit No. 194 - Agricultural Estates II
Comments on the progress of this project are the same as Credit No. 155
above.   The managerial problems are, however, not so acute.
Credit No0 195 - Irrigation Rehabilitation II
There were initial delays in disbursement on this project, due to difficulties
in establishing a new project authority and in following procurement procedures.
However, construction contracts have now been awarded and disbursements are
progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 210 - Telecommunications EKpansion
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project is now
progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the tropospheric
scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants retained to study
the telecommunications authority and recommend remedial measures have completed
their work and have also been retained to implement the recommendations.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5
Credit No. 211 - Fisheries
This project is about one year behind the original implementation schedule
and disbursements are low.   The principal cause for the delay has been the
unsatisfactory management and engineering assistance.   Arrangements with new
engineering consultants have been concluded and proposals for improved management
assistance to the project are being considered by the Governnent.   Prospects for
successful project implementation remain good.
Credit No. 216 - Technical Assistance II
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 219 - Education
Implementation of this project fell a year behind schedule due to delays in
the Government's evaluation of consultants and to uncertainties regarding the
liability of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian income tax.    A
contract with consultants was signed in June 1972, and the project is now pro-
gressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 220 - Irrigation Rehabilitation III
Necessary rehabilitation of irrigation works has been found to be much more
extensive than originally estimated.    To allow credit disbursements to be con-
tinued throughout the project execution period, the disbursement rate for civil
works contracts has been lowered.   While the project is behind the original
schedule, major contracts are now being awarded and disbursements are expected
to increase rapidly.
Credit No. 246 - Seeds
Progress of this project has been hampered by delays in the provision of
funds by the Government and by slow procurement of equipment.    Remedial action
has been taken by the Government, and the project is now expected to progress
satisfactorily.
Credit No. 259 - Tea
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 260 - Highways II
Progress on this project is satisfactory.
Credit No. 275 - Technical Assistance III
Progress on this project is satisfactory.
Credit No. 288 - Education II
Progress on this project is satisfactory.

Credit 1No. 289 - Irrigation Rehabilitation IV
This relatively new project was declared effective in May 1972.   Studies
on groundwater availability, water storage, and further rehabilitation projects
are underway.   The consultants for the main project commenced work in June 1972,
and first civil works contracts are expected to be awarded in May 1973.   An
agricultural extension advisor is still being sought.
Credit No. 300 - Population
This credit was declared effective on November 2, 1972.
Credit No. 310 - Development Finance
This credit was declared effective on August 10, 1972 and the project is
progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 318 - Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation
This credit became effective on October 19, 1972 and initial progress is
satisfactory.
Credit No. 319 - Fourth Agricultural Bstates
The original terminal date for effectiveness of this credit of November 30,
1972 has been postponed to January 31, 1973, to give the Government additional
time to appoint executive assistants for oil palm, rubber and commercial operations.
Credit No. 334 - Second Electricity Distribution
The original terminal date for effectiveness of this credit was November 20,
1972.   It has been postponed to December 20, 1972, to allow the Govemrment
additional time to issue the legal opinion.
