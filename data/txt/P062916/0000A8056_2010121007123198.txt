                         Strengthening Bangladesh Bank to Become a Modern Central Bank
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Government's drive for a strong and effective regulatory and supervisory system for Bangladesh's banking sector has gained new momentum. The World Bank is supporting the
                         Government's initiative through the Central Bank Strengthening Project (CBSP) to enable Bangladesh Bank (BB) to play its role as the country's monetary authority, bank regulator
                         and supervisor.
                         The Development Objective of CBSP, in support of the Government's priority, is to achieve a strong and effective regulatory and supervisory system for Bangladesh's banking sector.
                         Towards attaining this Development Objective, the project has supported the following initiatives.
                                  Development and adoption of appropriate policy manuals, regulations and guidelines to strengthen BB's regulatory and supervisory capacity
                                  Establishment of a Policy Analysis Unit (PAU) to strengthened BB's capacity for research and monetary policy formulation;
                                  Development of modern Human Resources (HR) policies in BB including: (i) human resource planning; (ii) recruitment of new skills; (iii) promotion and rotation; (iv)
                         compensation; (v) development of specialist career streams and a "fast-tracking" policy, and (vi) adoption of a Performance Management System (PMS).
                                  Training of 2200 Bangladesh Bank staff on Information technology and computers. In addition, 540 staff participated in overseas training and 547 staff in local training on
                         different functional areas of central banking.
                                  Automation of work process at Bangladesh Bank through setting up Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN) systems which link all the 8 branches of BB and
                         the head office and provide all the staff with intranet and internet facilities. Also, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has already been installed in BB which will go live in September
                         2010 automating BB's manual processes for accounts and internal audit.

                         Overall the project has made significant and visible progress on all fronts. Particularly notable is the completion of all procurement actions and signing of contracts. The recent World
                         Bank mission team was pleased to note that the Bangladesh Bank project team has been energized with strong support from the Governor of Bangladesh Bank.

                         The recent mission reviewed the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the project and considers the likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objective based on
                         implementation ratings and outcome to be good. However, the disbursement at 31 percent is still very low, although 80 percent of the funds is now fully committed and expected to
                         be disbursed within the next 15 months.

                         The mission also reviewed the other components of the project with a special emphasis on Accounting and Auditing Standards, Human Resources Development and Payment
                         Systems Development, and is satisfied with the overall progress made by BB in attending the priority areas of reform.

                         Finally, the World Bank would like to reiterate its continuous support for and cooperation with the Bangladesh government to facilitate employment generation through private sector
                         enterprise growth and in further development of the financial sector in Bangladesh

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following a review of the overall project, the mission downgraded ratings for Overall Implementation Progress (IP), Financial Management, and Project Management to Moderately
                         Unsatisfactory (MU), reflecting the team's assessment that the previous ratings were optimistic and forward looking but not reflective of the current actual performance of the Central
                         Bank to implement the project and the low level of disbursements. The team hopes to upgrade the project as soon as disbursements pick up and completion of contracts accelerates.
