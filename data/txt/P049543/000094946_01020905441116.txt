1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background to the Study
In July 1998, the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications (MOWHC) awarded the
contract for conducting a study to assess the environmental policy and management of the First
Road Sector Project (FRSP) to ARCADIS Euroconsult.
The study was initiated as a result of three major developments:
i)    the National Environment Statute of 1995 which made it mandatory for environmental
impact assessments (ElAs) to be carried out for all new development projects;
ii)   the realisation by the MOWHC that the FRSP would include major road works requiring
ElAs; and
iii)   increased funding for road sector activities by donors who stipulate environmental
assessments as a condition of funding.
In addition, the World Bank (which is supporting the FRSP through the International
Development Association) requires both road-specific and sectoral environmental assessments
for all activities in all sectors to which it provides assistance.
The FRSP's strategy for integrating environmental concerns into road sector activities is to:
a)    identify the sectoral environmental impacts of the road program  on Ugandan
environmental management system, on the planning process and on the policy,
regulatory and institutional framework; and
b)    conduct site-specific impact assessments for each of the planned road sections and
elaborating on activities that will mitigate these impacts and contribute to
environmentally sound use of the land and its resources adjacent to the proposed road
works.
This study addresses the first component, focusing on environmental policy and management as
the basis of the Sectoral Environmental Assessment for the road sector in Uganda.
1.2 Objectives of the FRSP Environmental Policy and Management Assessment Study
The objectives of the study can be summarised as follows:
i) to assist the Government of Uganda to identify the status of the country's procedures for
conducting ELAs of road sector projects by reviewing policies, regulations and the
institutional framework for conducting EIAs;
ii) to identify the most critical constraints to environmental management of the road sector in
Uganda;
iii) to develop sector specific environmental impact assessment guidelines;
iv) to streamline and standardise the EIA process for road works in Uganda.
These objectives are elaborated in the Terms of Reference (TOR) presented in Annex 1.



7
This study intends to achieve these objectives by:
* illustrating how environmental concerns can be integrated into road construction,
rehabilitation, improvement or routine/periodic maintenance;
*  establishing the modalities of setting up units within the MOWHC and RAFU/road agency
that will be responsible for environmental management and related issues;
*  indicating training needs to undertake environmental assessments;
*  developing practical guidelines for environmental impact assessment applicable to the road
sector in Uganda.
1.3 Study Methodolotv
The Inception Phase of this study began in early July 1998. At this stage, however, the contract
for the study had been signed by ARCADIS Euroconsult but not by the MOWHC.
Understandably, until the contract had been signed by both parties, ARCADIS Euroconsult was
hesitant to mobilise the entire study team. So for this phase, the Team Leader and Institutional
Expert were mobilised and instructed to begin work on the study.
The contract was signed in mid-August 1998.
The postponement in mobilising the entire team resulted in a number of changes to the study
workplan as proposed in the Technical Proposal. The changes were essentially related to the
deferment of certain tasks from Phase I to Phase 11. This, however, did not affect the overall
output of the study.
Much of the first phase was spent on familiarisation with road sector activities and national
environmental procedures and regulations through perusing documentation; holding meetings
with affected parties, such as the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and the
Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) among others; and field visits to Luwero and Mpigi Districts.
Phase ll of the study got underway in mid-August. All the team members were deployed for this
phase. Again, documentation was reviewed, and meetings were held with various stakeholders,
organisations and institutions. During this phase, field trips were made to inspect the following
FRSP roads: Jinja-Tororo Road, Mbale-Namunsi Road, Sironko-Kapchorwa Road, Mbale-
Pallisa Road, Pallisa-Kumi Road, Pallisa-Tirinyi Road, Mbarara-Ntungamo Road, and the
Kabale-Kisoro Road. These roads were selected on the basis of the different environmental and
social situations through or near which they pass; eg. wetlands in Pallisa and Kumi Districts;
mountainous/hilly terrain in Kabale and Kisoro where erosion protection measures such as
terracing are practised, and Kapchorwa where they are not; and the Jinja-Tororo Road being a
busy trunk road.
The initial findings of the study were presented at a workshop held at the Public Works Training
Centre (PWTC) at Kyambogo on 30th September 1998. The workshop was attended by
participants from the MOWHC, NEMA and various other government and non-government
organisations that would play a role in road sector environmental management. The main issues
discussed at the workshop pertained to the nature of the environmental guidelines and the
procedures for conducting EIAs, and the institutional and training aspects of the study.
A Project Steering Committee (PSC) was set up to provide a platform for liaison between the
stakeholders, MOWHC and the study team, and to give general guidance to the study team. The
PSC comprised personnel from the MOWHC, NEMA, USAID and UWA. The first PSC meeting
was held on 8th October 1998. Its purpose was to update the PSC members on the progress of



8
the study, explain the role of the Steering Committee and give an overview of the outcome of the
workshop held on 30th September 1998 at Kyambogo. The consultant also requested some
clarification on specific institutional aspects, these being confirmation of the acceptability of an
environmental unit (EU) within RAFU, and an indication of the preferred location of an
environmental liaison unit (ELU) within the MOWHC. With regard to the guidelines, the
possibility of undertaking the first four steps in the EIA process (ie. preparation of the project
brief, screening, scoping, preparation of terms of reference for the environmental study)
simultaneously was discussed with a view to streamline the EIA process to avoid delays in road
project implementation. This suggestion was affirmed by NEMA.
A second PSC meeting was held on 23rd October 1998. The main issues discussed at this
meeting revolved around the location of the ELU. The consultant outlined the pros and cons of
various options proposed for the location of the unit, while the MOWHC circulated a paper that
indicated its preferred position as being within its Policy Analysis Unit.
The overall implementation of the study has more or less complied with its revised workplan as
indicated in the Inception Report.
1.4 ReDort Organisation
The findings and recommendations of this study have been presented in four volumes, in order to
separate the distinct study components. These are:
Volume I     The Executive Summary
Volume II    Main Report
Volume III    Road Sector EIA Guidelines
Volume IV    Environmental Management Resources
The Executive Summary is presented in Volume I. It gives a brief description of the study,
summarises the components of the FRSP, indicates institutional changes within the road sector
and lists NEMA's initiatives in road sector (and national) environmental management. The
document highlights the main issues that have emerged during the course of the study.
Summaries are provided of the proposed implementation plan and budget for implementation.
This document is the Main Report, which looks at various aspects related to the institutional
framework for environmental management within the MOWHC and as applicable to the FRSP. It
is aimed at decision-makers, including top level management in the MOWHC (these being the
Permanent Secretary, the Engineer-in-Chief, Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners); the
Director, Deputy Directors and Heads of Division of RAFU and the future Road Agency (RA),
and donor agencies involved in the road sector.
The Main Report begins by describing the current institutional setting in the light of the Post
Constitutional Restructuring of the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications (Final
Report, May 1998) and how this will affect environmental management in the road sector. The
report also describes the role of the proposed environmental liaison unit (ELU) in the MOWHC
and the environmental unit (EU) in Road Agency Formation Unit (which forms the transition to
the establishment of a road agency).  Training requirements for personnel involved in
environmental management in the road sector within the MOWHC, and to some extent in RAFU,
are discussed. The report describes local capacity to conduct ElAs.  It also discusses the need
for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in road sector environmental management and
possible locations for such a unit. In order to assess the performance of the FRSP at national



9
level, recommendations have been made for impact indicators, their monitoring, and for
conducting evaluations of the road sector. Finally an implementation plan has been developed
which highlights tasks that need to be done in order to ensure the incorporation of environmental
considerations into road sector activities. A budget for execution of these tasks is provided.
EIA guidelines have been developed specifically for the road sector, and the roles and functions
of the ELU and EU, as well as the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) are
specified. These guidelines are presented in Volume III of this report.
Volume IV is intended as a reference document for road engineers within the MOWHC, RAFU
(road agency), firms of consulting engineers, environmental practitioners and any individuals
interested in environmental issues related to the road sector. The document gives a description of
the legal framework for environmental management of the road sector. The physical, natural and
social environment of Uganda is presented as applicable to the FRSP and the road sector. The
report also presents, as a guide, an analysis of the types of impacts that may arise from road
works activities, indicating possible mitigation measures and responsibility for monitoring. The
importance of public participation in project planning and environmental assessment is
addressed. Of particular use to road engineers and EIA practitioners is a listing of environmental
considerations that are included in existing MOWHC documentation.

2. THE ROAD SECTOR IN UGANDA
2.1 General
A fundamental requisite for stimulating socio-economic development, maintaining security and
consolidating national unity within the country is to have well-developed transport infrastructure,
which includes road, rail, ferry and air transport.
The Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications is responsible for the planning, design,
construction, improvement and maintenance of all roads, railways, airports and waterways.
Road transportation is the most important mode of transport in Uganda, carrying an estimated
90% of passenger and freight traffic. In addition, the road network links the eastern-most part of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi to the Indian Ocean
port of Mombasa in Kenya.
Indeed, the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, has declared that roads be given the highest
priority in the development of infrastructure in the country.
2.2 The Road Network
The road transport system in Uganda totals some 60,000 km, and is categorised into Classified or
Main Roads, Rural Feeder Roads, Urban Roads and Community Roads. Classified main roads,
rural feeder roads and urban roads have been inventoried and make up half of the total network.
Community roads are not inventoried. Table 2.1 below gives a breakdown of each road category.
Table 2.1:    Road Network Categories
Road Category            Length (Km)              % of Total
Classified Main Roads                    9,625                        15.8
Rural Feeder Roads                      20,168                        33.2
Urban Roads                               1,000                        1.7
Community Roads                         30,000                        49.3
Total                                   60,793                       100.0

MOWHC (pers. comm).
2.2.1 Classified Main Roads
Classified main roads cover a length of 9,625 km, of which approximately 23% is paved while
77% is gravel.
There are three types of roads within the main road network: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary
roads. The functions of each of these are summarised below.



11
Primary Roads                      * connect major urbanised regions;
a connect major commercial centres;
. connect ports of entry, facilitating transnational
traffic;
* connect major international airports
Secondary Roads                    * connect regional commercial centres to major
ones;
. connect district administrative centres to the
Primary Road Network;
a connect the rural feeder road system to the Primary
Road Network.
Tertiary Roads                     * connect local streets and community centres to the
Secondary Road Network;
* connect rural areas and small communities to
district administrative centres and other public
services.
2.2.2 Rural Feeder Roads and Urban Roads
The rural feeder and urban roads jointly make up the unclassified road network. Rural roads
provide access for rural communities in the major agricultural areas.
Nearly all the rural feeder roads have gravel or earth surfaces. About 60% of the urban roads are
paved and the remainder are gravelled.
The responsibility for both rural feeder roads and urban roads fell under the Local Authorities,
but have recently been moved to the MOWHC.
2.2.3 Community Roads
These are also known as "unproclaimed roads." They link small settlements and individual
homesteads to the rural feeder road system. They are predominantly earth roads.
Community roads are maintained by local communities or individuals.
2.3 The Status of the Road Network
2.3.1 Condition of the Road Network
Approximately 72% of the classified main road network is regarded as being in fair to very good
condition. This includes 87% of the paved roads and 68% of the gravel roads.
Rehabilitation of about 50% of the rural feeder roads network has been undertaken over the past
decade through various donor-supported activities.
Only about one quarter of the urban roads in Kampala have been rehabilitated to date.



12
The condition of community roads varies throughout the country depending oni the importance
placed on the roads by the individuals or local communities.
2.3.2 Funding
Between 1995 and 1998, the GOU adopted the Four Year National Prioritised Main Roads
Maintenance Programme. Under this programme, road financing was as follows:
Table 2.2:    Financing of the Four Year Main Roads Maintenance Programme
(in billion UShs)
Funding Source        1994/5      1995/6      1996/7      1997/8           Total
Government               13.5       17.0        20.0        24.0            74.5
Donors                   11.4       16.4        21.8        18.0            67.6
Total                    24.9       33.4        41.8        42.0           142.1
Source: Ten Year Road Sector Development Programme (1996/7-2005/6), Vol 2
The GOU recognises that it is responsible for maintenance of main roads, and intends to provide
annual Government contributions which will increase every year until 100% Government
financing is achieved for road maintenance.
The financing of major road rehabilitation and construction projects has been largely donor-
supported.
2.3.3 Organisation and Management
As a result of the recent post constitutional restructuring of the Ministry of Works, Housing and
Communications, a number of changes are occurring within the MOWHC concerning its
administration, management and organisational aspects (refer Post Constitutional Restructuring
of the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications, Final Report, Mav' 1998).
The former Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications has taken on the additional
functions of the Building and Human Settlement Departments and the Building
Materials/Technology Research Station, all of which were under the Ministry of Lands, Housing
and Physical Planning. Thus the MOWTC now becomes the Ministry of Works, Housing and
Communications (MOWHC).
In addition, the Engineering Unit from the Ministry of Local Government, which dealt with
District and Urban Roads has been transferred to the MOWHC. Two new units are also proposed
which will report directly to the Permanent Secretary, namely the Policy Analysis Unit and the
Resource Centre.
The Directorate of Transport and Communications will now have three departments:
Communications, Transport Planning and Transport Regulation. The Directorate of Engineering
will also have three departments: Quality Assurance, Roads and Housing.
The Finance and Administration Department will remain with its three divisions:
Finance/Accounts, Personnel and Administration.



13
Finally, it is proposed that a national road agency be set up by mid-2000. In the meantime, the
Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) has been set up as a transition stage.
2.3.4 Environment
In the past environmental issues have not been given due attention by the MOWHC, and
environmental impact assessments have been carried out at the behest of donors supporting
particular road projects.
With the establishment of NEMA, environmental matters are receiving more consideration in all
sectors. The Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1998, require that all projects
falling under the Third Schedule of the National Environment Statute of 1995 must implement
ElAs in accordance with the procedures set out in these Regulations. Major road construction
and rehabilitation projects fall into this category.
2.3.5 Constraints
Major constraints related to the road network in Uganda include:
-      rehabilitation backlog;
-      heavily trafficked gravel road links;
-     poor road drainage structures;
-     traffic congestion throughout the Kampala urban and suburban zones;
-     axle overloading;
-     accident black spots;
-      inadequate design;
-      insufficient road financing mechanism.
In addition there are a number of institutional setbacks:
-      fragmented road administration organisational set up;
-      lack of a cost-effective road management approach;
-      inadequately trained manpower for feeder road management at Local Administration
level;
-     poor motivation of staff;
-      insufficient plant and equipment for carrying out maintenance activities;
-      inadequately equipped physical facilities such as maintenance workshops, office
accommodation, furniture and communications;
-      lack of capacity within the private sector local construction industry.
2.4 First Road Sector Proiect
2.4.1 The Ten Year Road Sector Development Project
The Ten Year Road Sector Development Programme (RSDP) was formulated by the GOU to
provide a framework for improving the efficiency and safety of the road network by removing
the major constraints over a ten year period from Fiscal Year 1996/7 to 2005/6. (refer Ten-Year
Road Sector Development Programme (1996/7-2005/6), October 1996). The RSDP has been
divided into two phases; the first phase covers the first five years of the programme and is known



14
as the First Road Sector Project.
The objectives of the RSDP are to:
i)    provide a road network which will meet the present and future traffic demand and at the
same time enhancing road safety and environmental protection by carrying out effective
maintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading of the major road network, and by
constructing new links where justifiable;
ii)    establish and develop a road administration mechanism that will ensure an efficient and
effective road network;
iii)   enhance the capacity of the local construction industry.
2.4.2 FRSP Project Components
Activities within the FRSP fall into three components: road network links, road network
improvement and road network administration and capacity building.
Component A: Road Network Links
Roads in the network have been prioritised for manual routine maintenance, mechanical routine
maintenance and periodic maintenance
Component B: Road Network Improvement
Under this component, the following two lane roads will be upgraded to 4 lane dual
carriageways, entailing capacity improvement of about 32 km of urban sections of trunk roads
originating in Kampala:
-     Kibuye - Busega Road
-     Kibuye - Makindye Road
-     Nalufenya - Roundabout - Njeru Road
-     Kampala - Ggaba Road
-     Kampala - Port Bell Road
-     Kampala - Banda - Bweyogerere Road.
The component also involves pavement strengthening of selected main roads as follows:
-     Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal, Equator Road and Kasese - Kilembe Roads
-     Jinja - Malaba and Busia - Muwayo Roads
-     Tank Hill and Luzira - Butabika Roads
-     Kampala (Kasubi) - Nansana Road
-     Mbale - Namunsi Road
-     Mbarara - Ntungamo Road
Selected roads will be upgraded to paved standard:
-     Gayaza - Bugema - Zirobwe Road, and Gayaza - Kalagi Road
-     Ntungamo - Rukingiri - Ishasha Road
-     Kyotera - Mutukula Road
-     Fort Portal - Bundibugyo Road
-     Busunju - Hoima Road
-     Sironko - Muyembe - Kapchorwa - Suam Road
-     Karuma - Pakwach - Arua Road



15
Matugga - Semuto - Kapeeka and Butalangwa - Luwero Roads
Kabale - Kisoro - Bunagana Road
Masindi - Kafu Road
Kyenjojo - Mubende Road
Tirinyi - Pallisa - Kumi and Mbale - Pallisa Roads
Some 1,700 km of feeder roads are to be upgraded. The component proposes a rural feeder road
programming study and a national project for the provision of drainage structures for feeder and
community roads.
The Kampala Bypass will be constructed under this component.
A number of studies are proposed under this component. These include:
-     Road Safety Improvement Study (proposals have been invited)
-     Rehabilitation of Bridges Phase II Study
-     Malaba Border Post Improvement Study
-     Kampala City Traffic Flow Improvement Study.
Component C: Road Network Administration and Capacity Building
Institutional building and technical assistance under this component includes, among others,
programme coordination; establishment of the RSDP Transitional Management Unit and
Management Information System; developing capacity within the local construction industry;
Road Administration and Road Fund Studies; Road Network Management Policy Study (the
contract for which is currently being negotiated); Road Financing and Cost Recovery
Management Study (tenders have been invited), and TA for the Training Production Unit and the
Central Materials Laboratory.
Physical facilities such as the upcountry mechanical workshops, Central Materials Laboratory
and the Training Production Unit will be rehabilitated, while regional training centres and
regional maintenance/testing laboratories will be established.
Studies to be undertaken under this component include:
-     Transport Sector Strategy Study (tenders have been invited)
-     Transport Master Plan
-     Highway Capacity and Axle Load Control Study
-     Study to Improve Rural Community Transport Services
-     Standardisation of Non-Conventional Chemical Stabilisation of Road Pavements
-     Implementation Manual and Management Information System for the Rehabilitation,
Improvement and Maintenance of Rural Feeder Roads (at proposal stage)
-     Rural Roads Strategy Review.
Rehabilitation of plant and equipment will also take place and a plant hire pool will be
established.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE FRSP
3.1 Impacts of FRSP on the Environmental Management Svstem in U2anda
From the description of the FRSP in the previous chapter, it is apparent that the FRSP affects all
levels of roads, ie. classified roads and unclassified roads, paved and unpaved roads, and feeder
roads throughout the country.
Roads play a major role in the economic development of the country, impacting on several
sectors. Farm inputs such as fertilisers, insecticides, etc, are conveyed along roads to the
farmers, while agricultural products (food crops, cash crops, horticultural crops) are transported
to markets within the country and in neighbouring countries. Non-perishable goods and industrial
products are taken to and from centres along the road network. Uganda's road network provides
a transit route for inter-country traffic by linking Rwanda, Burundi, southern Sudan and the
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the Indian Ocean, thus earning the
country much-needed foreign exchange. Roads connect major tourist destinations to airports and
border posts. They are instrumental in the maintenance of security. Finally, roads provide access
to health centres, schools and the district administration centres.
The FRSP will undoubtedly influence all these sectors. Its activities may induce envirohmental
changes that could directly or indirectly affect agriculture, commerce, industry, wildlife, tourism,
health or education. Consequently, it is imperative that the approach for environmental
management of the road sector is multi-sectoral.
Precisely because of this multi-sectoral nature of the impacts of road projects, a number of
agencies or stakeholders must be involved at various stages of the road planning cycle. The most
important of these is the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) which is
mandated by law to be "the principal agency in Uganda for the management of the environment"
(Refer the  National Environment Statute,  1995).       Other stakeholders  are  the
ministries/departments responsible for the sectors mentioned above, and of course, the public -
ie. road users and those who benefit from the road.
To date there has been little coordination between the MOWHC, NEMA and other government
ministries or departments. Environmental impact assessments are done in an ad hoc manner,
usually at the behest of a donor. When EIAs are commissioned, practitioners are restricted by the
time and financial constraints dictated by the budgets for the feasibility studies, and are often
unable to address pertinent environmental and social issues to the desirable extent. Cognisant
environmental considerations in day to day road works activities, such as maintenance, are non-
existent.
The outputs of this study will contribute to streamlining environmental management systems in
the road sector in Uganda, particularly in terms of:
. illustrating how environmental concerns can be integrated into road construction,
rehabilitation, improvement or routine/periodic maintenance;
*  establishing the modalities of setting up units within the MOWHC and RAFU that will be
responsible for environmental management and related issues;
*  developing practical guidelines for environmental impact assessment applicable to the road
sector in Uganda;



17
*  indicating training needs to undertake environmental assessments;
*  encouraging inter-ministerial/departmental cooperation in addressing environmental issues;
and
* involving the public at critical stages in the road project planning cycle.
3.2 Major Environmental Impacts of Roads and Road Works in Uganda
The magnitude and significance of impacts due to a road or road works activities will be
influenced by the type of road (whether it is a major highway or a rural road), its proposed design
(eg. whether a realignment is planned, in which case the length of the realignment and the
terrain/nature of land it traverses ), the purpose of the road and who it is supposed to serve. The
construction of a new road is likely to cause more significant impacts than the rehabilitation,
improvement or maintenance of an existing road.
While in most cases roads or road works impact on the environment, in some instances the
environment affects roads. The physical, natural or sociological environment through which a
road passes will also determine the magnitude of any impacts.
The most common environmental factors relating to roads in Uganda, and having both positive
and negative impacts, can be listed as:
* increased runoff
* changes in land use
* soil stability and erosion
* changes in hydrology/drainage and impacts on wetlands
* exploitation of quarries and borrow. pits
* pollution
* depletion of forest areas
* risk to protected areas and wildlife
* socio-economic aspects
* impacts resulting from service amenities for the workforce
* impacts on public health
* road safety
* impacts on sites of historic or cultural value.
Possible impacts due to these factors, contributing causes and examples of mitigation are
summarised in Table 3.1. The table is by no means exhaustive, and should be regarded only as
indicative in order to give a general idea as to the type and nature of the impacts that might be
expected from road works activities.

3.3 Environmental Impacts of Roads under the FRSP
It is seen from Section 3.1 and Table 3.1 that roads are fundamental to the development of the
country and provide a considerable number of socio-economic benefits. It is for this reason that
roads are usually built. In general, the social and economic benefits due to a road tend to
outweigh the environmental disadvantages. However, these disadvantages cannot be dismissed
as they will eventually impact on the public. As awareness of the value of the environment
increases, there will be a growing demand to prevent and/or mitigate adverse impacts.
This section summarises very briefly the most significant environmental impacts of some of the
sub-projects listed in the Road Network Improvement component of the FRSP (see Chapter 2)
and is based on available reports. For sub-projects where EIA reports were not available or EIA
studies have not yet been carried out, an indication of major environmental considerations is
given. All roads, except the Kampala Bypass, are existing, but it has not been established in all
cases whether realignments are necessary.
It will be noted that ALL impacts due to FRSP roads have not been listed as these will be
similar to those described in Table 3.1 above; instead in each case environmental concerns
that would warrant special attention have been highlighted.
3.3.1 Upgrading Urban Sections of Trunk Roads
The roads to be upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane are the Kibuye-Busega Road, Kibuye-Makindve
Road, Nalufenya-Njeru Road, and roads from Kampala to Ggaba, Port Bell, Banda and
Bweyogerere. These roads all lie within urban, suburban or peri-urban areas and so the natural
and physical environment in the areas of direct influence have already been considerably altered.
Issues of particular concern will therefore include:
* acquisition of land for road and road reserve, quarries and deviations for which compensation
will have to be paid;
* properties within the road reserve;
* nuisance caused by diversions (traffic);
x pedestrian and cyclist safety;
* dust, fumes and noise pollution during and after construction, resulting from road works
activities such as quarrying, earthworks, asphalt and crushing plants, construction and road
traffic.
3.3.2 Pavement Strengthening
Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal Road
An EIA was carried out for this road (refer Sabbour Associates, January 1996). The Katunguru-
Kasese section of the road passes through Queen Elizabeth National Park, which means there will
be high speed traffic through a protected area. The road also crosses the Kazinga Channel. The
stretch from Kikorongo to Muhokya and towards Fort Portal will pass through wetland areas.
Anticipated impacts of significance would include:
* disturbance to/destruction of wildlife habitats;
 disturbance to wildlife and disruption of wildlife movement;



21
*  impacts associated with increased number of tourists visiting the park (generation of solid
waste, demand for water and fuelwood, new lodges/camps, increased traffic within park, etc).
*  impacts on wetland areas (including Kazinga Channel, Lake George).
Equator Road
This road runs along the northern boundary of Queen Elizabeth National Park to Katojo and on to
Bwera and Mpondwe on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Consideration here
would be given to the fact that the road actually provides a more direct route to DRC, making it
more attractive for border-bound traffic than the route through Katwe. The road would therefore
benefit the park in that traffic would circumvent it.
Kasese - Kilembe Road
This road leads to a copper mine in Kilembe, which is at the base of the Ruwenzori Mountains.
Here the issues to note are:
* soil erosion and potential landslides due to the mountainous terrain;
* access to Ruwenzori Mountains and its implications on encroachment into national park and
its buffer zone (may lead to poaching and tree felling);
increased tourist numbers to Ruwenzori Mountains National Park.
Jinja - Malaba and Busia - Muwayo Roads
These are heavily trafficked roads connecting Kampala and Jinja to towns on the Kenyan border.
The roads pass mainly through small scale agricultural holdings. The section from Bugiri to
Malaba traverses a large wetland area. At the Busia/Muwayo/Malaba junction the roads pass
through the West Bugwe Central Forest Reserve. Thus issues of concern are:
*  impact on wetland areas;
*  impact on West Bugwe Central Forest Reserve;
*  road safety and risks to pedestrians and cyclists.
Tank Hill and Luzira - Butabika Road, Kampala (Kasubi) -Nansana Road and
Mbale - Namunsi Road
These roads are located in urban/semi-urban areas. Impacts will be the same as those described in
Section 3.3.1, namely:
acquisition of land for road and road reserve, quarries and deviations for which compensation
will have to be paid;
nuisance caused by diversions (traffic);
pedestrian and cyclist safety;
dust, fumes and noise pollution during and after construction, resulting from road works
activities such as quarrying, earthworks, asphalt and crushing plants, construction and road
traffic.
Mbarara - Niungamo Road
Land use along this road is mainly small scale agriculture. The road traverses many wetland
areas, which would be the main environmental concern.



22
3.3.3 Upgrading to Paved Standard
Gayaza - Bugema - Zirobwe Road and Gayaza - Kalagi Road
These roads pass through densely populated agricultural areas. The Gayaza-Bugema-Zirobwe
Road traverses a major coffee producing area. The major considerations here will be:
* acquisition of land for road reserve, quarries, workmen's camps, due to the high population
density;
* road drainage onto farms;
* wetland areas (along Gayaza-Kalagi Road).
Ntungamo - Rukingiri - Ishasha Road
An EIA study was carried out by Roughton International in August 1994 (see References, Annex
II). The problems were typical of those shown in Table 3.1. The area of influence has a highl
population density. The road provides an alternative route from Ishasha on the DCR border to
Mbarara, eliminating the need for traffic to pass through Queen Elizabeth National Park. This is
seen as a major benefit. Problems associated with the project road are:
* acquisition of land for road reserve, quarries, workmen's camps, due to the high population
density;
- hydrological considerations due to numerous river crossings;
- wetlands.
Kyotera - Mutukula Road
Roughton International carried out an EIA on this road in August 1994. The road passes through
wetland areas, and thus the major issue here will be the impact on them.
Fort Portal - Bundibugyo Road
Sabbour Associates conducted an EIA for this road in January 1996. The road circles the
northern tip of Ruwenzori National Park. It provides access to Semliki National Park, Semliki
Forest Reserve, Semliki Wildlife Reserve and Sempaya Hot Springs. The road also links areas
inhabited by pygmies to Fort Portal. Environmental and social concerns revolve around:
* improved access to Ruwenzori and Semliki National Parks, Forest Reserve and Wildlife
Reserve and its implications on encroachment into these protected areas and their buffer
zones (may lead to poaching, tree felling, destruction of wildlife habitats, etc);
* impacts associated with increased number of tourists visiting these protected areas
(generation of solid waste, demand for water and fuelwood, new lodges/camps, increased
traffic within park, etc);
* impact on pygmy tribes (exposure to alien cultures, erosion of traditions, income generation
opportunities for the tribes, etc);
landslides and erosion due to mountainous terrain;
* impacts on security due to proximity to DCR.
Busunju - Hoima Road
The feasibility study for this sub-project is in progress and includes an EIA. The road traverses
through an agricultural area with a fairly dense population. There are many rivers/water courses
en route. The road passes through Kikonda Forest Reserve and is the main road to Murchison
Falls National Park. Issues to be addressed include:



23
*  acquisition of land for road reserve, quarries, workmen's camps, due to the high population
density;
*  hydrological considerations due to numerous river crossings;
* impacts on Murchison Falls National Park;
* impact on Kikonda Forest Reserve.
Sironko - Muyembe - Kapchorwa - Suam Road
This road circles the northern tip of Mount Elgon National Park, proceeding to Suam on the
Kenyan border. The following need consideration:
* possibilities of landslides and soil erosion due to the mountainous terrain;
* impacts associated with improved access to Mount Elgon National Park (encroachment of
buffer zone, increased tourist numbers, etc).
Karuma - Pakwach - Arua Road
An EIA was carried out in February 1997 by Associated Consulting Engineers. The prime
concern here is that the road passes through the northern part of Murchison Falls National Park,
and crosses the Albert Nile at Pakwach. It then goes on to Arua, where small scale agriculture is
the predominant land use. The major impacts are associated with:
* destruction of /disturbance to wildlife habitats;
* disruption of wildlife movement (annual migration);
impacts of improved access to Murchison Falls National Park ( increased tourist numbers,
etc);
- impacts on traffic on Lake Albert;
impacts on archaeological sites at Labong, Fajawa Fort and Stone Age Sites;
e impact on Bondo Forest Reserve (and shea butternut tree).
Matugga - Semuto - Kapeeka and Butalangwa - Luwero Roads
Both roads pass through well populated agricultural areas, and wetland areas. The roads are also
important in terms of commuter traffic to Kampala. Hence the major considerations are:
e  road safety;
e  impact on wetlands.
Kabale - Kisoro - Bunagana Road
An EIA study was carried out by Roughton International, August 1994. The road Kabale-Kisoro
section passes through Bchunya Forest Reserve, and the road is the main route to Mgahinga
National Park and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. The issues to be considered here are:
* impacts of improved access to Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks
(increased tourist numbers, improved security, etc);
* impacts on Bchunya Forest Reserve;
* landslides and soil erosion.
Masindi - Kafu Road
The EIA for this study was done by Associated Consulting Engineers in February 1997. This
road forms part of the main access to Murchison Falls National Park. The main concem would
therefore be the impacts on Murchison Falls National Park.



24
Kyenjojo - Mubende Road
This road traverses through coffee and tea growing areas. The road also passes througlh Matiri
Central Forest Reserve and wetlands near Mubende. which are the main considerations.
Tirinvi - Pallisa - Kumi and Mbale - Pallisa Roads
Land use in this area is mainly small scale agriculture. The issue of environmental concern is the
impact on the Lake Kyoga wetlands.
3.3.4 New Road Construction
The Kampala Bypass will be constructed under this component. A comparative impact
assessment of the two alignment options (northern and southern) have been studied by Gibb
(refer Gibb, February 1998). The major considerations here are:
*  impacts on wetlands (Nakivubo swamp) that act as sewage systems for Kampala;
*  acquisition of land for road and road reserve, quarries and deviations for which compensation
will have to be paid;
*  nuisance caused by diversions (traffic);
*  pedestrian and cyclist safety;
*  dust, fumes and noise pollution during and after construction, resulting from road works
activities such as quarrying, earthworks, asphalt and crushing plants, construction and road
traffic.
3.4 Critical Constraints to Environmental Manazement in the Ugandan Road Sector
There are a number of constraints to environmental management in the road sector. Among the
most fundamental of these is the lack of awareness with regard to how roads impinge on the
environment, and a lack of understanding as to the importance of environmental protection.
Road engineers typically confine themselves to the road, road structures and the road reserve.
Anything beyond that tends to be regarded as not being their responsibility. Thus a change in the
attitude of road engineers towards the environment is crucial if environmental management
within the road sector is to be successfully integrated into its activities.
Furthermore, procedures and guidelines that are currently in place are fairly complicated, and
road sector personnel are at a loss as to how to implement ElAs, and when and how they should
be done.
This study puts forward means to overcome such constraints.

4. REVIEW OF THE PRESENT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
4.1 Overview of the Present Situation
This chapter describes the main institutions concerned with road sector environmental policy, the
conduct of road sector EIAs and the implementation of mitigation measures. It considers the
relationships between them, their relevant present capacities, and considers their operating
procedures and organisation where this provides some insight into how they might incorporate
environmental concerns into their road work. The chapter does not attempt to describe all the
stakeholders of roads and the environment.
The institutional setting is critical because achievement of the study's ultimate goal will depend
not only on developing appropriate EIA methods and training staff in their application, but also
on ensuring that they are properly integrated AND that those with authority over road sector
developments are given the responsibility for their application. The Terms of Reference
recognise this in paragraph iv under 'Overall Objectives':
Streamlining and standardising the EIA process for road works, including
the incorporation of environmental considerations in all stages of a road
project from the identification and selection of roads and alignments,
through design, implementation, monitoring, and the content of works
contracts for engineering consultants.
In addition, it is a requirement of NEMA that the Ministry, as a lead agency, establishes an
Environmental Liaison Unit (ELU) and our proposal includes work in support of this. However,
it should be noted right at the outset that the Road Agency Formation Unit, currently being
formed, will lead to the transfer of most lead agency responsibilities in respect of road sector
matters and the need to place environmental management capacity in RAFU. This complicates
matters and we pick up on the point below.
The main institutions are:
*  Ministry of Works Housing and Communications which is the ministry responsible for the
road sector
*  Road Agency Formation Unit a new, semi-autonomous agency under the Ministry
responsible for road construction.
*  National Environmental Management Authority which has statutory responsibility to
review and approve ElAs.
*  The local authorities which bear responsibility for the implementation of works on rural
feeder, urban, and community roads and for overseeing management of the environment in
the districts.
* The Uganda Wildlife Authority which is responsible for protected areas
* The road contracting industry which is used by the MOWHC to implement the majority of
road works.
The consulting engineers who are used by the MOWHC for the design and supervision of
major road developments, and who have been responsible for carrying out ElAs.
As described in detail below, the situation is somewhat fluid due to the recent transfer of the
department of urban and feeder roads from the Ministry of Local Government to the Ministry of



26
Works Housing and Communications. This transfer took place under the post constitutional
restructuring of ministries. The MOWHC has still to take a number of steps internally in respect
of restructuring. The situation is likely to continue to be fluid for some time as the formation of
the Road Agency Formation Unit is underway and will lead to the eventual formation of a road
agency.
4.2 Ministrv of Works. Housin2 and Communications
The Ministry is broken into two directorates and the Department of Finance and Administration.
The Directorate of Engineering is responsible for roads. It is broken down into two departments:
Maintenance and Development each headed by a commissioner. The Maintenance Department
has divisions for Mechanical and Maintenance, and is also responsible for the 22 district stations
around the country. (Although the district stations represent the MOWHC in their full range of
responsibilities, about 75% of their work is related to roads). The Development Department has
divisions for: Materials, Planning Design and Documentation, and Construction.
The post constitutional organisation is shown in the charts on the following pages. The
reorganisation involved changing the name of the Ministry which was formerly the Ministry of
Works, Transport and Communications.
The main changes can be summarised in the following table:
Table 4.1: - Comparison of Old and New Organisation for Roads
Old                       New
Responsibilities of       Roads                      Roads, Housing, Quality
Directorate of Engineering                           Assurance
# departments responsible    2  Development and
for roads                     Maintenance)
# divisions responsible for   3                      1
construction
# divisions responsible for   1                      2 (classified, urban and
maintenance                                            feeder roads)
This reorganisation was proposed by the Ministry of Public Service. Their report recommended
further consideration of the form of the Road Agency Formation Unit. Further consideration is
indeed happening now that the Director of RAFU has taken up his post and is bringing his own
perspectives into account. It might reasonably be anticipated that the Ministry organisation
structure may be revised slightly to take any resulting developments into account.
4.2.1 Construction Planning and Delivery
Construction (which includes rehabilitation and upgrading) takes place within the context of long
term forward plans. These are prepared periodically with consultancy assistance. The most recent
is the 1 0-year Road Sector Development Project 1996/7 to 2005/6. The first 5 years of this plan is
described as the 'First Road Sector Project' which is described in detail elsewhere in this report.

The detailed design of each road is carried out by consulting engineers accordina to
specifications laid down by the Planning, Design and Documentation Division who supervise the
necessary contracts.
Construction is carried out by contractors supervised by consulting engineers. The tendering of
contracts is managed by the Planning Division, but once they are let contracts are supervised by
the Construction Division.
4.2.2 Maintenance Planning and Delivery
Maintenance planning is conducted according to an annual planning cycle timed to tie in with
government planning procedures. The starting point is the annual road condition survey carried
out by the District Engineers and their teams.
Delivery is carried out in three ways:
* using small scale labour based contractors.
* by force account (mechanised), accounting for approximately 60% of non-labour routine
maintenance and all periodic maintenance works
* by mechanised contract accounting for approximately 40% of non-labour routine
maintenance works.
There is a plan to increase the proportion of non-labour routine maintenance that is contracted
out to 80%. -
The first and second of these are essentially the responsibility of the District Engineer who
determines requirements, administers the tendering of small scale contracts, and supervises their
implementation. The tendering of mechanised contracts is managed by Ministry headquarters,
according to Bills of Quantities prepared by the District Engineers. District Engineers supervise
the contracts.
4.2.3 Training
The 'old' organisation chart shows the training unit falling under the Training Department which
was hieaded by the Assistant Commissioner for Training, who reported to the Engineer-in-Chief.
In practice the unit's head has in recent years reported directly to the Permanent Secretary in line
with the fact that the unit serves the whole Ministry.
The training unit has three sub-units: the Public Works Training Centre at Kyambogo, the
Mechanical Training Unit at the Central Mechanical Workshop, and the Training Production Unit
at Luwero.
The training unit runs courses in-house. It also sends course participants to Ugandan, regional
and international training centres. In the case of regional and international centres, arrangements
are sometimes made for trainers to be sent to Uganda for training to take place in country. It has
to be said that the use of training centres outside Uganda has been very limited in recent years.
The training unit does not at present have capacity to conduct training courses in environmental
management. At this stage of the study it can be anticipated that external (Ugandan, regional, and
international) resources will be used to deliver training.



30
The work of the training unit is set out in the document Training Policv, Programmes and
Strategiesfor 1993-1998, prepared by the Training Task Force in February 1993. However, the
actual achievement of training delivery has been affected by budgetary allocations, which where
for example about 20% of estimated requirements in the last financial year. In practice, most of
the training that has taken place in the last five years has been directly linked to donor funded
projects. As a result, much of the five year training programme will roll forward unchanged and
we understand that there are no plans at present to produce a new complete five year plan. From
this it appears likely that specific sources of funding will need to be identified for any EIA
related training.
Normal practice for training courses is to: (a) develop a course specification setting out:
objectives, benefits, target group, duration, venue and sponsor; and (b) develop a course manual
setting out course contents. This study will develop course specifications for all courses that it
recommends. These specifications will set out the range of topics that the course should cover,
but will leave the selection of venue and sponsor to the implementing agency. The exact duration
of the course will be determined later in discussion with those selected for training delivery.
Although the unit bears responsibility for coordinating all training within the MOWHC, the
situation is somewhat confused by the fact that the Road Maintenance Coordination Unit also has
responsibilities for training.
4.2.4 Road Agency Formation Unit
The Government of Uganda has declared an intention to create a road agency that will be
responsible for all roads by 2001. As part of the transition arrangements, the MOWHC is in the
process of forming the Road Agency Formation Unit. This has significant implications for this
study, because responsibility for many of the activities resulting from this study are most
appropriately located within RAFU.
Present plans for RAFU are set out in the Transitional Institutional Reforms for the
Establishment of a Road Agency prepared by the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications in April 1998. As already noted, these will inevitably be subject to a degree of
revision now that the formation of RAFU is underway. Despite its name, RAFU is intended to be
a precursor to the eventual road agency and will manage important parts of the First Road Sector
Development Project. An executive director has been appointed and the other senior positions
were advertised in mid-July 1998. It will not exist as an independent legal entity but will fall
under the Permanent Secretary. This means that although contracts will be managed by RAFU,
they will be formally let by the MOWHC.
Within three years RAFU is expected to:
i. Conduct feasibility analyses and eventually come out with final engineering designs for 22
roads and a bypass totalling 2300 km of aggregate alignment length. The corresponding 22
study contracts will be awarded to consulting engineering firms grossing a cumulative value
of US$12 million.
ii. Let out consultancy supervision and works contracts for 79 works projects both maintenance
and development for a total cost of US$ 388 million covering approximately 7000 km of
alignment length, and
iii. Supervise 79 contracts mentioned in (2) above for a total value estimated at US$ 8 million.



31
The MOWHC will be left with the following functions:
* formation of the policy framework
* sector policy with intermodal and sectoral transport strategies and programmes
* international representation and cooperation
* fund-acquisition, allocation of financial resources and cost recovery
* management of central materials laboratory and central mechanical workshop
* district level small scale maintenance (labour based and small mechanical contracts, and
force account operations)
* engineering training services
* management, evaluation and auditing of RAFU and the road agency after the transition
period.
The MOWHC will appoint a number of additional staff to manage its relationship with RAFU.
RAFU will be responsible for all contracts over UShs 250 million.
The organisation chart of RAFU is set out in the diagram overleaf. Two sections are of particular
importance to this study.
The responsibilities of RAFU's Project Preparation Section (as presently proposed) will include:
Environmental impact assessment
* Preparation of the projects included in the FRSP
*  Establishment and enforcement of quality awareness
* Control system for maintenance and construction
C Contracting sizing and tender documents for outsourcing feasibility studies.
The Programming and Evaluation Section (as presently proposed) will
* prepare workplans for all work contracts, and
* evaluate performance of projects during and after implementation.
4.2.5 Overall Policy Formulation and Planning
The macro structure of the restructured Ministry is shown in the diagram overleaf. Two elements
have a bearing on the present study:
*  The Policy Analysis Unit is responsible for the identification of key policy issues, their
research, analysis and development, their documentation and the monitoring and evaluation
of policy implementation.
*  The Directorate of Transport and Communications is responsible executing the policy
and planning function of the transport and communications sector, including the road sector.
There is some potential in practice for overlap here, the more so when one considers the eventual
creation of a road agency will leave the Department of Roads responsible solely for policy
matters with implementation transferred to the road agency. These issues will not doubt be
resolved during the discussions in progress on the post constitutional restructuring report. The
creation of organs devoted to policy is of advantage in the formation of bodies responsible for
environmental management.

4.3 District Authorities - Roads
During the post constitutional reorganisation of ministries, the Department of Feeder Roads was
transferred from the Ministry of Local Government to the Ministry of Works, Housing and
Communications.
At the same time, Uganda has in recent years pursued a policy of decentralisation. It is the broad
intention of the decentralisation policy that as far as possible government should work at the
district level, but exceptions would be made national level assets such as the trunk road network.
We were told by the MOWHC that following the transfer the Ministry would be responsible for
policy and planning matters concerning feeder roads.
During field visits to Luwero and Mpigi the study team were told that although the head of the
Feeder Roads Department in the district (confusingly with the formal title of 'District Engineer'
but not the same individual as the head of the MOWHC's district station) would continue to
report to the Chief Administration Officer detailed plans and the bulk of budgetary allocations
would be made by the Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport. If this is the case, it is not
clear to what extent if any, responsibility for feeder roads is devolved in a meaningful way to the
local authorities. Conversely, it is not yet clear how the Division of Urban and Feeder Roads of
the Ministry will have overall responsibility in practice. However, its key functions have been
identified as:
* plan and coordinate rural feeder and urban roads rehabilitation and maintenance
programmes; oversee rehabilitation of feeder and urban roads projects sponsored by
Government or donors;
* monitor districts' performance in routine maintenance of feeder roads and where necessary
advise appropriate action;
. plan and carry out capacity building programmes for works department staff in local
governments;
* provide policy guidelines on feeder roads rehabilitation and maintenance work to local
governments.
Whilst central control by the Ministry makes the implementation of environmental policies
easier, we must anticipate a fluid situation whereby the working modalities between the
MOWHC and the local authorities are worked out.
The field visits revealed that at present very little money is spent on feeder roads. While the field
visits we undertook cannot claim to be statistically representative, the economic situation in
Uganda suggests that a similar situation is likely to be found in most other districts.
4.4 District Authorities - Environmental Management
The National Environment Statute 1998 makes a number of provisions for the institutional
arrangements for environmental management at the district level. These provisions include the
establishment of a District Environment Committee (DEC) and the appointment of a District
Environment Officer (DEO). These provisions are, as yet, only partially implemented and so we
do not know yet what the impact of these bodies will be in practice. Seven districts are being
assisted on a pilot basis under a World Bank funded technical assistance package. The statute sets
out a number of provisions that are relevant to the conduct of ElAs, and the bodies formed are a
potentially important resource.



34
The DEC is intended to be a sub-committee for the LC V council, but representatives of the
private sector may be invited to attend. The functions of the DEC may include the followingI:
*  to coordinate the activities of the District Resistance Council relating to the management of
the environment and natural resources.
* to ensure that environmental concerns are integrated in all plans and projects approved by the
District Resistance Council
*  to coordinate with NEMA on all issues relating to environment management
*  to prepare a district state of the environment report each year.
This last point indicates that the DEC will be an important resource of environmental information
for anyone preparing EIAs. However, in practice most districts will have insufficient funds for a
separate DEC and it is likely that its functions will be merged into another committee to form, for
example, a production and environment committee or a environment and heath committee.
The DEC is responsible for preparing every three years a District Environment Action Plan
(DEAP) that shall be binding on all persons within the district2. No DEAPs have yet been
formed, although it is anticipated that they will be prepared in the 7 districts under the pilot
project.
The District Environment Officer's functions may include3
to advise the DEC on all matters relating to the environment
e to liaise with the Authority on all matters relating to the environment
- to gather and manage information on the environment and the utilisation of natural resources
in the district.
e to serve as the Secretary to the District Environment Committee.
At present, DEOs have been appointed in 35 of Uganda's Districts. Based on our discussion with
NEMA, the DEO would be responsible for the conduct of ElAs where the lead agency was a
district level body. For classified roads where the lead agency is a national level body, the DEO
will play a consultative and advisory role.
4.5 National Environmental Mana2ement Authoritv
The National Environment Management Authority was established by the National Environment
Statute, 1995. It is the principal agency in Uganda for the management of the environment and
shall coordinate, monitor and supervise all activities in the field of the environment. Amongst it
functions is 'to ensure observance of proper safeguards in the planning and execution of all
development projects, including those already in existence that have or are likely to have
significant impact on the environment'. The Statute provides that NEMA may delegate its
functions to a lead agency, which in this case would be the Ministry of Works, Housing and
Communications.
The Statute gives NEMA quite wide powers to require and regulate the conduct of environmental
impact assessments. Although it is not envisaged that NEMA will actually conduct ElAs, lead
agencies are required to collaborate closely with the Authority. In practice, this means that
NEMA should be satisfied with the terms of reference for undertaking ElAs and the selection of
people to undertake the EIA. NEMA's requirements are set out in its EIA Guidelines and the
' Excerpted from 15(2) of the National Environment Statute 1995
2 National Environment Statute 1995, section 19
Excerpted from 16(2) of the National Environment Statute 1995



35
1998 EIA reguiations which are discussed elsewhere in this report.
NEMA is organised into four divisions:
* Policy Planning and Legal
 Information and Monitoring
* Education Awareness and Training
* Finance and Administration.
Information and Monitoring is the division responsible for overseeing environmental impact
assessments and audits and will review and approve the road sector EIA guidelines developed by
this study.
NEMA describes itself as 'lean and mean' when it comes to staffing. This is consistent with the
approach that NEMA itself is not responsible for undertaking environmental impact assessment
studies.
It is fair to note that at least two initiatives required by NEMA are still evolving: the development
of sector specific guidelines; and the creation of ELUs. The practical implication for this study is
that the outputs from this study will be more routine and specific than those that have been done
before.
4.6 Uganda Wildlife Authoritv
The Uganda Wildlife Authority was formed from a merger of Uganda National Parks and the
Game Department in 1996. It is a parastatal whose responsibilities include the National Parks,
Wildlife Reserves, Wildlife Sanctuaries and Community Wildlife Areas in the country and these
occupy about 11% of the total land area.
Roads affecting protected areas can be grouped into three categories: public roads leading to
protected areas; public roads passing through protected areas; and UWA roads developed within
protected areas for management or tourism purposes. UWA has undertaken a major road building
programme within National Parks in recent years. The other types of protected areas tend to have
very few roads within them.
Under a USAID funded planning project, UWA has been developing EIA capacity and
guidelines. However, these guidelines focus principally on the granting of concessions, and not
roads or other sectors. It is likely that UWA will need to develop its own EIA guidelines for
roads prior to the anticipated development of roads within the Wildlife Reserves.
4.7 The Uiandan Contracting Industry
As will be clear from the description of delivery approaches for maintenance and construction,
under the policy of privatisation, the MOWHC has relied on contractors to a large extent in
recent years.
The contractors fall into small scale and large scale mechanised. The small scale contractors are
used for routine maintenance of unpaved roads usually up to 10 km sections and are based in the
neighbourhood of the road being maintained. They use labour based techniques and are closely
supervised by the district engineers' staff. Some district engineers periodically hold short training



36
sessions with the small scale contractors and these occasions might present a convenient
opportunity to communicate environmental mitigation practices in routine maintenance.
Large scale contractors are both local and international, although international ones tend to
dominate the larger jobs. This has some implications in terms of communicating Uganda's
environmental practices to them. The number of contractors used on a regular basis by the
MOWHC is estimated to be around 20.
4.8 Consultinz Engineers
Again as noted from the description of delivery approaches above, the Ministry makes
considerable use of consulting engineers for the design and supervision of major works.
There are a number of consulting engineering firms with offices in Uganda. Most of those used
by the MOWHC are international organisations, with head offices overseas and Ugandan staff
employed locally. In practice only a small volume of the work is handled by locally owned firms.
The industry forum in Uganda is the Association of Consulting Engineers.
The capacity of the industry to conduct ElAs is considered further in Chapter 7: Developing
Capacity to Conduct EIAs.

5. PROPOSED INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT
5.1 Introduction
The effective uptake of environmental management and policy matters by the Ministry and
RAFU is as much an institutional matter as a technical one. This report provides information,
guidelines, policies and procedures, but unless staff are in place to implement and management
them they will not be used. We believe it will be necessary to have staff dedicated to
environmental matters.
It is helpful to break this issue into three questions that need to be answered:
* where should they be placed in the hierarchy?
* how many staff, and with what skills, are needed?
* what are the responsibilities of the staff9
Before attempting to answer these questions, it is important to recognise that the volume of work
is substantial. We do not list all the tasks here, since this would simply duplicate the tasks listed
in the job descriptions provided later. However it is sufficient to justify the appointment of a
small number of full time staff. Whilst the initial workload includes efforts to develop and
introduce systems and procedures, it will continue for ever to ensure their operation and
application.
5.2 Position in the Hierarchy - General Considerations
In determining the position of staff dedicated to environmental management, the following
considerations are key:
* In 3 years, RAFU will evolve into an independent agency. Based on our discussions with
NEMA, it is normal practice for such an agency to have its own environment unit. RAFU
itself will take on many of the lead agency functions of the Ministry in the road sector.
* Good practice indicates that 'Road Agencies should have a clearly designated staff member
with overall responsibility for environmental matters and knowledge of environmental laws
and regulations' and 'The environmental coordinator should have access to senior
management, and have their support in coordinating environmental actions throughout the
organisation'4.
* Most of the significant environmental impacts will arise from activities managed by RAFU
and not by the Ministry. In practice ElAs will be undertaken by the engineering consultants
responsible for the detailed road design and managed by RAFU.
* RAFU not withstanding, it is a NEMA requirement5 that the MOWHC as a whole has an
ELU since it acts as a lead agency in other transport sectors.6
'Roads and the Environment' World Bank Technical Paper No. 376.
Arising from the National Environment Action Plan, 1995
6 This poses a problem for this study as the scope of that ELU should go well beyond roads to all other
aspects of the Ministry's operations. These other aspects are outside the terms of reference for this study,
which makes it inappropriate for us to make firm recommendations.



38
*  The implementation of the post constitutional reorganisation, the creation of RAFU with
posts being remunerated at many times Ministry levels. and the planned eventual take over
by the road agency of all Ministry road matters is likely to leave the MOWHC highlv
demotivated for the next two or three years.
*  RAFU will be responsible for implementation, the Ministry will be responsible for policy,
and for monitoring the performance of RAFU against that policy.
*  NEMA's practice is to delegate detailed work to lead agencies, and its capacity for detailed
review of ElAs will be limited.
On this basis, it appears that two units will be required. One within RAFU (the 'Environment
Unit') to undertake much of the detailed day to day work, and one at the Ministry (the MOWHC
Environmental Liaison Unit), with a much smaller workload, to review RAFU's environmental
work, liaise, and input into the Ministry's wider policy machine.
The function of the ELU is to incorporate environmental concerns into the policies of the
Ministry in accordance with national guidelines, policies and regulations, and to inform
environmental policy makers of relevant Ministry issues and activities.
The function of the RAFU environmental unit will be to provide the resources and inputs
required to ensure that RAFU acts in accordance with national guidelines and legislation
concerning the environment.
In summary, the two units would be responsible for the tasks summarised as follows. A more
detailed description of these tasks is included as an attachment.
Table 5.1:    Summary of Responsibilities of the 2 Environmental Units
1. Ministry ELU
*  policy development in accordance with environmental regulation
*  overseeing environmental compliance of individual programme elements
.  advising the RSDP steering committee on the overall performance of RAFU
*  providing information on environmental matters to the Ministry's units
.  providing information on Ministry activities to NEMA
*  monitoring environmental impact of Ministry's overall programme
liaison with other countries on road sector environmental matters
2. RAFU Environment Unit
.  advising Ministry on practical implications of environmental policy
.  disseminating environmental policy and regulation to RAFU sections
*  managing the conduct of EIAs by consulting engineers
.  environmental monitoring and auditing of RAFU's activities
.  ensuring RAFU's operating practices take into account environment issues
.  other matters as may be required to integrate environmental issues into the project
cycle
.  disseminating and supervising a code of practice in environmental management
throughout RAFU.



39
The level of effort required to undertake these tasks will vary considerably. The largest task will
probably be the management of the conduct of ElAs by consultants.
The splitting of responsibilities into two units may seem complicated but it does overcome a
critical problem that has limited the effectiveness of ELUs in other sectors. Put simply, the work
of environmental units can be divided into 'hands on, practical matters' such as the preparation
of TORs for ElAs and 'high level, policy matters'. It has proved difficult in practice to combine
these into one unit. The arrangement proposed here nicely overcomes this problem. A further
advantage is that RAFU is a relatively small organisation with a relatively shallow hierarchy.
This means that as RAFU evolves into an autonomous road agency we do not anticipate that such
problems will start to manifest themselves.
The concept of creating two units was discussed during the conduct of the study and generally
accepted. There are some precedents in other sectors where the lead agency is not the parent
Ministry. These include the Uganda Revenue Authority and Uganda Wildlife Authority. In these
cases NEMA tends to deal directly with the authority concerned. Nevertheless, the situation in
the road sector does not exactly parallel these cases and the establishment of two units does
create some potential issues concerning the relationship between them. We discuss this below in
Section 5.5.
5.3 Position in the Hierarchy - Ministry Environment Liaison Unit
The positioning of the environment liaison unit within the Ministry is, as already noted, subject
to matters that are beyond the scope of this study, which has a roads only perspective. The
situation is made more complicated as the Ministry is still digesting both the post-constitutional
Ministry restructuring and its implications on the operations of RAFU. It is yet to be seen how it
will respond to the fact it will now be able to concentrate to a much greater extent on road policy
matters, and whether similar transformations will apply in other sectors. We therefore can only
set out the main considerations, and list the most likely alternatives.
It will not be appropriate to staff the ELU with staff who take on such duties in addition to their
existing assignments (this has been common practice in other sectors). It is hard to see how any
officer could find the time to undertake the initiatives required to make the ELU function
effectively in addition to even a partial workload. The more so, when the potential for conflicts of
interest - ELU activities might well increase the burden of the officer's other tasks - are taken
into account.
It will be important for the ELU to have access to senior staff of the Ministry. If not, its influence
on policy will be greatly diminished, and it cannot really fulfil its function.
It may be anticipated that there will be some revisions to the proposed organisation chart as a
result of the post-constitutional restructuring. Now is a convenient time for the Ministry to
incorporate the ELU into its structure.
During the study, we prepared and circulated a discussion paper setting out the main alternative
locations for the ELU, in the Ministry hierarchy and discussing the pros and cons. The Ministry
has indicated that its preferred position is in the Policy Analysis Unit since this most clearly
covers all sub-sectors. Accordingly, we present here a brief summary only of the options which
are illustrated in the chart overleaf.

Option 1:  In the policy analysis unit. This would put it at a very senior level within the
Ministry and cover all sub-sectors. However inter-departmental politics may hinder
the achievements of the unit.
Option 2:  A small stand alone unit under the Director of Transport and Communications where
it would, at least in theory, be able to cover all sub-sectors and would allow for
specialisation.
Option 3:  A unit under the Commissioner for Transport Planning (Directorate of Transport and
Communications) which is responsible for strategic planning, and in practice is likely
to do much of the Ministry's policy formulation, except perhaps for roads.
Option 4:  A small stand alone unit under the Director of Engineering. In this case there is the
danger that the unit would then be regarded as interfering with the functions of the
other departments when reviewing their projects.
Option 5: A small stand alone unit under the Commissioner of Roads.
The last two options would only be appropriate if one sees the ELU as supervising and checking
the work of the RAFU environment unit (this is the issue discussed below in Section 5.5) and
considered there to be little environmental management work in the other transport sectors.
From the perspective of this study, the Ministry's choice of the policy analysis unit as the home
of the ELU is reasonable as this gives it the greatest prospect of ensuring environmental matters
are fully integrated into the work of the Ministry. Options 2 and 3 are sound against the theory of
the post constitutional restructuring report, but may face practical difficulties. Options 4 and 5 no
longer seem appropriate.
5.4 Position in the Hierarchy - RAFU Environment Unit
The organisation of the RAFU has already been the subject of detailed study, but is subject to
review as senior staff take up their posts.
The main considerations in positioning the unit are the need to give the unit: proper access to the
Director of RAFU; ability to coordinate with planning and design; and independence to
concentrate on environmental matters.
The consultant's recommendation is that this is established as an additional section within the
Engineering Division. This is shown in the attached chart. We have discussed this arrangement
with the Director RAFU is in general agreement. Whilst some of the details of the overall RAFU
organisation chart may be revised during the formation process, it is not anticipated that such
revisions will affect the environment unit.

5.5 Relationship Between the ELU and RAFU Environment Unit
The creation of two units each with some responsibility for environmental management matters
for the road sector creates the issue of the relationship between them. To what extent is the ELU
responsible for the supervision of the environmental unit in RAFU? The issues are thrown into
sharpest focus in the case of environmental impacts assessment. There are two alternative
treatments, which we state here starkly for clarity:
Treatment 1:     Sees the Ministry as the lead agency in road sector matters, and RAFU as a
body that will inevitably have a bias to road sector. development over
environmental management. NEMA will not have the capacity to monitor
RAFU closely enough to provide a counterbalance - this responsibility must
fall on the ELU. The ELU should therefore have the authority to approve
stages in the EIA process, including the TORs and the EIS itself.
Treatment 2:     Sees RAFU as an autonomous body, whose head reports to the PS, but is not
in day to day operational matters controlled by the Ministry. The RAFU EU
will develop considerable experience and expertise in ElAs. Precedent
suggests that NEMA would be comfortable with the RAFU EU reporting
direct to it.
Whilst it might be argued that the Ministry is the Lead Agency and RAFU is the Developer, the
facts are that RAFU will always contract out development works and for the reasons already
described, much of the environmental management capacity is rightly placed in RAFU.
We lean towards treatment 2 on the grounds that this is more consistent with the semi-
autonomous status of RAFU (and the autonomous status of the proposed road agency). Detailed
approval of individual outputs from RAFU by the ELU gives considerable potential for
bureaucratic dispute and delay and could even undermine the accountability of RAFU. At the
same time, it is hard to see the ELU being able to combine a role that adds value at this level with
its policy oriented functions.
We have therefore, in drawing up the detailed description of the functions of the ELU and RAFU
EU adopted the following approach. The ELU will not formally approve RAFU EU documents,
except for those describing procedure where the ELU will be responsible for ensuring that they
comply with policy. Nevertheless the ELU will be responsible for monitoring the overall
performance of RAFU in respect of environmental management. This means that if it is not
satisfied with the performance of the EU it should take the matter up.
If the Ministry and RAFU do not agree on this approach, then a number of amendments will need
to be made to the EIA Guidelines (Volume III) and the description of the responsibility of the
various units set out below.
5.6 Size and Composition - Ministry Environment Liaison Unit
The tasks of the ELU suggest that the staff should have the following skills:
* transport sector policy formulation, planning and monitoring
* environmental planning.



44
The consultant's estimate of the workload in respect of road sector items is that this is less than a
full time position. The inclusion of non-road sector transport matters will increase this. The
Ministry has indicated that it wishes to place two full time staff in the ELU: an Assistant
Commissioner, and a principal engineer/officer. These appointments will be made from the
Ministry's existing establishment.
It can therefore be anticipated that those appointed will come from an engineering background.
We suggest that they are given training in environmental planning matters, probably through
attendance at a short course at an overseas university. This is elaborated in Chapter 6 on
Training.
5.7 Size and Composition - RAFU Environment Unit
The tasks of the environment unit suggest that the staff should have the following skills:
1. road engineering and planning
2. environmental impact assessment
3. community participation methods
4. socio-economics and relocation
5. ecology
It would take three staff to provide this range of skills, with (2 & 5) and (3 & 4) each being
combined into one individual. The consultant's experience elsewhere suggests that the workload
is also likely to require three individuals. However, the high calibre expected of RAFU staff, and
the need to build the unit up in phased manner in line with the development of RAFU more
generally, suggest that the unit should start with less than three full time staff.
Our recommendation is that initially, there should be a full time head of the unit who would be
an environmentalist with experience of road sector. The unit would have access to a part time
specialist in socio-economics with experience in community participation methods. This might
be conveniently be arranged through a draw-down contract for consultancy services. The
environment unit would rely on engineers in the planning section for engineering inputs during
this initial phase.
This establishment would then be reviewed after one year.
5.8 Tasks of the Ministry Environmental Liaison Unit
Note: While some of these tasks apply to all aspects of the Ministry, they have been prepared
from the perspective of the FRSP Environmental Policy and Management Study and therefore
contain a number of tasks specific to roads. It is expected that to the list will be added a number
of tasks specific to other sectors under the Ministry's responsibility.
The tasks have been formulated with reference to:
a)    the residual and new functions for the Ministry set out in the Government Report on
Transitional Institutional Reforms for the Establishment of Road Agency, July 1998
b)    functions/roles of ELUs as set out by NEMA.



45
5.8.1 Overview
The function of the ELU is to incorporate environmental concerns into the policies of the
Ministry in accordance with national guidelines, policies and regulations, and to inform
environmental policy makers of relevant Ministry issues and activities.
5.8.2 Policy Development
The ELU will participate in policy development by the Ministry to ensure that it meets
environmental concerns and regulations. This includes:
*  Ensuring that the Ministry is aware of policies and regulations laid down by other arms of
government, particularly NEMA.
*  Commenting on draft policies from an environmental perspective, and advising the Ministry
on the environmental impacts of existing policies.
*  Developing and reviewing sub-sector EIA guidelines as and when required.
*  Identifying environmental issues relevant to the Ministry.
*  Reviewing and commenting on policy instruments, such as design standards, prepared by the
Ministry.
*  Reviewing and commenting on sector planning documents, including, for example, road
network plans.
* Commenting on terms of reference for internal and external studies and policy development
exercises to ensure that they take into account environmental issues as appropriate according
to the nature of the study.
5.8.3 Environmental compliance of individual programme elements
The Ministry will be the lead agency in the development of a number of sub-projects. The key
mechanism for ensuring that these are designed and implemented with appropriate reference to
the environment will be the environmental impact assessment. However, it should be noted that
much of the detailed work of environmental impact assessments will be fully delegated to
individual departments and agencies where these have their own environmental units (and
possibly further delegated to contractors). In this regard, in the road sector, the Ministry (as
opposed to RAFU) will only be the lead agency in respect of maintenance contracts and the work
involved will be relatively minor.
Detailed tasks in this regard in those areas where the Ministry is the lead agency include:
*  Scoping projects and preparing TORs for EIRs/full ElAs in compliance with guidelines .
*  Reviewing the statements resulting from EIRs/EIAs to ensure that: (a) the terms of reference
have been complied with and (b) that they give a result that is likely to be accepted by
NEMA (if not a discussion should be initiated on whether or not the project should be
implemented). Forwarding the statement to NEMA.
*  Communicating the results of the NEMA review to the developer to ensure that required
mitigation measures are implemented.
Where the Ministry is not the lead agency, as in the case of RAFU projects, the ELUs role is to
provide feedback on TORs and Environmental Impact Statements in response to consultation by
the lead agency and to provide monitoring of such work.



46
5.8.4 Monitoring of RAFU
The RSDP steering committee will have responsibility for monitoring RAFU's performance. The
assessment of corporate efficiency will include coverage of standards of environmental impact
assessment. If possible (this may be difficult) the ELU should develop indicators to quantify this.
Whether quantified or not, the ELU should monitor the EIA standards achieved by RAFU and
report to the RSDP coordination committee according to its reporting cycle.
5.8.5 Information Dissemination
The ELU will be responsible for providing information on environmental matters to NEMA.
Much of the detailed information will come from the individual departments and agencies of the
Ministry. The ELU will be responsible for coordinating the collection of this information, where
appropriate setting standard formats, consolidating and aggregating it before submission to
NEMA.
This report does not make firm recommendations concerning a 'home' for GIS - it is beyond the
terms of reference - though it could conceivably be in the ELU.
5.8.6 Programme Monitoring
The ELU will be responsible for developing and implementing a programme to independently
assess the environmental impact of the Ministry's detailed programmes. The programme should
include measures to assess that road development activities do not lead to infringements of
environmental standards.
5.8.7 Other Matters
The ELU will be responsible for overseeing and coordinating programmes to develop the
capacity of the local consulting industry to carry out ElAs.
T~he ELU will be responsible for ensuring that each sub-sector develops and applies suitable EIA
guidelines.
The ELU will liaise with neighbouring countries and relevant regional organisations to exchange
information on relevant standards and procedures.
5.9 Tasks of the RAFU Environmental Unit
5.9.1 Overview
The function of the environmental unit will be to provide the resources and inputs required to
ensure that RAFU acts in accordance with national guidelines and legislation concerning the
environment.



47
Responsibility for compliance rests with RAFU's top management. However, the unit will be
closely involved in the design and implementation of all of RAFU's road projects. Much of this
will be done through the units involvement in the EIA process, which is expected to form the
bulk of its work.
5.9.2 Policy Development
Primary responsibility for policy will rest with the Ministry and its environmental liaison unit.
The environmental unit in RAFU will feed back on the practical implications of policies,
proposed and existing. This will cover issues relating to:
* EIA guidelines and regulations
* Design standards
* Standard contracts
* Maintenance procedures used by the Ministry
5.9.3 Policy and Regulation Dissemination
The unit will be responsible for keeping a library of policies and regulations affecting the road
sector and for ensuring that RAFU staff are kept informed of changes. Where appropriate this
will include the conduct of short seminars or training sessions.
5.9.4 Conduct of Environmental Impact Assessment
The environmental unit will carry primary day to day responsibility for arranging that
environmental impact assessments are carried out in accordance with laid down guidelines and
procedures. All work will be subject to approved road sector EIA guidelines.
Its duties will include:
Screening/Scoping/Project Brief/Terms of Reference for EIRs andfull EIAs
* Screening projects and preparing project briefs for NEMA.
Preparing terms of reference for EIRs/full ElAs in accordance with the guidelines
* Coordinating with the planning unit on the incorporation of TORs into larger contracts.
* Consulting with the Ministry ELU on the TORs
* Liaising with NEMA for the review of the TORs.
Contracting EIAs and EIRs
The actual contracting of EIAs and EIRs will be subject to procurement guidelines for RAFU and
the Ministry (which will actually issue the contracts.) The unit will provide inputs to the short-
listing process and evaluation process as required.
Conducting EIslElAs
Providing information and clarification to the EIA contractor as required on a day to day
basis. This will include practical matters relating to the interpretation of guidelines
* Participating in the facilitation of the public consultation process
* Reviewing the outputs of the study to ensure that it meets the terms of reference
Liaising with design to ensure that any identified planning issues are responded to.



48
Approval of EIRs/EIls
* Liaising with NEMA for the approval of the EIA
*  Ensuring that the results of the approval are incorporated into the design and planning
process.
*  Consulting with the Ministry ELU on any issues that may arise from the EIA.
5.9.5 Environmental Monitoring and Auditing
RAFU will bear responsibility for ensuring that: implementation of road works is conducted in
accordance with mitigation plans; unforeseen environmental consequences are identified and
addressed; and that maintenance addresses environmental as well as engineering concerns. Much
of the detailed work will be done by the consulting engineers supervising works contracts and by
District Engineers in formulating their workplans. The role of the environmental unit in this
regard will be:
*  Coordinating and reviewing arrangements to make sure that environmental issues are
addressed in district maintenance plans.
*  Ensuring that environmental matters are taken up by consulting engineers supervising works
contracts.
*  Reviewing environmental impacts of roads after the defect liability period.
5.9.6 Development and Incorporation of Environmental Practices
RAFU will have a number of standard systems, procedures that will be documented. The
environmental unit will be responsible for reviewing these as they are developed and providing
necessary inputs. Thereafter, they will be responsible for suggesting revisions and changes as
appropriate.
5.9.7 Input into the design and implementation process
A responsibility of the unit will be to ensure that environmental matters are taken into account by
RAFU during the design and implementation process. Formally, much of this responsibility will
be discharged during the EIA. Beyond this, it may be necessary to take additional steps to ensure
that environmental matters are taken into account at all stages of the design and implementation
process. In particular, detailed design should not commence until the environmental issues
relating to different alternatives have been considered. The environmental unit's tasks in this
regard will include:
*  participating in the initial identification of alignments and the consideration of alternatives.
*  providing inputs on environmental and social matters to the preparation of pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies for particular roads.
*  reviewing detailed designs for compliance with environmental guidelines.
*  reviewing draft contracts with contractors and supervising consulting engineers for
compliance with environmental guidelines.
*  supporting the maintenance unit in ensuring that emerging environmental problems are
addressed in maintenance plans.



49
5.9.8 Code of Practice
The unit will be responsible for documenting a code of good practice in environmental
management matters, and ensuring that RAFU staff are familiar with it and comply with it. This
may require the conduct of briefings and seminars for staff.
5.10 Job Description for Head of Environmental Unit
We have drafted the following job description for the head of the environment unit. It is brief as
it draws on the task list for the unit set out above.
Job Title: Head of Environment Unit
Reports to: Assistant Director Engineering
Reported to by: None
5.10.1 General
The Head of the Environment Unit will be responsible for ensuring that the unit conducts its
tasks in an efficient and effective manner and in accordance with laid down procedures, policies,
guidelines and codes of practice.
5.10.2 Specific Tasks
In addition to conducting the tasks of the unit, the head will:
* Secure service contracts with additional staff as may be required for the unit to perform its
duties.
* Supervise any staff contracted by the unit.
X Advise the directorate of any changes that may be needed in the staffing arrangement of the
unit.
* Ensure that the staff of RAFU are adequately informed and briefed on environmental
management matters.
* Consult with NEMA and the Ministry ELU.
* Participate in the evaluation of bids (such as for road design and supervision) that have an
environmental management (eg. EIA) component.
5.10.3 Qualifications and Experience
The Head of the Unit will have a Masters in Environmental Management or a related discipline.
She/he will have at least five years practical experience, including at least one in the road sector.
She/he will have experience in managing multi-disciplinary teams. Knowledge of environmental
issues, initiatives and actors in Uganda would be helpful, and experience in EIA would be an
added advantage.



50
5.11 Involvement of District Bodies in EIA
In prescribing the role of these district bodies in road sector EIAs, the consultant recognises that
much of what is said here about the road sector applies to other sectors as well. What is set out
here, must therefore be considered preliminary, pending the development of more general
guidelines and practice regarding the role of DECs in local EIAs.
In conducting a road sector EIA, the following steps should be included:
(1)    The most recent state of the environment report should be consulted to identify:
- environmentally sensitive areas and environmental issues
- relevant plans/initiatives in the district that might be impacted by the study.
- other persons/bodies that should be consulted.
(2)    The current District Environment Action Plan and District Environment Policy should be
consulted to ensure that the proposed road does not threaten any of the proposed
measures.
(3)    The DEC and DEO should be consulted:
- for recent information
- to discuss any issues emerging from (I) and (2) above
- to comment on draft ElAs.
- to ascertain any district level environmental bye-laws.
- at the auditing stage to determine if there are any issues that he has identified.
In addition, the DEC and/or DEO should be involved in the public consultation process.
We have discussed the above proposals with the Head of the NEMA District Coordination Unit.
5.12 Role of Other Ministries in Environment Impact Assessment
Many of the impacts of road development affect matters that are in the realm of other ministries.
Standard mitigation measures and a sensitive design may help reduce the immediate impacts, but
not eliminate them. Secondary impacts will be harder to assess and making reasonable judgement
will require the knowledge and input from other ministries, departments and agencies.
The organisations involved are shown in the following table. The list attempts to cover negative
impacts and not those that might be consulted about benefits as part of an EIA

- reduction of watershed
- access to poachers
Culture                      - invasion by alien cultures
- opportunities for vandalism of cultural sites
The scoping exercise for the EIA should determine which ministries/departments/agencies need
to be consulted, and this should be reflected in the terms of reference for the detailed study.

6. TRAINING
6.1 Introduction
This Chapter examines the training requirements of Ministry and RAFU staff in environmental
management and proposes suitable training courses. The training proposed takes place against
the institutional changes discussed elsewhere in this report.
The work done in preparing this session draws on discussions with the Assistant Commissioner
for Training and the Principal Personnel Officer concerning Ministry training practice and policy.
With a very small number of exceptions there has been little or no training in environmental
management or EIA and so the training proposed here is based on our assessment of what is
needed for staff to have the skills and awareness needed to implement the practices described in
this report.
In estimating numbers for training we have drawn on the Ministry of Public Service's report on
the post constitutional restructuring of MOWHC, and the MOWHC's report on Interim
Institutional Reforms for the Creation of a Road Agency. These reports were prepared at
different times and for different purposes, and therefore there are inevitable inconsistencies. In
drawing our estimates we have reconciled the two by assuming that there will be no planning or
construction staff within MOWHC, only in RAFU. We have also taken numbers from the full
operation stage of RAFU although this will not be reached until the year 2000.
6.2 Overview of Training Obiectives
The emphasis of the training will be on short courses aimed at
i. developing an awareness of the need to consider environmental issues during road
development,
ii. giving an understanding of the environmental impact assessment regulatory framework in
Uganda,
iii. developing skills for a) setting terms of reference for EIA studies, b) identification and
assessment of environmental impacts of road projects, c) incorporation of mitigation
measures at the various stages of road development, and d) reviewing environmental impact
studies reports and providing guidance on integrating results of these studies in decision-
making.
The training will be directed at all staff with responsibility for construction and maintenance.
Mostly the training will consist of seminars and courses lasting from I day to 2 weeks. Specialist
staff in environment units may be given longer training.
6.3 Ministry Training
As described in the session on the institutional framework, from the inception of RAFU, Ministry
operations will be concerned primarily with maintenance.



53
The present arrangements for training within the Ministry are set out in the Chapter on the
Institutional Framework. However, we note that the objectives of training as set out in the
Training Policy, Programmes and Strategiesfor 1993-1998 are:
* to upgrade and update professional experience of existing employees (refresher training)
* to prepare outstanding employees for new responsibilities (upgrading and specialisation)
The above training objectives show that the EIA training recommended in this study is in line
with MOWHC's training policy. There is however, no EIA or specific environmental
management training included in present training courses. (In stating this we recognise that road
engineering does of its very nature include consideration of the environment - the point here is
that the existing training focuses only on what is needed to construct the road).
6.4 RAFU Trainin2
RAFU is still in formation and does not have a training programme or policy. It has been noted
that, because of the salaries being offered RAFU staff should come 'fully trained', as it were.
However, it is accepted that there will be a need for professional development and that RAFU
will need to hold a number of working sessions to introduce working practices and procedures.
Based on discussion with those involved, we take the 'fully trained' concept to rule out long term
courses, but to allow the short term training we propose here.
In the courses listed below under the recommended training programme, we have set out some
common courses for Ministry and RAFU staff. This is because we believe that the staff involved
need similar skills (for example, a reasonable understanding of the regulatory environment).
However, it may well be that RAFU wants full control over its own training programme, and in
the implementation plan we have provided for the training to be delivered to RAFU and Ministry
staff separately if wished.
6.5 Recommended trainine programme
The recommended environmental management training courses/workshops for each of the four
groups are described below.
Group I - Top Management at the Ministry and RAFU
This group consists of those holding the posts of Assistant Commissioner/Assistant Director and
above who are responsible for the road sector. This essentially includes all top management
concerned with road construction and maintenance who are not included in the specific
categories below.
Ainm: To raise awareness and give an introduction to formal obligations.
Objeclives: The objectives of training top management will be
i.    to give an understanding of the environmental impact assessment legislation in Uganda;
ii.    to develop an awareness of environmental implications of roads, and procedures for
assessing them;



54
iii.   to develop an understanding of the human resource and institutional arrangements for
managing environmental impact studies and integrating the results of these studies into
project implementation;
iv.   to develop an understanding of how policy development will incorporate environmental
management concerns.
A suggested curricula of this course is given in Annex IV.
Numbers: Based on the establishment proposed in the post constitutional restructuring report (as
analysed in Annex V), the numbers would be approximately 12 staff from MOWHC and 3 from
RAFU.
Duration: The workshop would take 2 days and would include both formal presentations and
discussions.
Group 2 - Middle Management
This group includes:
* District Engineers and their deputies responsible for road sector matters (not including those
responsible for mechanical engineering), engineers responsible for overseeing construction
and maintenance
- all staff in RAFU directly concerned with planning and rehabilitation and construction
- those responsible for overseeing construction in RAFU
* those responsible for overseeing maintenance in RAFU and the Ministry.
Numbers: Based on the proposed establishments as analysed in Annex V, the numbers would be
approximately 70 from the Ministry and 32 from RAFU.
Aim: To ensure staff have a sufficient understanding of EIA to ensure that environmental issues
are adequately addressed in the planning design, construction and maintenance of road projects.
Objectives: The objectives of this training are
i.    to give an understanding of the environmental impact assessment legislation in Uganda;
ii.    to enable these officers to contribute effectively during scoping of EIA studies and
develop terms of references for these studies;
iii.   to familiarise the participants with procedures used during a) impact studies, b)
incorporating mitigation measures during road planning, and design, c) implementing an
environmental monitoring programme, d) review of EIA reports.
An outline of the proposed curriculum for this training course is given in Annex IV.
Duration: The training would take 5 days.



55
Group 3 - Environmental Liaison Unit Staff
This group would comprise staff members proposed for the environment liaison unit in the
Ministry.
Numbers: Two
Aim: To convert road engineers into ELU staff.
Objectives:
i.    to develop an understanding of potential environmental impacts of road projects and their
mitigation;
ii.    to give an understanding of the environmental impact assessment legislation in Uganda;
iii.   to develop a thorough understanding of the EIA process and its integration with the
project development cycle;
iv.    to impart skills for developing environmental auditing and monitoring plans for road
projects;
v.    to enable participants to contribute on environmental management issues in policy
formulation;
vi.   to enable participants to contribute on the implementation arrangements for incorporating
environmental management into Ministry activities.
Duration: The training will take up to 3 months as a post-graduate course at a university.
Group 4 - Road Inspectors and Overseers
This group would comprise all district based senior inspectors, inspectors and overseers.
Numbers: Based on the proposed establishments as analysed in Annex V, the numbers would
be approximately 94 from the Ministry.
Aim: The aim of this training will be to enable the road inspectors and overseers to ensure that
mitigation measures are identified and implemented by small scale contractors.
Objectives: The objectives of training this group will be
i.    to develop a practical understanding of environmental implications of road projects;
ii.    to develop skills for implementing environmental mitigation measures;
iii.   to develop skills for undertaking basic environmental monitoring of road projects,
develop an awareness of environmental impact assessment legislation in Uganda.
Duration: The training would take approximately 8 days and include a substantial field based
element.
6.6 Training Resources
A number of organisations in Uganda have already had experience in conducting EIA courses. It
is anticipated that some of these will be drawn on as resource persons for the courses proposed.
However, it is important to recognise that the courses (with the possible exception of oversees
training for ELU staff) should be Ministry and RAFU courses. They should be strongly tailored



56
to the road sector, concentrate on practice rather than theory and on the application of regulations
rather than the regulations themselves. They will not be off-the-shelf courses as any such will be
too generic and theoretical. We recommend that the courses should not be contracted in their
entirety to any one training organisation. However, it may be helpful to contract a consulting firm
with suitable experience in EIA to co-ordinate training programme development.
Institutions in Uganda
Several departments at Makerere University have courses that cover environmental management.
Some of the relevant courses are listed below.
Department of Geographv
A BA/BSc Degree in Environmental Management which is offered for both day and evening
students. EIA is one of the modules offered.
Institute of Environment and Natural Resources
An MSc in Environment and Natural Resources. EIA is part of the Introduction to Remote
Sensing and Geographical Information Systems Module. Other relevant modules are
Environmental Economics, Environmental Ethics and Law.
Faculty of Law
Master of Law Programme has Environmental Law as a one of the modules. A Certificate Course
on Natural Resources Law will be offered in 1999. This will be conducted during evenings and
week-ends over a 9 months period. Some of the modules that will be covered are Environmental
Law, Water Law, Law of Contract. The course is targeted at Natural Resources Managers.
The above training programmes will not in the short-term be able to contribute to building EIA
capacity for the road sector in MOW-C, so that they can undertake tasks indicated above.
Therefore a training programme that addresses this need is required. The following may be able
to contribute to short courses.

6.7 Organisation and Coordination
It is recommended that Groups 1, 2, and 4 be trained through workshops. Each workshop will
have a maximum of 25 participants. Therefore the number of training workshops to be conducted
are
Group 1:      1 workshop
Group 2:     4 workshops
Group 4:     4 workshops
As noted above, and further discussed in the implementation plan, group 2 may be broken into
training for the Ministry and Training for RAFU.
Therefore a total of 9 training workshops will be held. Budgets for these are set out in the
attached schedule.
The issue of scheduling and implementation is discussed in the implementation plan. There are
two alternative approaches to the coordination of the training programme.
Option 1:    Relies on internal resources (for coordination) both present and proposed. This
does pose some difficulties: the training should involve the ELU and RAFU EU, but this will
inevitably lead to delay; and the Ministry has as yet no experience with environmental
management courses. In the case of RAFU, the delay may not be an issue since staff will be
extended with other start up activities.
Option 2:    Engages a consultant from a firm of consultants with experience in EIA to
coordinate the training programme development and implementation. The consultant would act
as one of the resource persons on the training courses providing an element of continuity and
consistency. This option would be quicker but more expensive.
In making the choice, we would note that the training is largely a one-off exercise - which is an
indicator in favour of using a consultant. Nevertheless we do not make a firm recommendation
either way.
6.8 Budgetarv Considerations
The likely costs for each workshop with 25 participants are given below. It is recommended that
each of the workshops should be conducted by up to 4 resource persons consisting of
* EIA Specialist
* Environmental lawyer
* Roads Engineer with EIA experience
* Sociologist/Environmental Economist
together with a representative from NEMA.
In preparing a budget, we have allowed:
- three resource people continuously present for the top management seminar
- two and a half resource people continuously present for the middle management workshop
- two resource people continuously present for the inspectors and overseers course
- an average resource person cost of $500 including expenses except travel
- $20 per day for food for the top management seminar
- $15 per day for food for the middle management workshop



59
- $ 10 per day for food for the inspectors and overseers course
- $50 per day residential costs for the middle management workshop
- $30 per day residential costs for the inspectors and overseers course
- $100 per day for course facilities
- $50 per participant for course materials
- $200 per day for course transport on the days needed.

These are the estimated costs, PER COURSE, and do not include development which is included

60
A detailed budget has been prepared in the attached schedule. It does not allow for course
development fees. These have been provided for in the overall budget and allowed at
approximately 50% of instructors fees.
6.9 Institutionalisation
The course proposed here are designed to 'kick start' environmental management in the Ministry
and RAFU. It is not envisaged that they would be repeated in the form shown here after this start
up. Instead the materials should be used to integrate environmental management into the regular
training of the Ministry.

7. DEVELOPING CAPACITY TO CONDUCT EIAS IN UGANDA
7.1 Introduction - Needs and Objectives
The number of road sector ElAs that have been conducted in Uganda in the last five years is
limited and could be estimated to be around two a year. In some cases, it can be fairly stated that
the ElAs were not well integrated into the design process and were rather limited in scope
compared with the approach now envisaged.
In contrast, under the FRSP, it can be anticipated that 22 sub-projects will require full (very
detailed) EIAs, while for 6 sub-projects partial ElAs will be conducted. On the assumption that
most of these will be done during the three years of RAFU7 we can roughly estimate that seven
ElAs a year will be required, and this number can be expected to grow.
Outside the road sector, Uganda has greater experience in conducting ElAs in the water, waste
and sanitation sectors, and in projects specific to protected areas. However, the need for ElAs in
these and other sectors can also be expected to grow sharply as a result of the regulatory
framework developed by NEMA and the policy initiatives associated with the environment act.
As a result, we can expect capacity to conduct road sector ElAs in Uganda to be stretched and
there is a need for measures to manage this situation.
Most, if not all the road sector EIAs have been conducted by interrational firms, with or without
Ugandan partners. A second, but no less important objective is to contribute to the overall
development of the country by building Ugandan capacity to do ElAs.
7.2 The Local Industry
Because of the need to fully integrate ElAs into the design process, it is the consensus of NEMA
and the consultant, that in most cases it will be appropriate for ElAs to be undertaken by the
consulting engineers conducting the design, if necessary in association with individual or
corporate subcontractors with experience in environmental issues.
From this perspective, the local industry can be characterised as:8
* International firms of consulting engineers with full offices in Uganda. These are limited in
number but have road sector experience. Typically, top management is expatriate and most
or all of the other staff are Ugandan. There is some EIA capacity, but probably not
specialising in the road sector. ElAs might be carried out with an expatriate team leader
brought in especially for the job, coordinating a team of Ugandan specialists most of whom
will have worked with the firm previously.
Work has been done on eight EIAs (some of these at the pre-feasibility stage only) prior to the inception
of RAFU. However, it might be anticipated that a similar number of studies may be conducted by RAFU
prior to the inception of the road agency.
I The consultant emphasises that this is analysis is based on interviews with a number of key informants
and not an exhaustive survey.



62
International firms of consulting engineers with representation in Uganda. This category
covers most of the international firms operating in Uganda. Representation is carried out by
an office established for a particular project, and possibly supported by a regional office,
usually in Nairobi. Most such firms have road sector experience. Most project staff will be
Ugandan. ElAs would be staffed as for those firms with a full office, but the connections
with Ugandan specialists may be less strong.
*  Ugandan firms of consulting engineers. The Association of Consulting Engineers has about
10 corporate members. Their experience with road projects is generally limited to relatively
small roads. There is some experience with ElAs often in association with international
firms.
*  Regionally based freelance environmental specialists (mainly based in Nairobi).
*  Ugandan freelance environmental specialists. This group is diverse and therefore hard to
characterise. Some sub-groups include: staff of Makerere, and senior former government
employees. Several informants indicated that there are a number of skilled and experienced
staff in this sector, but that the total number available may not meet needs as the best staff
often prefer to seek full time employment - this applies particularly to staff who are at the
stage of their career where they are willing to undertake field work.
From the consultant's interviews with key informants9 a number of points became clear.
There is no shortage of staff in Uganda with sound formal training. There is a need to increase
practitioners' knowledge of issues specific to road sector EIAs but this is not a difficult matter.
Relatively few Ugandan staff yet have skills or practical experience to manage a multi-
disciplinary EIA team, but this is simply a matter of time.
The volume of road sector EIA work will not be sufficient to make it worthwhile for any firm to
develop permanent capacity. Work is therefore likely to be done by forming alliances and using
sub-contractors. Use of Ugandan staff is seen as important because of their knowledge of both
the country and its EIA practices.
Capacity can and will grow to meet the expected demand provided that it grows steadily. In the
short to medium term the industry may be expected to be dominated by international firms taking
the lead role. However, for the reasons given above, they will have to use Ugandans, often as
sub-contractors. The experience gained will become available to Ugandan contractors.
7.3 Overview of Pronosed SuDDort
In developing a package of proposed support, a principle has been that any training should be
modest given that: skills already exist; and the volume of work is such that practitioners will be
unwilling to devote substantial time to training. However there is a need to ensure that
practitioners are aware of the opportunities and are familiar with the specific requirements of
Uganda. In addition there should be some facilitation of the linkages that will be required to carry
out ElAs. Once this initial support has been provided, the private sector can be expected to secure
the inputs necessary for its own development.
It might be noted that informants were faced with the difficult dilemma of wanting to impress their
competence and capacity on the interviewer, and signal an appreciation of an initiative to build capacity.



63
The proposed support therefore comprises two main elements.
a) Seminar for top management, lasting for less than a day, to introduce senior managers of
consulting firms to practices and requirements.
b) Cross training for existing practitioners, lasting for a few days, to introduce EIA practitioners
to specific road sector matters.
In addition, it is recommended that the industry to develop databases of consultants to include
EIA practitioners.
7.3.1 Top Management Seminar
Purpose
To inform senior management of consulting firms operating in Uganda (both local and
international) of the likely future requirements (both quantitatively and qualitatively) for ElAs in
Uganda.
Composition
The seminar would be open to consulting organisations' senior executives in charge of the whole
organisation or roads or environmental impact assessment. All firms with local and regional
representation would be invited.
Numbers
It is likely that around 10 to 15 firms would respond. Some may send more than one person,
giving a total of around 25.
Duration and Timing
The seminar might last 4 hours. The seminar might reasonably be combined with the
dissemination of other information about the RSDP or RAFU to make a full day.
It is suggested that the seminar is conducted as soon as possible after the end of this study.
Pragmatically this means in January 1999.
If successful, the seminar might be repeated after some years when the details of a second road
sector project are known and/or there are major changes in the regulatory environment.
Content
The seminar would cover the following topics:
*  FRSP/RSDP and the ElAs that are likely to be required
*  Over view of the regulatory environment - the NEMA guidelines and regulations
*  Overview of the road sector EIA guidelines
*  The links between EIA and the project development and implementation cycle
*  Overview of the resources required to conduct an EIA.



64
Results
At the end of the seminar, participants would know:
* the regulatory framework for ElAs for the road sector
* the likely future demand for EIA services and the level of effort required to meet them
* the human resources required to conduct an EIA
* how EIA activities should be scheduled into project feasibility and design.
As a result they would be able to plan and direct studies that include a major EIA component.
Resources
The seminar would be conducted by Ministry, NEMA and RAFU staff. It would be desirable to
have support from the consultants preparing the guidelines, if this can be contracted.
Payments
The seminar would be free to participants.
7.3.2 Cross Training for Practitioners
Purpose
To train Ugandans already experienced in EIA in the details of the road sector guidelines.
Composition
Ugandans who have already have practical experience with the conduct of EIA with road sector
issues. The course would be open to Ugandans who work freelance, at University, for local, or
for international firms.
Numbers
A preliminary estimate of the numbers likely to attend is around 20.
Duration and Timing
The course should include some practical experience including a field visit. The total length of
the course would be about 5 days.
The course should take place at least six weeks after the executive seminar (to give firms the
opportunity to schedule the attendance of their staff as they consider appropriate). The timing
may be delayed to allow the formation of the ELU, the RAFU EU and the development of
training materials.
We do not anticipate that this course would be repeated, except perhaps in an altered form as an
initiative of the private sector.



65
Contenl
The course would cover:
*  Overview of the regulatory environment - the NEMA guidelines
*  The road sector project development cycle
*  The links between EIA and the road project development and implementation cycle
*  The EIA guidelines, with a detailed description of each issue, and specific reference to public
participation methodology
*  Methods for analysing impacts of road projects
*  Mitigation measures for impacts of road projects
*  ElAs and socio-economic issues (compensation, resettlement, etc)
* EIAs and ecologically sensitive environments (protected areas, wetlands, forests, etc)
*  Monitoring of road projects
*  The resources required to conduct an EIA
*  Reporting - the preparation of environmental impact statements.
Results
At the end of the seminar, participants would be able to plan and conduct major elements (as
determined by their background and experience) of a detailed environmental impact assessment.
Resources
The seminar would be conducted by staff from RAFU, NEMA and the Ministry. It would be
desirable if the main resource persons could be those with environmental responsibilities from
RAFU and the Ministry. If these were not in place in time, it would be desirable to have support
from the consultants preparing the guidelines, if this can be contracted.
Payments
Participants should be asked to meet the costs of transport, accommodation, meals and
refreshments. There would be no charge for tuition.
7.3.3 Developing Lists of Consultants
No inputs are proposed under this recommendation. There is a modest need to improve the
information available on both individual consultants and small specialist firms that might be sub-
contracted by consulting engineers to assist with EIAs.
NEMA has not published its list of individual consultants. This should be done in recognisance
that while these may not generally undertake full ElAs as individuals, they are a valuable
resource as sub-contractors.
The Association of Consulting Engineers may find it helpful to compile its own list of potential
sub-contractors and partners that it would make available to its members. This could usefully
include regionally based individual practitioners and firms.
The Consultant's Association of Uganda may also find it helpful to publish a list of members
with relevant environmental experience.

8. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL
AT MOWHC
8.1 Introduction
The Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications has a small Geographical Information
System (GIS) unit under the Road Maintenance Section. The unit is operated by two staff
members: a civil engineer (in charge of the unit) and a database assistant. In addition to
manipulating existing road network data, the staff of the unit is involved in collecting field data
such as confirming road alignment and status of bridges.
The GIS Unit provides basic information on the road network under the MOWHC's jurisdiction.
Users of the informnation generated in the GIS Unit include firmns implementing road projects,
individuals officers in the Ministry and both local and national politicians.
The study team is of the opinion that the GIS Unit within the MOWHC can be enhanced to
contribute to environmental management of road work activities.
8.2 The Relevance of GIS in Environmental Management of the Road Sector
8.2.1 Purpose of GIS
Digital GIS has been defined as a system for capturing, storing, integrating, manipulating,
analysing and displaying data that are spatially referenced to the earth. The advantages of a
system that can handle spatial data cannot be emphasised. But it is important to know that most
human activities across the earth's surface are spatial in nature and hence a map has been
developed as a device for storing and complex spatial data.
Digital GIS, like any other information system, once introduced in an organisation may be a
means of supporting better decision-making and reducing costs. Digital information systems,
including GIS, allow easy and practical ways of storing, retrieving and collating large volumes of
data in a user-friendly manner. The relevance of GIS technology to the FRSP is that it will
facilitate interpretation of environmental data through visual illustration. One of the practical
advantages of a digital GIS is that one can generate information for supporting decision making
by integrating, manipulating and analysing spatial data of different scales, a task that is
complicated if working with manual GIS. The information generated can be used by an
organisation's personnel at different management levels such as upper and middle managers, and
technocrats. The diagram in Figure 8.1 illustrates the different information levels needed in a
typical organisation to which GIS technology can greatly contribute.

8.2.2 Components of GIS
For a fully fledged GIS, one needs the following components:
- Digitisers necessary for converting analogue maps into digital data sets. Scanners do the
same type of work too. Global Position System receivers are important for capturing new
data (both point and line data) in the field;
* Colour plotters and printers capable of plotting A4 - AO maps;
* Computer(s) for the capture, analysis and display of data;
* Computer GIS software for making the hardware function properly;
* Personnel for carrying out GIS activities such as data capture, analysis and out-putting the
required information. Personnel is commonly given less attention; yet it is as vital as both the
hard- and software GIS components.
8.2.3 Managing Road-Related Environmental Data Using GIS
As pointed out earlier, GIS is an ideal tool for managing large volumes of data referenced to the
earth's surface. This applies to all natural and man-made features such as forest reserves,
agricultural areas, quarry sites, location of bridges, rivers and roads. The realisation that the
design, construction, maintenance and operation of road networks influence environmental
management beyond the road network itself is an incentive for the MOWHC to consider the use
of GIS technology in the provision of information to support decision making machinery.



68
The cost of acquiring hardware and software for a GIS Unit is much lower than the cost of
establishing a digital GIS database. However, a comprehensive digital GIS database has been
created as part of the tasks required of the terms of reference of this study. Hence this presents
an immense opportunity for the MOWIHC to use the already established GIS database for
managing road-related environmental issues with minimum investment in both hard- and
software, and personnel. The database created is at national scale, most of the digitised maps
being at a scale of 1:250,000. This scale is adequate for road-related environmental management
issues. The digital database consists of the following data sets which are in ArcView 3.Oa format
(although they can be exported to other GIS formats):
1. Road Network (line data format)
2. Digital Elevation Model or DEM (raster data format)
3. Contours (line data)
4. Slope steepness (raster data format)
5. Soils (polygon and raster data formats)
6. Rainfall distribution (polygon and raster data formats)
7. Hydrology (line data)
8. Land use (polygon and raster data formats)
9. Agro-ecological (polygon and raster data formats)
10. Vegetation (polygon and raster data formats)
11. Protected areas (polygon and raster data formats)
12. Archaeological and historical sites (point data)
13. Population (polygon and raster data formats)
14. Ethnic distribution (polygon and raster data formats)
The GIS database can be queried and calculations performed on the stored data like any digital
database using simple or compound queries and calculations. New information can easily be
derived from the above listed data sets in a digital GIS. Some GIS programs also support SQL
(Structured Query Language) queries to provide useful information for management purposes.
Such queries and calculations take the form of phrase-like computer commands acting on
specified fields of the database. The above GIS database can therefore be used to answer typical
GIS questions such as those as briefly described below:
a) What is at or within a specified area?
The aim of such GIS queries is to find geographic features located at a specified point or within a
given area on the earth's surface. An example would be: what historical and archaeological
sites are located within 50m either side of a road to be rehabilitated?. If such a question is
answered and the information reveals that there is no such historical or archaeological site within
the specified distance, a decision may then be made to exclude an archaeologist from a team of
experts needed to conduct an EIS hence reducing the cost of the feasibility study for that
particular road project.
b) Where is the location of specified features?
This is relevant if information being sought must satisfy certain conditions. As an illustration,
one may query the GIS database created for the MOWHC as follows:
* where are all steep areas (slope > 35Y) in Uganda?
* where are the counties in Uganda with population density greater than 500 persons/lkn2?
* where are all the "accident blackspots " along Kampala-Jinja-Malaba Road in Uganda?



69
c) How large or how long is a specified geographic feature?
This GIS typical data querying seeks to find out quantitative information about a specified
feature. One may be interested in knowing the length of a road segment that traverses an import
agricultural area, or the length of a road segment that may require rehabilitation. Other questions
may involve finding out the area (in km2) covered by a category of a given road network in
Uganda, or the area of agricultural hinterland served by a given road.
d) What has changed over a specified period of time?
There may be an interest in finding out the qualitative or quantitative changes that would have
taken place over a given period of time. A simple example would the total road coverage that had
been rehabilitated by the Government of Uganda between 1986 and 1996. Secondly, one may be
interested in knowing the decrease in vehicle accidents after implementing improvements on
selected "blackspots" (eg. better traffic signs) along a given road.
e) Which spatial patterns do exist?
It may be necessary to find the spatial correlation or patterns between one or more variables
using an existing GIS database. Simple questions such as the relationship between road density
network and different land use types can formulated and information provided using a GIS
database. Additional questions may be the relationship between major roads in Uganda and soil
types or areas prone to soil erosion.
f) Deriving new information from exiting data
One of the practical advantages of applying GIS technology is that one can generate new
information from existing data sets. The best examples are deriving continuous relief (digital
elevation models) from existing digitised contour lines. The relief data can then be used for many
applications such as isolating steep areas, soil erosion potential and many other applications.
Another example of deriving new information from existing GIS database is the calculation of a
buffer area (ie. a constant region around a point or a linear feature).
g) Modelling spatial data with GIS
Perhaps the most important advantage of acquiring GIS facilities in any organisation is the need
to provide information to support decision making. GIS can provide this summarised information
that may be needed by both upper and middle managers (figure 1). GIS modelling involves the
integration of existing or newly derived data and formulating relevant questions to which
answers are being sought to support decision making. The relevant questions may involve setting
certain conditions that must be satisfied. A hypothetical example may take the following format:
The MOWHC may wish to maximise and minimise the impacts of constructing a new road in the
country. The conditions that should be satisfied may include the following:
 the new road to be constructed should provide good access to an existing road network from
all the major agricultural and tourism regions of the country.
*  the new road should be constructed in areas that do not have very serious environmental
negative impacts as stipulated by NEMA such as environmentally sensitive areas (eg. steep
areas, fragile ecosystems like wetlands)
*  while taking into consideration to the first two conditions, the cost of the new road project
should befeasible.
GIS spatial data modelling can be used to provide a quick answer to such a proposed project.



70
High level application of GIS modelling may involve formulating different scenarios especially
where alternative course of action is needed (for example where a new alignment may be
required). When GIS is used to provide information for alternative course of action, this is
normally referred to as an allocation problem. Provided that there is a GIS database already
established, GIS modelling is quicker to implement by anybody with moderate GIS training.
In summary, information or results provided by the use of GIS technology can be used broadly
for the following managerial activities and tasks:
i.    supporting decision making by both middle and upper managers;
ii.    implementing policies and government projects;
iii.   finding alternative courses of action in the case of a controversial but socially and
economically important road project;
iv.    reducing the costs of conducting EIAs by the MOWHC.
8.2.4 Use of GIS in the FRSP Environmental Policy and Management Study
Among the tasks outlined in the terms of reference for this study was the identification of critical
constraints to environmental management in the Uganda road sector. In terms of the physical,
natural and social environment, these constraints are areas of rapidly decreasing habitats such as
tropical forests, sensitive areas of wetlands and soils, the potential of soil erosion and the
existence of historical and cultural sites in relation to road projects. For the study team to identify
easily and practically the above mentioned environmental constraints from spatial data sets
created at different map scales (1:50,000 - 1:900,000) and different periods (1960 - 1996), there
was a need to use a tool like digital GIS. In digital GIS, there is flexibility in integrating data sets
created at different spatial and temporal scales and produce new information. The alternative
would have been to use manual GIS with traditional cartographers equipped with paper maps,
drawing pens, planimeters and transparencies. Manual GIS is not a practical tool to provide the
much needed spatial information especially being integrated or compared are of different scales.
Another limitation of manual GIS is that deriving new information from existing data sets such
as steep areas from contour lines is not practical. In summary digital GIS was used because of its
convenience to integrate existing data sets and the ease of determining quantitative parameters
such as areal extents of given geographical features.
8.3 Capacitv for Using GIS in Ueanda
There is extensive capacity to use GIS technology as an environmental analysis and management
tool in Uganda, both in terms of man-power, equipment and software. GIS units are well
established in organisations like Makerere University Institute of Environment and Natural
Resources (MUIENR), the Faculty of Technology at Makerere University, the Lands and Survey
Department, National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), National Biomass Study
(NBS) and Uganda Wildlife Authority. Some projects such as Road Maintenance Unit in the
MOWHC, the National Wetlands Conservation and Management Programme (NWCMP), Rural
Water and Sanitation Programme (RUWASA) and CARE/DTC also have fully functional GIS
units. In the private sector, there is one firm that undertakes GIS consultancy, and a cartographic
company that produces and publishes maps (eg. for tourists).



71
There is also enough manpower to operate GIS units in Uganda. Most have been trained iocally
at MUIENR and at foreign universities (particularly the Netherlands and UK). GIS training has
been mostly at postgraduate level (both masters and diplomas). In addition, MUIENR offers
short courses in GIS as a planning tool.
With the continuous improvement in the information technology, personal computers are not
only becoming cheaper, but are able to run powerful GIS software. Popular GIS software being
used in Uganda includes ArcView, PC Arclnfo, IDRISI, TNTmips and ILWIS. Most GIS
specialists in Uganda can operate more than one type of GIS software.
8.4 The GIS Unit at MOWIHC
8.4.1 Capacity
The GIS Unit is equipped with a range of hardware and software. A summary is given in Table
8.1. From the table, it is clear that the GIS Unit at the MOWHC is rudimentary and small, both in
terms of equipment and software.
8.4.2 Current GIS Activities
The GIS Unit uses Windows 95 as the Operating System. There was an attempt to establish a
Local Area Network (LAN) in the GIS Unit. However, the LAN does not function properly.
It appears that there is little GIS activity except the retrieval of existing data, manipulating it to
produce information required by administrators at the Ministry headquarters, District Engineers,
staff involved on road projects, and politicians. The information requested range from a mere
presence of a road network to maps showing different traffic counts for selected road segments.
Requested information can be plotted in colour on A4 - AO size paper.
With the help of a GPS, the unit has tried to affirm the existing road network data digitised by the
National Biomass Study. An attempt to collect data on bridges has been made using a GPS. Field
data collection has been hampered because of GPS lack of accuracy and very often the GPS's
failure to receive strong satellite signals essential for calculation of geographic position(s). The
failure of GPS to function properly may be due to lack of experience to setting up the GPS
receiver before it is used. However, this needs to be verified. Depending on the model of stand
alone GPS used (especially the models manufactured before 1996), there is an off-set of about
300m in the y-coordinate (latitude) from the true geographic position.
GIS activities have been limited by lack of a laptop to download information from a GPS and the
plotter which is in poor condition.
In-house computer and file maintenance are lacking. Computers are covered to keep them free
from dust. Virus removal is done sporadically. Files are not customised.
Since the unit is not equipped with additional ArcView modules such as Spatial and Network
Analysts, real GIS modelling is limited at the MOWHC.

8.4.3 Training Needs
None of the staff at the GIS Unit have had any formal training in GIS technology. This is not
surprising because GIS is a relatively recent technology, not only in developing but also in
developed countries.
The two members of staff in the MOWHC GIS Unit received on-the-job training over a period of
6 weeks. Training was carried out by a foreign GIS expert working under the Road Maintenance
Unit. The staff were trained in the use of ArcView 3.0.
The GIS Unit is now able to carry out a number of GIS operations including data manipulation,
simple analysis, map design for printing and printing maps various paper sizes. The staff at the
GIS Unit are able to integrate data stored in Database Management Systems (such as dBase) and
Spread Sheets (Microsoft Excel) with GIS software. The GIS Unit at the MOWHC also has
desktop mapping software (MapInfo), but neither of the staff have been trained to use this
software application.
It was revealed that the first civil engineer to be trained to operate the GIS left the Ministry for
better job prospects. Another on-the-job training course was then organised for the present staff.
This may indicate that the MOWHC is not able to hold on to its skilled staff in circumstances
where better paid jobs become available for some individuals. Unfortunately, this is a problem
that is experienced in all government organisations, and it is not expected that the situation will
change in the near future.
8.5 Recommendations for Enhancing the MOWHC GIS Unit
This section puts forward recommendations for enhancing GIS capability within the MOWHC if
it is decided that existing GIS Unit should be strengthened so that GIS technology can be
effectively applied to road-related activities.
8.5.1 Hardware
In addition to the existing GIS computer, there is need for extra two powerful desktop personal
computers in terms of hard disk space ( about 2.5 Gb), RAM of 64Mb and Speed of at least
200V). A CD-Writer is also essential especially to supplement backing-up files and future
exchange of data with district staff. While CD-reader drives are now standard hardware for
computers on market, there is need for extra backing-up facilities. A tape drive that is compatible
with organisations with active GIS units such as the Makerere Institute of Environment and
Natural Resources (MUIENR), National Biomass Study (NBS) and Uganda Wildlife Authority
(UWA) Monitoring Unit is highly recommended for future exchange of data.
It will also be necessary to acquire 21-inch monitors with a capacity to attain at least 768 x 1024
screen resolution. This is important because most GIS software need such a screen resolution for
better management of the various opened 'windows'. While the GIS Unit currently has a 21-inch
monitor, it appears that the Graphics Card is not powerful enough to allow the attainment of the
desired screen resolution of at least 768 x 1024. The following is an estimation of what the above
mentioned and some additional equipment will cost:

Associated Costs

8.5.2 GIS software
The GIS Unit at the MOWHC is already using a non-licensed version of ArcView GIS 3.0a.
While this software is enough for basic GIS data manipulation and analysis, it may not be enough
for additional GIS analytical functions. It is thus recommended that the MOWHC GIS Unit
acquires at least 2 licenses of the newly released ArcView GIS 3.1 with the following additional
modules:
i.    ArcView Spatial Analyst
ii.    ArcView Network Analyst
iii.    ArcView Data Automation Kit
iv.    ArcView 3D Analyst.
ArcView Special Analyst will be important for GIS modelling in EIA studies since it allows easy
integration of different map layers for analytical purposes using the. grid (raster) data format.
ArcView Network Analyst will greatly enhance generation of information about the Ugandan
road network such as traffic volume flows and accident-prone spots.
ArcView 3D Analyst greatly enhances the use of topographic data (digital elevation models)
The estimated cost of for each of the above software modules ranges from US$250 (for non-
profit making organisations) to US$1000 for profit making organisations. Normally, an inquiry
from ESRI in USA or its agents in Africa (GIMS in South Africa) may provide more information
as to whether the MOWHC is a non profit making organisation.
A good supply of consumables will be required such as ink cartridges, special printing paper (A4
- AO), tapes and writable CDs. Between US$300 - 400 may be required on a monthly basis,
depending on the amount of printing that is undertaken.



75
8.5.3 Recommendations for Training
It is recommended that 3-4 staff members from the Ministry should receive in depth training in
the application of GIS for environmental analysis and management for a period of between 4 and
6 weeks. Current staff in the GIS Unit should participate in this training because as they carry out
most GIS functions related to their project activities, they need a strong theoretical GIS
foundation. A tailored GIS course developed with a bias to current and future road sector
activities is recommended.
To avoid unnecessary training expenses abroad, the development of a short GIS course tailored to
road sector needs should be carried out in Uganda. MUIENR GIS & Remote Sensing Laboratory
has acquired experience in such courses and training. The GIS & Remote Sensing Laboratory is
equipped with all the necessary GIS hardware and software and manned by three members of
staff. An outline of one of the short GIS courses (for general participants) that has been offered
in the last two years is presented in Annex IV.
Cost estimates for a GIS short course tailored specifically for MOWHC/RAFU/RA needs, and
lasting 4 weeks for 3 to 4 participants are presented in the Table 8.3 below.

8.6 Management AsDects Related to the Location of the GIS Unit
In the preceding sections, the usefulness of GIS in road sector planning has been discussed.
However, any GIS Unit can only continue to be useful if:
i)    it is managed efficiently
ii)    data is updated and/or acquired regularly, and
iii)   hardware and software is maintained and updated regularly to ensure compatibility with
other systems and new data, and to be able to cope with the ever-increasing volume of
data to be stored.



76
Sustainability of the GIS Unit is the underlying factor in its future usefulness, and this is
dependent on its location and ownership.
Under the current restructuring of the MOWHC, its GIS Unit is likely to remain within the
Ministry. But the best location for the GIS Unit has to be established. There are two options:
either the Unit should be based in the MOWHC or in RAFU (which will in due course become
the road agency).
A location within the Ministry would allow the GIS Unit to serve all departments in the Ministry
(aviation, railways, inland waterways and housing) in providing spatial information for national
level transport sector planning. This would also mean that the database would be used to its full
capacity.
On the other hand, most road project activities that will influence environmental management
within the road sector will be based in RAFU. The GIS database will contain much of the
information required by departments within RAFU, for example data required for the preparation
of project briefs for EIAs, or for assessing traffic counts, internal rates of return, etc, for FRSP
road projects. This means that there are focused activities in RAFU that will make a GIS Unit
more viable than if it were placed in the MOWHC.
Other factors which may affect the efficiency and management capacity of the GIS Unit include
the following:
i.    Given that RAFU staff will receive better financial emoluments than the MOWHC staff,
RAFU staff may have difficulty accessing information from a unit within the MOWHC.
The notion that 'information is power' may apply in such circumstances, especially
with specialised spatial information stored in a GIS.
ii.    With the GIS Unit located in the Ministry, there is a danger that when better job
opportunities arise, the MOWHC GIS Unit staff will leave, resulting in a high turn over
in recreating new GIS Unit staff.
iii.    RAFU will have the necessary financial resources for updating and maintaining the GIS
database so that it will function efficiently.
While the MOWHC would seem the natural location for the GIS Unit, RAFU is the more
sustainable choice. However, the Director of RAFU has indicated that, for the moment, the GIS
Unit should not be housed in RAFU.
In light of this, a third option is proposed. The GIS database for the road sector can be managed
and maintained by the GIS and Remote Sensing Laboratory at MUIENR. Ministry personnel,
consulting engineers, EIA practitioners and any other individuals may then access/obtain road-
related data (environmental, social and technical) from MUIENR at a fee. If so required,
MUIENR GIS staff can be commissioned to carry out specified data manipulation and analysis.
The MUIENR GIS Laboratory also has map printing facilities.
If this option is adopted, close collaboration between the MOWHC, RAFU and MUIENR will be
fundamental in the use, exchange and updating of geo-information for the purposes of managing
environmental issues related to the FRSP.
An inventory of the MOWHC's sectoral activities that require use of geographic information
may help in making the final decision as to where to locate the GIS Unit.

9. MONITORING NATIONAL LEVEL PERFORMANCE OF THE FRSP
9.1 Performance Monitoring
The ultimate aim of the Road Sector Development Programme, and thus of the FRSP, is to
provide a road network that will meet the present and future demand for road transportation in
Uganda. The primary purpose of developing the country's road network is assumed to be that
better roads and a more efficient road network will stimulate. economic development, and
consequently enhance social well-being throughout the land.
In order to determine whether these assumptions are correct, and to what extent improved roads
and a better road network contribute towards improving social welfare and economic
development, it will be necessary to monitor the performance of the FRSP at the national level.
But in addition to these perceived socio-economic benefits, the impact of roads and the entire
road network on the physical and natural environments should also be assessed.
This chapter addresses the requirements of conducting monitoring of the social, physical and
natural environment of the FRSP at the national level, and identifies agencies who need to be
responsible and/or involved in monitoring. The methodology can be extended to apply to
ensuing projects under the Road Sector Development Programme.
Guidelines for environmental monitoring of specific road projects under the FRSP are presented
in Volume III of this report (Environmental Guidelines for the Road Sector).
9.1.1 Objectives of Environmental & Social Performance Monitoring
Environmental and social performance monitoring of the road sector at national level will
contribute substantially to developing sustainable road sector policies, as well as to the road
sector planning process.
It gives an indication of whether improving the road network has resulted in benefits or
disadvantages, in the social and environmental context, or whether including environmental
management in road works is indeed beneficial.
In addition, the economic justification of incorporating environmental protection is often
questioned. Environmental performance monitoring will be able to determine whether or not this
is so.
The outcome of environmental performance monitoring should be to propose policies, standards
and procedures which will result in improved environmental management in the road sector.
9.2 Identification of Indicators
The MOWHC would be no doubt be interested in determining the benefits of integrating
environmental concerns in terms of its functions and operations. It has often been purported that
environmental management reduces road maintenance costs and that roads which have included
environmental protection measures need to be maintained less frequently. Although there is



78
evidence of this from studies undertaken in other Eastern African countries, this has to be
demonstrated for Ugandan conditions and for both paved and unpaved roads.
Environmental/social performance monitoring of the FRSP should centre around the main
environmental and social impacts, as perceived at the national level, that are expected to arise
from its road sub-projects. These are:
* impacts on air quality (especially urban areas)
* impacts on protected areas, forests and wetlands that roads pass through
* impacts on value of land adjacent to the road
* impacts on road safety
* impacts on agricultural development
* impacts on education
* impacts on public health
* impacts on rural incomes
impacts on settlement pattern
* impacts associated with compensation
The above can be converted into "performance targets", ie. intended or unintended outcomes of
improving the road network by determining exactly what environmental and social performance
monitoring is required to establish the following:
* does the inclusion of environmental mitigation measures affect the overall cost of road
maintenance?
* is the frequency of road maintenance affected as a result of incorporating interventions for
environmental protection?
* do improved roads result in more or less air pollution in urban areas?
* do improved roads have an effect on the value of adjacent land?
has an expansion in the road network impacted on protected areas, wetlands and forests?
have better roads contributed to enhancing road safety?
has an improved road network led to changes in agricultural development?
have better roads impacted on education levels?
have better roads had an effect on public health?
have improved roads led to an increase in rural incomes?
* has an improved road network led to changes in settlement patterns?
* are the procedures for paying compensation for rights of way/acquisition of road reserve
acceptable?
To be able to measure the changes in any particular performance target, indicators must be
identified. The number of indicators required to evaluate performance targets varies; some need
several indicators, while for other targets, one indicator will suffice.
It is important to note here that roads are not necessarily the sole factor responsible for changes
in the various performance targets; they are likely to be one of several contributing factors.
The table below gives performance targets and corresponding indicators for monitoring these
targets.

9.3 Data
Data collection is the basis of all monitoring activities. It will therefore be necessary to conduct
an initial baseline survey in order to establish benchmarks against which changes in any given
indicator can be measured. Thereafter, such surveys should be carried out everv 5 years.
All the data that is required for environmental performance monitoring of the road sector is
routinely collected by various government agencies to be included in district and national
development plans, profiles and reports. Consequently, the MOWHC would not be involved data
collection for most of the proposed indicators. The following agencies may be approached for
information:
Table 9.2:     Sources of Data

Impacts on maintenance costs            District Road  Offices;  Maintenance  Sections  of

MOWHC/RAFU/road agency
Changes in air quality                  Ministry of Health, Department of Meteorology
Changes in land value                  Ministry of Lands; Government Valuer; district councils

Impact on protected areas (national parks,  UWA, IUCN, WWF, MUIENR
game reserves, sanctuaries, etc)
Impact on road safety                  National Road Safety Council; Department of Statistics,
Police records
Changes in agricultural development    Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Food;
National Agriculture Research Organisation; Bank of
Uganda Agriculture Secretariat
Changes in education levels             Ministry of Education; Ministry of Gender, Labour and
Social Development
Changes in public health status         Ministry of Health, District Health Offices, Uganda
Medical  Association,  Development  Network  of
Indigenous Voluntary Associations
Changes in rural income levels          Department of Statistics; Bank of Uganda Agriculture
Secretariat
Changes in settlement patterns          Department of Statistics, Department of Physical
Planning
Adequacy of compensation                Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development
It is therefore unlikely that special surveys or field investigations will need to be conducted to
obtain much of the information relating to the indicators.
Environmental audits that are required to be conducted as part of the EIA process for road
projects will be essential in providing information on the impacts of road works and road projects
that will be required for the evaluation.



81
9.4 Assessing Environmental Performance
Environmental performance monitoring is designed to measure the overall environmental impact
of a project or programme. The FRSP is now in its third year, but due to various delays in its
implementation, only a small number of projects earmarked for the first phase have commenced
or have been implemented. It is therefore suggested that evaluation of FRSP environmental
performance is conducted at the end of the first phase (June 2002). For second (and subsequent)
projects within the RSDP, it is recommended that such evaluations are carried out at the end of
the project term (assuming a 5 year project duration).
The process of evaluation of environmental performance of the road sector will involve the
collection of necessary data as described above, and an in-depth analysis of that data so as to be
able to determine changes in performance indicators and establish trends. It is important that data
is analysed from a national road network perspective, rather than a local or road-specific one. As
mentioned earlier, the overall environmental and social impacts of the FRSP cannot be attributed
to roads alone, because the performance targets may be affected by factors such as cost of
agricultural inputs, fluctuations in market prices for agricultural produce, national budgets for
education and health, etc.
The evaluation would also have to review and assess all environmental monitoring reports and
audits carried out for each of the FRSP road sub-projects. The conclusion of the evaluation
should decisively state the overall impact of road sector activities on the social, natural and
physical environment.
It is unlikely that either the environmental liaison unit within the MOWHC or the environmental
unit in RAFU/road agency will have the time or personnel resources to carry out such an
evaluation. The evaluation should thus be carried out as an independent consultancy of about 5-6
person months, to be conducted over a period of approximately 2. months. However, the ELU
and environmental unit should be closely involved in the evaluation.
Typically the evaluation team would comprise:
-      an environmentalist or ecologist (team leader)
-      a road engineer
-      a sociologist
-      an agricultural economist
-      a transport economist
-      a land valuer/surveyor.
9.5 Cost of the Environmental Performance Evaluation Exercise
An estimate of the costs incurred to conduct the first evaluation, based on current prices, is
presented in Table 9.3 below. For the purposes of this estimate, rates for professional fees are
averages; obviously these rates will vary depending whether local, regional or international
experts, or a combination of these, are hired.

10. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
10.1 Purpose of this Chapter
Put in very simple terms, the four volumes (not counting the executive summary,) of this report:
provide information, propose organisational changes, set out procedures, and propose training
courses. Each of these items requires work to implement: information needs to be disseminated
and maintained, staff have to be acquired and briefed to allow organisational changes to happen,
staff have to be trained in new procedures, and training courses need to be arranged. All of this
will require considerable effort and commitment by individuals and the process will at times feel
like pulling oneself up by one's own bootstraps since the process will be overseen by units that
do not yet exist.
This implementation will take place against a background of institutional change in the Ministry.
The changes are described earlier in this volume, but in summary they stem from the post-
constitutional restructuring of the Ministry and the formation of RAFU. The implementation of
environmental management matters as proposed here, needs to be incorporated with these
institutional changes. The plans for institutional change are currently subject to intense review
and revision. The intensity may reduce, but it can be anticipated that the review and revision
process will continue for quite some time.
Therefore, although this Chapter sets out a detailed implementation plan, this must be subject to
considerable change. The main purpose of this Chapter is to identify the both the tasks to be
done, and the connections between them. This information can then be used by those responsible
for the wider changes taking place in the Ministry as a planning and monitoring tool.
10.2 Implementation Tasks and Issues - Overview
The broad nature of the implementation tasks has been alluded to above. More specifically, the
main tasks are:
Task I The dissemination and maintenance of information relating to FRSP itself, the regulatory
framework for environmental management in Uganda, and the physical and social environment.
Some of this information is in paper form, but in addition, this study has prepared GIS data in the
form of CDs.
Task 2 The revision of various existing manuals/documents - the general specifications, the
design standards, and the maintenance manual - already used by the Ministry to take into account
environmental matters raised by this study.
Task 3 The establishment of a system of monitoring and evaluation of road sector activities from
an environmental perspective.
Task 4 The establishment of an environmental liaison unit within the Ministry.
Task 5 The establishment of an environmental unit within RAFU
Task 6 The development and delivery of a training programme for RAFU and Ministry staff.



87
Task 7 The implementation of various proposals to increase the capacity to conduct ElAs within
Uganda.
Task 8 The testing and dissemination of the EIA guidelines.
Task 9 Overall management and monitoring and securing financing
Overall supervision will be the responsibility of: the committee responsible for the post
constitutional restructuring of the Ministry, the RSDP coordination office, the ELU, the
Environmental Unit, and RAFU. Some of these entities do not exist yet. The next subsections
describe the implementation tasks in the order I - 8 above, which is the order they appear in the
study documents. However, the tables towards the end of this Chapter organise the tasks
according to overall responsibility.
10.3 Task 1: The Dissemination and Maintenance of Information
Volume IV of this study provides, inter alia, information on:
* a brief summary of FRSP
i the regulatory framework for environmental management in Uganda. This is principally the
relevant statutes, and the regulations concerning EIA gazetted as statutory instruments by
NEMA.
* the physical and social environment of Uganda. This is provided in quite some detail and
includes mapping at a scale that fits Uganda onto A3.
In addition, the mapping information is provided in the form of a CD that can be read by the
appropriate GIS software, providing information at a scale of 1:250,000 of all the different
aspects of the physical and social environment.
This information will need to be accessed by a number of different users:
I.    The various units within the Ministry's Roads Department.
2.     The various units within RAFU's Directorate of Engineering.
3.     Consultants carrying out strategic studies, for example the Roads Master Plan.
4.     EIA practitioners carrying out EIAs of specific road projects.
In the first instance, we suggest that the Ministry makes available, at a fee, copies of the whole of
Volume IV of this study. In the longer term, we suggest that the ELU extracts the specific
information referred to above, and publishes it as an 'Environmental Information Handbook for
Road Sector Planners' in a convenient handbook.
The maintenance and operation of GIS information and systems is beyond the scope of this study
although it makes a number of recommendations in this regard. The Ministry will need to
examine options in light of cost effectiveness, possibly within the context of the propose MIS
study. It should be noted that the Director of RAFU has indicated that the 'ownership' of the GIS
data and systems should not be a responsibility of RAFU.

privatisation or contracting out.)
10.4 Task 2: Revision of Ministry Manuals and Procedures
Volume IV of the report of this study details a number of suggested changes to Ministry manuals
and procedures to introduce environmental management issues. The documents concerned are:
- The General Specifications
- The Road Design Manual
- The Maintenance Manual
The first two of these are used principally by consulting engineers, to whom they are available
for sale and the Ministry's Division of Planning, Design and Documentation.
The Maintenance Manual, which is still in draft, will have variety of users both within and
outside the Ministry.
For the time being, we anticipate that the Maintenance Manual will continue to be the
responsibility of the Ministry. We are not clear whether responsibility for the General
Specifications and the Road Design Manual will be transferred to RAFU since this is part of the
debate over the boundary between policy and implementation. Either way, it might be anticipated
that the start of operations by RAFU might be an appropriate moment to review the contents of
these documents.

10.5 Task 3: Development of National Level Monitorine
The EIA Guidelines contained in Volume III of this report make provision for environmental
audits of completed road works. In part these will be done during the normal monitoring of a new
road as at the end of the defects liability period and during regular maintenance. However. other
audits should be undertaken after a longer period - say three years - since environmental impacts
may take time to build up. Such impacts should not be done by the consulting engineers
responsible for the road design and construction because problems may stem from design
weaknesses.
The implementation challenge is two-fold.  Firstly to make sure that the audits are done
periodically as they should, and to some extent report in a standardised format, and secondly to
make sure that the lessons of such audits are consolidated in the form of an evaluation of the
overall road sector programme. Such an evaluation might draw in lessons and reports from the
affected sectors - forestry, agriculture, and so on - and may require the collection of additional
data. Much of this work will be overseen by the ELU and the Environment Unit in RAFU.

10.6 Task 4: Formation of a Ministry Environmental Liaison Unit
This report proposes the formation of a Ministry Environmental Liaison Unit. As noted, the ELU
will have a much wider remit than just roads - it will cover all the operations of the Ministrv.
This takes it well beyond the scope and competence of this study. A number of factors outside
this study will need to be brought into consideration and so of all the tasks considered here, the
implementation plan for this one must be considered the most tentative.
The actual work of the ELU is described in earlier in this Volume and the implementation plan is
intended to cover its creation not its operation.
The Ministry has indicated that it wishes to place the ELU in the Policy Analysis Unit and that is
the working assumption here, although it could conceivably be revised as the Ministry further
considers the post constitutional restructuring.

10.7 Task 5: Formation of a RAFU Environment Unit
This report proposes the formation of a RAFU Environmental Unit. This has been generally
agreed in discussions held during the conduct of the study. It has to be said that the creation and
successful operation of this unit is the key to achieving sound environmental management in the
road sector.
The actual work of the Environment Unit is described in earlier in this Volume and the
implementation plan is intended to cover its creation not its operation.
The inclusion of an environment unit in RAFU was not foreseen in the preliminary (ie. before
RAFU's creation) planning. However, now that the director is in place, and the process of
recruitment of the next level of staff has been started, there is a convenient opportunity to
incorporate the unit into RAFU. Its final form and creation can be incorporated into the overall
efforts to set up RAFU.



91
RAFU is intended to be a temporary organisation, giving way to an eventual autonomous road
agency. The exact nature of the road agency will be subject to a future study and so it is
impossible at present to plan the future of the environment unit beyond RAFU but a working
assumption is that the road agency will take a similar form to RAFU and the environmental unit
can be transferred across at as part of the transition.

10.8 Task 6- Training of Ministry and RAFU Staff
This report contains a number of proposals for training staff of the Ministry and RAFU. Training
is proposed at various levels, and is intended to both raise general awareness, introduce specific
new procedures, and train field staff in relevant operational matters.
The implementation of the training poses two particular problems. The first is a sequencing and
time-tabling one. Environmental issues are outside the experience of the Ministry and they may
require external assistance in identifying suitable training resources. Although a number of
possibilities are identified in this report, there will still be work to do matching and tailoring
resources to specific staff and needs. Ideally the ELU and RAFU Environment Unit should be
involved in developing and delivering training programs, but they themselves may need some
training and may take some time to get into place. The implementation plan below proceeds step
by step and relies as much as possible on local capacity but is rather slow. An alternative option
would be to contract out the whole training exercise.
The second problem concerns the fact that some courses as proposed will be common to both the
Ministry and RAFU. However, RAFU should probably have control over its own human resource
development activities and would want to choose the nature and timing of courses. Another
factor here is that the training of (some) Ministry staff could probably proceed before that of
RAFU staff. A solution to this may be to proceed as follows: the initial round of training will not
be delivered to RAFU staff. However, the training materials will be provided to RAFU for RAFU
to adapt and incorporate into their overall training programme as appropriate. As with the
creation of the Environmental Unit within RAFU, the implementation of the environmental
training programme needs to be fully incorporated into RAFU's overall development plans.

10.9 Task 7: Development of Local Capacity to do EIAs
This report contains recommendations to develop capacity to do EIAs in Uganda. The three
recommendations cover:
A top management seminar aimed at all engineering consulting firms working in Uganda to
enable them to understand the requirements for ElAs. Since most or all of the work by
consulting engineers which this seminar is aimed at will be commissioned by RAFU, RAFU
should be responsible for this work. It might be combined with other exercises conducted by
RAFU to apprise the industry of its working methods and plans.
* Cross training for Ugandan EIA practitioners to apprise them of issues specific to the road
sector. Since the development of Ugandan practitioners is largely a matter of policy in
developing local capacity, we have placed responsibility for its implementation with the
Ministry's ELU.
. Development and dissemination of lists of local practitioners who might be used on a sub-
contracted basis. The responsibility for these databases would be with bodies such as NEMA
and the association of consulting engineers.

10.10 Task 8: Implementation of EIA euidelines
The whole of Volume III of this study sets out guidelines for the conduct of ElAs on road sector
activities. Although they are termed 'guidelines', since they interpret the relevant environmental
law and regulations from an environmental perspective, compliance with their essential elements
is mandatory.
Much of the work required to enable staff to develop a working knowledge of the guidelines is
provided for under task 6, training of Ministry and ELU staff. In addition it will be important that
the guidelines are tested and to a greater or lesser extent 'internalised' by those responsible for
their implementation. We envisage that this will involve, after testing, the reproduction and
distribution of the guidelines in the form a convenient manual or manuals that can be carried
around by those responsible for their use in the field.
Users will include Ministry and RAFU staff and consulting engineers and EIA practitioners.
An issue will be the 'ownership' of the guidelines. In a sense, compliance with the guidelines is a
policy matter and therefore in the realm of the Ministry. However, they do affect a number of
detailed operational matters that are in the realm of RAFU. Other operational matters - mainly
maintenance - will not affect RAFU in the short term (except during the defect liability period).
In the long run, RAFU will evolve into the exclusive lead agency and responsibility for the
guidelines will pass to it. To resolve this issue we suggest that until the road agency is formed,
the guidelines are owned by the ELU. However, RAFU should be allowed to adapt and publish
the relevant parts of the guidelines in a format consistent with its codes of conduct and other
internal operating procedures. These adapted guidelines would be subject to approval by the
ELU.

10.11 Task 9: Overall Management and Financing
The preceding tables set out the tasks to be done and assign responsibilities for specific actions.
However, all of this is taking place in a fluid institutional environment. Responsibility needs to
be given to the overall tracking and management of the implementation process. This is
complicated by the fact that:
I ) at least two rather separate institutions - the Ministry and RAFU are involved.
2) some of the supervision is most appropriately undertaken by a unit which does not yet exist -
the environmental liaison unit
3) the creation of the environmental liaison unit depends on factors outside the scope of this
study.
To get round this problem, we suggest that the responsibility for Ministry matters should be
taken by the RSDP coordination committee - if it is formed - or else the Permanent Secretary.
Although the formation of the ELU is outside its authority, it can advise Ministry top
management of the issues affecting the formation of the ELU arising from this study. Once the
ELU has been formed, it would be convenient if its senior officer were represented on the RSDP
coordination committee or equivalent top level Ministry body.
The matters under the responsibility of RAFU should be monitored by the Director of RAFU.
As far as possible, the monitoring of the environmental matters set out here should be integrated
with the overall monitoring programme undertaken as a matter of normal management.
A key additional task will be to incorporate all implementation and operating costs into to the
organisations' budgets, and to agree with the financing agencies.

11. BUDGET
11.1 Budget Overview
This chapter presents a preliminary budget for the cost of implementing and complying with
the measures laid out in this study. The estimated costs over 5 years shown in detail overleaf,
but can be summarised as follows:

TOTAL                                       4,170
11.2 Comparisons
In considering the size of the budget, the following comparisons might be helpful.
The cost of setting up and running the ELU (not in RAFU) and the RAFU environment unlit
are approximately US$ 260,000 per annum. This compares with total estimated running costs
of RAFU of US$ 4,700,000 thousand per annum. We have not attempted to separate capital
and recurrent costs in this analysis, since all capital investments would need to be renewed
after five years.
The total cost (which does not include any specific provision for the implementation of
mitigation measures) is approximately $ 4.2 million. This compares with a total estimate for
the 5 years of FRSP of $ 754 million. The cost of environmental management is therefore
around 0.6% of project costs. This proportion is highly sensitive to the actual costs of ElAs
which will only be known accurately when terms of reference have been prepared, but we
consider that a proportion of 1% or so would still be reasonable.



99
11.3 Financing
All RAFU operating and formation expenditure will be met by a World Bank credit under the
Road Sector Institution Technical Assistance Project. In addition, there is a provisional lump
sum $500k credit for the establishment of the ELU. This amount was earmarked before it
was clear that much of the responsibility for road sector environmental management would
be placed in RAFU. We understand that RAFU is in the process of reviewing its budgetary
arrangements.
The FRSP (and existing sources of funding) make provision for contract, studv and
supervision costs. The extent to which these amounts make provision for EIA and mitigation
costs is unclear.
It is unlikely that additional sources of funding other than those indicated can be mobilised to
cover the costs of environmental management - if indeed they are necessary.
The Ministry, RAFU and the World Bank now need to incorporate the estimates provided
into their discussions.

11.4 Budget Assumptions
The following assumptions were used in the preparation of the budget.
i.    No provision has been made for the cost of mitigation measures. It is assumed that
these are included in the estimated costs of construction. As a rule of thumb,
thorough mitigation measures would normally increase the costs of construction by
around 5%.
ii.    The routine work of the ELU would cover developing procedures for maintaining
and updating paper information, and no additional budget will be provided:
iii.    No provision has been made for developing or implementing GIS systems.
iv.    The ELU would be housed in existing Ministry accommodation using existing
facilities. No provision has therefore been made for office equipment or furniture.
v.    No offset has been provided for income from the sale of documents.
vi.    No provision has been made for the overall revision of the Road Design Manual and
General Specifications on the assumption that a revision will not be made until it is
required for additional reasons.
vii.   No provision has been made for the cost of producing the Maintenance Manual since
this is still in draft.
viii.   Operating costs for the RAFU Environment Unit are based on a proportion of salary
costs and are roughly in line with the ratio of salary to non-salary costs anticipated
for the whole of RAFU.
ix.    Provision has been made for RAFU EU and ELU to spend 150 staff days in the field
per annum at a subsistence allowance of $50.

12. CONCLUSIONS
This study has provided a foundation for incorporating environmental considerations into
road sector activities by imparting an understanding of the types of environmental and social
impacts that result from these activities, and means for mitigating and monitoring them. It
has illustrated how these considerations can be integrated into road planning, construction,
operation and maintenance through the use of guidelines that have been developed
specifically for the road sector during the course of the study. The institutional framework
within which environmental management can be undertaken by the MOWHC and RAFU
(and the future Road Agency) has also been addressed.
Various tasks have been recommended to achieve sound environmental management within
the road sector. In summary, these are:
* the dissemination and maintenance of environmental information pertinent to the road
sector;
* the revision of current MOWHC manuals and documentation to include environmental
considerations;
e the development of procedures for national level monitoring;
e the formation of environmental units with the MOWHC and RAFU;
e to train MOWHC and RAFU staff in environmental issues;
e to develop local capacity to conduct ElAs; and
e to ensure that the Road Sector EIA Guidelines are used.
It is imperative that environmental management within the road sector is taken seriously, and
this can only be done by the express involvement of top level management within the
MOWHC and RAFU/Road Agency. They must have the overall responsibility for ensuring
that recommended measures for environmental protection and mitigation, and that other
procedures put in place for facilitating environmental management are complied with.
Finally, environmental management issues must also be assimilated into other activities
within the MOWHC.

ANNEX I: TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.    Introduction
The purpose of this environmental assessment is to review the environmental aspects
of the First Road Sector Programme (FRSP) with respect to (i) the adequacy of the
current national system of environmental policies and regulations regarding
environmental assessment, mitigation, monitoring and management of road work
activities; (ii)  the capability of the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Conmmunications (MOWTC) and the National Environment Management Authority
(NEMA) to commission, facilitate and implement future environmental assessments
of road rehabilitation project; (iii) identify programs and organise training courses in
environmental assessment techniques for road projects for appropriate government
staff and consultants; and (iv) assess local consultant capability and training needs to
conduct relevant environmental assessments.
Given that (i) as of May 1995 it became mandatory national policy that
environmental assessments are now required for any new development projects (i.e.,
the National Environment Statute) and (ii) the Government has proposed its First
Road Sector Program, in which major road works are proposed which will be
conducted throughout Uganda, there is an urgent need to review the country's ability
to comply with NEMA's requirements that ELAs be carried out for all road work
activities, including assessment of MOWTC need for assistance in developing
procedures and staff capabilities for environmental assessments of road works.
With the current evolving regulatory system for conducting environmental
management activities within all sectors in Uganda, including that of road works, an
overall assessment of the road sector will help to ensure that the in-country capacity,
regulatory framework, principles and procedures are established and will also serve
as the basis for identifying institutional strengthening needs that should be carried
out under the Sector Program.
2.    Backeround
The national road network, i.e., Main Roads, Feeder Roads, and Community Roads,
is essentially inadequate for the transportation needs of the country, as evidenced by
the fact that: (i) about 30% of the gravel main roads and many rural feeder and
community roads remain unusable in wet weather, which impacts agricultural
production and undermines national security by isolating entire districts; (ii) 32% of
the unpaved roads are in poor condition, producing excessive vehicle operating costs;
(iii) several Kampala District roads are seriously congested and vehicle delays are
increasingly causing complete gridlocks; (iv) illegal axle loads are common which
has disruptive effects on the freight transport system; (v) there is a lack of operable
equipment to maintain road infrastructure; and (vi) there are institutional
inadequacies in staffing levels, including notable gaps in environmental management
capabilities.
In response to the need to improve the transportation system, as a means to promote
sustainable economic development for the country, the Government, through its
Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications, has planned for a major Road
Sector Development Program (RSDP), to rehabilitate, upgrade and extend the road



A -2
network and technical capabilities to carry out road environmental management
within the MOWTC. Through the international Development Association (IDA), the
World Bank is considering the support of substantial components of the Program, the
first of which includes the proposed rehabilitation and upgrading of four major trunk
roads and related institutional strengthening of MOWTC in environmental
management and road monitoring.
In accordance with the World Bank's requirements for environmental assessment of
all proposed road rehabilitation activities, both road-specific assessments and an
overall Sector Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the FRSP are required.
The assessments will be needed to supplement the inadequate current proposed roads
to comply with World Bank and the Ugandan National Environmental Management
Authority standards for EIA reporting. The EIA work for FRSP will include two
major components: (i) identifying the sectoral environmental impacts of the road
program on the Ugandan environmental management system, on the planning process
and on the policy , regulatory and institutional framework; and (ii) conducting site-
specific impact assessments for teach of the planned road sections and elaborating on
activities that will mitigate these impacts and contribute to environmentally sound
use of the land and its resources adjacent to the proposed road works. The following
Terms of Reference describes the requirements for conducting the Sector
Environmental Assessment.
3.     Obiectives
The overall objectives of the Sector Environmental Assessment are:
i)    Assisting the Government of Uganda to identify the status of the country's
procedures for conducting environmental impact assessment of road sector
projects by reviewing its system of policies, regulations, and institutional
framework for EIA work and the gaps that remain in the system for carrying
out road sector environmental assessments and ongoing monitoring of
contractors top ensures they comply with environmental standards and
practices;
ii)    Identifying  the most critical environmental issues constraining  the
environmental management of the road sector in Uganda and activities that
are necessary for strengthening the institutions involved in road sector EIA
work, including the need for further policies and regulations, studies and
training of government staff;
iii)   In conjunction with NEMA, developing environmental guidelines for
environmental assessments of road projects; and
iv)    Streamlining and standardising the EIA process for road works, including the
incorporation of environmental considerations in all stages of a road project
from the identification and selection of roads and alignments, through design,
implementation, monitoring and the content of works contracts for
engineering consultants.



A - 3
4.     Tasks
i)     Assess the scope of the FRSP's field of influence, activities and impacts on
the environmental management system in the country;
ii)    Describe the proposed sector program in terms of the environmental impacts
of the work components;
iii)    Define the study area, i.e. what constitutes the environmental habitats that
will be included within the program's influence and what constitutes the
direct and secondary impacts that are anticipated;
iv)    Describe the environmental situation in Uganda, including environmental
and social/resettlement issues relevant to the Project such as (a) the presence
of sensitive soil conditions, erosion, steep slopes, and the need for soil
conservation and revegetation; (b) rapidly decreasing areas of natural
habitats and the need for protection, including the Project's potential
influence on already protected areas; (c) the presence of likely resettlement
issues, and the need for resettlement and/or compensation or other social
assistance; and (d) the likelihood of positive impacts on women and/or local
sustainable economic development as a result of environmental programs
that would be implemented as part of the road impact mitigation process;
v)     Describe and assess the country's policy framework for environmental
management of road sector activities. The Consultant will analyse (i) the
national environmental policies and legislation relevant to the road sector,
particularly the emerging framework for EIA work evolving through NEMA;
(ii) transport sector policies relevant to environmental management,
including road sector policies; and (iii) sector-specific laws and regulations
that have environmental implications;
vi)    Review the institutional tasks the project will entail, including the initiation,
implementation, and approval process of ElAs and monitoring of the
implementation of environmental mitigation plans;
vii)   Assess the institutional capacity of both central and regional level authorities
to implement future environmental assessments and monitoring of road
works, as well as to facilitate this work by effectively commissioning outside
firms;
viii)  Identify needs for additional fields of expertise, training and funds for
providing the institutional strengthening of road sector EIA capabilities,
within MOWTC, NEMA and other relevant organisations;
ix)    Propose a training approach for appropriate government staff, with the
possibility of a study tour to draw upon foreign expertise in the area of road
sector environmental review and regulatory framework development;
x)     Assess local consultant capability to conduct environmental assessments,
including both NGOs and private sector firms. From this assessment,
determine the training needs for such consultants to enable them to become
fully familiar with environmental assessments for the highway sector.



A -4
xi)    Review the EIA process in Uganda and its harmonization with the World
Bank's procedures and how these new procedures will impact on future EIA
requirements under the Project;
xii)   Formulate sector-specific environmental assessment guidelines and process
that will cover: (i)   environmental screening of sub-projects; (ii)
categorization for standards of determining Category "A", "B" or "C"
projects, in accordance with World Bank/NEMA definitions; (iii)
environmental assessment of sub-projects; (iv) design of environmental
mitigation and monitoring plans; and (iv) standard operations, procedures
and conditions for inclusion in road construction contracts; and (v) ways to
analyze project altematives where impacts are likely to be significant without
such alternatives;
xiii)   Develop national and sector level mitigation plan. This will include
mitigation plans to (i) define institutional capacity and regulatory policy
weaknesses and ways to minimize these sectoral deficiencies and (ii)
establish a set of principles according to which the individual road
components should be environmentally and socially assessed. The basis for
such principles may be found in documents ratified by the Government and
the World Bank Environmental Source book.
xiv)   Identify environmental performance indicators for monitoring of project
implementation and prepare a monitoring plan, including specifications for
supervision expertise and costs during project implementation.
