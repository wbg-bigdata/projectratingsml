F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project objectives are:

  1.    To strengthen the Government's road sector management capability through
spinning off the road administration and execution activities of the Ministry of Works,
Housing and Communications (MOWHC), and the creation of an autonomous and
performance-based Road Agency.




                                                 ii

  2. To improve transport sector policy and management, through the redefinition of the
role of MOWHC towards a regulatory and planning body.

  3. To prepare physical infrastructure components to be included in the proposed First
Road Sector Project which would contribute to economic growth and poverty alleviation
and to improved access to social services.

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.         In 1997, when the Road Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance Project
(RSISTAP) was appraised, Uganda was one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. This was
due to implementation of a series of structural and institutional reforms. The government developed
a comprehensive policy and institutional reform program aimed at deregulating the economy,
eliminating direct state involvement in the public services, and improving institutional efficiency.
The government embarked on a major privatization program, a comprehensive civil service reform,
public expenditures reform for both development and recurrent budgets and a decentralization
process. These elements of the government's reform program provided the background for the
design of the RSISTAP.

2.         RSISTAP was designed to support the Government of Uganda (GOU) in setting up an
appropriate institutional framework in the roads sector and to prepare engineering designs for
implementing the Road Development Program (RDP), a component of the proposed 10-year Road
Sector Development Program (RSDP) 1996-2006. RSDP is currently being supported by a four-
phased IDA Adaptable Program Loan (APL). APL1, 2 and 3 are under implementation and APL4 is
under preparation.

3.         The creation of an autonomous, performance-based Road Agency (RA) was critical.
Accordingly, the overriding goal of RSISTAP was to support the government in setting up such RA
within three years of project effectiveness. It was planned to carry out a study for the establishment
of a RA, which would cover the statutory, legal and regulatory framework required for the
establishment and operation of the RA. The study was also required to assess the funding
arrangements for the road sector and for operation of the RA including the possibility of a user-
managed road fund. Prior to the establishment of the RA, consultant services for transitional
institutional arrangements in the form of a Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) were agreed to be
financed under RSISTAP. RAFU was to be created prior to effectiveness of the credit and to take
over the management of large contracts from the Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT). This
institutional arrangement was intended to ensure a more effective program management and project
implementation capability in the road sector, thus creating a conducive environment for effective
implementation of the RDP and the creation of an autonomous RA. The strategy at project
appraisal was that by the time parliament passes the bill to create a RA, the institutional capacity of
RAFU in financial management, procurement, environment and monitoring would sufficiently
develop to transform RAFU to Uganda National Road Authority (UNRA).

4.         The design of RSISTAP was consistent with the World Bank Group's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was discussed at the Board on May 20, 1997, and the GOU
Letter of Sector Policy (LOSP), which was signed by the Minister of Finance, Planning and
Economic Development (MOFPED) on July 16, 1997. RSISTAP was part of IDA's operational
program, which was designed to reduce poverty through a medium term strategy focused on private
investment-led growth. Lowering transport costs and improving reliability of accesses to
infrastructure were the key elements to facilitate business development. RSISTAP was designed to:
(i) strengthen the budgetary process through the development and implementation of a management
information system; (ii) provide support for implementation of parastatal reforms in the transport
sector; (iii) create an enabling policy and regulatory environment for private sector investment and
management; (iv) improving environmental protection though the establishment of an



                                                1

Environmental Liaison Unit (ELU) within MOWT; and (v) prepare for the rehabilitation and
upgrade of economic infrastructure through feasibility and engineering studies, and the preparation
of bidding documents.


1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.        The project objectives were to: (i) strengthen the government's road sector management
capability through spinning off of the road administration and execution of activities under MOWT,
and the creation of an autonomous performance-based Road Agency; (ii) improve transport sector
policy and management, through the redefinition of the role of MOWT towards a regulatory and
planning body; and (iii) prepare physical infrastructure components to be included in a future road
sector program which would contribute to economic growth and poverty alleviation and to
improved access to social services.

6.        As given in the Memorandum and Recommendations of the President to the Executive
Directors, dated August 4, 1997, Technical Annex 7, the key indicators to assess the outcomes and
impacts of project development objectives were as follows:

      · Creation of an autonomous Road Agency by June 1, 2000.
      · Spin off executing functions from MOWT by June 1, 2000.
      · Establishment of an Environmental Liaison Unit (ELU) within MOWT by July 1998.
      · Increased volume of road works to be contracted out to the private sector increasing to
          85% of the total in 2000/2001 from 65% in 1996/97.
      · Commencement of physical investments in support of economic growth and market
          integration by September 1999.
      · Project funds would be properly budgeted, accounted for and audited within a
          satisfactory system of internal control.
      · Improved       co-ordination    between   national   environmental     sector   policy  and
          implementation of road programs.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
        reasons/justification

7.        There was no change in the PDO. However, some indicators and their target values were
modified and realigned in the process of the extensions of credit closing dates as follows (see data
sheet):

(A) PDO Indicators:

· Improve institutional efficiency of the road sector measured through improved management of
    works contracts.

· Redefining the role of MOWT with a target date for transferring maintenance activities to
    UNRA by October 1, 2007.

· Rehabilitate economic infrastructure with a target date of commencement of physical
    investments in support of economic growth and market integration by June 30, 2001.




                                               2

· Improve environment protection with a target date for setting up an ELU in MOWT by April 1,
    2001.

· Improve efficiency through involvement of the private sector with following target values to be
    achieved by December 31, 2007: (i) 100 percent new construction and rehabilitation works
    contracted out; and (ii) 85 percent maintenance works contracted out.

(B) Intermediate Outcome Indicators:

· Preparation of road rehabilitation and upgrading sub-projects with a target date for
    commencement of physical investments by June 1, 2001.

· Establishment of UNRA by October 1, 2007.

· Strengthen road management capacity with a target value of completing road sector policy and
    management studies by December 31, 2005.

· Timely availability of counterpart funds with appropriate budget discipline established by
    December 31, 2007.

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

8.         The primary target group or main beneficiary of the project was the MOWT. RSISTAP
supported setting up of ELU, technical advisory services for the operation of RAFU, creation of
UNRA, external auditing, and carrying out of studies relating to sector policy, institutional
development, capacity building and technical management. It also supported preparation of
engineering design of selected road projects, which have been or are being implemented under the
follow-on road sector projects. These activities have led to substantial savings in vehicle operating
costs and travel time on national roads. The study to develop a ten-year district road investment
plan (TYDRIP) was a precursor to the policy and development of the ten-year district, urban and
community access roads investment plan (DUCARIP) currently under implementation with support
from other donors. Improvement and timely maintenance of district roads will benefit local
governments, farmers, traders and rural population through increasing agriculture produce, and
contributed to improving delivery of social services in the rural areas. Since the identified sub-
projects were part of a comprehensive countrywide road investment strategy, RSISTAP contributed
to foster economic growth and poverty alleviation through improvement in market integration and
accessibility. The completed sector studies benefited in rationalizing road sector management and
improved efficiency and management effectiveness in the road sector. The main beneficiaries
identified at project appraisal remained the same during project implementation.

1.5        Original Components (as approved)

9.         As provided in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) of March 1998, the RSISTAP
comprised the following components.

10.        Part A: Institutional Developmental and Capacity Building:

Strengthening the borrower's road sector management capability through provision of technical
advisory services by:




                                               3

           (i)     Staffing RAFU as the nucleus for the proposed Road Agency; and

           (ii)    Establishing and staffing a new ELU in MOWT.

11.        Part B: Sector Policy and Management Studies:

Improvement of the Borrower's road sector policy and management through provision of technical
advisory services for studies on:

           (i)     an autonomous Road Agency;

           (ii)    road safety audit and regulations;

           (iii)   road network management policy; and

           (iv)    development of a management information system.

12.        Part C: Infrastructure Preparation Studies

Preparation of the physical infrastructure components of a proposed multi-year roads rehabilitation
and improvement program through:

       (i)  the carrying out of feasibility studies and if feasible, the detailed engineering design and
            environmental assessment of about 680 km of main roads; and

       (ii) (a) preparation of a national feeder road study and (b) detailed engineering designs for
            about 500 km of feeder roads.

13.        Part D: External Auditing:

Provision of technical advisory services for the auditing of accounts under the projects.

1.6        Revised Components

14.        Per the government's request dated February 4, 1999 an amendment to the DCA was
signed on May 5, 1999 to add the following component:

15.        Part E: Office equipment, computers and vehicles for RAFU estimated at US$720,000.
The justification for such equipment was well explained and linked to capacity building in the
government's request. Accordingly, in the DCA, Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the
Credit), Schedule 2 (Description of the Project) and Schedule 3 (Procurement) were amended.

16.        In addition, the government's request also included a revision to Part A for institutional
development and capacity building. In the original component, it was envisioned that RAFU would
be staffed by teams provided by international consulting firms. The selection of consulting firms
would have caused less management problems in handling a large number of technical assistance
staff. But based on findings of a consultant's report on "The Transitional Arrangements for the
Establishment of a Road Agency" (TAERA) and the government's experience in the country on
setting up of a similar organization such as the "Uganda Revenue Authority", the government was
convinced that the recruitment of individual consultants for line positions within RAFU, combined



                                                 4

with the recruitment of technical assistance consultants, both individuals and firms would be the
most effective way of achieving capacity building.

1.7        Other significant changes

17.        No significant changes were made in the overall project objectives and design. However,
some changes as summarized below were made in the scope and scale, implementation schedule
and funding reallocation.

18.        Scope and scale: On October 4, 2001 the DCA was amended to allow for the following
changes in the scope and scale of the project activities: (i) increasing the coverage of roads under
detailed engineering design and environmental assessment from 680 km to 730 km; (ii) increasing
the coverage of engineering design for the 10 years district road investment program from 500 km
to 1000 km; and (iii) carrying out a feasibility study and detailed engineering design for upgrading
from gravel to paved (bituminous) standard of about 300 km of district roads that were reclassified
to national roads.

19.        Implementation Schedule: The original project closing date was December 31, 2000.
During the life of the project the closing date was extended four times because of the delays in
achieving the critical development objective of establishing the national road authority, as follows:
(i) on May 5, 2000, for one year until December 31, 2001; (ii) on October 4, 2001, for two years
until December 31, 2003; (iii) on March 10, 2003, for a further two years until December 31, 2005;
and (iv) finally, on December 23, 2005, for a period of another two years until December 31, 2007.
The compelling justification for all extension requests were that the project's development
objectives were still achievable, but that more time was needed to implement the intended
ambitious reforms.

20.        Funding Reallocation:      Funding reallocation among the categories of institutional
development, capacity building and equipment was done three times: on May 5, 1999; October 4,
2001; and on November 2, 2004. The aim was to ensure that the revised components were
adequately funded.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.        In the LOSP, the government expressed commitment to continue selection and
prioritization of the transport investments and recurrent expenditures in a rational manner. This was
necessary at that stage when new projects were competing for very limited resources. As part of the
medium term strategy for the transport sector, the government developed the 10-Year (1996-2006)
RSDP to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve access to social services.
Consistent with the goals of institutional reform RSDP provided emphasis on privatization of road
management and restructuring of MOWT. RSISTAP supported GOU's institutional reform
objectives in the road sector and facilitated consultants in preparation of the investment component
of RSDP and conducting sector policy, management and technical studies.

22.        The following lessons drawn from the experience of earlier transport operations in
Uganda were reflected in the design of RSISTAP: (i) limited capacity of the implementation agency
to address the problems relating to contract management, financial and technical monitoring; (ii)
substantial delays in the processing and awarding of contracts, which led to delayed completion,



                                               5

cost overruns, and loss of investment; (iii) the need to first undertake the main institutional and
policy changes, including restructuring road administrations as well as changes in the decision
making process before proceeding with any road sector investment; and (iv) the need to update
engineering design before commencement of projects so as to avoid substantial changes in the field.
RSISTAP took these lessons into account. As a result, the Bank did not support implementation of
the government's First Road Sector Project (FRSP: 1997-2001) though the project was ready at the
time of the RSISTAP's appraisal as the critical institutional reforms aimed at improving
management efficiency in the road sector had not been completed. Accordingly, in order to address
the institutional reforms, on September 1, 1998, RAFU was established as a nucleus and precursor
to the proposed autonomous road authority. RAFU was given responsibility for the management of
large civil works contracts. RAFU being an "arms-length" agency with competitively selected and
well salaried professionals, it greatly enhanced road management as compared to the Ministry.

23.        At project preparation, a risk analysis was carried out and the mitigation measures were
correctly identified. The results of the proposed institutional restructuring/setting up of a road
agency associated with mobilization of government funding for its sustained operations was
allocated "high risk" rating and this was adequately mitigated through the credit by adopting a
market based remuneration system and extending contract on long term basis that would attract
qualified and experienced technical staff. The other risk of developing adequate management and
technical capacity was managed through agreeing on a series of key actions as follows: (i)
appointment of the head of RAFU by credit effectiveness, (ii) approval of an action plan
recommended by the study on the transitional arrangements for the establishment of the Road
Agency by credit effectiveness; (iii) compliance with key target dates under an agreed action plan
prior to appraisal of the proposed follow-on FRSP (RDP Phase 1); and (iv) allocation of adequate
counterpart funds (US$ 3.0million). However the delay in fulfilling the mandatory procedures
required prior to setting up of an autonomous road agency such as approval of a road agency bill by
the cabinet and then by the parliament was not conceived as part of the risk analysis.

24.        RSISTAP was prepared in a collaborative manner and GOU took the lead role.
Information sharing and consultations also took place with the donor community. Within the
framework of RSDP, two donor technical meetings took place in Uganda in April and October
1996. In addition, a Donor's conference was held in Paris on November 20, 1996. The draft project
concept document was disseminated to the donor community and formerly reviewed in March 1997
at a stakeholders' meeting comprising of GOU, local government officials, representatives of the
donor community, professional bodies, academia, transport operators and road users during
appraisal.

25.        The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) carried out a quality at entry review during the
period December 1, 1997 to January 16, 1998 and rated it as satisfactory (see paragraph 63).

2.2        Implementation

26.        The Bank approved the project on September 9, 1997, the DCA was signed on March 9,
1998 and the credit became effective on August 27, 1998. The credit was scheduled to be effective
within 90 days of the credit signing by June 9, 1998, but by that date the government could not
meet the following effectiveness conditions: (i) the terms and conditions of employment of RAFU
staff as recommended in the study on TAERA; (ii) key RAFU staff selected; (iii) approved action
plan for implementation of the TAERA study recommendations; and (iv) consultants selected for
carrying out four studies under the component of sector policy and management studies.
Accordingly, the credit effectiveness date was extended for a further period of three months. All
effectiveness conditions were met by the extended effectiveness date of August 27, 1998. The


                                               6

major delay was due to the difficulty in the recruitment of the Director of RAFU. This position was
first advertised in July 1997 and was only filled on September 1, 1998 after a re-advertisement
because the first advert did not attract competent applicants. The other key positions of Finance and
Administration and Deputy Director were filled on December 3, 1998 and January 7, 1999
respectively.

27.        A mid-term review (MTR) took place in March 2000. The MTR noted that project
objectives two and three: relating to improving sector policy and management through redefining
the role of MOWT, and carrying out engineering studies for the preparation of the physical
infrastructure component of the follow-on project were being successfully accomplished. However,
the first project objective related to the creation of an autonomous performance based road agency
was not progressing satisfactorily, as preparation and processing of the legislation for the
establishment of UNRA took much longer than anticipated. A draft bill was prepared and discussed
with stakeholders in late 2004 and was approved by Cabinet in April 2005. The bill was presented
to parliament on April 13, 2006, and was approved on May 5, 2006. Though it took long to
establish (see paragraph 30 below for the main reasons of the delay in implementing UNRA, and
Annex 2, Table 2.3 for a chronology of events for setting up UNRA), due to its transparency
requirements, the involvement of the private sector in the Board of Directors, and the requirement
to adhere to the performance agreement between MOWT and UNRA the bill is being considered as
best practice by road management specialists.

28.        During implementation, the project was twice subjected to a QAG review: (i) October 12,
2004; and (ii) September 22, 2006. In the first review of October 2004, the overall rating of
assessment was moderately satisfactory. However in the second review of September 2006, the
overall rating was satisfactory (see paragraph 65).

2.2.1      Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Factors outside the control of the GOU or implementing agencies:

29.        There were no major factors outside the control of GOU or implementing agencies that
affected the implementation of the project.

Factors generally subject to government control

30.        Selection of the appropriate option either Road Agency or Authority: In April 2001, GOU
prepared policy guidelines and implementation strategy for promoting an executive agency program
and RAFU was identified as one of the candidates for converting to a road agency using a "fast
track" program. In May 2001, the road agency study was launched and its report was discussed in a
workshop held in Kampala on March 3, 2002. In January 2003, though GOU was still committed
to develop RAFU as a Road Agency based on the Executive Agency Bill (EAB), it was recognized
that the EAB would not provide sufficient autonomy needed for the operation of a road agency. As
a result, in June 2004 the option of establishing an executive agency was abandoned, and GOU
authorized MOWT to develop its own bill for the establishment of an autonomous road authority.
In September 2004, the MOWT with support of consultant prepared the UNRA Bill which was
submitted to Cabinet in October 2004. Cabinet approved the bill in April 2005 and the bill was
approved by parliament on May 5, 2006. In between, there were parliamentary and presidential
elections that delayed the approval process. Though GOU took a long time in deciding the
appropriate option of an Executive Agency or Authority, it must be recognized that this decision
was arrived at in a consultative and democratic manner taking into account the views of sector



                                                 7

stakeholders and that the final outcome is highly commendable. A chronology of the main events
that have happened for the setting up of UNRA is shown in Annex 2, Table 2.3.

Factors generally subject to the implementing agency's control

31.       As mentioned before RAFU, an "arms-length" agency under the control of the MOWT,
was created as an interim measure to enhance the capacity for the management of large contracts
(financed by GOU and development partners) prior to creation of a fully autonomous road agency
(UNRA). With the creation of RAFU road management capacity considerably improved (see
Annex 3). However, initially RAFU had limited procurement and contract management capacity,
was slow in recruiting its staff, and had weak monitoring and reporting capacity throughout the
execution of the project as is explained in the paragraphs 32­35.

32.       Initially inadequate capacity of RAFU for procurement and contract management:
Although technical assistance was provided to RAFU in these areas, it was initially still
overwhelmed with the massive task of procurement and contract management since it took over the
management of all GOU and development partner financed large contracts.

33.       Delay in recruiting RAFU key staff:        The following problems were experienced in
recruiting local engineers: (i) the perception that transfer from MOWT to RAFU would be
automatic created some confusion; (ii) the condition to resign from public service prior to joining
RAFU on a fixed term contract of one year, though renewable, was not clear as many of the staff
had job security and were not sure whether they would forfeit their terminal benefits or not; (iii) the
government's requirement for engineers in responsible positions is that they must be registered
engineers in accordance with the laws of the country, i.e. the Engineer's Registration Act 1965, and
this condition for recruitment of engineers in RAFU was an obstacle as many of the registered
engineers were holding top government positions or were well placed in the private sector. To
overcome these issues the following was agreed: (i) to assign 13 young engineers who had not been
registered by the Engineer's Registration Board, many of them with Masters level degrees, to
RAFU on probation and their appointment letters were issued promptly upon registration; (ii) in
order to build confidence in the staff, performance evaluation was carried out to enable
management to assign the correct responsibilities to them; and (iii) renewal of the annual contracts
was made automatic provided the performance was satisfactory. Many of the young professionals
performed well and some have competed successfully to occupy managerial positions in UNRA.

34.       Weak monitoring capacity. The project included key output and outcome indicators for
monitoring and evaluation. However the long decision-making process that require the approval of
the contracts committee, lack of follow up on the agreed performance indicators, incomplete design
of the monitoring and evaluation framework have contributed to implementation delays of some
project activities.

35.       Lack of comprehensive progress reporting. RAFU prepared progress reports on
individual project activities, but paid little attention to produce more comprehensive and
consolidated progress reports for the information of all stakeholders interested in the road sector.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.       M & E Design: The key performance indicators for monitoring the achievement of the
project objectives, project implementation, and financial progress were designed at project appraisal.
The framework provided adequate information on inputs, outputs, risks, critical assumptions,
outcome and impacts. However, the QAG review noted that it was not sufficiently sensitive to track


                                                8

progress through intermediate targets and benchmarks. The ICR team agrees with the QAG review
report that it did not provide a good measure of progress as these were formulated in terms of end
results or outputs whereas capacity building and institutional developments were through a phased
process and needed intermediate benchmarks to monitor progress and to make adjustments as the
need arose.

37.        M & E Implementation: During project implementation, the performance indicators were
modified and realigned as necessary (see paragraph 7) specifically to measure the progress of
achieving development objectives and to take into account the changes made in the project
activities. The ICR team agrees with QAG review report that: (i) results framework agreed at entry
was not modified during project implementation; (ii) the four project extensions were not subjected
to easily monitored benchmarks; and (iii) the results framework should have been revised and
updated at the time of each credit extension. RAFU had a monitoring officer but no comprehensive
evaluations were carried out to assess the performance of the organization in terms of procurement
delivery, contractor payments and the performance of contractors and consultants.

38.        M & E Utilization: UNRA will have a Planning Directorate with an adequately staffed
unit responsible for M & E functions.

2.4        Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.        Procurement: At project appraisal, all procurement arrangements including procurement
plan and procurement methods were discussed and agreed consistent with the World Bank (WB)
guidelines. The project included mainly procurement of consultant's services which comprised
consulting firms and individual consultants. The selection methods used were quality and cost
based for technical assistance, engineering and policy studies; and least cost selection methods for
the audit services. For the supply of vehicles, computer and other office equipment, the
procurement methods of international bidding and shopping were used, which were consistent with
the World Bank guidelines. Despite RAFU's efforts to follow procurement plans, delays occurred.
On some occasions the quality of procurement documentations were not up to standard at the initial
stages of the project. However, by project closing and with the formation of working teams of
international consultants and local staff, the quality of procurement documents improved and
procurement activities for most of the goods and consulting services contracts were satisfactorily
completed.

40.        Financial Management: There was a separate Finance and Administration Division, in
RAFU, that was responsible for all aspects of financial management. A well documented Financial
Management Manual was developed. The manual outlines internal control procedures as well as
financial reporting arrangements for the funding received from the GOU budget and the WB and
other donors. Effective July 2001, the accounting system was fully computerized based on a double
entry accounting system. The ratings of the Financial Management (FM) in the ISRs were
satisfactory. The quality of the financial management reports in general was good. Satisfactory
audit reports were received on a timely basis, which were reviewed by the Bank and the comments
sent to the Borrower. FM issues were identified and appropriate recommendations made. The
absence of an internal audit unit had been a theme for a long time and it is now being established
under UNRA. Consistent with the DCA, the following financial covenants were complied with: (i)
carrying out audits of the special account in accordance with appropriate auditing principles by
independent auditors and (ii) furnishing of the information concerning the records and accounts.
There had been some delay in the release of counterpart funds due to budgetary constraints, but
prior to project closing this was fully resolved.



                                                9

41.        Environment:    At appraisal the project was considered as a Category "C" project with
no environment risks as the project included no physical components. An ELU was established in
MOWT to monitor the activities of not only road projects but all environmental issues relating to
infrastructure projects under the jurisdiction of the ministry. ELU was formed in April 2001 and
now it has three environmental specialists. ELU works in collaboration with the National
Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) and follows the recommendations of the road
sector environmental policy and management study report completed earlier in the project. ELU
ensures that all road projects have NEMA approval prior to start of their implementation.

42.        Social: As this project was primarily technical assistance for the institutional
transformation of the road sector in Uganda, no direct social impacts occurred. However, the
project provided adequate emphasis on addressing the social issues through the engineering design
of feeder roads to be implemented under the follow-on projects. In addition, under RSISTAP, a
road safety improvement and audit study was completed. The main purpose for this study was to
review the road safety problems in Uganda and to develop an action plan for remedial measures to
improve road safety under the follow on projects. The plans have been implemented under the
RDPP2 project. These include: (i) preparation of curricula for driving instructors and driving
schools; (ii) training manuals for teaching road safety in primary schools; (iii) provision of road
safety enforcement equipment, motor-cycles, computers and associated training for the traffic
police; and (iv) capacity building for the injury control center of Mulago Hospital.

2.5        Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43.        RSISTAP supported the preparation of institutional reforms while setting up RAFU as an
interim measure. It also carried out the feasibility studies and prepared the engineering design and
bidding documents for rehabilitation and upgrading of the prioritized road projects to be executed
through the four phased APL: Road Development Program described below. The overall
performance of these operations can be attributed to the performance of RAFU.

44.        Road Development Program Phase 1 (RDPP1): The size of the credit was US$119
million and IDA financed US$102 million. The original allocation was US$90.98 million. The
increase was due to the appreciation of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) against the United States
Dollar (USD). It was approved by the Board on June 29, 1999, became effective on February 1,
2000 and will close on June 30, 2008. Its key objective was to improve access to rural and
economically productive areas and to gradually build up road sector planning and management
capability. The Project completed the construction of the Pakwach-Nebbi-Arua road (130 km) and
Busunju-Kiboga-Hoima road (145 km) designed under the RSISTAP.

45.        Road Development Program Phase 2 (RDPP2): The size of the credit was US$97
million and IDA financed US$79 million. The original allocation was US$66.5 million. The
increase was due to the appreciation of the SDR against the USD. It was approved by the Board on
July 3, 2001, became effective on April 11, 2002 and will close on June 30, 2008. Its key objective
was to improve access to rural areas and economically productive areas and to progressively
continue to build up sustainable road sector planning, design and program management capability,
as well as road safety management. The project completed the construction of Karuma-Olwiyo-
Pakwach road (108 km) and Fortportal-Kasese-Katunguru and Equators road (162 km). It also
financed the improvement of safety at selected road accident black spots, capacity building
activities, and the production of a national transport master plan including a specific plan for the
Kampala metropolitan area.




                                               10

46.        Road Development Program Phase 3 (RDPP3): The size of the credit/grant is US$114
million. The original allocation was US$107 million. The increase was due to the appreciation of
the SDR against the USD. It was approved by the Board on May 20, 2004, and became effective on
June 23, 2005. Its key objective was to improve access to rural areas and economically productive
areas and to progressively continue to build up sustainable road sector planning, design and
program management capability including road safety management. The Project is implementing
the construction of Soroti-Dokolo-Lira road (125 km) and Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road (42 km).
The project also finances feasibility and detailed design for the Gulu-Atiak-Nimula and the Arua-
Koboko-Oraba roads, and the detailed design of 300 km of district roads, as well as capacity
building in RAFU/UNRA.

47.        Road Development Program Phase 4 (RDPP4): This project is under preparation. It is
proposed to complete the balance of work which could not be financed under the RDPP3 on
account of cost overruns. The roads included are Busega-Mityana road (57 km) and Zirobwe-
Wobulenzi road (26 km). The project also plans the financing of road safety activities, the
preparation of a future urban transport component in Kampala, capacity building and preparation of
design and bidding documents on priority roads. The project is scheduled for Board presentation on
October 30, 2008.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.        The project design addressed the objectives of carrying out appropriate institutional
reforms, which were critical for the implementation of the government's 10-year RSDP. The
project objectives were relevant to the country's development priorities and the circumstances
prevailing in the road sector. Given that this was a technical assistance project supporting major
sector reform, the planned implementation period of only three and a half years was too short.
Similar institutional reform processes in the region have taken not less than a decade The project
preparation was timely and responsive to the ministry's needs for making preparations for
implementing the First Road Sector Development Program (1997-2001), which was to be the first
five year phase of the 10-year Road Sector Development Program (1997-2006) with a cost
estimated at US$1.5 billion. The Bank carried out a diagnostic analysis of the government's
planned RSDP and correctly advised to start with a technical assistance project for addressing
critical needs of building institutional capacity, creating an independent road agency, and preparing
detailed designs and bidding documents for the rehabilitation/paving of the main road network, and
all these were adequately reflected in the design of RSISTAP.

49.        The project objectives were clear, relevant and important to improve sector policy, road
management, preparation of the future road sector investment programs, and improving access to
social services. The project components had a good linkage with the project objectives. The project
also contributed to the Bank's CAS strategic outcomes of lowering transport cost, improving
reliability of access to infrastructure services, and poverty reduction through medium term strategy
focused on private investment led growth. The project objectives were also in line with the
country's (1998) Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), and the LOSP through facilitating the
efficient and reliable provision of transport services, increasing agricultural production, enhancing
linkages with neighboring countries, promoting economic growth and integrating the country as a
whole.




                                                11

3.2        Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.        As given in section 1.2 above there were three PDOs. The relative importance of each
project objective, its linkage to the high level objectives and the rating for the assessment of its
outcome is described below:

51.        The first objective of strengthening the government's road sector management capability
through spinning off of the road execution and administration activities of the MOWT, and creation
of an autonomous performance based road agency has been largely achieved, though with
considerable delay. Its rating is assessed as "moderately satisfactory" due to these delays. For the
achievement of this PDO, 70% of the project resources were allocated and therefore, this PDO
carries the most weight. RAFU was created as an interim solution in September1998 and was given
the task to procure and manage large contracts for upgrading, rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance on the national road network. Through setting up of RAFU, the implementation of
large contracts improved considerably in terms of quality of outputs and time of delivery. The
creation of an autonomous performance based road agency that would fully manage the national
road network (including maintenance) however took much longer than planned for the following
reasons: (i) in 2000, the government approved the Executive Agency Bill (EAB) and selected
RAFU to be converted to a Road Agency as per EAB, but in 2002 the road agency study recognized
that EAB will not provide adequate autonomy and recommended not to move forward with this
proposal; and (ii) in 2004 the government abandoned the idea of creating a road agency under EAB
and started preparation of the UNRA bill which took until April 2005 to be approved by Cabinet
and until May 2006 to be approved by parliament. Thereafter the Board of Directors of UNRA was
appointed in January 2007, the CEO selected in November 2007, Directors in March 2008, and key
staff in May 2008. Throughout the project duration RAFU carried out one of the key functions of
UNRA, the management of large contracts (which constitutes about 70% of its overall tasks), on the
national road network with increasing efficiency and has thereby enhanced sector efficiency
substantially (see Annex 3). RAFU has also, with the help of the project, implemented an extensive
capacity building program in the sector that has now enabled it, including its well developed
fiduciary functions, to transit to UNRA as of July 1, 2008 and take over maintenance works from
MOWT. With effect from January 1, 2008, GOU has been financing the salaries of RAFU staff.
Meanwhile the majority of the RAFU staff has been selected for the various positions of UNRA
and appropriate allocation has been made for the payment of market based salaries of UNRA staff
in the FY08/09 budget.

52.        The second objective of improving sector policy and management through redefining of
the role of MOWT towards a regulatory and planning body has been substantially achieved and its
rating is assessed as "satisfactory". For the achievement of this PDO, 7% of the project resources
were allocated. To improve sector policies and road management, RSISTAP has financed several
studies including the road agency study, road network management and financing study, road safety
audit, motor vehicles inspection study, in-house development of management information system
and a study in the use of local lime in road construction. Many of the recommendations resulting
from these studies have been implemented. For example, based on the recommendations of the road
management and financing study, a Road Fund (RF) bill was prepared and the RF legislation
passed by Parliament on June 19, 2008. It is expected that the RF will be fully operational by July 1,
2009. The axle load regulation and control policy has been reviewed, revised and axle load control
is being implemented by MOWT. Further studies were carried out under the follow-on RDP
projects, including a study for the spinning off of the surface transport regulatory functions of the
MOWT to an autonomous agency. This is now under consideration by the government.



                                              12

53.        Achievement of the third objective of preparing physical infrastructure components to be
included in the future road sector program has exceeded the original targets by 128%, and its rating
is assessed as "highly satisfactory". Feasibility studies were carried out and the engineering designs
prepared for upgrading/rehabilitation of a total length of 795 km compared to the envisaged 680 km
at appraisal. One road, Kapchorwa-Suam, was found not feasible. The upgrading of 383 km and
rehabilitation/strengthening of 162 km of roads have been completed under the follow-on projects
RDPP1 and RDPP2, which will close on June 30, 2008. The rehabilitation and upgrading of the
remaining 250 km of roads will be completed under the ongoing RDPP3 and the RDPP4 which is
under preparation. A pre-investment study for the Nile Bridge at Jinja was completed in March
2006 and the key findings were that the low traffic levels would make it difficult to use a Public
Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement for construction of the new bridge, but the bridge was
assessed to be in critical condition needing urgent attention. Meanwhile, as GOU is conducting
repair works, JICA has agreed to finance preparation of detailed design and bidding documents and
possibly the construction of a new bridge. Regarding feeder roads, detailed engineering designs for
1,000 km under the ten year district road investment program were completed, which is over and
above the planned 500 km.

3.3        Efficiency

54.        The RSISTAP did not include the implementation of civil works. Therefore, conventional
quantitative economic analysis which is normally carried out for investment projects does not apply.
However, an autonomous road agency (with RAFU as a transitional arrangement) is being set up
and significant economic benefits were achieved through better road network management. A study
to review the benefits of institutional effectiveness through setting up an autonomous road agency
was concluded in September 2004 and its key findings are that institutional reforms can result in: (i)
higher quality of roads; (ii) fewer contract cost overruns; (iii) greater private sector participation;
and (iv) value for money as a whole on the projects completed. A summary of the assessment is
given in Annex 3.

3.4        Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

55.        The project has laid a strong foundation for the management and sustainability of the
road sector and has successfully prepared the design and bidding documents for the follow-on
projects RDP-Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4. By creating RAFU it has successfully increased road
management capacity, however, one of its objectives to create an autonomous road agency took
much longer than anticipated and was not fully achieved by project completion and therefore the
overall outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory. The project outcome is still fully relevant to
current Bank and government strategy and sector efficiency has been sustainably improved.
However, the efficacy of the process has been less than fully satisfactory. Hence, the overall rating
of Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5        Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56.        Poverty impact: As this was a Technical Assistance (TA) project, it did not have any
direct impact on poverty alleviation, gender and social development aspects. However the project
included an engineering study for the upgrading and rehabilitation of feeder roads to be
implemented under the follow-on projects. It is expected that after the improvement works are


                                                13

completed on feeder roads, it will have an impact on the economic growth and poverty reduction
through lowering transportation costs, savings in travel time, and improving access to social
services. The policy and strategy paper on feeder roads also provided equal employment
opportunities for male and female workers on road rehabilitation works.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

57.        During the implementation phase the following institutional changes were made:

(i) MOWT established RAFU in September 1998, which was condition of effectiveness of the
credit. RAFU took over the management of large contracts and performance improved considerably
in terms of quality and time delivery. Maintenance of the national road network remained with the
engineering department of MOWT. All responsibilities for the management of national roads will
be transferred to UNRA by July 1, 2008.

(ii) An ELU was established in April 2001 within MOWT and its objective was to provide
coordination with NEMA.

(iii) For the overall coordination of RSDP, a steering committee was established under MOFPED in
September 1998.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative):

58.        At project design in 1997, the establishment of the Road Fund had not been planned for.
During the implementation period, the creation of a Road Fund was discussed and agreed upon with
GOU. This change will be a positive step towards ensuring adequate and stable flow of
maintenance funding and sustainability of the project outcomes.

3.6        Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

59.        As this was a technical assistance project aimed at carrying out institutional reforms,
conducting sector policy studies and preparing engineering design for the main and feeder roads, it
was not required to carry out such beneficiary surveys. However the following stakeholder
workshops were held:

(i) On November 20, 1996, a donor's conference was held in Paris to discuss government road
sector strategy for the national road network, which was reflected in the first 5-year phase (1996-
2001) of the GOU's 10-year (1996-2006) road program.

(ii) In January 1998, a stakeholder's workshop was held in Kampala to review the TAERA study
report and recommendations.

(iii) On March 3, 2002 a stakeholder's workshop was held in Kampala to discuss the road agency
study.

(iv) On April 23-24, 2002 a stakeholder's workshop was held in Kampala to discuss an update of
the GOU 10-year (1996-2006) road program. This workshop was attended by all stakeholders,
including development partners interested in the road sector.

(v) On June 28, 2005, a stakeholder's workshop was held in Kampala to review the performance of
the transport sector.




                                              14

(vi) On October 16-19, 2006 a joint transport sector review meeting was held in Kampala to review
performance of the sector. The workshop was attended by all stakeholders, including development
partners.

(vii) On October 30, 2007, a stakeholder workshop was held in Kampala to discuss the findings and
recommendations of a study aimed at promoting PPP through using the concept of Output
Performance-based Road Contracts (OPRC) for the maintenance and management of roads in the
country.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

60.        The risks identified during appraisal were associated with the mobilization of government
funding for sustainable operation of the Road Agency and development of its capacity to implement
the RSDP, given the incentive problem and the likely competition for qualified human resources in
the sector across the region. By adopting a market-based remuneration system and by extending
contracts on a long term basis, RAFU was able to attract and retain the appropriate staff. By
establishing a Road Fund, it is anticipated that the risk associated with sustainable funding will be
mitigated. Considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a Road Fund and the
likelihood for adequate future financing of road maintenance has considerably increased. It is
therefore judged that the reforms are irreversible and the rating for the risk to the development
outcome is assessed as "moderate". Other risks not identified earlier are associated with the creation
of an executive agency as opposed to an autonomous road authority. This risk was mitigated after
government realized that an executive agency would not have sufficient autonomy, unlike an
autonomous road authority. Hence, the creation of an agency under the Executive Agency Bill
(EAB) was dropped in favor of an autonomous road authority, UNRA, which will be fully
operational by July 1, 2008. The restructuring of MOWT is on-going to transfer the management of
national roads to UNRA. The roads designed under RSISTAP are being implemented under RDPP
Phase 1, 2, and 3.


5.         Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1        Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.        The project design was relevant, appropriate and responsive to the client's needs. The
government's 10-year (1997-2006) road sector investment program estimated to cost US$1.5
billion was ready and it sought Bank's support to implement its first 5-year phase (1997-2001). The
Bank reviewed the size of the program and was not convinced about the adequacy of the
institutional set up and management capacity of the implementation agency, MOWT, to embark on
such a large project. As such, the team correctly advised the client to first prepare a TA project with
a specific focus on strengthening management capacity, reviewing sector priorities, and
implementing policy and institutional reforms, which were critical prior to considering any major
investment in the road sector. The Bank's assessment of the lack of capacity and its proposed
ameliorative measures were correct.




                                              15

62.         Taking into account that the consultative and legislative process for the creation of a road
authority is a long process, the proposed project implementation period of three and half years was
too short. Experience shows that road sector reforms seldom take less than a decade to complete.
Setting the establishment of a new autonomous road agency as the primary development objective
of RSISTAP was indeed an ambitious target to achieve in 3-4 years. The overall risk of the project
at appraisal was assessed as "high" and the mitigation measures were adequate, though a
comprehensive risk mitigation plan to follow during project implementation was not designed and
discussed with the borrower. This gives the main reason for the quality at entry rating of
"Moderately Satisfactory".

63.         The ICR team agrees with QAG quality at entry review report's rating that the project
concepts, objectives and approach were "satisfactory", and the rating for institutional capacity
analysis and readiness for implementation "marginally satisfactory". The ICR team also agrees with
the QAG findings carried out in 2004 and 2006. The QAG Quality of Supervision Assessment
(QSA6) report dated October 12, 2004 highlighted the following issues related to the quality at
entry: (i) the project was not ready for implementation at approval; (ii) project preparation took nine
months, and project effectiveness took another twelve months, (iii) institutional capacity analysis
was not adequate; (iv) some of the problems encountered during implementation could have been
easily identified by a thorough stakeholder assessment and a proper institutional analysis; (v)
project team should have identified, at entry, both the champions of supporting reforms and those
resisting reforms; (vi) an organizational/management specialist might have provided insights into a
more appropriate timeframe and the organizational capacity for project implementation; and (vii) it
might have been more appropriate to require the passage of some sort of umbrella legislation by
project appraisal. Instead of including several effectiveness conditions, which delayed the project
effectiveness, the task team should have spent more time in ensuring project readiness.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.         A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was prepared, which has provided a good basis for
the project supervision. The skills mix of the Bank supervision team was well balanced and the
Bank team provided good guidance to the government in meeting the effectiveness conditions. The
Bank team maintained a strategic vision on institutional development during the project
implementation. The supervision team worked closely with the client and not only pushed forward
the agreed agenda of institutional reform, but provided guidance on other cross-cutting issues such
as the creation of a RF, strengthening contract management and enhancing donor collaboration in
the road sector. The quality of the financial management reviews was found to be satisfactory and
consistent with the Bank guidelines. The supervision aide-memoires for the most part of the
implementation phase were extensive and provided highlights on the key issues, thus providing
prompt information to the client and Bank management. However, the Bank's supervision teams
should have been more realistic in assigning the ratings for development objectives and
implementation performance in the ISR (the ratings were consistently shown as satisfactory in all
ISRs throughout the life of project) and should have been more proactive in addressing the causes
of these delays.

65.         The ICR team agrees with the QAG findings that: (i) this was a high risk ­ and high
reward venture; (ii) there was significant involvement of the Bank's team to resolve day to day
problems; (iii) from the strategic standpoint, the Bank was highly responsive in recognizing the
problems and providing space and time for their resolution; (iv) the actions taken by the Bank to
resolve implementation bottlenecks were adequate; (v) additional management attention to both the


                                               16

substance and reporting of project results might have helped to further advance the institutional
reform agenda of the project; and (vi) a major effort should have been undertaken to revise the
results framework particularly at the time of each credit extension. However, the ICR team does not
agree with the QAG finding that the Bank could have been more proactive beginning with the
progressive cancellation of the credit as the critical milestones were missed and the
recommendation to release the IDA resources for other projects in Uganda or elsewhere in SSA.
Such cancellation of portions of the credit would likely have imperiled the reform process and the
project might not have achieved the reforms as they are now in place. Rather, the supervision team
and the client have, through persistence, eventually achieved the initially planned institutional
reforms and more.

(c) Justification for Rating of Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.        Though the Bank underestimated the time needed for the envisaged reforms, the Bank's
advice to the Borrower that the investment program could only be supported if the government was
ready to strengthen road management capacity through reforms and that an interim RAFU should
be created was appropriate and commendable. During the implementation phase, the Bank worked
closely with the client to achieve quality reforms over and above what was envisaged at appraisal
(for example, approval of the RF Bill). The setting up of UNRA took much longer than initially
planned and the Bank could have been more proactive in furthering these reforms, therefore the
overall rating of the Bank's performance is assessed as "moderately satisfactory", despite the
successful outcome of the other two objectives of improving sector policy and preparing the
engineering designs of physical infrastructure.

5.2        Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.        The government showed strong commitment in implementing the institutional reforms.
UNRA is in the final stages of becoming operational. MOFPED commenced to finance the
operational cost of RAFU/UNRA after the RSISTAP credit was closed on December 31, 2007. In
addition, government has shown a strong commitment to move the institutional reforms further by
setting up a Road Fund to enhance financial sustainability of road maintenance. Furthermore, the
government is in the process of approving a policy for improved vehicle inspection. In order to
monitor performance of the transport sector, government has convened, on an annual basis, a Joint
Transport Sector Review Workshop (JTSR), the last of which was held on October 18-19, 2006.
The next JTSR is scheduled to take place in September 2008. However, due to the long time taken
to establish UNRA, the Borrower's performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agencies' Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.        RAFU's Management Committee (MC) was responsible for monitoring and providing
advisory services. The MC comprised the Minister of MOWT (Chairman), the Permanent Secretary,
Engineer-in-Chief/Director of Engineering and the Director of RAFU. The head of the RAFU desk
in MOWT, financed by DANIDA, served as a secretary to the MC and acted in a liaison role


                                              17

between RAFU and MOWT. To ensure efficiency, RAFU appointed highly qualified core staff in
the engineering, finance and administration divisions. The staff was engaged on one year,
renewable, performance based contracts. As of September 30, 2002, RAFU had 66 staff (including
support staff) against the established 94 positions. As of December 31, 2007, the date of project
closing, 63 positions were filled. RAFU has proven its functionality and viability by improving the
quality of output and shortening the time taken for implementing major civil works by
approximately 50 percent compared to the time taken previously by MOWT, although its takeoff
was delayed due to initial difficulties to employ appropriate staff.

69.        In July 2005, the Bank expressed its concerns regarding quality of procurement and urged
RAFU management to streamline and centralize the operation by introducing tight quality control
measures as the procurement documents, such as evaluation reports, contained inconsistencies and
was not always compliant with the procurement guidelines. Subsequently, the formation of teams
comprising of foreign and national professionals to handle procurement helped to considerably
improve the situation and build capacity.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.        The government showed strong commitment to carry out institutional reforms in the road
sector, and implemented the key recommendations of several studies completed on road safety,
vehicle inspection and road network management. The implementing agency, MOWT delegated
much of the project management responsibilities to the newly established RAFU. RAFU being a
new and inexperienced agency was a bit slow at the initial stages, but soon picked up in fulfilling its
responsibilities. RAFU had to face a major challenge of recruiting national professional staff as
they were neither sure of their terminal benefits if they left their incumbent positions, nor of their
future if they accepted the one year contract in RAFU. In order to solve the impasse, the ministry
and the Bank agreed to assign young professionals to RAFU for training. These professionals, who
have been working in RAFU for the last seven years, now form the nucleus of the present RAFU
and many of them are likely to occupy key positions in UNRA. Due to the initial problems related
to the capacity of RAFU and due to the delays in creating UNRA the overall performance of the
government and the implementing agency is rated as "moderately satisfactory".

6.       Lessons Learned

71.        Technical Assistance: When RAFU was created in 1998, its head and other key staff were
expatriate staff appointed under the project funded TA program. The involvement of the TAs was
slowly phased out as the capability of national professionals was developed to manage the activities
of the sector. In 2004 a Ugandan national professional with a good performance record was
appointed as the Director of RAFU, thus replacing an expatriate staff and this has proven to be
effective. However, the skill transfer to local staff was not very effective and took a very long time.
In designing a technical assistance program, it is critical to evaluate the knowledge, skills, talents
and competencies of national professionals so as to appoint them to senior positions. Future TAs
should have clear objectives of training national professionals in a specified time to ensure
institutional sustainability.

72.        Policy and institutional reforms: The policy and institutional reforms to transform the
ministry's road agency (RAFU) to an autonomous road authority (UNRA) have taken much more
time than the anticipated three and half years as that required launching a study, holding
stakeholders´ workshops, reaching a consensus, preparation of a draft legislation, cabinet approval,


                                                18

discussion in parliament, and enacting the Bill into a law, which are the unavoidable processes to
set up a road authority. Making UNRA effective also required a comprehensive institutional
analysis, preparation and agreeing on the organization chart, recruitment of staff, preparation of an
operations manual, etc. Therefore it is critical to allow sufficient time for designing, planning and
implementing policy and institutional reforms in the sector. In hindsight, one could have designed
RSISTAP as a smaller credit focusing on the base studies for the reform and preparation of design
and bidding documents for the follow-on APL, and link the reform process with triggers to the
implementation of the various phases of the APL.

73.       Project Implementation Unit (PIU): RAFU was created as a default PIU and as a nucleus
for the establishment of an autonomous road authority and most of its salary and operational costs
were funded by the project. This was to mitigate the risks related to sustainable government
financing and to ensure that the staff was well motivated to implement the costly projects. However,
it took long for government to prepare a realistic budget to meet the requirements of UNRA as the
extended credit continued to finance the salaries of RAFU. As such, this became a disincentive for
moving rapidly toward a government financed road authority. The lesson is that the putting in place
of a PIU may be a disincentive for the implementation of institutional reform.

74.       Monitoring and Assessment Framework: At project preparation, a set of good outcome
and impact indicators were designed, but no framework was agreed to monitor project performance
and as a result no effective monitoring was carried out during project implementation. Therefore to
only design performance indicators may not be enough unless a comprehensive monitoring and
assessment framework has been agreed upon with all stakeholders at the project design stage. The
monitoring and assessment framework should include a time based action plan to carry out baseline
studies, regular reviews of interim benchmarks, and a well coordinated mechanism for evaluation
and reporting of the project performance at least biannually.

75.       Inadequate procurement capacity that resulted in implementation delays: RAFU was a
new agency and it did not initially have adequate procurement capacity to launch and manage large
works and services contracts. The lesson is that the initial TA team for the support of RAFU should
have included more and better qualified procurement and contract management specialists.

                                Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. This project does not include civil works. Therefore, conventional quantitative economic analysis similar
   to that for investments project does not apply. However, an autonomous road agency (with RAFU as a
   transitional arrangement) has been set up. As such, significant economic benefits can be achieved through
   better road network management. A study conducted by a consultant (Mark Thriscutt an Independent
   Road Management Consultant) dated September 2004, has analyzed the benefits induced by such an
   institutional reform. The conclusions drawn from this study are as follows:

   · Higher quality of road treatments (including road construction and maintenance) through
   improved contract procurement and supervision: It is widely recognized that works carried out under
   RAFU management is to a higher standard due to more rigorous supervision and closer adherence to
   contractual requirements. For example, insisting that contractors have separate materials testing
   laboratories on site contributed towards an improvement in the quality of materials used by contractors.
   The use of technical audits by RAFU also resulted into continued quality improvements.

   · Reduce Losses due to "Unrecorded Payments: Without good pay and a professional working
   environment, it is more likely that corruption will happen with the procurement of big public work
   contracts. The Mark Thriscutt report mentions that "unrecorded payments" made by contractors and
   consultants in one form or another range from 10 percent and 20 percent. Conversely, there was no
   evidence that such losses were being incurred in contracts being managed by RAFU.

   · Fewer contract cost overruns: In addition, with professional management from RAFU, late
  completion of civil works was substantially decreased compared with the completion of works under the
  management of engineering department under the ministry. This resulted in fewer contract overruns under
   RAFU.

   · Greater Private Sector Participation: By introducing competition in the provision of services, and
   by having the right institutional framework, private sector companies have been encouraged to develop
   more efficient and effective ways of providing the required services. According to Transit NZ of New
   Zealand, competitive tendering could reduce costs by 10 percent - 15 percent.

   Cost Benefit Analysis of the Reform to the Date of 2004

2. A cost benefit analysis was carried out on the road projects managed by RAFU and the results showed
   very good internal rates of return, thus indicating that the reforms offered a positive value for money to
   the economy as a result of improved contract management. On the average, IRRs of 53% were obtained
   for the most optimistic scenario and 14% for the most pessimistic scenario.


   Table 3.1: Estimated Benefits from Improved Performance in 2004 prices (US$ million), using only
                                               known RAFU Projects

    Scenario                                          Most Optimistic                       Most Pessimistic
    NPV (2004 prices, using                             $119 million                           $3.3 million
    12% discount rate)
    IRR (%)                                                  53%                                   14%

3. If the profile of work continued over the next 20 years, then the benefits from the reforms will be much
   larger. The result of the evaluation is listed in Table 3.2




                                                        30

                                           2004 prices (US$ million),
                   Assuming future RAFU Workload will remain similar to present levels
         Scenario                                Most Optimistic                      Most Pessimistic
         NPV (2004 prices,                        $1, 490 million                       $710 million

         rate)
         IRR (%)                                       67%                                  51%


4. However, all the analyses were done before the project closed in December 2007; the analyses evaluated
   the benefits brought by the institutional setting of RAFU rather than of UNRA. If UNRA can operate as
   efficiently and autonomously as designed, it is expected that the benefits of reform can be sustainable.

6.1      INTRODUCTION

1.       The short and mid term strategy of the Government of Uganda is to promote and develop cheaper, more
reliable and safer transport services to support growth in the different sectors of the economy. In order to implement
the above strategy, the government prepared a 10-Year Road Sector Development Program (RSDP) which received
Donor Support in November 1996. However, the efficient implementation of the RSDP required broad institutional
reforms and policy development as well as infrastructure preparatory studies for the physical components.

2.       The International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank agreed to support the institutional
reforms, policy developments, and preparation of infrastructure studies of the RDP through the Road Sector
Institutional Support and Technical Assistance Project (RSISTAP). The Bank approved the project on September 9,
1997, and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) between government and the Association was signed on March
9, 1998.

6.2      PROJECT OBJECTIVES

3.       The primary objectives of the project were to (i) strengthen the government's road sector management
capability, through spinning off the road administration and execution activities of the Ministry of Works and Housing
and Communications (MOWHC), (now Ministry of Works and Transport) and the creation of an autonomous and
performance-based Road Agency; (ii) improve transport sector policy and management, through the redefinition of the
role of MOWHC to that of a regulatory and planning body; and (iii) prepare physical infrastructure components to be
included in a future road sector program, which would support domestic market integration thus contribute to
economic growth and poverty alleviation, and improved access to social services.

4.       The project objectives remained the same throughout the life of the project; however, the scope was revised to
accommodate additional sector policy and management studies, consulting services for physical components and to
provide for equipment and software for the Road Agency Formation Unit as part of capacity building.

6.3      Project components

6.3.1    Original Project scope

5.       The projects objectives were originally to be achieved through the following 4 (four) components:

Part A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building

6.       This component aimed at strengthening the road sector management capacity through provision of technical
advisory services by (i) staffing the Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) as the nucleus for the proposed Road
Agency (ii) Establishing and staffing a new Environmental Liaison Unit in the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications, now Ministry of Works and Transport.

Part B: Road Sector Policy and Management Studies

7.       This aimed at the improvement of the road sector policy and management through the provision of technical
advisory services for carrying out studies on: (i) an autonomous Road Agency; (ii) Road safety Audit and regulation;
(iii) Road Network Management Policy; and (iv) Development of a Management Information System.



                                                           34

Part C: Infrastructure Preparation Studies

8.       These were to include (i) feasibility, detailed engineering design and environmental study of about 680 km of
main roads (ii) national feeder roads study (iii) detailed engineering design of 500 km of feeder roads.

Part D: External Auditing

9.       This provided for the technical advisory services for auditing of accounts under project.

6.3.2    Changes in the project scope

10.      On May 5, 1999, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended to provide for a new component,
Part E of the project which aimed at enabling procurement of office equipment, computers and vehicles for the Road
Agency Formation Unit, RAFU. The amended credit also allowed for individual recruitment of RAFU staff under
Component A of the project based on personal qualification and experience.

11.      On October 4, 2001, the DCA was amended again, to re-allocate the project proceeds and allow for the
following changes in the project scope (i) increase main road to be designed from 680 km to 730 km, (ii) replace the
District Feeder Roads study with two separate studies: (a) Preparation of a 10 Year National Feeder/District Road
Investment Program, and feasibility study and detailed engineering design for rehabilitation of 1000 km of
feeder/district roads (b) Carrying out feasibility study for upgrading about 300 km of district roads to national
standards; (iii) substitution of the Kapchorwa-Suam road study by feasibility study and detailed engineering design of
Soroti-Lira road, and (iv) extend support for capacity building to the Uganda Statistics Bureau.

12.      On November 2, 2004, the DCA was again amended to re-allocate the project proceeds and allow for the
following additional changes in the project scope (i) Motor Vehicle Inspection Services study, use of Lime in road
construction in Uganda and pre-investment study for a second Nile bridge at Jinja under project component B; (ii)
feasibility study and detailed engineering design of Busega-Mityana road under component C; (iii) additional
equipment for new staff/consultants within RAFU under project component E,

6.4      Project costs

6.4.1    Original IDA financing Allocations

13.      The DCA for RSISTAP signed on March 9, 1998, provided for the following allocation of the SDR
21,600,000 credit proceeds: Part A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building (SDR 10,060,000), Part B:
Sector Policy and Management Studies (SDR 1,450,000); Part C: Consulting Services for Physical Components (SDR
8,560,000); Part D: External Auditing (SDR 80,000) and unallocated (SDR 1,450,000).

6.4.2    Amendments and Re-allocations

14.      On May 5, 1999 the credit proceeds were re-allocated as follows: Part A: Institutional Development and
Capacity Building amount was reduced to SDR 9,340,000 to allow for a new component Part E: Office Equipment,
Computers and Vehicles (SDR 720,000).

15.      On October 4, 2001, the credit proceed were again reallocated and the following changes were made: Part B:
Sector Policy and Management Studies amount was increased to SDR 1,600,000 and Part C: Consulting Services for
Physical Components was reduced to SDR 8,410,000.




                                                             35

16.      On November 2, 2004 the credit proceeds were again re-allocated and the following changes were made: Part
A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building was increased to SDR 13,420,000, Part C: Consulting Services for
Physical Components was reduced further to SDR 4,970,000; and Part E: Computers and Vehicles was increased to
SDR 1.530,000. These changes resulted into zero balance on the unallocated component.

6.5      Project Implementation

6.5.1    Implementation Schedule

17.      The credit became effective on August 27, 1998 with an original closing date of December 31, 2000. Due to
delays in achieving one of the critical development objectives of the credit, of designing and building a strong and
sustainable national road authority, and the desire to enable continuous support of the institutional reforms, the credit
was extended four times to the current closing date of December 31, 2007 as follows: Extension to December 31, 2001
was sought on April 10, 2000 and approval was given on May 5, 2000; extension to December 31, 2003 was sought on
September 10, 2001 and approval was given on October 4, 2001, extension to December 31, 2005 was sought on
January 8, 2003 and approval was given on March 10, 2003; and extension to December 31, 2007 was sought on
November 18, 2005 and approval was given on December 23, 2005 . The extensions were asked for by the government
and were approved by the World Bank to enable the credit support the completion of the institutional reform process,
which had taken much longer to complete than had been envisaged when the project was appraised. The schedule of
implementation of the project activities is in given in table 7.1.

6.5.2    Financial performance

18.      A summary of the financial status at project closure is shown in the table below. From the table, the percent
utilization of the credit in terms of SDR is 98 percent while in terms of US$ it is 95 percent. The difference in
percentages is due to depreciation of the dollar against the SDR over the years.

   20.       The first objective was to strengthen the Borrower's road sector management capability
   through spinning off of road administration and execution of activities under MOWHC and the
   creation of an autonomous performance-based Road Agency. This objective was to be achieved
   through project component, Part A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building through
   technical assistance services. The rating for the achievement of this objective is: SATISFACTORY
   as shown in the table below.

     Objective No.2

     21.      The second objective was to improve transport sector policy and management, through the
     redefinition of the role of MOWHC to that of a regulatory and planning body, and improved road
     management and increased involvement of the private sector in road management. This objective was
     to be achieved through project component, Part B: Sector Policy and Management Studies. The rating
     for the achievement of this objective is satisfactory. Six Sector Policy studies and Management
     studies were conducted instead of the four as shown in the table below. The studies, namely the Road
     Network Management study, Road Safety Improvement and Audit study, Road Agency Study, Re-
     introduction and commercialization of Motor Vehicle Inspection, Study on use of lime in Road,
     will/have formed the basis for government policy in various aspects of road management.

    Objective No.3:

    22.      The third objective was to prepare physical infrastructure projects to be included in a future
    road sector program, which would support market integration and improved access to social services.
    This objective was to be achieved through the project component, Part C: Infrastructure Preparation
    Studies. The rating for the achievement of this objective is highly satisfactory. Feasibility study and
    detailed engineering design was done for 870 km of national instead of the 680 km planned at
    appraisal. Civil works on all the designed roads have been carried out/ongoing under IDA/GOU

   6.6.2   Component Assessment

   Part A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building

   Staff RAFU as a nucleus for the proposed Road Agency

   23.     The project supported institutional reforms and technical assistance to the Ministry of Works
   and Transport, specifically in setting up of a performance oriented Road Agency Formation Unit
   (RAFU), the nucleus of the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA). RAFU started operating in
   1998, and its functionality and viability was proved through improved quality of outputs and by
   shortening the time taken for the procurement processes for the civil works compared to the time
   taken by other management arrangements.

   24.     The Road Agency Formation Unit, (RAFU) since establishment has been manned by highly
   professional and experienced staff employed on performance based renewable personal contracts. The
   staffing levels at project closure were as indicated in table 6.1. During program implementation, the
   following consultants provided Technical Assistance:

   (i)     Specialists Services: Four consultants provided Technical Assistance (TA), comprising of a
   Transport Economist, an Environmental Specialist, Bridges Engineer and Soils/Geotechnical
   Specialist, collectively referred to as Team 1, from May 2001 to January 2004. A similar team of
   consultants referred to as Team 3, provided by Louis Berger International Inc.-USA provided
   Technical Assistance from March 2004 to July 2007.

   (ii)    Project Engineers: Four Project Engineers (two Senior Project Engineers and two Project
   Engineers) were engaged as Team 2 from January 2002 to February 2004. Another Team of four
   Senior Project Engineers, Team 4 provided Technical Assistance from March 2004 up to August 2007.




                                                      43

Environmental and Social Management

25.     An Environmental Liaison Unit (ELU) has been established in the Ministry of Transport to
provide the capacity to monitor the activities of the RSDP in particular, and those of the ministry in
general with respect to adherence to environmental protection policies and mitigation of adverse
environmental and social impacts (including land acquisition, compensation and resettlement)
resulting from road works. The ELU, formed in April 2001, is currently staffed with a Principal
Environmental Officer as its Manager and two senior officers; one in charge of environmental matters
and the other social issues. Technical assistance for one year was also provided by technical advisors;
the environmental advisor was funded through the credit and the social advisor by DANIDA.
Workshops to sensitize Engineers from Ministry of Works and Transport and the Road Agency
Formation Unit (RAFU) were held from 11-13 January, 2005.

Sector Policy and Management Studies

Road Safety Improvement and Audit Study

26.     The main purpose of the study conducted by Phoenix was to review road safety problems in
Uganda and to develop an action plan of remedial measures to improve road safety. The study,
completed in April 2002, identified institutional weaknesses, poor infrastructure, ineffective laws and
regulations, poor enforcement, poor vehicle conditions, among the causes of the high accident rates.
As a result, 5-year Improvement Plan and a 3-year Action Plan, were developed. The 3-year action
plan comprised of engineering actions, enforcement actions, education actions and human resource
actions and the 5-year plan action plan covered 58 black spots on rural highway and urban roads.
Implementation of the prioritized elements of the Action Plan comprising provision of enforcement
equipment to traffic police, physical improvement to identified black spots on one Key route
(Kampala-Jinja road), a road safety institutional support project have been/are being undertaken under
the IDA funded RDPP2 credit.



                                                   44

Management Information System Development Study

27.     The study was aimed at developing the proposed Road Works Management System to
provide MOWHC with a basic management tool for operational maintenance management,
programming, and management of projects under RSDP. However, with the establishment of the
Division of Information Services (ISD) in RAFU it was no longer necessary to undertake the study.
As a result the study was excluded from the credit. The Information division of RAFU undertook a
much wider review and developed a comprehensive strategic information systems plan which
provided a frame for building a robust information structure and a strategic direction for developing
information systems in the roads sector with main focus on internal users (RAFU and UNRA), key
business partners and external customers. Implementation of these initiatives has been ongoing and is
to continue in accordance with UNRA priorities and available resources.

Road Network Management Policy Study

28.     The objective of the study conducted by Tahal was to develop a functional Road
Classification System, Pavement Management System, and Axle Control mechanisms to enable
MOWHC to effectively plan network development and management. The study was successfully
completed in November 1999 and the following were the outcomes (i) road functional classification
system, road numbering and network planning, (ii) recommendations regarding axle loads, (iii)
recommendations regarding pavement maintenance practices, and (iv) recommendations regarding the
Pavement Management System. The road networks in the country have now been classified to
national, district, urban and community roads and axle load control programs implemented.

Road Agency Study

29.     The study was awarded to M/s WSP International (UK) in April 2001 and the services
commenced in May 2001. The study conducted by WSP International (UK) was concluded in April
2002 and the recommendations made in the report formed the basis for establishing the Uganda
National Roads Authority. The recruitment of UNRA staff is in progress. The board was appointed in
January 2007, the Executive Director was appointed on November 1, 2007 and the positions of the
Directors and Managers advertised in November 2007 and December 2007 respectively. It anticipated
that UNRA would be fully operational by 1 July 2008.

Re-introduction and Commercialization of Motor Vehicle Inspection

30.     The objectives of the study were: (i) to determine the viability, cost effectiveness, of re-
introducing and privatizing motor vehicle inspection services, (ii) to review existing legislation to
ensure its sufficiency in the re-introduction, privatization and provision of quality vehicle inspection
services, (iii) to plan and propose institutional set-ups and linkages for managing the vehicle
inspection process, (iv) to specify the desired minimum level for vehicle inspection and prepare the
related reference documentation (e.g. Inspection station manual, station layout), and (v) to prepare
documentation for the procurement of firm(s) to provide Motor Vehicle Inspection Services. The
study was successfully completed by Lea International in April 2007 and its main recommendation
was that the government re-introduces motor vehicle inspection (MVI) services as commercialized
self-financing services through concessions of periods ranging between 5 years to 8 years.
Additionally the study produced a Motor Vehicle Inspection Manual and Operations/Procedures
Manual. The recommendations were forwarded to the Ministry of Works and Transport to formulate
appropriate policies.

Use of Lime in Road Construction in Uganda

31.     The major objective of the study was to investigate possible sources of lime, its quality,
industrial production and methods of production. The study was successfully completed by CSIR


                                                   45

Transportek in March 2007, and the recommendations were that there should be improvements in the
production methods for lime and testing procedures. It also recommended that the stabilization design
guide for Uganda should be developed, and General Specifications should be improved.

Consulting Services for Physical Components

32.     The following Consulting services have been completed:

(i)     Karuma-Pakwach-Arua Road (238 km): Designs were completed in May 2001 by
Roughton International and Resettlement action plans in December 2002. Civil works were carried

District Road Investment Plan was also developed and detailed design for 740 km to fit in the budget
of US$10million.

(ix) Feasibility Study to upgrade 300 km of District Roads to Re-classified National Road
Standard: The study was completed in March 2004 and detailed engineering design is being
undertaken under RDPP3.

Office Equipment, Computers and Vehicles

33.     All the planned office equipment, computers and vehicles have been delivered and RAFU
maintains a register of all the equipment.

External Auditing

34.     The Auditor General appointed Ernest & Young as Auditors for the RSISTAP for the entire
credit period using QCBS procurement method of the World Bank, however the appointment had to
be re-validated every financial year. In compliance with the credit requirements, Audited Financial

Statements for each of the fiscal years of project implementation right from credit effectiveness were
prepared and submitted to the Bank.

7.7      Major Factors affecting Implementation and Outcome

35.      Delayed project start: The start up of the project delayed by more than one year compared to
the original implementation plan.

36.      Conditions for Credit Effectiveness: Satisfaction of the conditions of credit effective
achieved in September 1998, six months after credit signing.

37.      DCA amendments: The development credit agreement (DCA) had to be amended to allow
for the provision of a new component, Part E to provide for acquisition of office equipment,
computers and Vehicles for RAFU. The credit had been originally negotiated on the basis of staffing
RAFU with consultants and office equipment would have formed part of the consultant's package.
However, the government decided to staff RAFU by recruiting on individual basis, thus the need to
provide for procurement of office equipment, computers and vehicles.

38.      Optimistic Implementation Program: Following the consultant's report on Transitional
Arrangements for Establishing a Road Agency, the government produced its own report in July 1998
providing for recruitment of individuals. The government's report anticipated a mobilization period
which if achieved would have led to completion of the project by December 31, 2000. The proposal in
this report proved to be very optimistic and it was found very difficult to recruit individual engineers
with the required qualifications and experience. The government changed its strategy, after
consultation with the World Bank, by continuing with recruitment of individuals in parallel with
technical assistance teams supplied by international consultants.

39.      Limits of the Staff Recruitment Market: Throughout the life of the project it has been very
difficult to recruit highly experienced professionals on individual basis. The continuing lack of
success in recruitment of sufficient experienced professional staff has resulted into increased work
load for the RAFU staff adversely affecting their performance. In particular pressure on staff in the
procurement and site supervision areas has exposed some to challenges beyond their current level of
skill and experience.

40.      Investigation of Complaints: Some ministry of Works and Transport staff who could not
qualify for employment in RAFU lodged complaints which had to be investigated and disposed off
before proceeding with the recruitment process.

41.      Resistance to Change: The institutional changes and reforms experienced some resistance
from some stakeholders.

42.      Delayed UNRA Bill: By January 2003, the Government of Uganda was committed to a
policy of developing executive agencies based on a single Executive Agency Bill (EA) and RAFU
was listed as a high priority case for converting to an executive agency. Ultimately it was recognized
that the Agency Bill did not give sufficient autonomy and as a result this strategy was abandoned and
the Ministry reverted to developing its own bill. This process was not concluded until 5 May 2006
when the UNRA Bill was passed by Parliament.

43.      Government Bureaucracy and lengthy parliamentary legislative process: It took over 9
(nine) months to have the UNRA bill approved and becoming law.




                                                   47

6.8      Bank and Borrower Performance

6.8.1    Bank

44.      Throughout the life of the project, the Bank showed commitment to ensuring that the reform
process was successful, particularly ensuring that a road agency is created and this was the major
reason why the credit closing date was extended four times. Additionally the Bank has been
instrumental in the improvement of sector policies by allowing introduction of additional studies in
the project. With respect to supervision, regular implementation support missions have been
conducted throughout the project's life. In this regard, the Bank performance is rated as being
satisfactory.

6.8.2    Borrower

45.      Government: The project risks identified, with respect to the borrower, were committing
financial resources and managerial autonomy. From the table showing funds utilization, GOU
contribution is US$4.17 million against the appraisal figure of US$3.0 million. Additionally GOU has
accepted to establish a road fund to support UNRA operations. On the side of autonomy, by the
government dropping the Executive Agency Bill which did not give sufficient autonomy in favor of
the UNRA bill it was a clear indication of total commitment to granting managerial autonomy to the
Road Agency. Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development was also actively involved
in the reform process and demonstrated ownership.

46.      Implementing Agency: In order to ensure satisfactory performance, the operations of the
implementing agency were supervised by a management committee comprising of the Minister of
Works and Transport as its Chairman, the Permanent Secretary, the Engineer-in-Chief/Director of
Engineering, and the Director, RAFU. While the overall operations of the Road Sector were being
monitored and evaluated by the steering committee comprising of Permanent Secretaries and Senior
officials of the MOFPED, Ministry of Public Service, by March 2000 the project objectives related to
transport sector policy management and preparation of physical implementation components had been
successfully accomplished. The outstanding objective was related to establishing RAFU and its
staffing which had experienced delays. Based on the above observations, the Borrower is rated as
being satisfactory.

6.9     Lessons learned and benefits

47.      RAFU has changed the mode of delivery of road projects and consequently the culture of both
private and public sector entities, and that of professionals and administrative staff involved in road
administration and the broader civil engineering sector in Uganda. As a result, the performance of
road programs has improved as evidenced by the number of projects delivered on time and within
budget.

48.      The local engineers have been able to go through a capacity building program. They can now
take up higher positions of responsibility in the roads sectors.

49.      Financial management systems have been put in place which meets the Bank's requirements
and standards. A well documented financial management manual outlining the internal control
procedures as well as financial reporting requirements to government and the World Bank was
developed. Additionally, a computerized accounting package was procured and is fully operational.

50.     Technical Audits in addition to financial audits need to be continuously carried out, as these
have enabled success of the changes that have been introduced.

    Annex 7. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

EU Financed Technical Assistance to RAFU

  1. The European Commission financed a Technical Assistance (TA) team to assist RAFU and
      other TA teams within RAFU for a period of 36 months, commencing April 2005. The team
      was predominantly involved in administering EDF funded projects and projects funded by
      other agencies and contributed to the effective management of EDF financed projects,
      increased technical assistance, technology transfer to Ugandan engineers and sustained,
      improved performance of the road authority.

  2. The team comprised of the following experts: (i) Team Leader; (ii) Senior Project Engineer I
      (SPE I / Contract Management); and (iii) Senior Project Engineer II (SPE II / Procurement).

  3. The TA support has now been extended to August 2009 and the scope has been widened to:
      (i) provide support in the establishment of UNRA through a Reform Implementation Team
      (RIT) Advisors; (ii) addresses the transfer of MOWT road maintenance, ferries, axle load
      control and main bridge functions to UNRA in 2008; and (iii) provide assistance in setting up
      a Secretariat for the Road Fund, with the medium term goal of facilitating direct budget
      support by donors to UNRA.


  4. The revised TA composition beginning January 2008 is as follows: (i) Senior Project
      Engineer I (SPE I / Contract Management); (ii) Senior Project Engineer I (SPE II / Contract
      Management); (iii) Change Management/Institutional Expert (RIT); and (iv) Road Sector
      Reform Expert (RIT).

  5. In addition to the above, the EU will finance short term specialists for an input of 310 man
      days.
