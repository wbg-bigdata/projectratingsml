GLOSSARY
Carriageway - Area of road for use by motorised vehicle. bounded on either side by road shoulder.
Duka - Local name widely used to refer to roadside retail shops.
Matatu - Public minibus, widely used mode of travel both within and between urban areas and other
settlements.
Murrum - Local name commonly used to refer to gravel suitable for road building
Pavement - A structure composed of layers of increasing rigidity and strength and of varying
thickness, designed to carry traffic loads on natural soil formations. typically comprising subgrade.
sub-base and base layers.
Maintenance - All those activities undertaken to prevent deterioration of the road pavement during
its serviceable lifetime. Such activities may include clearing of side ditches, desilting of culverts.
repairing of potholes. ravelled surfaces and deformations, clearing of vegetation on the verges and
restoration of road furniture and markings. The activities are categorised as Routine, Recurrent or
Periodic, depending on the extent of work, plant used. frequency of such requirements and cost.
Rehabilitation - An enhanced period of maintenance intended to restore the road to its original
condition. Structural defects are repaired without major changes to alignment and width standards as
would be implemented in a reconstruction.
Road Reserve - Area of land typically extending 15 metres from the centre line of the road, owned
by the MOWHC and within which they have rights to extend the road and place associated
infrastructure (signs etc). This area is often also used for placing of underground or overground
utilities (water mains. electricity, telephone cables etc).
Shoulder - Area of road (typically 1.5 metres wide), between the carriageway and ditch, often used
by pedestrians and cyclists. may or may not be sealed.

Introduction
The Ministry of Works Housing and Communications (MOWHC) of the Republic of Uganda is
currently examining various rehabilitation options that would minimise the need for ongoing
maintenance and increase the lifetime of the following sections of road in the western part of Uganda
(Figure 1):
*  From Katunguru to Fort Portal via Kasese;
*  From Kasese to Kilembe; and
*  The Equator Road (between the Katunguru-Kasese Road and Bwera on the Congo border).
In accordance with Ugandan legislation and conditions associated with the scheme's funding by the
World Bank. an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required. The study reported in this
document considers the potential effects of the proposal on social, cultural and economic resources.
In accordance with a request from the World Bank the social, effects on the physical and biological
environment have been addressed in a separate report.
Proposals
The works will comprise on-line improvements focussed on:
*  reconstructing, strengthening and sealing of existing carriageways and shoulders;
*  localised widening of the carriageway within the current road reserve;
*  sealing of verges;
*  clearing of ditches;
*  replacement of three bridges. and
*  repair of existing, and construction of additional, drainage infrastructure.
The rehabilitation is unlikely to increase the number of vehicle movements that would otherwise
occur, since it is not changing the nature of the road but rather minimising the need for ongoing
intensive maintenance.
Construction is expected to extend over two-three years and employ 2-300 men. The works will be
undertaken in three packages using a combination of manual labour and mechanised plant. Various
sites have been identified for the sourcing of murrum and sand and for the disposal of spoil. Several
work camps (probably three) will be required as well as storage areas along the project roads. The
workcamps will include various workshops, maintenance and processing facilities including batching

plants as well as housing and staff infrastructure (shops. canteen etc). Temporary landtake will also
be required for working widths, diversions and parking/storage areas. In general these will be
accommodated within the road reserve.
Method
The study has been undertaken in accordance with World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 - Annex
B; Republic of Uganda Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (NEMA. 1996) and the
Draft Road Sector Guidelines (Arcadis Euroconsult and Makarere University, 1998) and has
included:
*  Identification and review of relevant Ugandan and World Bank policy, legal and administrative
framework and requirements;
.  Determination of details of scheme components, as well as construction requirements and
activities (including those taking place off-site) associated with the project, in particular those
which could have implications for environmental resources;
-  A determination of current and anticipated social, cultural and economic conditions and the
nature and location of receptors. These were established through review of: existing reports and
documentation; field visits and surveys; consultations with statutory bodies, concerned groups
and local communities, including a public consultation meeting;
*  Identification and evaluation of potential impacts, both positive and negative; and
.  Proposals of cost-effective mitigation measures, and where appropriate, opportunities for
enhancement during construction or operation of the schemes.
It is recognised that the proposals could have significant consequences for local communities. In
addition, these communities also have valuable local knowledge that can aid the design and
implementation of the scheme. A kev component of the EIA was therefore the participation of
concerned groups and NGOs and incorporation of their concerns in the formnulation of
recommendations. This was undertaken through informal consultation with individuals and
community representatives as well as a public consultation meetings held on 26 November 1999.
Impacts on Social, Cultural and Economic Resources
Key impacts are associated with loss of or damage to land or property, disturbance during
construction and the potential for increased risk to safety as a result of faster travelling vehicles.
Since in general any road widening or temporary requirements for working widths, to accommodate

completion of the works. There may be a requirement. however, for some permanent land acquisition
in Bwera and Kasese and short term landtake in the vicinity of three bridges. It is important that
appropriate planning is made for such temporarn or permanent landtake and that commensurate
compensation is made for any losses. In addition full reinstatement should be undertaken following
completion of works on all areas of temporary landtake.
During construction there is potential for disturbance to local communities and road users as a result
of the works and the movement of construction traffic as a result noise. dust, delays. risks to safetv.
interruptions to utility supplies and damage to propertv access. In the longer term, faster traveling
vehicles could present a threat to other road users including bicycles and pedestrians. Various
mitigation measures have therefore been recommended and include:
*  forewarning all affected parties of nature and timina of works;
*  agreement of all compensation packages prior to commencement of works;
*  separation and reinstatement of topsoil in roadside areas of temporary landtake;
* proposal and implementation of specific reinstatement requirements for each borrow pit;
•  removal of waste at end of works period;
- routing of new haul roads away from settlements:
- damping of haul roads. wheel washing and covering of vehicles;
* use of flag men:
* restriction on working hours;
* local sourcing of materials:
maintaining access to properties during works and reinstating on completion of rehabilitation;
placement of speed bumps and signs at sensitive areas e.g. towns, schools etc.; and
* sealing of all shoulders.
Beneficial Impacts
Although the rehabilitation works has potential, if inappropriately undertaken, to present a threat to
the environment. there are also considerable benefits to be gained. These have been discussed in
Report and include:
* reduced risk of erosion and land degradation as a result of improved road drainage;
* reduced risk of ponding and associated risks to property and to health;
* reduction in frequency of maintenance activities and hence disturbance to human communities
adjacent to the road and road users:
* opportunity to introduce safety measures in the vicinity of towns and settlements e.g. speed
controls. sealed shoulders. signs etc.; and

*   economic benefits through provision of an improved and reliable infrastructure to transport
passengers and goods. This should encourage economic activity and also, in the longer term.
mav result in additional communitv benefits e.g. improved access to schools, medical centres
etc.
Environmental Management
An Environmental Management Plan has been prepared which itemises the required mitigation
measures and identifies the agencies responsible for implementing and monitoring these measures
during design. construction and operation of the proposed works. A list of monitoring requirement
has also been determined. Provisions for such measures should be included in the tender documents
and the Construction Management Plan. An overview of the responsibilities, resources available to
and capabilities of the individual agencies involved in the environmental management and monitoring
of the project is also provided and areas where capacity building, increased  resources and
interagency coordination is required are identified. In particular the implementation of an ELU
vithin the MOWHC, appointment of an Environmental Manager in RAFU and establishment of a
working relationship would benefit the environmental management of both this and future highway
projects in Uganda.
Alternatives
Alternative options in terms of transport mode. road route, rehabilitation methods etc have been
identified, together with a consideration of the environmental, technical and cost implications of
each option. Air and rail transport modes are shown to be inappropriate in view of the lack of
existing infrastructure (rail) and hich economic and environmental costs (air).  Similarly, an
alternative road option would involve substantial cost and could give rise to a range of environmental
effects. The preferred engineering options are considered to be environmentally acceptable as they
represent an optimal balance of larger scale, but less frequent and managed, disturbances associated
with rehabilitation against the smaller but more frequent and ad hoc disturbances associated with
routine, recurrent or periodic maintenance. The Do Nothing scenario is shown to be unfavourable in
environmental terms since, within a relatively short time. sections of the road would become
unsuitable for use by motorised vehicles, with a range of resultant environmental effects including
increased potential for erosion, accidents. safety, reduced economic activity and associated effects.

Katunguru-Kasese-Fort Portal Road             Feasibility Studx Review and Detailed Engineering Design
Kasese-Kilembe Road
Equator Road                                                         EIA (SCA) - Final Report
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
The Ministry of Works Housing and Communications (MOWHC) of the Republic of Uganda is
currently examining various rehabilitation options that would minimise the need for ongoing
maintenance and increase the lifetime of the following sections of road in the western part of Uganda
(Figure 1):
*   From KatunQuru to Fort Portal via Kasese;
- From Kasese to Kilembe: and
- The Equator Road (between the Katunguru-Kasese Road and Bwera on the Congo border).
As part of this process. an application for funding has been made to the World Bank. The MOWHC
now wishes to obtain financial and economic cost estimates for undertaking the works associated
with the various rehabilitation options. It has therefore commissioned Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick & Co
(SWK) in association with Associated Consulting Engineers (ACE) to provide consultancy services
to undertake a Feasibility Stud,v Review of the rehabilitation options for these sections of road as part
of the Road Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance Project (RSISTAP). Depending on the
finding,s of the Feasibility Study and on authorisation from the Government. in consultation with the
World Bank, the detailed engineering design and cost estimate for the favoured options will be
undertaken.
An economic feasibility study, preliminary engineering study and detailed engineering design of the
Katunguru-Kasese-Fort Portal and Kasese-Kilembe sections was undertaken in 1995 by Sabbour
associates. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Katunguru-Kasese-Fort Portal section
was included as part of that feasibility study. Although repair works have subsequently been
undertaken to sections of that road. these have been limited to surface treatment with no replacement
of road bases or sub-bases. The nature of the works, combined with the continuous passage of
overloaded trucks. has, however, meant that the effects of such improvements are relatively short
term and there is a continual need for ongoing repairs, which is expensive.
An inception report for the current Feasibility Study Review was provided to the MOWHC and
World Bank soon after the commencement of the project, followed by an Interim Report on 30th
November 1998. The agreement for undertaking the Feasibility Study Review also required the

completion of Environmental Impact Assessment comprising an Assessment of the Physical and
Biological Issues (PBA) and Socio-Cultural (SCA) Assessments of the options under consideration.
The Feasibility Final Report was submitted in April 1999. This report comprises the SCA. In
accordance with a request from the World Bank this has been submitted as a separate document from
the EA.
1.2   Objectives of the SCA
The objectives of the SCA study are to identify potential social-economic or cultural concerns at a
sufficiently early stage in the project development so that appropriate measures can be incorporated
into the scheme selection. planning and design to ensure that it is socially and culturally sound. It
allows the design engineers to address such issues at an early stage and in a cost effective fashion,
after considering various schemes and design alternatives.
The World Bank screening process has identified the project as of Category A i.e. 'the project may
have diverse and significant environmental impacts'. In general road rehabilitation works which do
not require major realignment or engineering works might be expected to be assigned a lower
categorv and therefore would be subject to a more limited environmental analysis. However, a
substantial component of the proposed works are within, or adjacent to, the Queen Elizabeth National
Park (QENP), a site of national significance for wildlife conservation, and it is for this reason that the
project has been assigned the highest category in terms of the requirements for environmental
analysis.
An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required under Ugandan Legislation (National
Environment Statute, 1995) and although a formal notification as to the level of study required has
not been received it is likely that the project will be considered to require the highest level of
environmental analysis or Environmental Impact Study (EIS) comprising a major and detailed
assessment. The SCA reported in this document, together with the PBA (which is reported in a
separate document), are likely to fulfil many of these requirements. In addition the PBA and SCA
serve as mechanisms for inter agency co-ordination and promotes the building of environmental
management capabilities.

2. METHODOLOGY AND REPORT STRUCTURE
The approach adopted for the overall EL'= comprising the SCA and the PBA has been developed in
accordance with World Bank- Operational Directive 4.01 - Annex B: Republic of Uganda Guidelines
for Enviromnental Impact Assessment (NEMA. 1996) and the Draft Road Sector Guidelines (Arcadis
Euroconsult and Makarere University. 1998) and has taken account of various relevent guidance
documents (ODA. 1996: Surnokawa and Hoban. 1997: World Bank. 1991). This has resulted in the
following general approach:
(i)  Identification and review of relevant Ugandan and World Bank policy, legal and administrative
framework and requirements. This was undertaken through both desk study and consultation writh
statutory bodies. environmnental specialists and agencies in order to ensure that necessary measures
are included in the design and implementation of the scheme to meet the appropriate requirements
and is sumnarised in Section 3.
(ii)  Determination of details of scheme components. as well as construction requirements and
activities (including those taking place off-site) associated with the project, in particular those which
could have implications for environmental resources is presented in Section 4. These were identified
through a review of the Feasibility Study Final Report. examination of engineering proposals (plans,
methods of construction. location of borrow pits etc) and ongoing discussions and site visits with the
project engineers to gain a sound appreciation of the proposals.
(iii)  A determination of current and anticipated socio-cultural and economic baseline conditions has
been established through review of:
* existing reports and docunentation. In particular for the Katunguru-Kasese study area, the
determination of baseline conditions has drawn on the review presented in the previous
EIA report produced by Sabbour and Associates in 1994;
* field visits and surveys in December 1998 and September 1999 to determine details of
landuse, vegetation types. soils, topography. drainage conditions etc;
* consultations with statutorv bodies, concerned groups and local communities, including
two public consultation meetings on 26 November 1999 to establish the nature and location
of receptors and local concerns and interests.
These are described in Section 5.
Details of documentary sources. people consulted and attendees and issues raised at the public
consultation are contained in the Appendices to this report.

(iv)    Where potential impacts were identified. evaluation of both their positive and negative
environmental effects has been undertaklen using established criteria and is reported in
Section 6. Where impacts can be reduced to acceptable levels through the incorporation of
practical and cost-effective mitigation measures, these have been identified and developed
together with the project engineers. Where direct mitigation is not possible or cost-effective.
compensation measures have been proposed. Where appropriate, opportunities for
enhancement during construction or operation of the schemes have also been identified.
(v)    An Environmental Management Plan (Section 7) has been prepared. which itemises the
required mitigation measures and identifies the agencies responsible for implementing and
monitoring these measures during design. construction and operation of the proposed works.
A list of monitoring requirements has also been provided. This is followed in Section 8 bv a
discussion of the responsibilities, resources available to and capabilities of the individual
agencies involved in the environmental management and monitoring of the project and
identifies areas where capacity building, increased resources and interagency coordination is
required.
(vii)   Alternative options in terms of transport mode. road route, rehabilitation methods etc have
been identified in Section 9. together with a general description of the environmental,
technical and cost implications of each option.
Supporting information is contained in various technical Appendices to this report.
The PBA has been reported in a separate document, where physical and biological considerations
have been addressed.

3. POLICY. LEGAL AND ADMIINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
3.1   Historical Perspective
Uganda became independent from Britain in 1962 under a Federal Constitution which was abrogated
five vears later when the country became a republic. In 1971. the government was overthrown in a
military coup. In 1979 the military regime was itself overthrown bv anti-dictatorship forces backed
by the Tanzanian army. Following the removal of the military dictatorship, the ruling forces became
divided and started in-fighting which plunged the country into a period of political confusion.
violence. large internal displacement of the population and mismanagement of the economy and
resources. This situation. which also intensified environmental degradation. continued up to 1986.
In 1986. the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took over the government after a five year
guerrilla war in the bush. From then. the new government embarked on a wide ranging recovery
programme that has had effect on all social, political and economic aspects of the country. Chief
among these are: spearheading a vigorous campaign to attract investment: privatising public
enterprises to encourage private management; and restructuring the public service to increase
efficiencv. The restructuring process has included the decentralization of services and devolution of
powers to the districts and lower levels to encourage the public to manage their own resources.
Others include the new constitution and prioritising environmental management practices and
legislation.
Due to political upheavals that characterised the post-independence period until 1986, no new policy
or legislative instruments were put in place to promote sustainable development. This was
compounded by the view that since Uganda is well endowed with abundant natural resources,
environmental manazement was not a priority issue.
3.2   Government Organisation
3.2.1 National Government
At the highest level. the institutions with an interest in the project are the various relevant ministries
whose main role is to handle the policy issues of the respective areas for which they are responsible
under them. The ministries of relevance to the current study are the Ministry of Land, Water and
Environment (MOLWE) which amongst other roles is responsible for environmental policy and the
Ministrv for Works. Housing and Communications (MOWHC) which is responsible for road
infrastructure.

Below these ministries are two types of institutions. namely Departments and Parastatals. The former
are purely government institutions whose day to day activities are directly supervised by respective
ministries as. for example, the Departments of Energy, Works and Antiquities.  By contrast.
Parastatals are semi-autonomous organisations which execute their day to dav duties almost
independentlv of the parent ministries. These include Uganda Electricity Board (UEB), National
Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), the National
Environmental Management Agency (NEMA). Uganda Railwavs Corporation (URC) and the
National Bureau of Standard (NBS). It is intended that in time the Road Administration Formation
Unit (RAFU). the road implementing unit within the MOWHC will become a separate Road Agency
(RA).
There is a tendency for Parastatals to have links directly to Ministries rather than through
corresponding Departments. The Parastatals of most relevance to this project are:
•  NEMA. which is the main agencv responsible for coordination of environmental concems within
Uganda. Its functions, including approval of EIAs and environmental monitoring. are discussed
further in Section 3.3.1 below;
*  UWA, whose interest in the project relates to the fact that a section of the project road passes
through the nationally designated Queen Elizabeth National Park: and
*  the various utility agencies whose infrastructure mav be located within the road reserve and could
therefore be affected by works.
All ministries. departments and Parastatals operate at the national level.
3.2.2 Local Government
When the NRM Government took over power in 1986. it introduced a new mode of local government
based on a 5-tier system. This system which promotes grass roots participatorv democracy begins
from the village or Local Council One (LC I) level up to the District or Local Council Five (LC V)
level. In between, there are LC II; LC III and LC IV which correspond to the Parish, Sub-county and
County or Municipality respectively. Councils are led by executive comnmittees of nine people, each
who serve for a particular period of time and are eligible for re-election. Apart from LC I executives.
who are elected by all adults in respective councils, the rest of the executives are chosen from
executives of lower councils also known as electoral colleges.
In the planning process. only three levels in the LC system are effective and these are LCs I, IH and
V. The Local Government Statute of 1993 entrenched and strengthened the LC system in Uganda.

Uganda is currently implementing a national programme of decentralisation through the Ministnr of
Local Government (MOLG). This is provided for by the Local Government Statute of 1993 which
reorzanises the role of local governments. provides for new responsibilities, empowers them. and
establishes new relationships with the central government. Key decentralisation policy objectives
among others. are to free local managers from central constraints and. as a long term goal. allow them
to develop organisational structures tailored to local circumstances and to increase their capacity to
plan. finance and manage delivery of services to their people. The Chief Administrative Officer
(CAO) steers and directs all the decentralisation activities in each district.
The Local Councils (LCs) operate under the Ministrv of Local Government and have representatives
of all other sectors at the national level. Environmental issues at LCV are supervised by the District
Environment Coimnittee (DEC) witlh the help of an environment officer who in turm is responsible for
the Local Environment Committees (LECs).
3.3   Environmental Management In Uganda
3.3.1  MVanagement at National Level
The post-1986 era in Uganda has been associated with many development programmes and an
average economic growth rate of over 6% per year. This trend necessitated a need to direct national
development efforts to ensure that plans aimed at improving the standard and quality of life take due
consideration of environmental concerns.
With the above background. the NRM government created a number of institutions to cater for
environmental issues. initially. the Ministry of Environment Protection in 1987. followed by the
Directorate of Environment Protection and NEMA. The establishment of NEMA was legalised by
the 1995 Environment Statute. It is now the main coordinating agency of environmental concerns in
the country and operates under the general supervision of the Minister of Lands. Water and
Environment  which is also represented on the Comnmittee which provides and coordinates
environmental policy guidelines. NEMA is headed by an Executive Director who is also an ex-officio
member of the board that oversees the implementation and successful operations of the policy and
functions of the Authority.
NEMA is made up of four divisions one of which is the Information and Monitoring Division (IMD)
whose primary purpose is to ensure adequate surveillance and control of the environment and any
related areas of interest to it. Part of IMD's mandate is to ensure that environmental regulations such
as EIA are complied with: environmental standards are set; and an environmental monitoring system
is put in place.

It is intended that each sectoral lead agency, should have an Environmental Liaison Unit (ELU) to act
as a contact point for NEMA. According to the Statute. a lead agencv is "any ministry, department.
parastatal agency. local government system or public officer in which or whom anv law vests
functions of control or management of any segment of the environment". The day to day activities.
and running, of the ELUs is not the responsibilitv of NEMA but of the respective lead agencies
As can be deduced from the above. there is no provision for a structure to handle environmental
issues at the centre i.e. in the Ministry of Lands. Water and Environment. Instead. all issues that are
bevond the mandate of NEMNA are puslhed to the Policy Committee, whose chairman is the Prime
Minister
3.3.2 Management at Local Level
In line with the national programme of decentralisation. the NES of 1995 provides for the transfer of
environmental management responsibilities to districts. municipalities and rural communities at the
grass roots. Based on the guidelines that had been provided during the NEAP process, the NES gives
a framework in which to manage the environment at districts and lower levels so as to be in line With
the overall decentralisation process which is one of the current priority government policies.
This framework results in an environmental management system that integrates and fortifies links
among all levels in the district (i.e. LC V, LC III and LC I ), public sectors and NGOs, through
creation of environmental committees at district and local levels. At the highest level, the District
Environment Conmmittee's (DEC) main objective is to co-ordinate the activities of the District Local
Council (DLC or LCV) relating to the management of the enviromnent and natural resources and to
ensure that environmental concerns are integrated in all plans and projects approved by the DLC. On
the advice of the DEC. a local government system may create Local Environment Committees
(LECs) whose main responsibilitv is to prepare local environment work plans which are consistent
with NEAP and District Environment Action Plan (DEAP).
Environment related activities in districts are facilitated by District Environment Officers (DEOs)
who are direct employees of respective districts. Among other duties. a DEO is supposed to serve as
Secretary to and advise the DEC; liaise with NEMA on all matters relating to the environment; and
assist LECs in the performance of their functions as provided for in the Statute.
All these structures are intended to be part and parcel of the district local government and not NEMA.
Their functions are to facilitate coordination be in place between NEMA and the districts and to
transfer "real power" to districts and lower levels so that decision making and budgeting are

3.4   Summarn of Relevant National Legislation and Guidelines
There are several legal statutes and guidelines which are relevant to the environmental appraisal of
this project. controlled by the various government departments. Most of these documents however are
not more than five vears old and their implementation is still in earlv statges. For example. the
Constitution was promulgated in 1995. while the National Environment Management Policy was
formulated in 1994. There follows a brief summary of the Constitution and relevant statutes.
3.4.1   The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995
Amongst other matters addressed by the new Constitution, land related issues were given high
prioritv. Article 237 vests all the land in the country to the people, while Article 26 prohibits forceful
seizure of individual property including land by any authority, public of private without adequate
compensation. This has instilled a sense of security of tenure in most Ugandans. especially those
who have been squatting on public or other lands. Since the contents of these articles cannot be
described as land reform actions, a land bill was provided for by the same constitution in which
issues pertaining to land tenure and land use would be dealt with in detail. A Land Act. 1998 is now
in place and provides for all issues related to land in Uganda.
One of the national objectives and principles of state policy is to promote sustainable development
for present and future generations. To ensure this. Article 245 empowers parliament to provide for
measures intended to protect and preserve the environment from amongst others abuse, pollution and
degradation. Within the same framework. Articles 39 and 41 give every citizen the rights to a clean
and healthy environment and access to information. Being the supreme law of the land, the 1995
Constitution has brought changes in many other legal documents which existed previously, more
specifically in land and environmental management.
3.4.2 The National WVetlands Polic!'
Wetlands. commonly known as swamps in Uganda. are a resource of considerable importance just
like any other natural resources such as forests and rangelands. This resource had been exposed to
uncontrolled exploitation for a long time. which forced the Government in 1986 to impose a ban on
large-scale drainage schemes until such a time when a more elaborate and socially harmonious policy
was put in place. In 1995. the National Policy for the Conservation and Management of Wetland
Resources was made. The policy aims at curtailina the rampant loss of wetland resources and

ensuring that benefits from wetlands are sustainable and equitably distributed to all people of
Uganda.
In summarv, the wetlands policv does not allow drainage of wetlands except in extreme cases
pertaining to important environmental management: it calls for sustainable use and sound
management of wetlands: equitable distribution of wetland benefits and the application of EIA on all
activities to be carried out in a wetland.
3.4.3   Thie Water Statute, 1995
The Water Statute was made to provide for the use. protection and management of water resources
and supply; to provide for the constitution of water and sewerage authorities; and to facilitate the
devolution of water supply and sewerage undertakings.
The main objectives of the Statute are to: promote the rational management and use of the waters of
Uganda; promote the provision of a clean and sufficient supply of water for domestic purposes to all
persons; allow for the orderly development and use of water resources for purposes other than
domestic use; and to control pollution and to promote the safe storage, treatment, discharge and
disposal of waste which may pollute water or otherwise harm the environment and human health.
3.4.4 The Uganda Wildlife Statute
The government, on behalf of, and for the benefit of the people of Uganda owns all wildlife in its
wild habitat. The main purposes of this statute is to promote sustainable management of wildlife
conservation through Uganda; implement relevant international treaties conventions agreements or
other arrangements to which Uganda is a party: and promote public participation in wildlife
management.
The Statute requires any developer with a project likely to have significant effect on any wildlife
species or communitv to undertake an EIA in accordance with the NES, 1995.
Sections 18 and 19 give procedures for declaration of Wildlife Conservation Areas (WCA) and
define what constitutes such an area. A WCA may be either a Wildlife Protected Area (WPA) or a
Wildlife Management Area (WMA). WPAs comprise National Parks and Wildlife Reserves or any
other areas declared as such by the Ministry of Tourism Trade and Industry (MTTI). Wildlife
Sanctuaries, Community Wildlife Areas or other areas classified as such by the MTTI make up the
WMAs. Subsection 5 of Section 19 describes a National Park as an area of international and national
importance because of its biological diversity, landscape or national heritage value. A Wildlife

to make regulations controlling acts or omissions within a WCA and most activities are not allowed.
A National Parkl is the hig-hest level of wildlife protected area in Uganda, where extraction of natural
resources is completely unacceptable unlike in a Wildlife Reserve or Community Wildlife Area
where controlled activities may be allowed. General restrictions in WCAs apply to:
* hunting. taking, killing. injuring, or disturbing any wvild plant or animal, or any domestic animal,
*  taking. destroying. damaging, or defacing any  object of geomorphological. archaeological,
historical, cultural. or scientific interests or any structure lawfully placed on constructed;
* preparing land for cultivation. prospecting for minerals or mining or attempting any of these
operations,
driving, conveving, or introducing any wild animal into a wildlife conservation area:
. willfully driving, conveying or introducing any domestic animal into a national park or
negligently permitting any domestic animal, to stray into a wildlife conservation area: and
- starting or maintaining a fire without lawful authority.
3.4.5   Environmental Quality Standards
According to the NES. 1995, NTEMA in consultation with respective lead agencies is responsible for
the development of national enviromnental quality standards for use in environmental monitoring
activities covering air, water, effluent. noxious smells, soil, noise, vibration and radiation. NEMA is
also supposed to establish such criteria and procedures as they consider necessary for the
determination of the standards for buildings and structures, industrial products; materials used in
industrv, agriculture and for domestic use; solid waste disposal; and such as other matters and
activities that may affect the environment.
However. due to the relatively short time NEMA has existed. none of this standards have been fully
developed to be ready for use. In June 1998 calls were made by the same agencv in the mass media
informing the public of the authority's intention to start applying some of the standards being
developed. In addition. comments wvere invited from all interested parties and more especially, the

lead agencies before these standards are confirmed or otherwise harm the environment and human
health.
3.4.6   National EL andAudit Guidelines
NEMA has finalised the development of the national EIA guidelines (NEMA, 1996). copies of which
are available and provide a summary of their requirements. These guidelines are now in force
because they have the required legal backing bv the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations.
1998 and of the NES of 1995.
The MOWHC has recently commissioned the production of Environmental Guidelines for the road
sector in Uganda. These are currently in draft form (Arcadis and Makerere University, 1998) and are
likely to be finalised in the near future. In general thev follow the World Bank procedures.
The two sets of guidelines describe the various processes involved in undertaking an EIA from the
initial screening to determination of the level of studv required to production of the final statement.
As part of the process the lead agency needs to submit the project brief to NEMA at an early stage to
obtain a Certificate on the Screening decision and on completion of the study a Certificate of
Approval needs to be obtained from the Agency before the project can proceed.
Unlike EIA guidelines. environmental audit guidelines are not yet ready because they were not
accorded similar priority. Although the preparation is ongoing they are unlikely to be available for
use in the near future.
3.5   World Bank Requirements
Under the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01 (World Bank, 1991), EIA is a flexible procedure
depending on the nature of the project and is to be conducted during project preparation, closely
linked to the feasibility study. EIA must cover project-specific and other environmental impacts in
the area of influence of a project. EIAs also include the country's own environmental study and
action plans, and overall policy framework, national legislation and institutional capabilities.
The level of Environmental Assessment required is determined by the category to which the project is
assigned by the World Bank screening procedure. The current project has been screened as Category
A, i.e. it "may have diverse and significant impacts". This classification requires a full EIA to be
undertaken.

The objective of EIA is to ensure that project developments are environmentallv sound and
sustainable. Enviromnental consequences should be identified at an early stage of the project and be
weighed in project selection. siting. planning and design.
The possible alternatives and possibilities for improving the project environmentallv by preventing,
minimizing, mitigation or compensating for adverse impacts should be included in the EIA: these
steps may help avoid costlier remedial measures at a later date.
The EIA is also intended as a formal mechanism for inter-agency coordination on environmental
issues, promotion and building of local environmental management capabilities. An important
component of the EIA is the participation of concerned groups and NGOs and incorporation of their
concerns in the formulation of recommendations.
Project-specific ElAs are intended to cover six main fields:-
* existing environmental baseline conditions:
X potential environmental impacts direct and indirect including potential benefits and enhancements:
systematic comparison of alternative investments. sites, technologies and designs;
* preventive. mitigatory and compensatory measures in the form of an environmental mitigation or
management plan:
* environmental management and training; and
* environmental monitoring.
The EIA process needs to identify relevant environmental agencies to carry out the required EIA
activities during planning and implementation. Projects with potentially major impacts generally
need to strengthen several important organisational functions. such as monitoring, inspection and
management of implementation of mitigation measures
For highly risky or contentious projects and/or where there are serious and multidimensional
environmental concerns, there should be an advisory panel of independent, internationally recognised
environrnental specialists to advise.
Under the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30: Involuntarv Resettlement (World Bank, 1991), a
resettlement and rehabilitation plan must be implemented to ensure that project affected persons who
are displaced as a result of the project are resettled and rehabilitated. providing them with the means
to improve, or at least restore. their former living standards. income and production levels prior to the
project. The operational directive describes the Bank's procedures for involuntary resettlement.

defining the policv objectives and resettlement planning. Involuntarn resettlement should be avoided
or minimised where feasible. A socio-economic survev should be undertaken to establish the number
and economic status of the displaced population and assist with designing and implementing the
resettlement proerammes. The resettlers and hosts for the resettlement area should be involved in the
resettlement process. which should include a time-bound resettlement plan and compensation
packages.
This Directive does not applv to the current project as there will be no change in road alignment and
no resettlement will be associated with the limited road widenina that will be required.
3.6   Agencies with an Interest in the Project.
There are a number of aaencies which have an interest in the proposed project. These include:
MONVvHC. RAFU. who are the project promoters as well as. NEMA, LCs. UWA. Kasese and
Kabarole District Administrations and the Wetlands Management Programme. These agencies and
representatives of local conmmunities have been consulted during the EIA process (See Appendix C).

4. PROJECT NEED AND DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSALS
4.1   Project Need
The roads which are the subject of this study are located in the western part of the Uganda in the
districts of Kabarole and Kasese, wvhich are highly productive agricultural and industrial areas. The
economic activities, and their potential for future growth, are dependent on the road infrastructure to
transport goods to the major urban centres to the east. in particular Kampala, Jinja. Masaka and
Mbarara (Figure 1), a dependence which has in recent years been compounded by the deterioration in
the railway service between Kasese and Kampala arising from lack of adequate track maintenance,
there are understood to be no immediate plans to rehabilitate the line. However, even if the railway
line was fully operational. many of the agricultural activities would remain primarily dependent on
road transport mode as a consequence of their method of trading, which relies on transport of goods
bv feeder road to roadside trading centres located on the trunk roads, and for onward transport of
goods to Mbarara and Masaka, which are not served by rail infrastructure.
Although an alternative road between Kampala and Fort Portal, via Mubende, is currently being
constructed. it is anticipated that this route will not be completed for at least three years and even
then this may prove a difficult route for some vehicles as a result of its steep gradients and sharp
corners. The southern route, comprising the project roads, will continue to be necessary to serve
Mbarara and Masaka.
T he project roads also comprise the main route to the Congo to which, until the recent outburst of
civil unrest, Uganda sold much of its export produce. It is likely that this market will recover once the
current troubles have been resolved.
The current conditions of the roads included in the project area are described in Section 4.2 below
and are variable ranging from good to very poor. Although the majority of the sections can at present
be classified as fair to good, this is a result of the ongoing costly maintenance works which need to be
undertaken at regular intervals. In order to guarantee the presence of a reliable road transport route
which is not dependent on the availability of funds from one year to the other, there is a need for a
consolidated and more comprehensive programme of road rehabilitation to improve the integrity of
the roads within the project area.

4.2 Current Road Conditions and M\laintenance Activities
For the purposes of this study the following definitions of maintenance and rehabilitation activity
have been adopted:
Routine Maintenianice - comprises a continuous series of operations on the road. consisting mainly of
cutting of grass from edges of the road. cleaning ditches. desilting culverts and undertaking some
simple "first aid" repairs to the road pavement.
Recurrent Maintenance - comprises annual maintenance. normally at the end of a rainy season. to
repair erosion. potholes or other faults that may have developed during the season.
Peeriodic Mainitenance- comprises restoration to an  as new" condition and prevents further rapid
deterioration. Activities include shoulder regravelling. repair of potholes. deformations, drainage
structures, complete resealing. road marking and repair of road fumiture. The effectiveness of such
maintenance is higkIy dependent on the integrity of the base course.
Rehabilitation - comprises more substantial interventions to strengthen a road. repair structural
defects and restore a road to its original condition often after it has deteriorated to an unmaintainable
state. Rehabilitation may also include changes to characteristics such as alignment and widening.
An inventory of the maintenance activities undertaken on and the current conditions of the project
roads has been included in the Feasibilitv Study Final Report. A summary of the key findings is
presented below.
Katanguru and Fort Portal: The general condition of this section of road is considered to be fair to
good, but this is a reflection of the ongoing high cost routine, recurrent and periodic maintenance
activities. which are currentlv undertaken.
Kasese to Kilembe: The initial 5 kn from Kasese as far as the security gate of the Kilembe mines
has been subject to routine, recurrent and periodic maintenance and consequently is in a fair
condition. However, bevond the security gate the road was until recently in private ownership and
the lower levels of maintenance have resulted in the road becoming deteriorated and heavily
potholed.
Equator Road: The initial 20 km of this road has been subject to routine, recurrent and periodic
maintenance and is considered to be in reasonable condition. although there are some local

deformations. The remaining 18 kn has not been subject to such a level of maintenance and as a
result has failed beyond repair and needs rehabilitation.
4.3   Project Proposals
Typical rehabilitation activities will include:
(i)    Site preparation including clearing of vegetation and stripping and storage of topsoil from
areas of works plus five metres:
(ii)    Removal of existing shoulders and backfilling of existing side ditches:

(iv)    Removal of the existing road surface, scarification, reshaping and compaction of the exposed
surface to form the new road sub-base:
(v)    Construction of new shoulders to the required width, filling with two layers of lime-stabilised
sub-base to existing road level and laying of lime-stabilised base course on the carriageway;
(vi)    Strengthening of road carriageway and shoulders with a new lime stabilised base coarse
overlay;
(vii)   Sealing of carriageway with two coats of surface dressing and the shoulders with a single

4.4   Traffic forecasts
An assessment of anticipated traffic demand is presented in the main volume of the Draft Final
Report for the Feasibilitv Study. The key findings of that assessment are that:
*  Since no new alignments or major changes in road type will be implemented and as the most
badly damaged areas are limited to the Kilembe and Equator Roads and probably do not
discourage traffic. no additional traffic will be generated by the rehabilitation:
. In general. having consideration of the alternative routes within the road network the
rehabilitation works are unlikely to divert traffic from other routes. The possibility that unrelated
improvements to the Kampala. Fort Portal Road will lead to diversion of traffic away from the
National Park has been examined as a sensitivit-y test.
* Traffic levels are likely in general to increase in line with the country as a whole, except perhaps
for the agricultural sector which may, if it expands, contribute additionally to this figure.
Consequently, a figure of 4% growth to 1999 followed by 7% per annum to 2001, 5 % per annum
to 2011 and 3% per annum thereafter has been adopted.
In summary, the rehabilitation works are unlikely to increase traffic levels above those which would
occur if a more ad hoc approach to maintenance. as takes place at present, were to occur. What it

will do, however, is greatly reduce the need for such ongoing maintenance and ensure the presence of
a route of suitable quality for the next twenty years or so, rather than this being dependent on the
availability of resources at those times when repairs are required. Consequently, it will allow the
natural growth of traffic to take place in an unconstrained fashion. rather than perhaps being limited
at times when funding is scarce.
4.5   Construction Requirements and Activities
Land Requirements: In general the working width (including diversions and parking areas) will be
confined to the road reserve, although there may a requirement for local short term landtake for
diversions and parking/storage areas. Some longer term landtake will be required in the vicinity of the
three bridges that will be replaced to accommodate traffic diversions, parking and storage of material
and plant used for their construction. It is anticipated that three work camps will be required, each
typically covering an area of 3.5 acres. although the size could be reduced if a local workforce was
used and/or foreign workers housed within existing towns such as Kasese and Bwera. In addition.
various longer term storage areas will also be required
Site Activities: The construction activities are anticipated to extend over a period of 2-3 years. Work
will be concentrated in the dry periods with reduced activity in the rainy season. The works will be
undertaken in several consecutive (probably three) works packages and will involve the use of a
combination of mobile mechanical plant and manual labour. The on-site plant is likely to include
some or all of the following: graders, bulldozers, loaders, bitumen sprayer, chipping spreaders, trucks
etc.
Work Camps: The work camps will contain all maintenance and processing facilities required to
support the rehabilitation activity, including plant workshops and maintenance facilities, concrete and
bitumen batching plants, facilities for the workforce (canteen, shops etc). If the workforce is not
housed in local towns. it will be accommodated in buildings constructed in the work camps..
Sourcing and Disposal of Material: Murrum will be obtained from local borrow pits and chippings
and sand from local quarries, and will be imported by truck. The potential borrow pits and quarries
have been identified and are listed in Table 4.1 together with details of their location, issues
associated with their use and likely reinstatement requirements. Other material e.g. culvert sections,
bitumen etc will be imported from local suppliers, also by truck. Some old road surface material may
be pulverised and re-used in the new subgrade and sub-base layers (i.e. the lower layers of the road
pavement where deformations or deficiencies exist). The remainder of the old road surface material
and spoil generated by excavation of new ditches will be disposed of in the borrow pits, except where

an agreement is reached with a local landowner. The volumes of such material have been estimated
and are summarised in Table 4.2.
Workforce: As discussed above, it is not vet known whether a local or imported workforce will be
used. If an imported workforce is used this could either be accommodated in a work camp or in local
towns; in which in both cases the workers would require transportation to and from the work areas. It
is anticipated that the works would required an averarge workforce of 2-300 men (unskilled labour)
over a period of three years although this will depend on the options that are selected.
Traffic Management: In general, there will be no need for road closures during the construction
period with single lane traffic management in the vicinity of the works. although there could be some
local off alignment diversions within the road reserve at certain locations. Where the three bridges
are replaced, there will be short term diversions via a temporary bridge. The major source of vehicle
movements during the works period will be associated with import of murrum and aggregate and
export of spoil.

5.  BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
5.1   Studv Area
The project area is located in westem Uganda close to the Democratic Republic of Congo border in
the districts of Kasese and Kabarole in western Uganda. The Equator and Kilembe roads are entirelv
in Kasese District as is the southern part of the Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal road as far as the
River Mubuku. Kasese district is divided into two counties namely Bukonzo and Busongora. These
two counties are divided into twentv sub-counties. two of which are Town Councils, and the
remaining, parishes. Within the Kabarole district there are 6 counties. the project road being located
exclusively in two of them namely Bunvangubu and Burahva. Within these two counties there are 11
sub-counties and 49 parishes. Since work-s *vill be confined to the immediate vicinity of the roads. the
studv area for direct impacts has focussed on the road corridor and its immediate vicinity. In terms of
indirect impacts. for example those arising from increased accessibility, a more regional perspective
has been adopted.
The following sections describe the existing socio-cultural and economic conditions. physical and
biological conditions are detailed in the separate PBA report.
5.2   Landuse/Economic Activity
Settlements
The first 15 km of the Katunguru to Kasese section as far as the Equator Road junction passes
through QENP while the remainder follows the boundary of the Kahendero area of the Park.
Consequently, this section is not heavilv settled with the exception of four centres, at Katunguru. the
Equator Road junction, Mohokya and Kasese. Most of the section north of Kasese is characterised
by small human settlements, but these are generally scattered away from the road, the exception being
trading centres such as Rwimi and Kibito.
From the junction with the main Katunguru to Kasese road. the first section of the Equator road has
few settlements, partly because the southern side is within the QENP. From Munkunyu secondarv
school the area becomes relatively well settled with increasing density towards Bwera Township
close to the Congo border.
The Kasese to Kilembe road passes through settlements all the way to Kilembe town at its western
end.

The studv area is also closely linked with the urban area of Katwe-Kabatoro, located wvithin the
QENP between the Equator Road and the main Katunguru to Kasese Road. Within the studv area.
Fort Portal. Kasese. Bwera. Hima. Katwe-Kabatoro and Kilembe are recognised as urban centres
while most of the other settlements along the road are trading centres, serving the villasges with basic
household commodities e.g. soap. paraffin. etc.
Between 1984-94 Kasese and Katwe-Kabatoro doubled their populations while there was a marked
decrease in population growth for both Kilembe and Bwera. The rapid expansion of Katwe-Kabatoro
and Kasese was closely linked to their emergence as major economic centres. Kasese is well served
by road and until recently also had a rail connection to Kampala: this has however ceased to operate
owing to inadequate maintenance and a resultant deterioration of the track and there are no immediate
plans for its rehabilitation. Kasese also is a main link to the towns on the border between Uganda and
the Congo and. until the recent troubles. brisk trade took place in food and other commodities
between the tho countries. It is anticipated that such trade will recover once the border reopens.
Katwe-Kabatoro is a mining town for rock salt. wvhich fetches a good price and is marketed
countrvwide. It also supports fishing activities.
The populations of Bwvera and Kilembe have diminished for different reasons. The reduction at
Bwera can be attributed to a tightening of cross border trade with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In particular the introduction of a revenue customs post in 1986 has reduced the potential for cross
border smuggling, which previously attracted young people to this town. At Kilembe the relocation
of people awav from the town can be attributed to the reduction in mining activities, which resulted
from a drop in world copper prices.
Agriculture
The project area has great agricultural potential. which is favoured by good climate and fertile soils.
Agriculture is the main economic activity in the study area with the large majority (approximately
75%) of the population depending on agriculture to produce enough food both for subsistence and
surplus for sale. Produce marketing of traditional cash crops is completely deregulated. And it is
estimated that approximately half the food crops produced enter the market, the remainder being
consumed by their producers.
In the low-lying areas close to the QENP, the main agricultural activities involve growing cotton and
cassava. Maize. groundnuts. matooke. potatoes. passion fruit, sunflower seeds. onions, simsim.
cabbage, yams and beans are also grown. Of these the most important are coffee, cotton maize and
beans. These share the same farming svstem as the northern and eastern cereal cotton cattle system
although this area supports verv little livestock.

The highland areas of Kasese District are classified as being under the mediun altitude coffee
system, with major crops comprising coffee. beans, bananas, maize and cassava.
The most northern 30 km of the study area across Kabarole travels through an highly productive
agricultural area containing plots of various size. Most notable is the Mobuku Irrigation area where
large plots of land are under cotton and maize. There are also understood to be several prison farms
in this area which operate large quantities of agricultural produce. The remainder of the area as far as
Fort Portal comprises small holder farms in which crops such as cassava. robusta coffee. yams. paw
paws sweet potato, beans, maize. tomato, passion fruit, onion and pineapples are grown as both
subsistence and cash crops. Matooke is another dominant crop and is exported to the Port Bell
distillery in Kampala. A number of fruit trees are also common along this section of road and include
avocado, mangoes. jack fruit and guava. Livestock rearing, especially of Fressian cows and goats. is
also popular in most of the Kabarole District but on a small scale.
Virtually all crops need to be transported from the area of production to urban centres and especially
Kampala. Now that the railway line from Kasese is no longer operational, the only transport routes
are by road either to the south through Kasese, Katunguru and Mbarara. or north via Fort Portal. This
northern route, however, includes approximatelv 100 km of unmetalled road, which makes it
impassable to many vehicles, particularly under wet conditions. Before reaching the trunk roads.
produce needs to be transported by feeder roads from the rural areas where it is harvested. In general
these feeder roads are of poor quality. which makes the acquisition of transport facilities to transport
their products directly to the market difficult or impossible for the producers themselves.
Consequently, they become dependent on middlemen who control the price payable to the farmers for
their produce. In general this is low compared to the price obtained by the middlemen in the trading
centres and there is little re-investment back into the rural areas that generate the produce.
Where there is agricultural activity adjacent to the project road. the cultivated areas are often
observed to extend onto the road reserve as far as the ditch although they do not encroach on to the
verge. This is observed particularly along the western stretches of the Equator Road, close to Bwera.
and the agricultural area between Kasese and Fort Portal. In general there is no roadside agricultural
activity on other stretches of the project roads, owing largely to the fact that most of those areas are
located within the QENP, where agricultural activity is generally prohibited.
Fishing
Fishing activity is concentrated around Lakes George and Edward and along the Kazinga Channel.
The development of commercial fishing activity was promoted by the Uganda Fish Marketing
Corporation which had a freezing plant on Lake George between the 1950s-70s to process produce
taken from these sources for subsequent distribution to both local and export markets. The proximity

of Katunguru to these resources and to the main road ensured that it grew into a commercial fishing
and fish processing centre during this period. However. owing to poor management and subsequent
drops in catch yields. which have been attributed to overfishing. this activity declined in the mid
1970s. Consequently the fish markets disappeared from and have not returned to Katunguru.
although some small scale commercial fishinQ activity does take place from Katwe.
Within Kabarole there are two main landing sites at Mahyoro and Kayinja on Lake George. which act
as major outlets to the urban markets. Other fishing grounds exist in the form of small lakes and
rivers. In addition. fish farming in fish ponds is slowly growing with 330 ponds being established by
1993 most of which were stocked witlh Tilapia and Mirror Carp.
Industry
The area's main active industrial plant is the Hima cement works which is understood to currently
produce 16.000 tonnes of cement per month. It is intended to increase this to 25.000 tonnes by
2000/2001. It is understood that the cement is transported to Kampala via the southern route through
Katunguru. Oil. gypsum and pozzulana are imported to Hima for the works.
The copper mine at Kilembe was active until the early 1970s but 2 million tonnes of copper waste.
including cobalt and nickel. remain in the Kilembe valley and at the copper smelting plant south of
Kasese. to the wvest of the road. These are a continual source of pollution, much of which is washed
into Lake George. The Kasese Cobalt Company Limited is currently constructing a plant at Muhokya
to recover cobalt from the copper tailings. although transport demand associated with these works is
likely to be relatively modest. There are also plans for a foundry at Kilembe. possibly at the disused
copper plant. although details of these proposals have not yet been established.
Most other industries within the Kasese District are small scale in nature. the majority being
agriculturally related and include the processing of foodstuffs such as animal feed. maize flour and
coffee. In addition. there is a nail industry in Kasese township, a soap plant at Hima. and cooking oil
processing facilities at Kisinga. Salt mining is undertaken from the crater lakes in Katwe and there
are lime and cement industries in Muhokva. Small scale industries in metal and timber works are on
an increase. especially around Kasese township.
The project area has a mini hydro power generating station at Mubuku. This is owned by Kilembe
Mines Limited. but they sell the power to UEB and this has made a substantial contribution to
supplementing power supplied by the Owen Falls dam and in supporting local industry. The Kasese
Cobalt Company Limited is developing its own hydropower station on the Mobuku river for its own
use.

Wildlife Conservation
The Lake George Game Reserve was established in 1925 and the Lake Edward Game Resenre in
1930. In 1951 the present area of 1 978 ;m2 was designated as the Kazinga Game Reserve and was
renamed the Queen Elizabeth national park in 1954. The extent of the Park is shown in Figure 4.2
with the boundary running for much of its length along the Equator Road and from the Junction of the
Equator Road with the main road to a point just south of Kasese.
The land to the south of the Kazinga channel and east of the road is currently classified as the
Kyambura Wildlife Reserve although it is understood that this area may soon be incorporated into the
QENP and hence subject to a higher level of protection than at present.
The restrictions on activities in the QENP and the Kvambura Wildlife Reserve as a result of their
designated status have been described in Chapter 3. The growth of the Park has led to conflicts
between conservation and the activities of local communities. in particular poaching, fishing.
fuelwood collection, grazing and agricultural activity. The current Park Management Plan (Olivier
1990) recognises these conflicts and the need to work with local communities since "National Parks
cannot hope to survive in the long termn without the support and cooperation of local people." The
Plan also specified zones within the Park for certain uses including exclusive tourism, integrated
tourism, exclusive conservation, and buffer zones. In particular the area south of Kasese bordering
the main road was zoned as for exclusive conservation.
The UWA is currently preparing a New Park Management Plan, although this was not yet available at
the time of writing of the this report. It is. however, understood that UWA are:
*  intending to construct an earth road at the entrance to the Park near the Escarpment from
Bushenyi;
*  intending to redesign all road entrances to QENP:
•  intending to incorporate Kyambura Wildlife Reserve into QENP:
*  minimise travel by visters along the main road through the Park. through the creation of a scenic
route running from the Equator Road to the south of the Park and a river crossing of the Karzinga
Channel; and
* keen to operate launches along the Kazinga Channel to the east of the road to Kyambura. which
is to be upgraded to National Park status and Lake George, where a new water based recreation
centre and Lodge are being proposed. Currently the level of the road bridge at Katunguru.
however, makes it impossible for even small boats to pass under it.

However. the fact that the road reserve is owned bv the MONVHC means that UWA technicallv have
no control over activities occurring within the width of the reserve that passes through the QENP.
even though the Park has been designated as a site of national significance and its integrity could be
substantially affected if the project is inappropriately designed. implemented and managed. In view
of this technicality, it is particularlv important that the measures proposed in this EIA  are
implemented and monitored and that there is ongoinc liaison with UWA to ensure protection of the
Park. The project should be seen as an opportunity for the MONVHC to work collaboratively with the
UWA. district authorities and funding aaencies to control the impacts that are already occurring and
to ensure that there are no additional impacts associated with the road rehabilitation.
Tourism
Resources for the attraction of tourists include the animal game in the Queen Elizabeth National Park.
which has experienced steadily increasing visitor numbers over the past decade. An extension to the
Mweya Lodge. located within the Park. to provide better facilities for guests and in particular dav
visitors should be completed early in 1998. In addition. there are plans to build a new Lodge on Lake
George. a new road near the Park boundarv at Bushenvi and to redesign all road entrances to the
QENP. It is understood that tourists have expressed some surprise and indignation at the presence of
a tarmac road passing through the Park.  Other tourist attractions in the vicinity include the
Ruwenzori Mountains for which visitors use the Ibanda village, accessed off the Mubuki turn-off. as
a base.
5.3   Land Ownership/Tenure
The road reserve along the entire route. including the section which passes through QENP, is owned
by the MOWHC and nor permits etc are required for landtake (temporary or permanent within this
area).
Within QENP, UWA may request restrictions on activities e.g. no landtake outside the existing
roadwidth, but MOWHC are not obliged to follow these requests and if they refuse to do so there are
few options available to UWA.
Outside QENP most of the population are aware that road reserves belong the MOWHC and of the
implications of development or agricultural activitv within these areas. They also know that in
general there is no compensation pavable for losses experienced if the MOWHC wishes to undertake
work within the road reserve.
Other land beyond the road reserve is likely to be in private or customary ownership/use and if such
lands is required either temporarilv e.g. for diversions during construction or permanently e.g. for
realignment or borrow pits, losses must be compensated for at prevailing market rates according to

the area and landuse affected. In most cases. local authorities may handle such issues if deemed
necessary by the affected communities.
5.4   Socio-economic Status
Emplovment
The major employment sector is agriculture as the majority of the people still live in the rural areas
However, a big portion of this labour force is unpaid and lacks skills. Production is undertaken in a
large number of small. scattered farms. Animal traction or mechanisation is still limited, while fertiliser
and pesticide usage is minimal. The industrial sector is growing at a very slow pace and hence still
offers minimal employment.
State of the Economv
On the whole output is still low. The study area relies predominantly on primary products i.e.
agriculture. There is little value added and as such these commodities command low prices. The major
problems affecting agriculture include poor technologv, lack of infrastructural development, lack of
markets and unfavorable factors such as uneven rainfall, floods, diseases pests and inability to get
produce to markets particularly in rainv seasons.
As discussed above, the poor state of the feeder roads results in a high dependence of rural farmers on
middlemen for transportation of goods to and from the urban centres, which limits the income that can
be made from rural agricultural activity and hence economic growth in these areas.
Industrial products are still very limited and the few industries that exist operate below capacity.
Industry is still on a small scale and includes metal works, wood works, production of animal feeds.
bakery, shoe-making, printing and brick-making. The major problem affecting industry is lack of
capital, skills and market and the absence of a reliable transport infrastructure.
Sociolotzical backgtround
A sociological review of the study area was undertaken as part of the Environmental Assessment
produced by Sabbour and Associates in 1994. That study concluded that the project area has a sex
ratio (males per 100 females) varying from 100 to 104 at a young age, which then declines with age
refiecting the greater tendencv of males to migrate from the area. The population is steadily growing,
with an average natural population growth rate in the study area of 3%.
The Sabbour Study found that, within the study area, women grow and sell most of the crops for cash
sale as well as looking after the household. Children are also used as labourers on small farm

holdings. selling produce and loading v ehicles destined for towns. This is deemed to be free labour
and diverts children from education. Although the marketing of crops is predominantly by women
and children. thev use the roads mostly as pedestrians. while men basically use bicycles and. if they
have the money,. vans or lorries.
5.5   Transport and Communication Networks
The road network is by far the most important mode of transport in the study area and is the main
transport route for people and comunodities between commercial centres, in particular between the
agricultural and developing industrial areas of western Uganda and the urban centres around Kampala
and Jinja to the east. Access to these urban centres from western Uganda is either along the Kasese to
Katunguru road to the south and then through Mbarara and Masaka. or north along the Kasese to Fort
Portal road and east through a section of unmetalled road between Kagorogo and Mubende and to
Kampala. The murrumJearth section of this road is slowly being replaced by one wvith a tarmac
surface. \Whichever route is taken. the Katunguru to Fort Portal Road is likely to be used for some
part of the journey.  Although there lhave been plans to construct a new road from Kampala to
Kasese. to the south of the Fort Portal route, this has not yet been completed. If and when these
above routes are in place. alternative and more direct routes could be provided from Kasese and Fort
Portal to Kampala. but the road betveen Katunguru and Fort Portal would still be important in
linking the western part of the country to Kasese and to the onward routes through to Kampala.
As well as being the main internal transport mode, the highway network is the major transport route
to Uganda's neighbors. particularly the Congo to which. until the recent troubled times, Uganda sold
much of its export produce. It is likely that this market will recover once the current civil unrest
ceases.
The importance of the highway network has increased in recent years owing to the cessation of the
railwav service betveen Kasese and Kampala. This arose from lack of adequate track maintenance
and there are understood to be no immediate plans to rehabilitate this line.
Like most of Uganda there are three types of road network classified in accordance with the type of
surface and institution/authority responsible for their maintenance.
Trunk roads are maintained by the Ministry of Works Transport and Telecornmunications, while feeder
roads are a responsibility of the Local Administration. Earth roads are under the care of local councils
and communities through -which they pass. In general the feeder roads are in a bad state and this leads to
problems of market development for rural populations. their dependence on middlemen who have a
monopolv for transportation of goods to and from the urban centres. However. it is recognised that

improvement of feeder roads would not be effective on its own without also improving the main trunik
roads between the towns.
There are several airports in the study area including at Kasese from which there are passenger services
to Entebbe and other Ugandan regional airports. However the cost of flying is prohibitive to most
travelers and air freight is not an economic method of transporting produce.
The bicycle is the most common mode of transport for the rural/urban communities. Charges depend on
volume/weight and distance to be covered. Motorcycles for hire have of recent entered the transport
industry. Their charges are slightly higher than those bicycles. Special hire taxisicommuter taxis are
common in urban centres.
There are currentlv various accident blackspots within the studv area. These are summarised in
Appendix E.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION
6.1  Introduction
This chapter identifies and evaluates the potential social. economic and cultural consequences of the
construction, operation and maintenance of the proposed interventions. Sections 6.2 and 6.3 address
direct and indirect effects respectively. Effects on the physical and biological environments are dealt
with separately in the PBA Report
Mitigation measures are included in aenieral terms in the initial evaluation of impacts described in
this Section. and are summarised in tabular form in the EMP in Section 7.
6.2 Direct Effects
* Loss of land
During construction there will be requirements for landtake associated with:
0 Road widening;
0  Working widths including diversion routes:
0  Borrow pits. quarries, spoil disposal and haul roads: and
0  Work camps and storage areas.
While some of this land may be reinstated following completion of works. other areas may be subject
to longer term effects. The Public Works Act, the Constitution of Uganda (1995) and the Land Act
(1998) provide for the payment of adequate compensation for any damage caused to crops, buildings
and for land taken for works purposes. However. it is well known that in the past contractors have
used the law and law enforcement organs of government to under compensate land owners. This must
not be allowed to happen during the planned works. Funds should therefore be set aside by the
MOWHC and landowners should not be expected to restore land from their own resources. The
various levels of compensation pavable for specific tvpes of loss should be negotiated and agreed at
an early stage in order to ensure consistency and avoid the possibility of disputes. The various types
of loss are discussed in turn below.
Road Widening - In general all permanent landtake associated with widening of the roads will be
within the existing road reserve except at the junction in the centre of Bwera and the roundabout
between the main road and the Equator Road at Kasese. where some permanent landtake could be
required from commercial urban areas in order to improve visibility and turning radii to the

appropriate standards. Whether or not any land is required and if so the specific extent and locations
will be considered and determined as part of the detailed design.
Where the widening is contained within the road reserve no compensation is payable to anvone
currently using this land. However. at some locations. the land within these areas is informally used
by local communities for annual crops. and at certain sites, fences and temporary structures have been
erected. It is understood that the practice of using this land for agriculture arises in part from the
need to manage these areas to control vermin etc adjacent to private land, in view of the lack of
maintenance (in particular cutting back of vegetation) undertaken by the MOWHC. rather than a lack
of available alternative sites for cultivation. Although compensation is not payable for damage to
structures or crop losses in these areas. the potential for any detrimental effects should be minimised
through forewarning of the works. including specification of the time when they will take place
and/or undertaking the works after the end of the harvest period.
Once the requirement for landtake in Bwera and Kasese has been determined, a detailed inspection
must be undertaken to identify losses and determine specific compensation packages. This should be
undertaken in accordance with U,andan and World Bank requirements and should involve
consultation and negotiation with the district valuer, landowner and, if necessary, an independent
lawyer. Once agreement has been reached, the valuer should submit the details to the Ministry of
Land and Surveys which in turn should notify MOWHC of its requirement to make and administer
the payment. Any compensation package will need to be agreed and in place before fmalisation of the
design and commencement of construction activity. During consultation a preference was expressed
for payments to be made directly by MOWHC rather than through the local administration. The small
areas required means that no resettlement will be necessary.
Working widths - During construction of the highway sections, small local storage and parking areas,
as well as road diversions will be accommnodated within the road reserve, except in the vicinity of the
three replacement bridges and some larger works storage areas. At these sites there will be a need for
temporary landtake outside the reserve to accommodate traffic diversion via a temporary bridge
(which is necessary to keep the road open during bridge replacement) and for storage of the materials
(in particular concrete) required for the bridge construction.
As described above with respect to road widening, there should be forewarning of local communities
undertaking agricultural activity within the road reserve in order to minimise loss of crops and
structures within that areas. At many locations it may be possible to return the land to agriculture
after completion of the works, although this will depend on the level of management (cutting back of
vegetation) undertaken by MOWHC. Where landtake is required outside the road reserve (i.e. at the
bridges and larger storage areas) appropriate compensation measures should be established. These
should be based on the market rates for the crops and again should be negotiated between the

landowner and governument valuer prior to commencement of works and the payment administered by
the MOWHC. It is important that the compensation agreement should include specification of the
timing of the xworks and requirements for post construction reinstatement e.g. separation and storage
of top soil, digging over of ground to counter the effects of compaction and reinstatement of topsoil
and removal of all construction waste as these could affect the level of any loss incurred by the
landowner. In the past in Uganda. when land has been used during construction. the developers have
regarded this land as belonging to them and re-used it in the future. Appropriate reinstatement after
completion of works should minimise the potential for such an occurrence.
Borrowv Pits. Spoil disposal, haul roads - The location of the borrow pits and access roads are
provided in Table 4. 1. The majority of these pits are existing and already have access from the road
network via haul roads. However anv further extraction from exisitng pits, creation of new ones and
associated haul roads. or disposal of spoil on private land will need agreement with and compensation
to the landowner through a similar process of negotiation. agreement and payment described above.
Such agreement should include the reinstatement requirements which should be implemented
wherever possible to return the land to its natural state and to prevent erosion and encourage
revegetation. . The need for such measures is discussed in the PBA reported in a separate document.
A  preliminary determination of these requirements has been provided in Table 4.1; specific
requirements for each site should, however, be defined and included in the CMP once the sites have
been finalised and should include the following principles:
*  removal and storing topsoil for reuse, or use topsoil from areas being worked to re-instate
previously worked areas:
*  where the natural topography is gently sloping, filling of depressions and shaping of slopes at
less than the angle of natural repose of the local soil type for maximum seed survivability. Where
the pit is on the steep edge of hill. terracing should be undertaken:
•  reinstatement of topsoil: and
.  construction of intercepting ditches at the tops and bottom  of slopes, cut-off drains and
dissipation structures.
Owing to the high rainfall and soil fertility in the studv area, the natural revegetation rate is very high
and will be particularly so if the reinstatement is undertaken during or just before the rainv season. In
general therefore. reseedin2 will not be necessary except where:
*  the slopes are considered to be at a high risk of erosion (for example locations where physical
constraints such as the presence of buildings, utilities etc prevents adoption of suitably shallow
slopes). In these cases seeding with local varieties of grass should be undertaken; and

*  there is a risk that the land will be cultivated before the soil has a chance to stabilise. resulting in
erosion. This has been observed at the sites of reinstated pits elsewhere in Uganda where the
availability of an apparently reinstated area has proved an attraction even though it can take
several years for the soils to settle. At these site it is recommended that the area is planted with
napier grass which will act to stabilise the soil and through its value as fodder for cattle will
discourage alternative cultivation of the site with ainual crops which could threaten soil stability.
It is understood that often once Ugandan land owners are compensated by public works, they have
regarded the borrow pits as belongina to the government and. therefore have no obligations towards
that piece of land and do not use the compensation payments for restoration purposes. In order for
this not to happen the contractors to reinstate the land prior to handing it back to the owner rather
than including the cost in the compensation to the owner to do this work himself.
In general it is proposed to dispose of all spoil (mostly form ditch construction) within the borrow
pits as the first stage of reinsatement so that no local spreading or tipping of spoil will take place
unless specifically negotiated with a landowner.
Work Camps/Storage Area - The use of land for work camps or material storage areas will require
compensation to landowners for any temporary losses. Unlike the areas of temporary landtake
associated with the bridges. there is considerable choice over the selection of such sites and
opportunities for negotiation with landowners. However, the area of landtake involved (probably
three sites of several acres for the works camps and many smaller roadside areas for the storage
areas) together with the level of infrastructure and activity taking place on these sites, has the
potential for longer term consequences for the environment. In particular. the need for workshops.
maintenance areas, batching plants, housing and support infrastructure and the associated activities
(noise dust and traffic generation, use of natural resources and waste generation) could have long
terms implications for land quality (see the PBA report for effects on soils and water quality). In
practice such sites are rarely reinstated to their former use; in some cases they are abandoned and
subsequently occupied by itinerants or vagrants whilst in others the facilities are reused for housing
or other development.
Sites for these activities should therefore be carefully selected and subject to environmental
consideration prior to commencement of negotiation with landowners. In particular the potential for
water pollution should be evaluated. It would be preferable and may be possible to reuse former
works sites. It is understood, for example, that there is such a site at Kasese and the possibility of
leasing it should be investigated. In addition use of a local workforce and/or housing any workers
within the towns would minimise the need for on site housing, workers facilities and the associated
waste generation. On completion of works all plant and waste should be removed from the site
including any underground material such as waste oils. Full reinstatement of the site is often

impracticable. and such areas are usually more suitable for future development. Such future uses
should be taken into account when choosing the sites.
Communitv disturbance and risk to safetv during rehabilitation works
During construction there will be potential for community disturbance principally through:
*  noise and dust generation and threat to safety of local communities from  plant operations
associated with rehabilitation activities:
*   interruption of utility supplies and temporary access restrictions to certain properties during
rehabilitation works:
*  noise and dust generation and threat to safety to communities on access routes. associated with
vehicle movements to and from the site. In particular the need to transport material to and from
borrow pits could result in dust disturbance to local communities. particularly if they are situated
close to the unsealed haul roads:
e  presence of an alien workforce
While the road passes through several settlements. the disturbance at any one location due to the
rehabilitation works will be relativelx short term. However, particularly sensitive receptors such as
schools and health clinics should be identified and if it is considered that they may be affected by the
works. it is recommended that working hours in these areas are restricted and flag men are used. In
particular works often attract children (with resultant risks to safety and potential for truancv); the
local communities should be forewarned of this potential so they can set up mechanisms to
discourage such activities which can also be enforced bv the contractors. At many locations it may be
sufficient to forewarn communities of the timing and nature of the works in their vicinity and of any
anticipated disruption and to ensure that accesses. ditch crossing points etc are maintained during the
works period appropriately reinstated on completion of the works. Liaison with the utility companies
is necessarv to minimise disruption caused by interruption of services. Responsibility for forewarning
communities and industry of such interruptions lies with the utility companies
The same communities will. however. be on the access route to other works areas and could therefore
be subject to disturbance as a result of traffic movements associated with the import and export of
materials and transport of personnel during the entire construction period. In particular dust from
construction vehicles. particularlv those travelling along haul roads could cause disturbance. Local
sourcing of material and disposal of anv spoil should be adopted to reduce the length of vehicle
journevs and wheel washing practices and covering of loads should be undertaken to minimise dust
disturbance. Specific measures and restrictions mav be required e.g. warning signs placed at schools
and other possible accident spots and restriction of construction traffic movements on market days.

Where haul roads pass close to settlements, the roads should be dampened and flag men used. New
haul roads should be routed away from settlements.
During construction. the presence of a large alien workforce with relatively high incomes and free
spending habits can have social repercussions and tensions e.g. as a result of drunk-enness.
prostitution. pollution. influx of disease (in particular H1V), inability to integrate with local
communities, competition for jobs. removal of natural resources e.g. wood, fish etc. As discussed in
the PBA Report. the presence of work camps can also pose a risk to local natural resources. Use of a
local workforce would minimise the potential for such problems. In addition, the provision of on-site
health facilities could prevent problems associated vith heath and disease.
*  community disturbance due to inadequate road drainage
At present it is understood that inadequate road drainage at certain locations within the project area
results in flooding of adjacent land. including compounds and in some cases buildings. In addition to
the disturbance and damage to properties that this can cause it also presents a risk to safety and to
health. In particular such effects have been reported during the consultation exercise (Appendix F).
The proposed design should ensure that the rehabilitation addresses such effects and that any
potential for future occurrences at these or other locations is minimised.
* Community disturbance and risk to safety as a result of increased traffic movements and
vehicle speeds once rehabilitation is complete
In the long term the improvement to the roads is likely to result in an increase in number and speed of
vehicles travelling along them, which could result in higher noise and air pollutant levels as well as
presenting a risks to other road users including pedestrians and cyclists.
Noise and air pollution are not major issues in the context of upgrading an existing road since, while
traffic levels may increase, the design of the road surface should improve both air and to an extent
noise pollution. The improvements in the road surface should decrease problems associated with
dust, while the avoidance of the need to slow down at potholes etc may reduce air exhaust emissions.
The sealing of all shoulders should provide a safe pavement for pedestrians and cyclists. In addition,
the recommendations for speed control measures that have been formulated through inspections and
liaison with local officials, summarised in Table 6.1 below  and comments received during
consultation (appendices F-F) should be implemented etc. Where rumble strips or speed bumps are
constructed. these should extend onto the shoulders to prevent road vehicles driving around them.
The location of the strip/bump should be clearly sign posted to avoid accidents associated with
vehicles hitting them unexpectedly. The proposed provision of stopping areas for matatus in all the
major settlements should improve safety standards.

*  Effects on road vehicle users
During the construction period, road users may experience delays owing to the road works. No
closures are anticipated and, in general. roads will be kept open through local diversions within the
road reserve, single lane traffic management or temporary bridges. Forewarming of works would
also minimise any disruption to road users.
In the longer term, the improvement in the road should result in an overall reduction in travel time.
The exception would be in QENP where the imposition of a speed restriction and speed
bumps/rumble strips would increase the travel time by a few minutes. This restriction is being
implemented largely to reduce the potential for road kills within the Park and is described further in
the PBA. The increased travel time through the Park will, however, be compensated many times over
by the gains achieved elsewhere on the road. In addition, the provision of acceleration/deceleration
lanes at the two Park entrances within the project area should minimise delays to road users.
Within the QENP the potential for accidents is considered to be of particular concern where the side
roads join or cross the main highway and are often not visible owing to local topography. The
proposed incorporation of deceleration/acceleration lanes at the two Park entrances within the project
area should help to reduce this potential. The engineers should liaise with UWA's landscape
architects regarding the layout of these facilities. Similarly there should be liaison with UWA and
their architects regarding the location and content of any signs and the location and nature of speed
bumps and rumble strips within the Park.
* Effects on tourists
The presence of an upgraded road may enhance accessibility for tourists in particular to the QENP.
As tourist numbers increase, the demand for other services and articles are also likely to increase and
could generate additional income for the local communities (see Section 6.3 below). However, it is
important that the presence of the road does not detract from the tourist experience particularly when
visiting the QENP and observing animals, for example through speeding vehicles and the associated
noise implication and threats of accident. The potential for accidents to road vehicle users in QENP
has been discussed in the previous section.
* Historic and cultural resources
Since there will be no deviation from the current road alignments no loss of or damage to historic or
cultural resources is anticipated.
* Landscape and visual effects

Since the roads will follow their existing aligmnent and there are unlikelv to be any changes in levels
no effects are anticipated directly from the road works. There will. however. be some local changes
in topography at borrow pits, quarries. camp sites. The proposed reinstatement following laid dovn
procedures including grading. planting etc. should minimise visual effects and at some locations
wlhere there has been minimal restoration in the past could represent an improvement in existing
conditions.
6.3   Indirect and off-site effects
* Economic activity
Agriculture and Fisheries
Apart from the direct phvsical effects of land or crops being taken or destroyed. the longer term
effects of a guaranteed good road infrastructure on agricultural activities will be largely positive. The
project area is potentially a highl! productive agricultural region. which may benefit from  the
presence of a reliable route for export of excess produce both within and outside the region and hence
increased opportunities for enhanced income to farmers. It may be more worthwhile for farmers to
invest in non-traditional cash crops once the rehabilitation has taken place and the export route is
more secure. However. any benefits to farmers in rural areas may continue to be limited while the
feeder roads remain in a bad state and the farmers continue to be dependent on middlemen for the
transportation of their products to trading centres as well as for the import of commodities produced
elsewhere. While it is recognised that the improvement of the main trunk roads betwveen the towns is
important for increasing agriculture related economic activity, in order for the farmers rather than the
middlemen to gain from this improvement, it must also be accompanied by an improvement of feeder
roads. It is not possible at this stage to determine whether the rehabilitation will act as a catalyst for the
upgrading of the feeder road infrastructure serving the local communities.
In the long term, prices for farmers' produce may improve if new buying centres are established in
villages and farmers may benefit from competition and save time normallv spent on ferrying produce
to markets which are currently inaccessible. The time saved could then be used for other activities to
further household incomes.
Industrv
The benefits to industry should be similar to those that may be brought to farmers as discussed above.
In particular. the reliabilitv of the export and import route for materials may encourage the growth of
the industries that are beginning to be developed or expanded in the region. for example the cement
works at Hima.

Tourism
The rehabilitation will provide more reliable access to Queen Elizabeth National Park as well as
Ruwenzori and Kibale National Parks and to Semliki Wildlife Reserve in the Bundibugyo District.
This will also contribute to the potential for generating local income from tourist activity. The effects
on wildlife conservation which is the source of many of the tourist activities have largelv been
addressed in the PA Report. Generally potential impacts can be avoided. and UWA have stated that
there will be no conflicts with the proposed new QENP Management Plan provided there are no
borrow pits or road widening within the Park and the measures to reduce vehicle speeds are
implemented. The Park are very keen that the bridge at Katunguru is raised to allow tourists access
by larger boats to the eastem part of the Park including the area which is currently Kyambura
Wildlife Reserve, but will soon be upgraded to be part of the National Park. Unfortunately this
bridge does not fall under the present project Tenns of Reference. However, liaison regarding road
junctions and speed restrictions would help ensure an optimal solution for both MOWHC and UWA.
Other economic activitv
If increased economic activitv does occur, petty traders may join the race to provide services such as
sale of basic household goods and small holder farmers will have access to markets. More "dukas"
and stalls may develop along the road and basic commodities such as paraffin, soap and salt may be
more readily available than before. The improvement in the roads could result in lower vehicle
operating costs which should be reflected in the price of commodities exported and imported to the
regions as well as of passenger transport.
During construction there will be some income generation for local communities, both as a result of
direct labour and through the provision of associated services e.g. accommodation, food, mechanical
support etc to the construction team and contractor..
* Health, Welfare and Education
The reduction in ponding as a result of improved drainage infrastructure could lead to a reduced risk
of malaria from flies that breed in the flooded areas and risk of accident. The rehabilitation of the
road is unlikely to have other imnmediate benefits on health, welfare or education, although if it
contributes to an increase in economic activity then this could be reflected in general improvements:
however, this effect would take some time to become apparent. Moreover, the benefits would be
largely confined to the urban communities located along the road unless the road rehabilitation acts
as a catalyst for the upgrading of the feeder road infrastructure serving the local communities. If this
does take place then the benefits to the local community arising from increased accessibility are
likely to be significant, since in addition to the direct economic benefits to the rural communities that
would arise. such an upgrading would also provide increased access to clinics, schools etc.

If the area attracts people from outside the project corridor e.g. to new trading centres. there is likely
to be increased use of fuelwood for enernrv requirements since electricity supply from the UEB is not
sufficient even for the existing demand. This could result on pressures on the now well vegetated
areas along the route. particularly for charcoal production. Existing plots of private land and some
forest reserve may be depleted. While the potential imipact mav be moderate. it is likely to be of long-
tenn significance.
Similarly. an influx of population may place pressures on existing infrastructure such as wvater
supply. waste facilities. health and educational establislments etc. However. it is considered that anv
such influx is likely to be slow and providing municipal facilities are improved at an appropriate rate.
such problems can be avoided through appropriate planning.
Maintenance Requirement
Road maintenance is a common problem in Uganda. The rehabilitation would decrease the need for
continuous intensive maintenance and hience the frequency of socio-cultural disturbance associated
withl this activitv.  However, some routine and recurrent maintenance e.g. desilting of culverts.
maintenance of speed bumps etc will be required. The use of herbicides for maintaining road edges

7.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
7.1   General
A specific mitigation plan cannot be finalised until the detailed design has been undertaken and
reviewed. However, based on the findings of the evaluation described in Section 6, various
mitigation proposals have been made. Wherever possible these have been specific, but where there is
as yet insufficient detail e.g. reinstatement of borrow pits. location of speed bumps/rumble strips. the
plan has included guidance on how to deternine and specify the mitigation requirement once the
detailed design is further advanced. These mitigation measures have been compiled into an
Environmental Management Plan which itemises the requirements and agencies responsible for their
implementation and monitoring during the Design. and construction and the Post Construction phases
(Tables 7.1 and 7.2 respectively). A sunmmary of monitoring requirements is also provided (Table
7.3). The Design and Construction Management Plans should be incorporated in the following:
* the final scheme design:
* the invitation to tender to contractors and subsequently in the conditions of contract; and
* the Construction Management Plan (CMP) and the monitoring requirements for implementation
by MOWHC and the resident engineer.
The Contractor should then prepare a working method statement demonstrating how he proposes to
undertake the works in accordance with these documents.
During construction, the Resident Engineer and his team will be responsible for ensuring adherence
to the CMP.  Within this team, there should be an experienced, qualified and independent
environmental, specialist, whose specific responsibilitv will be to ensure that the environmental
aspects of the Plan (as derived from the EMP) are implemented. UWA have requested that a
nominated representative of the Authority is on site during the period of the works and if such a
representative is appointed, there should be a mechanism for him to liaise and consult with the
resident Engineer's team, ideally through the Environmental Specialist, who will have the
responsibility and authority for implementing the scheme in accordance with the EMP.

8. INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
8.1  Introduction
The environmental actions to be carried out cover a wide range of issues, as described in Section 7 of
this report.  To be most effective, these actions should ideally be integrated into the wider
development of environmental capabilities and roles so that the initiatives and responsibilities of
various organisations with an interest in the project (e.g. NEMA, MOWHC, RAFU, UWA, LCs, etc)
are properly focused within a well defined environmental protection framework. In this way,
possible duplication of effort will be minimised, and common goals can be established to reduce
potential environmental conflicts between the activities of different organisations.
The process should be seen as part of the ongoing general strengthening of national and local
institutional capabilities in Uganda to ensure that environmental concerns play a meaningful role in
guiding developments in the country. The establishment of a such a national regulatory framework
can be visualised as a four-stage process (UNEP, 1992).
1)    Policy setting
2)    Implementation of policy - establishing regulations
4)     Verification of compliance with regulations
5)     Enforcement of regulations.
This framework is being put into place on a national basis by NEMA but is not yet established in full.
A clear statement of policy has been made through and the National Environment Action Plan.
However, there is comparatively little verification that policies are being complied with and there
appear to be, in some cases, insufficient resources and legislative and regulatory powers to permit
enforcement, although new legislation is in progress.
The increasing concerns of bilateral and multilateral funding agencies over environmental
consequences of project developments is an additional reason for Uganda, and MOWHC itself, to
establish proper environmental controls and to ensure that effective environmental assessment is built
into the planning and implementation processes from very early stages. A brief overview of the issues
faced by the key agencies of relevance to the project in establishing and undertaking these
environmental controls is discussed below.
8.2   NEMA

Within the short time NEMA has existed and within the framework of its mandate. a number of
achievements have been made amongr which are the following:
* increased awareness of the need for environmental management in the public and private sectors:
* development of guidelines. regulations and standards for use in environment management which
has increased chances of sustainable use of the resource base e.g. EIA Regulations and
guidelines., draft environmental standards etc.;
* creation of institutional structures to implement the program on improved environment
management e.g. LECs. ELUs, DECs;
* supporting a number of districts. NGOs, CBOs and local communities in their bid to conserve the
environment and natural resources through provision of technical and logistical support; and
NEMA has increasingly become effective in executing its duties despite the fact that environment
management and planning in Uganda are relatively new phenomena. However, in doing so some
practical problems have become apparent in the institutional and legal framework that was created to
implement environment management programmes in the country. For example:
* in some cases there are conflicts between the Constitution and specific legislation relating to
environmental management:
* while NEMA's role is to coordinate matters relating to the environment, it has no regulatory
powers and is dependent on the relevant Ministries to enforce the standards;
X in some areas there is an overlap in functions betNveen NEMA and Ministries which results in
conflicts, and potential for competition and a lack of necessary cooperation and coordination; and
* standards developed by NEMA are inconsistent with those developed by specific Ministries, and it
is not clear which ones should be applied.
Other practical problems include lack of financial and logistical support for the newly created
institutions, inadequate staffing or the staff lacking appropriate skills to undertake the assigned tasks,
matters to do with legislation over resources reserved for the central government such as water,
mines. forests, wetlands and national parks. There is also the issue of support for NEMA after the
current Environment Management Capacity Building Project (EMCBP) through which these
functions are funded by the World Bank ends.

8.3 MOWHC and RAFU
As yet there appears to be no well established ELU within the MOWHC or environmental capability
within RAFU. Consequently, there is currently no formal mechanism within the Ministry through
which it can voice its environmental concerns and. in turn, interact with NEMA and ensure that its
planning and operations do not cause undue environmental problems. These roles have in part been
assumed by existing officers within RAFU and the Ministry, who have where appropriate sought
advice and input from external agencies. for example in the recent preparation of EIA guidelines for
road projects, specification of appropriate environmental considerations in Terms of Reference to
contractors etc . However, even with the of best intentions, such an approach, which involves only
limited and intermittent specialist environmental input, cannot guarantee the appropriate
environmental awareness and implementation of appropriate management procedures. However, it is
understood that the Ministry intends to implement an ELU and that the RAFU are actively pursuing
the appointment of an Environmental Manager. Such measures should help to ensure the necessary
coordinated approach and improvement in environmental management procedures in the future.
8.4   Other Agencies
UWA
It is understood that in the past, developers have in some cases not taken due account of ecological
resources, including those in protected areas, and as result a deterioration in conservation value,
which could have been avoided through liaison with UWA, has resulted.
Local Councils
Although the national programme of decentralisation provides for transfer of environmental
management responsibilities to districts, municipalities and rural communities the implementation of
such a strategy has been in some cases hindered by various practical considerations including:
* a lack of resources, and the appreciation of the need for and function of DEOs in the district local
governments has meant in some cases that they have not been effectively appointed or provided
with the appropriate authority and resources;.
* a potential conflict of interests between the roles of the DECs, which are proposed by NES 1995
and district health and environment committees (DHECs) proposed by the Local Government
Statute of 1993, both a result of the on going decentralisation programme; and

the roles of all the local environmental institutional structures recommended by NES 1995 and
the National Environment Management Policy such as DEO, DEC and LECs are not well defined
which at times causes confusion. In manv cases the individuals involved are not wvell guided
about their duties and how they relate to other institutions and agencies.
8.5   Recommendations
While the creation of NEMA has had a considerable effect on environmental management in Uganda.
there are inevitably some inconsistencies and lack of regulatory mechanisms that prevent it from
becoming fully functional. These are gradually being addressed by new legislation. and
implementation of the necessarv mechanisms within the relevant lead agencies including the
proposed ELU and Environmental Manager within the MOWHC and RAFU respectively. The
implementation of such measures should be encouraged wherever possible.
At the local level there is also a need for allocation of resources to. education of and empowering of
environmental officers and committees. although it is recognised that this may achieve a higher
priority as these measures are implemented at a national level.
Owing to previous development practices, which have in some cases not taken due account of the
conservation value of ecological resources, there is a particular need to establish links between
project promoters and the UWA so that both organisations develop an appreciation of the others
requirements and concerns and can work together to find mutually acceptable solutions. The current
project should be seen as an opportunity for the MOWHC and UWA to develop such relations. The
proposed ELU within the Ministrv and the Environmental Manager in RAFU should take
responsibility for this function.

9. CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES
9.1  Introduction
There are various alternatives to ensuring good transport links between the east and western parts of
Uganda and between Uganda and the Congo. On the macro scale there are altemative transport
modes that could be used, whilst within the road transport option itself there are choices that can be
made in terms of construction of new roads or use of existing alignments, standards adopted and
methods of undertaking the works. In addition, there is the no project scenario. In summary the main
alternatives comprise:
* use of other transport modes e.g. rail or air;
* use of other road transport routes;
alternative rehabilitation options;
* alternative construction methods. and
* do nothing scenario.
These alternatives and their consequences are discussed briefly below.
9.2   Alternative Transport Modes
The current railway infrastructure extends from Kasese to Kampala and north to Jinja, Tororo and
Soroti. At present. although it is used for the transport of freight (passenger transportation has ceased
for safety reasons), it is costly and unreliable with many derailments. There are presently no plans for
rehabilitation of this service. While in the longer term the use of rail rather than road infrastructure
where practicable is likely to be a preferable option in terms of environmental considerations (energy
consumption, air emissions etc), this would be dependent on a reliable and economically viable
service which is unlikely to be in place for a considerable time. Even if the rail service was
functional, the potential for its use would be constrained by the limited extent of the network which
would not provide links to the south parts of Uganda or to the Congo. The use of such a mode of
transport would also require an alteration in trading methods, particularly to minimise double
handling of materials (which itself has a high environmental cost). Therefore, although transportation
by rail may be a viable option in the future, it will only serve a proportion of the market (the rest will
continue to be dependent on road transportation) and is unlikely to be feasible for some time.
The high costs of air transport both in terms of economic and environmental considerations (energy
consumption, emissions to air) prohibit the use of such a transport mode.

9.3   Other Roads
Although an alternative road between Kampala and Fort Portal via Mubende is currently being
constructed. it is anticipated that this route will not be completed for at least three years and may
prove a difficult route for some vehicles as a result of steep gradients and sharp corners. Even when
this new road is completed, the southern route, comprising the project roads, will continue to be
necessary to serve areas to the south including Mbarara and Masaka as at present there is no other
road serving these areas. While it is recognised that owing to its potential to affect the nature
conservation value of the Park, the routing of the project road through the QENP is, there are
substantial constraints associated with rerouting the highway to avoid the Park; these include the
potential for considerable environmental impacts associated with landtake, associated ecological,
resettlement and compensation issues. bypassing towns and trading centers that have grown up and
are dependent on the existing road network, as well as the high cost and long implementation period.
In addition:
the presence of the Congo border would prohibits construction of such a route to the west of the
Park;
* the steep slopes of the rift valley escarpment on the Park's eastern boundary restrict options in
this area and could lead to an increase in costs; and
- a direct route from Kasese from Mbarara would be prohibitively expensive.
One of the project roads (the Equator Road) also comprises the main route to the Congo via the
Bwera/Mpondwe border post and there are no suitable alternative routes to that post which would not
require new construction across mountainous terrain. The nearest border post to the north is via the
Fort Portal - Bundibugyo Road at the northern tip of the mountains and at that location the Congo
side of the border is poorly served by roads. The southern post through Rukingiri is active but is
distant from major town in both Congo and Uganda. The present route through Bwera/Mpondwe
also has the advantage of being routes along the boundary of the Park rather than passing through this
protected area..
9.4   Rehabilitation Options
Owing to the level of deterioration of the Kasese- Kilembe Road from km 8.8 to 12 and the Equator
Road from km 20 to the border, any low cost maintenance activity would not be effective and there is
therefore a need for significant rehabilitation. Although the level of deterioration of the Equator Road
between km 0-5 is somewhat less, similar considerations apply to that stretch. Therefore, on these
sections, total reconstruction is recommended. The other sections of these roads are in better
condition and lower cost maintenance is the preferred option; while a more comprehensive

rehabilitation of these sections would result in a longer maintenance period and hence less
disturbance and associated environmental risks associated with maintenance, any environmental
benefits are considered unlikelv to outweigh the considerable larger scale disturbances associated
with rehabilitation.
The Katanguru - Fort Portal Road carries relatively higher volumes of traffic, and while the present
condition of the road is fair to good, this is a reflection of the high cost and frequent maintenance
activities which are currently undertaken. Along this stretch, rehabilitation is the favoured
environmental option as it reduces the need for the frequent disturbance (considerably more frequent
than would be required on the less busv Kilembe and Equator Roads).
Various alternatives in terms of construction activities and mitigations have been discussed in
Sections 6 and 7 of this report and specific recommendations to minimise environmental impacts
have been made including:
use of a local workforce where possible;
* housing of any foreign workforce within existing towns;
* siting of work camps away from QENP;
* specification of borrow pits, in particular, no use of pits within the QENP:
- use of local borrow pits to minimise haul distances; and
- if possible extraction of sand from existing pit at Katanguru should be avoided.
9.5   Do Nothing
The Do Nothing option comprises a continuation of the current levels of maintenance which require
frequent works and are dependent on availability of resources whenever this work is required. While
such an option could in the short term maintain the required standards between Katanguru and Fort
Portal, it would result in frequent maintenance and the associated high costs. In addition, the ad hoc
approach has more potential for generating environrmental impact than a well planned and
comprehensive project which is subject to an EIA and designed, implemented and monitored in
accordance with an Environmental Management Plan. The ad hoc approach would therefore be of
particular concern where the project road passes through the QENP. Other sections of the project
roads have deteriorated or are near to complete failure and cannot be rectified through the type of
maintenance activity associated with the Do Nothing scenario. This scenario would therefore within a
relatively short period of time render such road links unsuitable for use by motorised vehicle, with
resultant consequences in terms of erosion, accidents, safety, economic activity and associated
environmental effects.

r                         Uganda. The Katunguru-Kasese-Fort Portal road is a section of the Trans African
Highwav linking Mombasa in Kenya to Lagos in Nigeria. The road joins Equator
road which runs western to the Zaire border. On national level. it completes the
western road circuit that connects the towns of Kasese, Bushenvi. Mbarara and
Masaka, and Fort Portal to the capital Kampala. Through the Equator road the
|                        route connects Eastern Zaire. Rwanda and Burundi to the railway terminal at
Kasese where import and export goods from and destined to these countries can
be trans-shipped to and from the port of Mombasa in Kenya.
2.    Katunguru-Kasese-Fort Portal bisects the Queen Elizabeth National Park which
is renowned for its wildlife and in particular the territorial grounds of the Uganda
Kob.

(b)    vehicle operating costs for the types and sizes of vehicles forecast under
(a) above for both the existing and proposed investing and proposed
alignments and standards. These estimates, in conjunction with the
forecast of traffic with and without the proposed investment, shall form

including but not limited to surface and ground water drainage, soil
erosion, air pollution and possible preventive measures; and
(e)    the net benefits of the proposed improvements assessed under (a) to (d)
above. These shall be compared with the costs determined in para. 8
(adjusted to include detailed engineering, physical contingencies, and
supervision costs), for a period of analysis considered appropriate for the
investments being evaluated. Shadow-pricing shall be used in the
analysis if deemed necessary. For each alternative, the net present value,
discounted at 12%, the intemal rate of retum, and the first year benefit
shall be calculated. On the basis of these calculations, the optimum
alignments, design standards, starting date and staging schedule shall be
determined; and
(f)    Detailed cost/benefit streams should be presented for each alternative
considered both for the with-and without-project cases.  Multiple
exclusive alternatives should be assessed based on the NPV. For the
recommended alternative, sensitivity analysis should be conducted for a
20%  increase in costs and for a 20%  reduction in benefits. A risk
assessment should also be developed, in order to highlight the likelihood
of an unsatisfactory outcome. The fiscal and distributional impacts of the
project should also be evaluated, with emphasis on poverty alleviation.

Kasese                                     can be reminded during rallies.
*   The reason why people have been enchroachinig on reserve land is
because the MOWHC has not been maintaining the reserve land
Farmers fear their crops being eaten by pests, vermins Fanners cannot
spray bushes
Compensation Procedures
* A techinical team visits, assess and reaches a consensus over the right
cost  The rate given to the faniler varies with the stage, type, of the
crop, quality and what it would cost a fanier to establisi it elsewhere
Impacts of Road improvement
*   Marketing of food crops is done by women. Improvement of the road
would make women walk comfortably; and could be assisted by
children if the road was made safer.
Suggestions for the future
*   Trees should be planted to mark the boundaries of the road reserve.
This could help the farmers as well trees would stop farmers' soil being
washed away into the road, which silts the drains.
*   The MOWHC Engineer should work hand in hand with affected
villages and sensitize them over road reserve                      *    Could be done through the sub-county works
committees and political leaders at all levels.
Mrs. Biira Eva           Assistant Chief Administrative officer/  *   There is a Probe Committee investigating  among other things
Clerk to Kasese District Council           "encroachment on road reserve and construction of houses in green
belts in Kasese Town Council." The report is yet to come out but one
person had been stopped to construct a building as it did encroach on
road reserve.
*   mitigation: - Sensitization by LC leaders guided by the Engineers.
*   "We don't know how wide the road reserve should be. We regard the
slashed area by piida (MOWHC) as road reserve". (We all laughed!!!)
*   There is need to know the time when construction work will be done

APPENDIX Dl: PUBLIC CONSULTATION
KASESE DISTRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCIL HALL 26/11/1999
1     INTRODUCTION
The meeting was convened and facilitated by Associated Consulting Engineers (ACE), specifically to
seek for people's views about the project of constructing/renovating the Kasese - Kilembe and
Equator Roads. The meeting started at 10.45 a.m. with cominunication from the Executive Engineer -
Ministry of works, housing and Communications (MOWHC).
The Executive Engineer informed the people about the main purpose of the meeting. He explained
that there was need to get a an input (information) from the local population where the roads are
going to be constructed/renovated. He subsequently invited the Chief administrative Officer (CAO) -
Kasese District, to officially open the meeting.
Chief Administrative Officer
He highly welcomed the government initiative to consult the local masses as a good participatory
planning approach. He gave an example Stirling Construction Company that constructed Kasese road
without due consultation with local people. There has therefore, been no ownership of the project for
purposes of sustainability.
Given that background, the C.A.O said this public consultation was imperative for purposes project
sustainability. He informed the meeting the road construction/renovation is priority number two of
the government of Uganda. The C.A.O. further said that the local people can stifle development
projects if not impressed upon, i.e. conscientised. This is just an emphasis of his remarks on the need
for mass participation in project planning and management.
In his final remark, he cautioned that since land belongs to the people, appropriate modalities should
be earmarked for land compensation. This will prevent land disputes between the locals and the
contractor and, or MOWHC (Government). However, he advised the local people to be open to the
contractors and consultants for purposes of fruitful discussion. He then declared the meeting
officially open.
Further Communication
The Executive Engineer informed the meeting that drainage is the biggest problem in road
construction. Therefore, there is a need to improve and, or enlarge culverts. He requested the

people's representatives to sensitise the people on what has transpired. He also emphasized that
land belongs to the people. So it should be handled carefully, ie. amicably by the concerned parties.
A case in point was getting murram for road construction. It will involve excavation of peoples land.
which must be compensated for.
2      Representative - Associated Consulting Engineers (ACE)
He informed the meeting that his company (ACE) is charge of carrying out a Feasibility Study on the
proposed renovation of the Kasese roads: namely Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal. and Kasese -
Kilembe and Equator road.
Asked when the construction would begin, he said it was not known. until the feasibility study is
complete. He accordingly sought for people's views on the feasibility study.
The ACE representative informed the people about the width of the roads in terms of carriage ways
and shoulders. However, he said that the general guideline for road width with reserve is 30m.
Katunguru - Kasese: Carriage way 6.0m, Shoulder l.5m
Kilembe: Carriage way 5.6m, Shoulder 1.5 m
Equator Road: Carriage way 6.0m. Shoulder 1.5m
He noted that there is a provision in the project document to widen the carriage ways up to 6.0m.
He informed the people about the bridges earnarked to be renovated.
Mobuku bridge
Nyambwamba bridge
Mpondwe bridge
Other road requirements:
-      To check all culverts for due repair.
-      Pavements will be made
-      Road furniture and paint marking especially special signing at sharp corners, will be
provided.

The speaker of Kasese District Local Government Council, appreciated the initiative of public
consultation. But he hoped that the project would be implemented as planned. On the drainage
system, he cited some areas that should be worked on. namely, Katoro area (where there is a ridge)
and Bukungara Valley on Equator road.
The Executive Engineer informed the people that most bridges are catered for in the contingency
plans of the project.
The Chairman works committee, Kasese District Local Council (KDLC), added other areas that need
to be worked on during the project. On Bwera road, there is stagnant water at many areas/points (No
specific points). There is no culvert at Pokopoka. This also causes stagnant water which affects
people's movement and sanitation.
The speaker mentioned other areas like Karambi, customs which have stagnant water.
There is need for a Zebra-crossing as you approach Kasese Town, due to heavy traffic. Bwera Town
needs round about at the junction. The junction is a potential accident area, but drivers have only
been careful.

3.2.1   Compensation
Further clarification was sought on compensation modalities as this was quite a contentious issue.
The Executive Engineer said that property can be valued by the government valuer and the MOWHC
effects payment. But the contractor can also pay if the contract states so.
The Kasese Town Council Engineer informed the people that there can be compulsory land take
/acquisition in public interest.
The Kasese Town Council Land valuer said that the chief Government Valuer, through the district
valuer and District Compensation Committee makes arrangements to pay people through the C.A.O's
office.

A member informed the meeting that Kasese Cobalt Company Ltd (KCCL) had a problem, when they
paid/compensated the locals through Kasese Town Council. He advised the MOWHC to deal
directly with the local people.
The Environmental Officer KCCL advised that there is need for neutral person(s) identified by the
MOWHC to assess property for compensation. The lawyer should be on the assessment committee.
The C.A.O advised the local leaders to do a lot of Community sensitisation in as far as
compensation is concerned.
4      Factors Affecting Project Implementation
a)     Lack of Community Involvement in supervision
b)     Thefts e.g. fuel siphoning
c)     Delays in compensation
d)     Poor quality construction materials
e)    Inadequate funding
f)     Poor Workmanship
g)     Poor Engineering Design
h)     Floods and Earth quakes
4.1    Observation
It was observed that this project planning needs to envisage other future development plans in the
district. For instance an International Airport is due to be constructed and it will lead to increased
traffic. So project designers need to take note of this. The ACE representative took note of it.
The C.A.O discouraged the contractors to import unskilled labour as the district has enough.

6 Institutional Arrangments for Compensation
People were informed by the moderator that there was need for an institutional arrangement to
handle compensation matters that may arise during project implementation. The moderator advised
people to identify neutral people/parties to form the institutional arrangement.
The Structure below was proposed.
Note: Details pertaining compensation can be obtained in 3.2.1
At the subcounty level. the production and environment committee, as well as the
secretary for production and environment should directly be involved in compensation
matters.
The above can provide channels through which the public can submit their concerns
regarding project implementation i.e road construction.
7     Any Other Issues

The following are other concerns of social nature that can be mitigated by the
project.
Mr Muhindo B.M. chairperson LC III Rukoki subcounty wants flooded areas of
Nyamusamba river at Kigoro Trading Centre to be controlled.
The Chief Engineer Kilembe Mines ltd identified the 2.1 Km stretch of Kyanjuki on
Kasese - Kilembe road to be added on the project. He urged that this road serves a secondary
school, two primary schools and a big housing estate.
The Headmaster Mpondwe Primary School requested for road signs, humps and
Zebra crossing around the school (Equator Road). He argued that, the school has 1704 pupils
including those with disabilities. The pupils normally fail to cross the road because it is
busy.
The Headmaster Mother Care Preparatory School asked for humps on Kilembe -
Kasese road. He states that many lives have lost, where children of Kasese P.S., Rock P.S.
Mother Care P.S., Kasese High School and Celak cross daily. The Zebra Crossing has not
helped much.
Below are specific engineering requests made
a)     Culverts on Kasese - Kilembe road
-      Golf Club Junction
-      Kibenge
-      the end of Road Barrier
-      Kyenjojo
-      Recreation Club
b)     The road in Hima Town Centre requires bridges on the trenches, humps to
reduce accidents.
c)     On Katunguru - Fort Portal Road,
-      humps are needed at Hima Township,  Mukhoka Town and
Katunguru Town.
-      Bridge on Hima River

REPORT OF KATUNGIRU - KASESE - FORT PORTAL ROAD
PUBLIC CONSULTATION MEET HELD ON 26/11/99
AT THE FORT PORTAL MUNICIPAL COMMUNITY HALL
INTRODUCTION
The meeting started with a remark from the Executive Engineer Ministry of Works Housing and Communication
Kabalore District, who welcomed the people and apologised for the confusion over the venue of the meeting place.
He informed the public that. the meeting was convened to consult them on several issues regarding the proposed
construction and renovation of the fort Portal - Rweimi road. He gave a brief background to the project.
Feasibility studies were being undertaken by ACE/Scott Wilson collaboration and it was a requirement by World
Bank (the funder of the project) to carry out these public consultations.
He introduced representatives of ACE, Namely Engineer P Kalungi, Ms Lubanga Rosalind - Sociologist and Mr.
Bbosa Ronald. He also introduced the local dignitaries from whom he invited the mayor of Fort Portal Municipality
to officially open the Meeting.
Mayors Address
He was appreciative of the proposed project and the approach to consult the public, he noted that this was the first
time he was observing people being consulted over road matters. He appealed to all members present to give the
necessary information and after which he declared the meeting open.
Briefing on proposed engineering plans on the Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal road by Engineer Paul
Kalungi.
He started by reviewing the present status of the road and the proposed interventions on the Fort Portal to Rwimi
Section. He informed members that the carriageway was narrow and it lacked shoulders. The plan was to be
widened the road to about 6 metres. It will follow the current alignment. This section has very many sharp
comers and these will not be tempered with because of the high costs involved. The plan also involves improving
drainage. Road widening may require creation of road diversions in the course of constructing and may need
murram obtainable from individual person's borrow pits.
The purpose of the meeting was to obtain people's views, on how they could facilitate the contractors work during
construction, identify possible problems that may arise during and after construction and how these could be
addressed.
Discussions
Ms Rosalid Lubanga led the participants into the next session of the day's activities in which they were divided into
two groups of about 14 people each, to brainstom and identify the likely positive and negative consequences of the
project and devise workable solutions at the different stages of the project.
By the end of this session, ideas, views and concerns of the people that were in the groups were discussed and
contentious issues debated in order to come up with a common stand.
1 a)    Social and Economic problems facing the district.
Members were asked about the problems, they generated the following list.
-      unemployment among the youth
-      power struggles e.g. those aiming at splitting the district.
-      insecurity
-      low levels of literacy as a result of high school drop out rates and few institutions of higher
learning
-      lack of constant power supply



-      low level of industrialisation, a few existing mdustries included maize mills, tea factories, diary
factories.
b)    Problems of using the current road
The participants were asked for the problemns of using the current road.
-      Accidents - because the road is narrow, this evidenced when motorists and cyclists are over taking
each other and pedestrians especially school children are the victims.
-      poor maintenance, due to busy reserves which reduce the visibility for drivers thus increasing the
possibility of accidents
-      Too many comers because of the terrain
-      No road signs
-      Animals grazing on road reserves.
c)     Mode of land acquisition
Members were asked about how land was acquired
It was reported that land was acquired through: inheritance, purchase and govemment allocations such as
in the case of resettlement schemes and work camps.
2      The role of the rod in solving the socio-economic problems facing the district-
Members were asked the ways in which the improvement of the Fort Portal - Rwimi road would help in
solving the identified socio economic problems and those specific to the road. Some problems might be
solved while others may not while may be aggravated.
Problems that might be partly addressed included:
-      unemployment: the unemployed may obtain work on the road works
-      improvement in agricultural production could only be attained with improved access roads.
-      accident would be reduced if road safety signs and sign posters are put on the roads.
3 a)   Members present were asked for the anticipated negative effect on different people living near and off the
road, road users (motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, and people of different gender and ages) during the
different phases of the project.



The table below summarises the anticipated problems and mitigation measures

- Earth quakes cracking the road    - Better engineering design.
3 b)    Constraints to effective utilisation of renovated roads members were asked for factors that may constrain
full and effective utilisation of the renovated roads.



Insurgencies (political instability) as a result of improved and faster move.
low agricultural production - despite the improvement of the road, low levels of agricultural
production would mean that the road may not be put to full utility.
n  -   Transport fares would go up. This view was supported by the fact that previous experiences with
improvement Fort - Portal - Kyenjojo road had lead to the deployment of more policemen. This
made the transport fares to go up, because the regulation requiring taxis to carry 3 people per seat
would be enforced. The result would be reduced movement of people.
4.     In which way could people affect, hinder or facilitate renovation work?
The moderator wanted to get labour including women to work on the roads and the response was
affirmative, participants added that women were already involved in public works like slashing and
cleaning the streets of the municipality and further that information would be given to people about the
availability of jobs through radio Tooro (VOT) in addition to the press.
5. a)   Compensation
The secretary to the District Land Board which had been recently instituted made the following
clarifications regarding permanent and temporary land take:
-      The CAO is responsible for compensation issues since he is the Chief Accounting Officer and
reports to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Works.
-      The district has got a Land Board, a Land Office, and a Town Council Land Board.
-      The Land Board of each district has the power to compile compensation rates in view of non
permanent aspects e.g. animals, crops, buildings-section 60 of the Land Act of June 1998.
-      Compensation rates differ for different crops and materials.
-      The district doesn't have a Valuer (The service commission has re-advertised the position but has
so far not been able to obtain one.
-      That section 74 (I) of the Land Act holds that the Ministry can take land in the event of failure to
agree with the owner of the land - in agreement with the established rates as per the district in
question.
Monitoring of stakeholder compensation.
5 b)   The participants pointed out that monitoring was handled by the Local Council IH and the CAO's office.
Individual could also employ the service of law furms at their cost.
There was a concern that the process of handling compensation by Govermment machinery is slow. The
procedure would normally involve sending, a technical team including, the valuer and other like the
survey, the District Agricultural officer to do assessments which are sent to the District Engineer then the
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works, who makes a budgetary allocation during the following financial
year and money is sent to the CAOs office.
Participants expressed a need for the affected people to be directly compensated by the contractor.



c)    Road Reserves
Extent to which people are aware of temparing with road reserves.
-      It was reported that people had some knowledge about prohibitions of using road reserves.
-      Road committees are supposed to sensitize people about road reserves - The chairman of the road
committee is the sub county head.
-      There was laxity in enforcing regulations governing road use.
-      Concerning the handling of people doing farming and other activities along the road when
construction work starts, members agreed that there was a need for advance warning of 3 - 6 months.
-      There was also a reported need for the use of the media and seminars to sensitize the public
-      Members resolved that the following would be charged with making enchroachers aware.
-      LCs'                   -       media advertisement
-      Road Committees        -       Office of the District Engineer
-      Technical Staff
6.     Institutional arrangement and capacities to manage information, monitor mitigation measures and enforce
compensation agreements.
-      Members present agreed that the LCI III community liaison offices should work hand in hand
with the public relations officer for the contractors to handle problems as they arise.
-      Participants also agreed that LCs, chiefs and land committees would be entrusted with the
responsibility of handling the views and concerns of the public at the different stages of
construction.
-      The District Engineer informed the participants that there were no bye laws restricting camping,
but they were of the view that the following places should not be used for camping purposes.
-      cultural sites
-      near wet land
-      near trading centres
-      near public institutions.
The moderator asked for information concerning the skills the community needed to fully
participate in monitoring, mitigation measures and road maintenance after construction.
-      maintenance of drainage channels
-      road use
-      meanings of road signs



Other Issues Raised
1      The start of construction work may be influenced by:
-      Politicians
-      Contractors
2.     Many road corners implied that -
-      road signs and guard rails should be installed on the road
3.     Members suggested that the existing road net work i.e. Fort Portal - Kazingo - Matasndai - Rubana be
maintained.
4.     Suggestion on Contractor - public relationship -
-      proper assessment of people's property
-      prompt assessment and compensation.
The representative for the CAO, Mr. Kaija Samuel provided a closing remark and re-emphasized the need for
adequate assessment, to avoid repeating the exercise and called upon the contractors to ensure prompt compensation
payment. He reiterated the need for the road and the importance of road reserves and urged the community to
participate by working harmoniously with the contractors. Mr. Kaija warned the contractors of careless driving and
brought it out clearly that on a number of occasions people's vehicles have been hit by turning and over speeding
trucks of the Contractors.
In a further remark he warned the contractors of breach of contract (failure to implement what the participants had
agreed on) and the need for sensitization and early waming.
There being no further business the meeting was adjourned at 1.35 p.m.
