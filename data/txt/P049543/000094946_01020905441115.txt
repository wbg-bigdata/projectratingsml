1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
In July 1998, the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications (MOWHC) awarded the
contract for conducting a study to assess the environmental policy and management of the First
Road Sector Project (FRSP) to ARCADIS Euroconsult.
The study was initiated as a result of three major developments:
i)    the National Environment Statute of 1995 which made it mandatory for environmental
impact assessments (EIAs) to be carried out for all new development projects:
ii)   the realisation by the MOWHC that the FRSP would include major road works requiring
EIAs; and
iii)   increased funding for road sector activities by donors who stipulate environmental
assessments as a condition of funding.
Based on this, the FRSP's strategy for integrating environmental concerns into road sector
activities is to:
a)    identify the sectoral environmental impacts of the road programme on Ugandan
environmental management system, on the planning process and on the policy,
regulatory and institutional framework; and
b)    conduct site-specific impact assessments for each of the planned road sections. elaborate
on activities that will mitigate these impacts, and contribute to environmentally sound
use of the land and its resources adjacent to the proposed road works.
The FRSP Environmental Policy and Management Assessment Study addresses the first
component, focusing on environmental policy and management as the basis of the Sectoral
Environmental Assessment for the road sector in Uganda.
1.1.1 Objectives of the Study
The objectives of the study are to:
i)     assist the Government of Uganda to identify the status of the country's procedures for
conducting ElAs of road sector projects by reviewing policies. regulations and the
institutional framework for conducting ElAs;
ii)    identify the most critical constraints to environmental management of the road sector in
Uganda;
iii)   develop sector specific environmental guidelines;
iv)    streamline and standardise the EIA process for road works.

1.2 Setting the StaLe for EIA
In order to provide the background against which the EIA process in Uganda has evolved. this
section briefly highlights the key elements and the milestones leading to the formulation of the
national EIA guidelines.
As Uganda strove to increase economic productivity after years of civil unrest, it became
apparent that the various socio-economic activities were having grave consequences on the
physical and natural environment (soil erosion, deforestation, reclamation of wetlands, loss of
fishing grounds), as well as on public health (pollution, increased incidence of disease).
Recognising the need for an environmental management plan, the Government of Uganda began
to develop the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) in 1991 so as to provide a framework
for addressing these problems and in addition to ensure the integration of environmental concerns
into the development process. NEAP was finalised in June 1995.
NEAP established, inter alia, the following issues which are of direct relevance to this study:
* that there was an absence of policies and laws for sustainable environmental management in
the country;
- that ElAs were conducted on an ad hoc basis, and usually at the behest of a funding agency;
* that national environmental standards were lacking for most sectors (with the exception of
water and health).
Stemming from NEAP, the National Environment Management Policy for Uganda (1994) was
formulated whose overall policy goal is to maintain or enhance environmental quality and
resource productivity on a long-term basis while promoting sustainable social and economic
development. One of the key objectives of the policy is to integrate environmental concerns into
all development policies, planning and activities at all levels, and to encourage participation by
the people during the development process.
With regard to EIA, the policy's objective was to provide a system of EIA and environmental
monitoring so that negative impacts arising from a development could be foreseen, eliminated or
mitigated. In order to achieve this goal, the policy outlined its strategies as being to:
i) create a legal EIA process necessitating environmental impact assessments, environmental
impact statements and environmental audits for all private and public development projects;
ii) establish a national environmental authority whose function would be to oversee ElAs, while
leaving the actual implementation to the lead agencies involved;
iii) develop EIA capacity/capability in sectoral ministries and departments.
Subsequently in May 1995, the National Environment Statute was passed which provides for the
establishment of the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) whose functions
would be to coordinate, monitor and supervise the sustainable management of the environment.
(NEMA was established in 1996). The Statute also provides for the establishment of district
environment committees, district environment officers and local environment committees. In
addition, the Statute addresses national and district level environmental planning, environmental
regulation (through ElAs, environmental auditing and monitoring), and the establishment of
environmental standards.



8
The Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations of 1998, make it mandatory for all projects
listed in the Third Schedule of the Statute and any major repairs, extensions or routine
maintenance of any existing project included in the Third Schedule of the Statute to conduct
ElAs in accordance with the regulations before implementation. These regulations are therefore
applicable to all major roads and all roads in "scenic, wooded or mountainous areas."
1.3 Environmental Guidelines for the Road Sector
This volume of the study report focuses specifically on developing environmental guidelines for
the road sector in Uganda. It is intended for use by personnel in the MOWHC, the Road Agency
Formation Unit (RAFU), the future Road Agency (RA) and environmental practitioners who will
be contracted to undertake environmental impact assessments (EIAs). It will also be of use to
various stakeholders, such as Local Authorities, the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the Forestry
Department, conservation-oriented NGOs (eg. IUCN), etc., as well as donor agencies supporting
the road sector.
The National Environment Action Plan for Uganda (June 1995) requires that each sectoral
ministry has an environmental liaison unit (ELU). The MOWHC already has such a unit. These
guidelines have been developed on the premise that the ELU will play a greater role in
environmental management in the road sector than simply liaison. They also assume that another
environmental unit will be created under the Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU), which will
later become a unit in the proposed Road Agency. The institutional framework which provides
the basis for these guidelines have been discussed in detail in Volume II of this report, and should
be referred to for clarification of responsibilities for road sector activities in the context of
MOWHC and RAFU/Road Agency.
The guidelines have been designed so that the tasks in the EIA process that are to be undertaken
by the MOWHC's environmental liaison unit (ELU) and the environmental unit (EU) to be
created under RAFU and its successor the Roads Agency are explicitly indicated. The same
procedures would also apply if the Road Agency were to be privatised in the future.
The guidelines present procedures for conducting ElAs of road projects where the purpose of
each step in the EIA process is clearly described. These procedures closely follow the National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) EIA guidelines, and aim to assist those who are
unfamiliar with environmental assessment requirements in Uganda or have little experience in
ElAs of road projects specifically. However, modifications to these procedures have also been
presented which intend to streamline the EIA process so as to accommodate the MOWHC's road
project cycle.
Environmental management during road maintenance are described with a view to assimilating
environmental and social considerations into current practices for assessing maintenance needs.
Also included in this document are guidelines for the integration of public consultation,
compensation and settlement issues into the EIA process for the road sector.
It must be stressed that the guidelines contained in this document are intended to direct personnel
within the MOWHC/RAFU/RA and EIA practitioners in the application of the EIA process.
Although road sector activities, their impacts and mitigation measures have been described as
comprehensively as possible, the full range of environmental and social issues will not have been
covered, nor will all the difficulties in carrying out ElAs have been addressed. This will only be
possible after the guidelines have been applied to road projects of different screening categories

located in various environmental and social settings. Thereafter the guidelines should be revised
to include any experiences that would improve their application and relevance to the road sector.
1.4 Stakeholders in the EIA Process
The FRSP will no doubt play a major role in the economic development of the country, since
roads provide the essential link between source and destination so important to agriculture.
commerce, industry, wildlife, tourism, health and education. However, activities in the FRSP
may induce environmental changes that could directly or indirectly affect these sectors.
Consequently, it is imperative that the approach for environmental management of the road
sector is multi-sectoral.
Precisely because of this multi-sectoral nature of the impacts of road projects, a number of
agencies or stakeholders must be involved at various stages of the road project cycle. The most
important of these is the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) which is
mandated by law to be "the principal agency in Uganda for the management of the environment"
(refer The National Environment Statute  of 1995).         Other stakeholders  are  the
ministries/departments responsible for the sectors mentioned above, and of course, the public -
ie. road users and those who benefit from the road.
Stakeholders should be involved at the planning, design, construction and maintenance stages of
the road project cycle, and EIA is a tool that can ensure that this is done. Participation by
stakeholders is highlighted in these guidelines under various sections, but is specifically
addressed in the Guidelines for Public Consultation (Chapter I 1). A list of stakeholders who
may need to be involved in road sector activities is presented in Annex I.
1.5 Review of World Bank Practice
The World Bank emphasizes an environmental assessment must be carried out for any project
before it can grant any form of assistance or input into the project.
The requirements set by the World Bank in its policy statement,' entail bearing in mind
environmental considerations at the time of project identification, preparation, and recognizing
that modification could occur at the time of appraisal, negotiations, and implementation.
Because of this recognition, the World Bank requires that ElAs are carried out to determine
project impacts which may be potentially irreversible, for instance, extinction of species or
ecosystems. On the other hand the current World Bank policy on environmental issues is that
projects with severe environmental impacts will not be financed without adequate mitigation
measures.
Under the World Bank Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment,2 a borrower has the
responsibility for carrying out an environmental assessment while the Bank plays a review and
follow-up role to ensure that the project has adequately complied with the requirements for
environmental assessment. In that respect, the Bank assists the borrower to prepare the terms of
reference or the environmental assessment.
Operational Manual Statement 2.36: "Environmental Aspects of Bank Work", May 1984.
OD 4.00, Annex A, October 1989.



10
The World Bank policv further requires the borrower to undertake appropriate consultation with
disclosure of information to affected groups and local non-governmental organisations.
Currently, environmental training is one of the mandates of the Bank as a measure to adequately
integrate environmental assessment into the various country project implementation policies.
1.5.1 Compatibility with Ugandan Law
Uganda has adequate laws on environmental issues as provided for under the 1995 Constitution,
the National Environment Statute and the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations of
1998, and other sectoral laws on natural resources management.
Most of the provisions in these laws take into account the World Bank policies on environmental
issues.  A review of the country's environmental laws inter alia revealed that Uganda is
committed to maintain sustainable development and this has been incorporated in its basic
legislation on the environment including the constitution.
Laws relating to environmental management in the road sector are presented in Chapter 2 of
Volume IV of this report.
Tender documents for feasibility studies for road sector projects include environmental
assessments, while contract documents have provisions for preventing environmental
degradation, through pollution and other means. This is in compliance with the requirements of
the law under the National Environment Statute, 1995.
A conclusion drawn from this study is that the Government of Uganda (GOU) is determined to
implement her national environmental policy on environmental issues, during the life span of any
project, including, for the current purpose, the FRSP. This policy is in line with that of the World
Bank.
The measures suggested under the World Bank directives, and whicil are included in the
Ugandan legislation, for ensuring compliance with environmental standards during project
implementation are reflected in the analysis above.
1.5.2 Harmonisation of NEMA and World Bank EIA Guidelines
In November 1997, a workshop was held in Kampala to compare environmental assessment
procedures between the Government of Uganda and the World Bank. The workshop concluded
that there was a substantial overlap and no basic inconsistencies between the NEMA and World
Bank EIA guidelines. However, it was clarified that all World Bank funded projects must
comply with NEMA guidelines.
The implications on the FRSP is that all its sub-projects, irrespective of the funding agency, must
conform with the NEMA EIA Guidelines, 1997, and the Environmental Impact Assessment
Regulations, 1998. The distinction between the two is that whereas the EIA Guidelines are not
legally binding, the Regulations are.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF ROADS AND ROAD PROJECTS IN
UGANDA
Road projects essentially follow four stages: planning, construction, operation and maintenance.
Activities that are undertaken during these stages have several environmental impacts. The
eiivironment is defined as comprising the following elements:
Phvsical elements
geology, topography, soils, climate, air quality, drainage patterns, surface water, groundwater,
water quality, soil erosion.
Biological elements
flora and fauna, habitats, rare and endangered species, protected areas that may exist in the area
of influence of the road, trends in flora and fauna.
Socio-economic elements
demographic characteristics, land-uses, agricultural and economic activities, modes of transport,
road networks and their usage, origin and destination of goods and passengers transported in the
area of influence of the road, administrative structures in the area of influence of the road.
employment.
Cultural elements
archaeological, historical, religious and cultural features, scenic beauty, wilderness value.
An environmental impact is a change in an environmental element that is caused directly or
indirectly by an activity related to a project such as a road, eg. clearing of vegetation along the
selected alignment of the road. Different social groups may be affected in different ways by
environmental impacts. Environmental impacts can be in the form of risks created by a project.
eg. increased risk of traffic accidents. Impacts vary in terms of the following characteristics:
* duration
* timing (short/long-term)
* magnitude
* spatial coverage
* likelihood of occurrence.
All these characteristics need to be established during an EIA of a road project.
Mitigation measures for those impacts found to be significant should be determined. Mitigation
measures aim to:
minimise or eliminate adverse impacts,
* enhance beneficial impacts,
protect the rights of affected groups to compensation.
Potential mitigation measures include alternative alignments and modification of the design of
the road project, compensation of those adversely affected by loss of land and relocation.

Summaries of the various potential environmental impacts that may arise during planning,
construction, operation and maintenance of roads are given in Tables 2.1 to 2.4 below, according
to the various road works activities undertaken at each stace. It should be noted that the i'st of
impacts and mitigation measures is not exhaustive, as each road will have impacts peculiar to
itself. The tables are intended as a guide. Furthermore, in most cases an impact on one
environmental element will result in impacts on other related environmental elements as
demonstrated below.
Annex 1I gives a detailed description of how these impacts arise, their mitigation, monitoring,
suggested methods for analysing these impacts, and potential sources of relevant data in Uganda.

3. NEMA EIA PROCESS AS APPLICABLE TO THE ROAD SECTOR
3.1 The EIA Process in Uganda
Under the National Environment Statute, 1995, NEMA was given the responsibility for preparing
environmental guidelines for EIA, which would serve as the administrative basis for the EIA
process. The Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment in Uganda (hereafter referred to
as the NEMA EIA Guidelines) were published in July 1997.
The EIA process as delineated by NEMA and the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations
of 1998 comprises:
* Project Brief
. Screening
* The Environmental Impact Assessment Study
* Decision Making
* Monitoring and Auditing
The process conforms with most intemational and donor guidelines prescribed for EIA, and is
depicted in Figure 3.1.
3.1.1 Project Brief
Project briefs serve to give relevant background information on the basis of which screening can
be carried out. Guidelines for formulating project briefs are given in Chapter 5.
The EIA process normally begins once a developer has submitted the project brief to NEMA.
NEMA then forwards a copy of the project brief to the Lead Agency (which can be a ministry,
parastatal, government department, etc, under whose jurisdiction the project falls), and holds
preliminary consultations with the Lead Agency.
In the road sector, for some sub-projects of the FRSP, the Developer and the Lead Agency will
be the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications, while for others the Roads Agency
Formation Unit (RAFU), which will in due course become the Roads Agency, will be the
Developer and the Lead Agency.
3.1.2 Screening
The purpose of screening is to determine the extent to which an environmental assessment is
required. Projects must go through three screens:
Screen I      The first screen sieves out projects that do not require ElAs. In the context of
road projects or activities these would include minor spot improvement or repairs
on earth or gravel roads.

If screening indicates that a project requires an environmental impact study, then
the project goes on to the second screen.
Screen 2      At this stage, it is determined whether the project or sub-project is likely to have
significant environmental impacts for which mitigation cannot be readily
identified. If that is the case, a detailed EIA study is necessary.
In the event that the project may  have some negative environmental
repercussions that can be mitigated, it proceeds to the next screen.
Screen 3      Projects reaching this screen would include minor rehabilitation, improvement
and maintenance works which would require an environmental impact review
(EIR) or partial EIA so that appropriate mitigation measures can be identified.
For example, regravelling works, or the repair of potholes or small sections of
existing tarmac roads may have impacts related to quarrying for material for
regravelling, dust and air emissions, noise, temporary disturbance to local
populations. traffic diversions, etc.
If the screening process determines that the project is exempt from EIA, or that the project should
be approved on the basis of identified mitigation measures, the developer is awarded a Certificate
of Approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment by NEMA. But if the project qualifies for
a partial or full EIA, the certificate is issued after approval or disapproval of the Environmental
Impact Review Report in the case of a partial EIA, or an Environmental Impact Statement for a
full EIA study.
Screening should be done by the Lead Agency and the screening category must be approved by
NEMA. Guidelines for allocating screening categories to road works activities are presented in
Chapter 5.
3.1.3 The Environmental Impact Assessment Study
The EIA study consists of three steps: scoping, the environmental impact study and decision
making.
Scoping
Scoping identifies the critical environmental and social issues which will need to be addressed
during the environmental study.  It requires consultation with the relevant authorities and
stakeholders (especially affected communities) so that their input/comments can be taken into
consideration.
In addition, the scoping exercise delineates the boundaries of the study area, identifies
preliminary alternatives, suggests a schedule for the completion of the environmental study and
for full public involvement during the study, and identifies the full range of stakeholders who
may be interested in or affected by the project.
Thus it assists in the planning of the environmental study and forms its terms of reference.
Scoping is normally carried out by the firm of consulting engineers conducting the pre-feasibility
study for a road project.



26
The terms of reference for the EIA studv should be prepared either by the persons conducting the
scoping exercise, or by the proposed environment unit within RAFU/Road Agency. These terms
of reference must be approved by NEMA.
Environmental Impact Study
During the environmental impact study, relevant data is collected and analysed. major impacts
are investigated in depth, mitigation measures developed for adverse impacts and compensatorv
measures recommended for unmitigable impacts.  All project alternatives are thoroughly
examined.
Impacts are quantified in terms of magnitude (major, moderate, minor, negligible), extent
(regional, local, site specific) and duration (long term, medium term, short term).
During the study, constant consultation must be undertaken withi the relevant authorities,
stakeholders, affected and interested parties.
Environmental Impact Statement
The findings of the environmental impact study are presented in an environmental impact
statement (EIS). The EIS must contain a description of the project site, surroundings, proposed
activities, and of the significant environmental impacts and risks. It should discuss the project
alternatives and recommend mitigation measures. The EIS should also contain a monitoring and
evaluation programme.
The environmental impact study and the EIS are usually undertaken by the consulting engineers
who are conducting the feasibility study and design of the road project.
3.1.4 Decision Making
The EIS is submitted to NEMA for review and comments. NEMA invites stakeholders and the
public to comment on the document. Comments are also sought from the MOWHC/RAFU/Road
Agency. If the EIS is approved, then a Certificate of Approval of the Environmental Impact
Assessment is issued, following which a decision is made to proceed with the project. The
project may then be implemented.
If, however, the EIS is not approved, then the project may be rejected or the developer may be
asked to revise the proposed actions or develop other mitigation measures in order to eliminate
adverse impacts.
A Record of Decision is prepared whether or not the project is approved.
3.1.5 Monitoring and Auditing
During and after implementation of the project, the Environmental Impact Assessment
Regulations require that the developer carries out environmental monitoring in order to ensure
that recommended mitigation measures are incorporated into the project design, that these
measures are effective and so that unforeseen impacts may be predicted.



27
After thle first year of operation. the developer must undertake an initial environmental audit.
The purpose of the audit is to compare the actual and predicted impacts, and assess the
effectiveness of the EIA study, as well as its appropriateness, applicabilitv and success. The audit
is to be carried out by persons or firms chosen by the Executive Director of NEMA.
Thereafter the Executive Director may require additional audits to be made.



28
4. EIA AND THE PROJECT CYCLE
It is important to emphasise that conducting environmental impact assessments does not entail
the introduction of new concepts or procedures. Rather it is a process for incorporating or
ensuring environmental management into existing steps in a normal project cycle.
The development process for a road project involves a number of technilcal studies wilich are
essentially the planning and design stages, after which the road is constructed and then becomes
operational. During operation the road needs to be regularly maintained.
Most procedures required to be carried out during an EIA can be undertaken as part and parcel of
project cycle activities. So, if EIA is regarded as part of the project cycle, provision will be made
for these various procedures to be included into the pre-feasibilitv study, the feasibility study.
design. construction and operations. This will help to avoid situations where ElAs are done after
the design stage or during construction.
Figure 4.1 compares the typical stages of a road project cycle with those in an EIA. and thus
illustrates how  EIA  can be integrated into planning. design, construction. operation and
maintenance. It should be stressed here that, although the flowchart may be interpreted as such.
EIA is not a parallel process to the road project cycle. The chart intends to indicate wheni each
step is to be taken.
The road project cycle followed by the MOWHC differs slightly to that shown in Figure 4.1. In
order to accommodate all the steps of the EIA process into the MOWHC's road project cvcle and
at the same time facilitate smooth implementation of the technical studies wvhich are part of the
road project. certain modifications to the EIA process are necessary. These are presented II
Chapter 7 of this document.

5. GUIDELINES FOR MOWHC AND RAFU/ROAD AGENCY INPUT TO THE EIA
PROCESS
As Lead Agencies and Developers in the road sector, the Ministry of Works. Housing and
Communications and RAFU/Road Agencv will need to undertake certain tasks so that the EIA
process may proceed as required by the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations of 1998.
Specifically these tasks are:
Preparation of the Project Brief
* Screening
* Preparation of the Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Reviews (EIRs)
* Preparation of the Terms of Reference for Scoping
* Preparation of the Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Assessment Studies
Review of Environmental Impact Reviews and Statements
It is expected that most of the projects requiring ElAs will be under the jurisdiction of RAFU.
However, there mav be occasions where projects undertaken by the MOWHC will also require
ElAs.
Figure 5.1 illustrates the EIA process for the road sector.
5.1 The Project Brief
5.1.1 Purpose of the Project Brief
TIhe project brief provides essential information to those authorities responsible for screening, so
that an informed decision can be made when it is allocated to a screening categorv.
A well written project brief has a number of advantages:
- it simplifies and speeds up the screening process, by eliminating the need for obtaining more
information;
* if the project brief contains adequate and appropriate mitigation measures for any anticipated
negative impacts, the Executive Director of NEMA may approve the project without
necessitating an environmental impact assessment;
* it forms the basis for terms of reference for an environmental impact review in the event that
only a partial EIA is required;
. it provides data which can act as a springboard for gathering further relevant data during
scoping and the EIA study, thus saving time and resources;
* it lays the foundation for public participation in the environmental appraisal process by listing
possible stakeholders.

5.1.2 Responsibility for Preparing the Project Brief
The project brief should be prepared by RAFU/Road Agency's environmenital unit or an engiineer
in RAFU's planning, design or maintenance section, who will be appointed by the Executive
Director of RAFU or the Road Agency. During the preparation of the brief, the designated
engineer or the environmental unit will need to liaise with MOWHC's environmental liaison unit.
For projects. other than routine and periodic maintenance, to be undertakeni by MOWHC. the
project brief should be prepared by the Ministry's ELU.
5.1.3 Preparation of the Project Brief
Project briefs are concise documents that should contain the following information.
1.    Nature of thte Project
A brief description of the project is required which states whether it involves the
construction of a new road or alignment, major rehabilitation of an existing road, minor
rehabilitation of an existing road, maintenance works. The length of road proposed for
rehabilitation/improvement/maintenance should be indicated here. This gives an idea of
the magnitude of the road works anticipated.
2.     Historical Background
A review of the historical background, particularly in the case of rehabilitation projects.
heips to identify reasons for rehabilitation. For example. the exercise would reveal
whether it was lack of maintenance, or whether there was a particular (environmental or
social) problem leading to the degradation of the road. or simply that the life of the road
was coming to an end, that has made rehabilitation necessary.
Such information can also give insight into positive and negative impacts previously
experienced during construction and operation. Lessons learned from this review would
facilitate the identification of such impacts which may not be altogether obvious during
the design for rehabilitation.
In addition, it would provide some baseline data which would be useful during the design
phases, and for monitoring in the later stages of project construction and operation.
Often the best sources for obtaining historical information are the local communities
living within the area of influence of the proposed road project.
3.     Area of Influence
Area of influence should indicate the length and location of the road to be
constructed/rehabilitated/improved. and the total area that will be affected by or benefit
from the road project. It should describe origin and destination points, and settlements or
towns along the project road.
The description should include protected or environmentally sensitive areas or ESAs
(national parks, forests, wetland areas, sites of cultural interest), major rivers and
topography.



3 3
These are best illustrated on a map.
4.     Baseline Data
In order to obtain an understanding of the extent of the likely impacts that may result
from a road project, it is essential that some baseline data is provided at this stage.
Information of relevance to road projects and their areas of influence includes:
- geology and soils
-climate and rainfall
- drainage patterns and wetland areas
- land use
- land tenure
- protected areas or sites of special conservation significance
- sites of cultural or historical value
- human population and demographic trends
- livestock population
- local government set up
- major economic activities
- health, education, sanitation services
- public health status.
Much of this information can be obtained from  district environmental action plans.
district development plans, and other such reports. If and when it is set up, a GIS
database within the MOWHC will also be able to provide a lot of this information. This
data will be useful during the EIA study to be conducted later, but also provides a
benchimark against which changes can be measured during monitoring.
5.     Project Components
This covers the basic design details of the road. for example:
- type of road (bitumen, gravel, earth)
- length of existing road
- number and length of new alignments
- length and location of deviations
- number of bridges
- type and number drainage structures
- number of livestock underpasses
- width of carriageway
- width of shoulders
- maximum cut and fill gradients.
In addition, the type of road works activities envisaged during the project must be
described under:
site preparation activities:   eg. clearing   of vegetation for camps, realignments,
deviations; grading. excavation of quarries through
mechanical means or blasting; access routes to
quarries;



34
construction activities:   eg. earthworks, haulage, drilling, production of asphalt.
crushing:
built facilities           eg. conitractor's camp; wvorkmen's camps; plant and
equipment stores;
operations                 eg. occupational safety;  location   and   number  of
workmen's  camps:  amount  of  gravel/hardstone
material required; sources and supply routes of other
material;
closure and restoration    eg. rehabilitation of quarries. camp sites.
At this stage, it is possible that many of the road's design features (such as bridges,
realignments, culvert locations, exact location for camps, etc) may not have been decided
upon. However, much of the information as regards the requirements of the road project
will be contained in the terms of reference for the feasibility study as well as the road
design manuals. Thus adequate information will be available for the purposes of the
brief.
Again. maps would enhance the description of the above components.
6.     Preliminary Analysis of Alternatives
Usually at the very beginning of a proposed road project, it becomes evident whether and
where realignments and deviations are required.
The brief should therefore indicate the location of possible alternatives for realignments
and deviations, the benefits derived from the realignments (economic and social), and the
likely impacts resulting from them.
7.     Othier Projects witihin the Area of Influence
Other development projects that are ongoing or planned for within the area of influence
of the road project may have implications on a road project in terms of traffic volume
(and therefore the life of the road), purpose of the road, road alignment or proposed
realignments, benefits associated with the road, settlements along the road, road safetv,
location of workmen's camps, and environmental impacts associated with these issues.
8.     Summary of Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Based on the above information, a summary should be prepared of anticipated positive
and negative impacts on the physical, natural and socio-cultural environments whichi
would result from the road project as well as mitigation measures that will be
incorporated into the road design to address the negative impacts. Where mitigation
measures cannot be identified at this stage, this should be stated in the brief.
It must be emphasised here that the project brief is NOT a scoping exercise NOR an
environmental impact study. Descriptions should be kept to a minimum and the project brief
should not exceed 20 pages.



35
5.1.4 Suggested Time Frame for Preparation of Project Brief
It should take the officer assigned to this task in the relevant department within RAFU/Road
Agency approximately 7-10 working days to prepare the project brief.
5.1.5 Submission of the Project Brief
For RAFU projects, ten (I10) copies of the project brief are to be submitted to NEMA's Executive
Director, while two (2) copies should be given to the ELU within the MOWHC. For MOWHC
projects, the project brief should be submitted directly to NEMA.
5.2 Screening
5.2.1 Purpose of Screening
Once the project brief has been submitted, the screening process begins. Screening determines
thle extent to which environmental analysis is required. From information provided in the project
briefs, projects can be screened in order to determine screening categories on the basis of the
nature, magnitude and sensitivity of the environmental issues at hand.
Screening has two main benefits:
i)    it allows the identification of major environmental issues at a very early stage, and by so
doing
ii)    it allows the prudent use of financial and human resources bv directing the focus of
environmental analyses on significant, rather than minor, environmental issues.
5.2.2 Responsibility for Screening
Screening should be done by the EU in RAFU in consultation with the ELU within MOWHC.
For MOWHC projects, screening should be done by the ELU. All screening categories to which
projects are allocated should be endorsed by NEMA.
5.2.3 The Screening Process
Using the screening methodology proposed in the NEMA EIA guidelines as a basis, road projects
should be subjected to the screening process shown in Figure 5.2 below.
In order to establish the appropriate screening category, it is important that the project brief
provides sufficient information in order to gain a basic understanding of the proposed project. To
reiterate, the main issues are:
- nature of the project            - project components (ie. types of works, design,
- historical background              proposed realignments, etc)
- area of influence (including     - preliminary analysis of alternatives
location of project)              - other projects in the area of influence
- baseline data                     - summary of anticipated positive and negative
impacts and mitigation/enlhancement measures.

Examples of screening categories for typical road projects and road works activities are given

Projects normally     *  routine maintenance works such as clearing roadside vegetation

Projects for which    *  partial rehabilitation works, such as repaving small sections of

IV          Projects requiring full   *  construction of new roads
environmental analysis  *  all road rehabilitation projects with new alignments
*  all road projects necessitating the displacement of people through
the acquisition of land for easement, for example the upgrading of
urban sections of major trunk roads
*  all road rehabilitation projects passing through environmentally
sensitive areas such as:
- wetlands
- forests
- national parks/protected areas
- areas prone to desertification
- areas prone to erosion (mountainous or steep terrain)
- areas of unique scenery
- areas of scientific. historic or archaeological interest
- areas of cultural. traditional or religious value
- areas of importance to threatened ethnic groups
Other Considerations
On occasion a situation may arise where, for the most part, a road project would not have many
significant impacts, but one small section of the road would cause concern. Such a case is
illustrated by, for example, a 200 km road which is proposed for upgrading, but of wilich 2 km
pass throughi a forest reserve. In this case a limited analysis should be carried out for, say. the
190 km of road which does not fall in the forest reserve or its buffer zone. while for the road
section traversing the forest, a full EIA study should be commissioned. This approach would
serve to save both time and resources.
For projects qualifying under Category IV, screening criteria as described above have to be
developed further to identify "thresholds". As an example, all forest reserves do not necessarilv
have the same value in terms of biodiversity, economic value or locally usable resources. So. the
impact of rehabilitating an existing road through a forest that is regarded as  being largely
degraded. encroached or cultivated by the Forest Department, may not need a full EIA study.
As each sector (forestry. health, water, inland waterways, etc) develops its own environmenital
guidelines, these threshiolds should be defined as part of that process. This will mean that for road
projects that affect any environmentally sensitive area, the ELU  should ask the relevant



38
ministry/departmentJauthority under whose jurisdiction these ESAs lie. to recommend a
screening category.
Thus, the various sub-projects under the components comprising the First Road Sector Project
would fall under the screening categories as shown in Table 5.2 overleaf. It must be noted that at
this stage these screening categories are only indicative since project briefs have not been
prepared for all the individual project components.
5.2.4 Suggested Time Frame for Screening
Provided all the necessary information is given in the project brief, screening of the project
would normally take half a day. If certain critical information is lacking, a specific request will
be made to the engineer/department responsible for the brief to obtain that information.
However, if a substantial amount of information is still required, then the project brief may have
to be returned to the relevant department in RAFU/Road Agency, revised and resubmitted.
The NEMA EIA guidelines allow 2 weeks for the Executive Director, in consultation with the
MOWHC's environmental liaison unit, to make a decision as to whether the road project is
granited conditional or unconditional approval (in which case a Certificate of Approval is issued)
or whether the project requires further environmental assessment.

5.3 Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Reviews
If screening determines that a partial environmental assessment (Category 111) or a full EIA
(Category IV) is required for a particular project. terms of reference need to be developed for
these studies.
For Category IV projects, terms of reference are prepared after scoping because of the amount of
detailed studv required for a full EIA. However for a Category III project, terms of reference can
be drawn up from the information provided in the project brief.
5.3.1 Responsibility for Preparing the Terms of Reference for EIRs
The responsibility for developing terms of reference for environmental impact reviews should lie
with the environmental unit within RAFU/Road Agency. The EU may liaise with the MOWHC.
For MOWHC projects. its ELU will be responsible for drawiig up these terms of reference. The
TORs must then be submitted to NEMA for review.
5.3.2 Contents of TORs for EIRs
Model terms of reference for an EIR/EIA study for a road project are included in Annex III of
this document. These TOR are only indicative and will have to be adapted to suit the particular
road project in question.
In general, the terms of reference for a typical environmental impact review should contain:
i)     Background h7iformation
The terms of reference should in its introduction provide background information pertinent to the
road project. (The project brief could be made available as an appendix).
ii)    Objectives of the EIR
The TOR should state the objectives of the study as being to determine the positive and negative
impacts associated with and resulting from the road project, and to develop appropriate measures
for ensuring mitigation whilst enhancing positive ones.
iii)    Scope of Work
The scope of work for EIRs need not be very elaborate, but thev should indicate:
* that the EIR should identify all negative and positive impacts resulting from the road project
and/or its activities;
. environmental and social issues of particular relevance to the road project that need to be
given special attention by the EIR;
that measures to mitigate negative impacts should be described;
* that interventions to enhance positive impacts should be investigated;
* the need to include the financial implications for mitigation and for enhancement of positive
impacts.



41
iv)    Output and Reportinig
The output of the EIR is a report containing all the findings of the study. The number of copies
of the report that should be submitted to the environmental unit in RAFU/Road Agency, the ELU
and NEMA should be stipulated here.
v)     Team Composition
This would relate to the critical issues as described in the project brief; but as an indication, the
team may comprise a number of specialists from any of the following:
- an environmentalist/EIA specialist             - a socio-economist
- a natural resource specialist                  - an agricultural scientist
- a wetlands specialist                          - a farming systems expert
- a biodiversity specialist                      - a wildlife management specialist
- a hydrologist                                  - an anthropologist
- a soils specialist                             - an urban planner
- a sociologist                                  - etc
The total personnel requirements to conduct the EIR would be in the range of 2.5 personmonths.
again depending on the complexity of the anticipated impacts.
vi)    Time Frame
The TOR should stipulate the number of days within which the EIR should be conducted -
normally over a period of about 20 to 30 days.
5.3.3 Suggested Time Frame for Preparation of Terms of Reference for EIRs
Assuming that most of the background information is contained in the project brief, the terms of
reference for an EIR should take about 2-3 days to prepare.
5.4 Terms of Reference for Scoping
The purpose of scoping is to determine the most critical issues that need to be addressed during
an EIA study.
5.4.1 Responsibility for Preparing TORs for Scoping
The terms of reference for the scoping exercise should be prepared by the environmental unit in
RAFU/Road Agency in consultation with the ELU. For MOWHC projects, the ELU must
prepare TORs for scoping. These TORs should be reviewed by NEMA.



42
5.4.2 Contents of TORs for Scoping
The terms of reference for scoping should cover:
i)     Background Information
The introduction should give background information pertinent to the road project. (Again, the
project brief could be made available as an appendix).
ii)    Objectives of Scoping
The objectives of scoping will be to determine the positive and negative impacts associated with
and resulting from the road project, and to highlight those issues requiring detailed analysis
which should be addressed by the full EIA study.
iii)    Scope of JVork
The requirements of the scoping exercise are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. The scope of work
comprises:
e identifying all potential negative and positive impacts resulting from the road project and/or
its activities;
* prioritising environmental and social issues of particular relevance to the road project that
need to be given special attention by the EIA study;
 consultation with local people to gain a better understanding of the prevailing situation. and in
order to develop appropriate and practical mitigation measures:
 identifving what further information is required in order to conduct a full EIA study
- giving a very brief indication of mitigation measures that should be further developed duritg
the EIA study:
* determining the number and type of specialists that need to be involved in the EIA study. and
personmonth input requirements by each specialist;
- establishing logistical and practical requirements of the EIA study.
iv)    Output and Reporting
The findings of the scoping exercise will be presented in a Scoping Report.
The number of copies of the report that should be submitted to the environmental Ullit in
RAFU/Road Agency, the MOWHC's ELU and NEMA should be stipulated here.
v)     Team Composition
As scoping is a preliminary exercise to determine the most significant components of the EIA
study, the team composition may comprise an EIA specialist and one or two other specialists
from any of the following fields:
- a socio-economiist/sociologist/socio-anthropologist
- a natural resource/biodiversity specialist
- an agriculture expert/agronomist
- a hydrologist
- a soils specialist



43
The total personnel requirements would be approximatelv I personmonths.
vi)    Time Frame
The TOR should stipulate the number of days within which scoping should be carried out. This
would be in the range of 10 to 14 working days.
5.4.3 Suggested Time Frame for Preparation of Terms of Reference for Scoping
Most of the background information required by the TOR for scoping will also be contained in
the project brief. Thus the terms of reference should take about 2-3 days to prepare.
5.5 Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Assessment Studies
Terms of reference for a full EIA study are developed from the scoping report. Their outline is
similar to the TOR for EIRs but the emphasis is on the major adverse impacts and their
mitigation.
5.5.1 Responsibility for Preparing Terms of Reference for ETAs
The terms of reference for the full EIA study should be prepared by the environmental unit in
RAFU/Roads Agency in consultation with the ELU in the Ministry. A firm of consulting
engineers may also be commissioned to do this. For road projects handled by the Ministry, TORs
should be prepared by the ELU. NEMA will review the TORs for completeness and adequacy.
5.5.2 Contents of TORs for ELAs
The contents of the terms of reference are similar to those described above for the EIRs. But as
the scoping exercise will have determined the most pertinent negative and positive impacts, the
focus of the TOR for an EIA study will be on these impacts.
The model terms of reference in Annex III should be used as a guide for preparing TOR for EIA
studies. Certain aspects in the model TOR will have to be emphasised or expanded depending on
the characteristics of the road project and the type of environmental issues that will cause
concern. A general outline of the requirements of the TOR are presented below:
i)    Background Information
The introduction to the TOR should give sufficient background information relating to the road
project. It must also state the major negative impacts as established during scoping, and indicate
which of these impacts require special examination. The scoping report itself may be appended.
ii)   Objectives of the EIA Study
The objectives of the EIA study would be to investigate in detail the positive and negative
impacts associated with and resulting from the road project as identified during the scoping
exercise, and to develop appropriate measures for ensuring mitigation whilst enhancing positive
ones where possible.



44
iii)    Scope of TWork
The EIA studv would necessitate a verv detailed examination of both positive and negative
impacts. The study would have to:
* examine all significant negative and positive impacts resulting from the road project and/or its
activities, particularly those regarded as having severe consequences on the social, natural or
physical environment;
* assess alternative options for the road project (including the "do nothing" option),
* describe in detail all mitigation measures, and their financial implications:
* develop mechanisms to enhance positive impacts and cost them:
* draw up a detailed mitigation plan for the incorporation and implementation of mitigation
measures, as well as for inclusion of mechanisms to enhance positive impacts:
. prepare a comprehensive plan to monitor the efficacy of the proposed mitigation measures
and to measure changes in environmental and social quality.
iv)    Output and Reporting
The output of an EIA study is presented in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) wlicih
contains the findings and recommendations of the EIA study. Details of the contents of the EIS
are presented in Chapter 6.
The TOR should state here the number of copies of the EIS report that should be submitted to the
environmental unit in RAFU/Road Agency, the ELU in the MOWHC and NEMA.
v)     Team Composition
The team composition for the EIA studv would relate to the critical issues as described il the
scopiig report. The report would also indicate the number and type of specialists required to
carrv out the EIA study. Again. these mav include any of the following:
- an environmentalist/ElA specialist       - a socio-economist
- a natural resource specialist            - an agricultural scientist/agronomist
- a wetlands specialist                    - a farming systems expert
- a biodiversity specialist                - a wildlife management specialist
- a hydrologist                            - an anthropologist
- a soils specialist                       - an urban/physical planner
- a sociologist                            - a forester
- a resettlement expert                    - etc
As EIA studies involve intensive investigations, the personnel requirements vary greatly,
depending entirely on the magnitude, nature and significance of the anticipated impacts.
vi)    Time Frame
The scoping study would give an indication of the length of the study. This again would depend
on the critical issues at hand. If, for example the road project was to impact on a small forest
reserve that has been largely encroached or degraded, the EIA study may take about 4 months to
complete. assuming no other potentially significant adverse impacts were identified. However, if
the project were to involve a realignment, where land must be relinquished for the new route,
then a very detailed compensation and relocation plan may have to be drawn up, whicil in itself
could take anything from 6 to 12 months.

5.6 Review of Environmental Impact Reviews and Assessments
5.6.1 Purpose of Reviewing EIRs and ELAs
An environmental impact review (EIR) is a limited analysis of the environmental implications of
a project, and its findings are contained in an EIR Report. An environmental impact statement
(EIS) presents the findings of a full environmental impact assessment study.
Both EIRs and ElSs must be reviewed in order to ensure that the studies comply with the terms
of reference, that the projects are socially and environmentally acceptable, and that the financial
implications of incorporating mitigation measures into the projects have been suitably addressed.
On the basis of the reviews, the decision is made as to whether projects are approved withl OT
without specified conditions, or whether projects are rejected altogether.
5.6.2 Responsibilitv for Reviewing EIRs and EIAs
EIR Reports should be reviewed by the EU in RAFU/Road Agency together with the
environmental liaison unit in the MOWHC. EIR Reports for road projects under the MOWHC
must be reviewed by the ELU. On the other hand, NEMA may opt to nominate a review team.
All review recommendations must be forwarded to NEMA, with whom the final responsibility
for endorsement or rejection lies.
ElSs, on the other hand should be reviewed by a panel of experts which may comprise any of the
following, depending on the critical environmental or social issues at hand:
- a roads engineer                       - a socio-economist
- an EIA specialist                      - a sociologist/social anthropologist
- an ecologist/wetlands ecologist        - a wildlife specialist
- an hydrologist                         - a soils specialist
- an urban planner                       - a land valuer
- an agronomist/agricultural scientist   - a farming systems expert
- a natural resource specialist          - a biodiversity specialist
- a wetlands specialist                  - etc.
RAFU's environmental unit (or in the case of MOWHC projects, the ELU) should be responsible
for convening the panel. and for receiving views and comments, but will be assisted by NEMA.
Depending on the decision that is reached with regard to the EIS, NEMA issues a Certificate of
Approval or rejects the project. The action is noted in a Record of Decision which is prepared by
NEMA.



46
5.6.3 Reviewing EIRs and EIAs
The processes for reviewing both EIRs and ElAs essentially follow the same steps. As a
guideline. the following should be considered during the review:
General/Procedural Issues
=> the terms of reference have been fully satisfied
=> the report complies with NEMA and sectoral guidelines
=> there are no contradictions in the report
=> the report is easily read and understood by NEMA, MOWHC, RAFU/Road Agency and
stakeholders
Impact Identification
> all kev environmental issues have been addressed
=> all significant negative and positive impacts have been clearly stated
= impacts on any environmentally sensitive areas have been defined
=: risks arising from the project have been evaluated
=> indirect, off-site, trans-boundary and cumulative impacts have been addressed
> long term and permanent impacts have been identified
> local communities have been involved in identifying impacts
Miti2ation and Support Measures
z impacts of design alternatives (eg. for new alignments and realignments. location of bridges)
have been properly discussed
mitigation measures for adverse impacts have been adequately developed
adequate consideration has been given to compensation such as loss of land, housing, crops
and for resettlement
= significant adverse impacts that cannot be avoided or mitigated have been described
=> support measures to enhance positive impacts have been properly developed
=> experiences from similar projects carried out in the past have been taken into account
=' local communities have been involved in developing mitigation and support measures
z> mitigation and support measures are technically and scientifically sound
=> mitigation and support measures have been included into the financial/economic analysis
lmplementation and Monitoring
=> institutional, financial and personnel resources are in place to implement recommended
mitigation and support measures
the environmental monitoring plan is described in sufficient detail to enable immediate
execution
=> the study specifies who will be responsible for monitoring
If impacts and their proposed mitigation have not been satisfactorily discussed in an EIR. theni
the EU/ELU or NEMA may return the report for inclusion/augmentationi of issues that are
lacking or not satisfactorily addressed. If, during the EIR review, it becomes apparent that some
environmental issues will have significant consequences, then the EU/ELU or NEMA may find
in necessary to commission a full EIA study.



47
5.6.4 Suggested Time Frame for Review of EIRs and EISs
For EIRs, the review process by the EU or ELU should take approximatelv one week, while
NEMA may be expected to take approximately three weeks.
The process for reviewing ElSs is expected to take in the order of three weeks.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES FOR PRACTITIONERS
This section intends to guide practitioners in conducting environmental impact reviews and
environmental impact assessments. It begins by! reiterating the definitions of an EIR and an EIA
and goes on to systematically define each assessment process.
During an EIR and EIA, it is equally important to highlight the benefits derived from the projects
as it is the adverse impacts. Therefore whilst developing mitigation measures for negative
impacts, consideration must also be given to enhance positive ones.
It should be noted that throughout the EIA process. involvement by local communities is
essential because
* they have a sound knowledge of their local environment and will therefore be able to assist HI
impact identification, determination of causes and developing appropriate mitigation
measures
* they will be most affected by any road project or road works activities
* they will be more interested in participating in the maintenance of roads or the road network if
they have been involved in the planning, design and construction stages.
Chapter 11 presents guidelines on public consultation during the EIA process.
6.1 Responsibilitv for Conducting EIRs and EIAs
EIRs and ElAs are normally conducted by the consulting engineers who are awarded the contract
to carry out the feasibilitv study, preliminary and detailed engineering designs.
6.2 Environmental Impact Review
An environmental impact review is a partial or limited environmental analysis which is required
to be undertaken for all Category III projects. ie. those which mav have some significant adverse
impacts.
The basic steps of an EIR are described below.
6.2.1 Baseline Study
The first step of an EIR is to gather baseline data to facilitate the identification of impacts, and to
be able to prepare a monitoring plan (see Chapter 9).
Much of the baseline data will be provided in the project brief. However. at this stage any gaps
in information are identified and collected.



49
6.2.2 Identification of Impacts
An EIR identifies potential positive and negative impacts caused by the road project and road
works activities. Typical impacts resulting from roads projects have been described in detail in
Chapter 2 of this report; but for the sake of clarification of the focus of the EIR, the major issues
can be grouped as follows:
* impacts on the physical environment (eg. soils/erosion, water quality)
* impacts on the biological or natural environment (eg. wetlands, national parks, forests)
* impacts on production systems (eg. land use, agriculture. livestock)
* impacts on the human environment (socio-cultural and socio-economic aspects such as public
health. loss of land, settlement patterns, income, gender)
In order assist in identifying all the types of impacts that may arise from a project, a checklist has
been developed which highlights typical issues that need to be considered. It must be noted that
each road project will have impacts that are peculiar to that road, and hence issues may emerge
that are not covered by the checklist. This checklist is presented in the following pages.
Checklists serve to summarise potential impacts and provide a simple and visual tool for
conducting an assessment. They also indicate the magnitude and significance of the impacts.
Often an activity will have more than one direct impact. the causes of which are related. For
example, excavation of quarries can lead to dust emissions, noise. degradation of land and
erosion. Also, one impact can lead to another or a series of other impacts (indirect impacts): dust
emissions from  quarries may lead to respiratory problems which may result in decreased
productivity and reduced incomes if the affected persons cannot work as a result of being
indisposed. Sometimes a number of impacts may affect one environmental parameter; water
quality of a stream may be affected by soil erosion, seepage from pit latrines at the workmen's
camp, and/or oil spills during maintenance or operation of construction machinery.
Initial mitigation measures should also be indicated in the checklist, which can be reviewed and
developed as appropriate during the subsequent stages of analysis.
In the checklist, the column for linkages should be used to indicate relationships between the
various environmental parameters and their impacts. Thus, linkages between impacts contributes
to determining the extent of impacts and their complexity. Using the example relating to water
quality above as an illustration, the links would be I b, 2a, Sa, I I a/b, and 22c.
Any other observations made during the site visits and discussions may be noted in the last
column of the checklist.
6.2.3 Developing Mitigation Measures
Once the impacts have been identified, it is worth going back to the causes of the impacts
because for mitigation to be sustainable, mitigation measures should be developed to address the
causes of impacts. In other words, it is more effective to treat the cause than the symptom.
Again, linkages assist in the developing of mitigation measures because they indicate the extent
to which mitigation is required.

With regard to road works activities, causes of inpacts may include methods of excavation.
practices emploved while crushinig stone or metilods of acquiring rights of wav (ROWs) or land
for the road reserve.
Mitigation measures can vary in complexity depending on the problem. To address the question
of safety around a hardstone quarry, planned access. adequate fencing of the quarry area and an
entry gate may suffice. If a road traverses an area where there is considerable movement of
livestock (eg. along the Kafu-Masindi Road), the road design may have to incorporate livestock
crossings at strategic locations. This could affect the road alignment, or bridae/culvert design.
and would have implications on the overall cost of the road.
During the design and implementation phases of a road project, mitigation measures would
consider anticipated impacts, whereas during the operation and maintenance phases, mitigation
would have to deal with impacts that may have already occurred or are likely to occur.
Many mitigation measures (eg. rehabilitation of quarries and borrow pits, workmein's safety,
protection of water sources ) are stipulated in the MOWHC's General Specification for Road anid
Bridge Works, Road Design Manual and Maintenance Manual. Relevant clauses are listed in
Annex IV, while Chapter 6 of Voiume IV of this report describes environmental provisions in
MOWHC  documentation. However, the challenge is to ensure that these measures are
implemented during the road design, construction and maintenance stages. By including specific
mitigation measures as explicit items in the tender/contract documents, so that they are included
in the Bills of Quantities (BOQ), the contractor is obliged to incorporate the measures, while the
Resident Engineer is then bound to ensure that thev implemented satisfactorilv.
Two strategyies are considered for incorporating mitigation measures into Bills of Quantities. The
first is to inform the Contractor, in the tender document to bidders. to absorb the mitigation
implementation costs into their rates quoted in the BOQ. As an example. the Contractor is
instructed to include the cost of work camp and labour camp operation and area restoration/cleani
up within his labour rates. The limitation to this strategy is that the Contractor, in an attempt to
remain competitive. may not include realistic fee levels to adequately fund environimiental
mitigation and management costs.
A second strategy may therefore be more adequate whereby the Contractor is mandated to
employ a more explicit accounting system for the required environmental mitigation costs. Under
this strategy, a line item is presented in the BOQ explicitly describing the various environmental
management and mitigation costs. As an example the budget line could be included to show costs
related to restoration and renovation of all quarrv sites and borrow areas in accordance with
mitigation measures as specified in the MOWHC's Environmental Management Guidelines. The
tender document to the bidding Contractors should specify that the Consultant would have to
prepare technical specifications and budgets for the main environmental management/mitigatioll
costs as identified in the Environmental Management Plan and the EIS (for instance for
environmental management and restoration of quarry sites/borrow areas/work camps. items
would include the safe disposal of xx m3 of spoil and excess material: the planting and
maintenanlce of xx m2 of specified vegetation, etc).
This latter strategy would make environmental mitigation costs more visible and accountable.
and would ensure that realistic environmental compliance costs have been budgeted for.

6.2.4 Identifying Opportunities from Positive Impacts
Studies on the environmental impacts of road projects tend to focus mostly on the negative
impacts that mav arise. However, the fundamental purpose for improving or rehabilitating a road
is to stimulate development of the country as a whole, thus benefiting the communities resident
along it and within its area of influence.
If a road provides better access to a village, it could facilitate the establishment of administrative
or infrastructure services at the village. It would allow agricultural extension workers to reach
more peopie, and consequently contribute to the protection of the catchment area. This may also
benefit the road in the long run, through reducing runoff volumes and speeds.
Although the EIR would be able to identify positive impacts, and means for enhlancing them,
support measures for promoting positive impacts would have to be undertaken jointly by the
MOWHC/RAFU and another agency (eg. Ministry of Agriculture, or NGOs involved in
agricultural extension, etc). However, the onus for initiating such mitigation measures would be
primarily on the other agency as the intervention is likely to be within their ministerial/
departmental/organisational mandate.
6.2.5 Environmental Management Plan
The basic elements of an environmental management plan are a mitigation plan and a monitoring
plan. When the mitigation measures have been established. a plan must be drawn up indicatiig
where each measure is to be incorporated in the design, when it should be implemented, who will
be responsible for implementing it. and where funds for mitigation may be sourced.
Mitigation measures must be monitored to ensure that they are appropriate, functional and
successful. In the event that they are not, other mitigation measures may have to be developed.
Similarly, the physical, natural and social environment influenced by the road project has to be
monitored to ensure that the road causes no adverse impacts. and to determine whether the
mitigation measures that have been implemented have contributed to environmental protection.
Environmental monitoring is discussed in Chapter 9.
6.2.6 EIR Report
The findings of the EIR study and recommendations for mitigation are contained in an EIR
Report. The report would generally comprise:
an executive summary
a description of the road project and its area of influence
a description of all positive and negative impacts that are anticipated
recommendations for mitigation measures
costs for incorporating mitigation measures
a plan for implementation of mitigation measures
. a conclusion indicating the whether the road project is environmentally and socially
acceptable, and conditions for attaining this acceptability.



55
6.2.7 Local Involvement
Involvement by the local communities living in and around the area of influence of the road
project in the identificationi of impacts is essential. The local people often have a very sound
understanding of the characteristics of the environment, such as tendencies for rivers to change
course, vulnerability of the soil to erosion, sites of cultural or traditional interest, or plant or
animal species of particular value to the community that may be depleted/destroyed by tile road
project (whether during construction or operation).
Similarly, local communities are wvell placed to develop mitigation measures, since they will be
affected most by the construction, rehabilitation or improvement of the road. Thus they would be
able to determine in advance whethier or not the mitigation measures that have been developed
will be feasible and practical.
Finally, involving the local people from the very beginning of the road project will impart a sense
of ownership of the road amongst them. This will serve to enhance road maintenance while
reducing vandalism.
Guidelines for public consultation are provided in Chapter 11.
6.3 Environmental Impact Assessment
An enivironmental impact assessment study is necessary where it is certain that there will be
significant detrimental consequences resulting from a road project, ie. all projects that fall into
Category IV. Thus an EIA study constitutes a much more in-depth study to establish the exact
nature and magnitude of both positive and negative impacts.
An environmental impact assessment study comprises the following steps:
-      scoping
-      baseline study
-      description of the positive and negative impacts
-      analysis of alternatives
-      detailed descriptions of mitigation measures and their costs
-      preparation of an environmental management plan, ie. mitigation and monitoring plans
-      environmental impact statement.
6.3.1 Scoping
The project brief and the screening process will give an initial indication of the prevalent and
likely environmental impacts. Scoping is essentially a quick initial assessment of the magnitude
and implications of the positive and negative impacts that have been identified as being
significant. Its main purpose is to focus the direction of the full EIA study on these impacts.
Thus scoping forms the basis for drawing up the terms of reference for the EIA study, ie. it
assists in planning the ELA study.



56
The scoping exercise will determine:
*  the major issues, impacts and considerations involved in. or that need to be addressed by. the
EIA study;
*  how these issues should be addressed bv the EIA study:
* the methodology for public participation in the EIA study;
* the availability, type and quality of data required for the EIA study:
* the number and type of specialists that will need to be involved in the EIA study:
* where expertise to deal with all the pertinent environmental issues can be sourced (in-country
or foreign);
* the amount of person months required to satisfactorily carry out the EIA study;
* the logistical and practical arrangements that need to be in place for the study to achieve its
purpose.
6.3.2 Baseline Study
As for an EIR, a baseline study is also required for an EIA. Again a lot of information can be
obtained from the project brief, GIS databases. district environmental reports, etc. However.
baseline data for an EIA has to be much more comprehensive since specific issues are to be
studied in detail. Gaps in information should be identified, and if possible investigations
conducted to obtain the necessary information. This may necessitate surveys. field visits and
research.
6.3.3 Description of Impacts
The project brief and the scoping exercise will have identified the most significant positive and
negative impacts. Here, a very detailed description of these impacts is required, specifying
direct, indirect, cumulative, short term and long term consequences on the physical, natural
(biological) and socio-cultural/socio-economic (human) environments.
6.3.4 Analysis of Alternatives
A road project requires a number of decisions to be made regarding possible and available
alternatives. These decisions centre around, for example, choices for realignments where these
are deemed necessary, sites for workmen's camps,  selection of quarries or borrow  pits,
identification of access routes to quarries, etc. By far the most important of these would be the
case where a realignment or alternative route has been proposed instead of the existing
alignment, since a realignment is in fact a new road construction.
The EIA study must consider all such alternatives where they arise. The analysis of alternatives
should indicate the preferred or least impact alternative, in environmental and social terms.
6.3.5 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures have to be developed for all adverse impacts. This has been covered under
Section 6.2.3 above. However in addition to formulating mitigation measures for all levels of
impacts, the EIA study should focus and refine those measures which address impacts having
very serious environmental or social consequences. Such measures would include, for example,



57
compensation and resettlement plans. reviewing or modifying hydrological aspects of the road
design to allow unimpeded flow of Nvater in wetland areas, or workiin(g procedures for
improvement works within protected areas.
Again, involvement by the local communities in developing and determining appropriate
mitigation measures is essential.
Provision for environmental protection are mentioned in various MOWHC's specifications (see
Annex IV, and Chapter 6 in Volume IV), but it is essential that they are implemented during the
design, construction and maintenance stages. They must therefore be included in the Contract
Documents and Bills of Quantities as distinct items, so that contractors and Resident Engineers
are responsible for their implementation.
6.3.6 Identifving Opportunities from Positive Impacts
As with EIRs, it is important that the EIA study should also address positive impacts that mav
arise from the road project, particularly because the overall perception of the positive impacts
from road studies is increased income and improved national productivitv. The involvement of
local communities is therefore essential in developing ways to enhance positive impacts.
The study must therefore look into ways and means to enhance these positive impacts. along the
lines described in Section 6.2.4 above.
6.3.7 Environmental Management Plan
Environmental management plans that are developed during EIA studies must contain sufficient
detail to enable the proper implementation of mitigation measures during construction, to allow
the evaluation of impacts that arise as a result of a road project, to enable the prediction of
impacts that were not anticipated during the EIA study, and to be able to assess the success of the
mitigation measures that were initially recommended. Given that EIA studies are necessary onlv
when very significant impacts are anticipated, these plans have to be very specific indeed.
A mitigation plan must indicate responsibility (during construction, during the defects liability
period and when the road is operational), schedules and methods for implementation of
mitigation measures, and sources of funds.  It may recommend site supervision by an
environmentalist during the installation of certain interventions.
Monitoring plans are put in place to ensure that the proposed mitigation measures are successful,
so that in the event that they are not effectual or cause secondary impacts in themselves, others
may be developed to replace existing mitigation structures. Monitoring methods must be
compatible with existing or proposed systems for monitoring environmental and social
indicators.
Environmental monitoring and auditing form Chapter 9 of these guidelines.

7. THE EIA PROCESS FOR RAFU PROJECTS
7.1 Preamble
In Chapters 5 and 6, NEMA's EIA process has been translated so that it can be applied to road
sector activities in the MOWHC as well as in RAFU and its proposed successor, the Road
Agency.
However. there are a number of issues that arise from those procedures which would delay the
normal implementation of road projects. These issues relate primarily to the process of review
and approval (of. for example, screening category, terms of reference, scoping reports. etc) by
NEMA. Of critical importance is the fact that the NEMA EIA Coordination Unit is mandated to
deal with ElAs for all sectors (agriculture, power, industry, water, tourism, etc) and this unit is at
present staffed by only two officers. It is therefore likely that the EIA Coordination Unit will be
swamped with ElAs and will be unable to give a timely response to specific aspects in the EIA
process where it is required to provide feedback, comments or a decision. In the event that
NEMA does not respond within the stipulated time frame (ie. 14 days), then RAFU/RA should
consider this as approval.
NEMA realises its predicament and is therefore keen to build capacity within the various sectors
so that it will eventually delegate (through Statutory Instruments) its authoritv to environmental
units within the sectoral ministries/departments. In this way NEMA will gradualIy become
purely a coordinating and supervisory body. The establishment of sectoral environmental units
and delegating authority to these units are provided for in the Nationzal Environmeiit Action Plan
(June 1995).
Another consideration is that the MOWHC road project cycle in practice does not include some
of the steps described in Chapter 4 of this document (see Figure 7.1). Crucially it does not
include a pre-feasibilitv stage, when ideally scoping and the preparation of terms of reference for
the EIA study are to be done. The feasibility study, detailed design and preparation of contract
documents are contracted out as a package, and are therefore undertaken by the same firn of
consulting engineers.
Finally. RAFU and the future Road Agency will be concerned with road projects costing US$
250,000 or more. These projects will all involve major road rehabilitation or road works, and
therefore automatically require partial or full ElAs as they will fall into either Screening
Category III or IV, as described in Section 5.2. Further, it is expected that the environmental unit
within RAFU will be staffed by a competent person with experience and qualifications in
environmental management.
The modifications proposed in this chapter are intended to streamline the EIA process for road
projects under RAFU. so that delays in implementation are avoided and a road project can
proceed as it would do normally. Consequently. the inclusion of the EIA process into the project
cycle of a road will not be regarded as a hindrance, but rather as a contributing element to the
design and construction of the road.

7.2 Recommended Procedures for Road Projects reguiring EIRs or ElAs
The typical steps in tlhe EIA process for road projects are as follows:
i.     preparation of the project brief
11.    screening
iii.    scoping
iv.    preparation of TOR for the EIA study
v.     review of TOR
vi.    EIA study
vii.   preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement
viii.   review of the EIS
ix.    approval of the EIS
x.     project proceeds with implementation of mitigation measures
In order to be accommodated into the road project planning cycle, it is proposed that the first
four steps are carried out simultaneously, as opposed to sequentially. In this way. when the TOR
for the feasibility study are prepared, the TOR for the EIA study can be incorporated into it at tihe
same time in a practical manner. But if scoping and the preparation of the TOR for the EIA
study were to be done while the procurement of consultancy services is ongoing, there will be a
delay in the procurement process until the scoping is finalised and the TOR for tile EIA are
prepared.
Figure 7.1 compares the MOWHC road project cycle with the proposed EIA process. Table 7.1
further elaborates where in the MOWHC's road project cvcle each step in the EIA process as
described in Chapters 5 and 6 should be undertaken, and by whom.

From Table 7.1. it is seen that no step in NEMA's EIA process has been omitted. Instead the first
four tasks have been grouped together to be carried out simultaneously, while the allocation of
remains unaitered, in that screening, scoping and the preparation of the terms of reference for the
environmental study are to be done by the environmental unit in RAFU/Road Agency. This does
not in any way compromise the quality of the EIA process as the ELU will be consulted
throughout the process, and NEMA will review project briefs, screening recommendations,
TORs for scoping/EIRs/EIA studies and scoping/EIR Reports/EISs for adequacy and compliance.

8. GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS DURING ROAD
MAINTENANCE
The road maintenance stage of a road project occurs after the road project is complete, that is
after construction or improvement works. Environmental assessments during road maintenance
would not usually entail partial or full EIAs, unless impacts of a very serious nature become
apparent after the defects liability period, eg. such as the destruction of a rain forest, or shrinking
of a wetland area of conservation value. In general, however, most activities carried out during
maintenance have minor and mitigable environmental impacts. Chapter 2 of this document
summarises environmental and social impacts that arise from road maintenance activities, while
a detailed description of impacts is presented in Annex II.
During maintenance, district engineers, road inspectors and overseers need to be able to identify
impacts that are occurring and impacts that are likely to occur. These impacts may not have been
previously anticipated, or they may have come about as a result of normal road use. Such
impacts could include soil erosion, gully formation or flooding of low lying areas, etc.
The guidelines in this chapter are intended for those persons involved in planning and
undertaking road maintenance to help them identify opportunities for incorporating
environmental management issues during road maintenance. In addition, thev aim to direct
district engineers, road inspectors and overseers in the identification and management of
environmental impacts during routine and periodic maintenance.
The MOWTC (draft) Maintenance Manual (1998) dedicates a chapter to environmental issues.
The Manual covers issues such as institutional aspects (including contractual relations and
clauses) and technical aspects covering water management, soil conservation, maintaining
vegetation, passage through villages and borrow pit reinstatement. The manual is still in its draft
stage and certain sections within this chapter will no doubt be elaborated and enhaniced.
Nevertheless, the presence of a chapter on environmental issues in the Manual indicates that
there is an appreciation within the MOWHC of the need for environmental management to be
incorporated into road maintenance activities. In addition, that chapter provides a foundation for
the use of these guidelines.
Studies in other parts of East Africa have demonstrated that the inclusion of environmental
protection measures in road design has led to substantial savings in maintenance costs in the long
term. In addition, it was found that the need for periodic maintenance on such roads is reduced.
8.1 Responsibilitv for Environmental Management during Maintenance
The responsibility for incorporating environmental considerations lies wAith whoever is
responsible for maintaining that particular road, ie. the district engineers, and the Maintenance
Sections within the MOWHC and RAFU/Road Agency.
At district level, road inspectors and overseers are usually the main persons involved in
maintenance works, and therefore they must also be involved in the identification of
environmental and social impacts, and the implementation and monitoring of environmental
mitigation measures.



66
8.2 Purpose of Environmental Management in Road Maintenance
Environmental management during road maintenance assists in:
*  monitoring off- and on-road conditions to ensure that there are no environmental
consequences caused by the road or road-related activities;
.  ensuring that measures for environmental protection and mitigation are functioning
satisfactorily;
* identifying impacts that were not foreseen during the EIA study;
* allowing timely action to be taken to prevent or minimise adverse impacts.
The process of including environmental considerations during maintenance is, in effect, part of
environmental monitoring which is described in the following chapter.
8.3 Methodoloev for Environmental Management during Maintenance
The basic components of an environmental assessment involve:
- identifying positive and negative impacts
- determining the causes of adverse impacts
- developing recommendations for mitigation or prevention of adverse impacts
- implementing mitigation/prevention measures.
In order to ensure environmental managemenit in road maintenance activities, these componenits
need to be incorporated into the district road planning process. This can be done by breaking the
assessment of impacts into the following stages:
i)     Problem identification and determination of causes
ii)    Development of protection/mitigation measures
iii)    Preparation of annual budget to include proposed mitigation measures
iv)    Preparation of annual work programme
v')    lmplementation of protection/mitigation measures.
8.3.1 Identification of Problems and Causes
At this stage, the district engineers must consult with the road inspectors and overseers, the local
communities and other organisations (environmental or developmental NGOs, community based
organisations) that may be able to assist in the identification of problems.
Problem identification should be undertaken as part of the biannual assessment for maintenance
needs, which are done through condition surveys. Condition surveys entail driving very slowly
for a fixed distance along a road, while noting the condition of relevant features. Survey forms
are used to evaluate the condition of the various road features such as drainage, shoulders,
embankments, carriageway, etc. The condition of each road feature is denoted by a method of
ranking.
The standard condition survey forms should be modified to include measures to minimise or
eliminate environmental problems observed along the road. Environmental aspects to be included
in these condition survey forms are presented in the following page.

68
In the survey forms, each of the itemised road conditions must be ranked into the following three
categories:
Category 2:   Road conditions are satisfactory (Good) and no action should be taken.
Category 1:   There are problems with the road conditions (Fair), but do not require urgent
attention. Planning of the necessary mitigation works should start.
Category 0:   There are major problems with the road conditions (Poor or Bad). Mitigation
action to be taken immediately.
During the condition survey, the surveyor should also look out for any impacts that do not appear
on the survey form. Also during the survey, attempts must be made to identify the causes of
apparent problems.
Initial mitigation actions may be noted on the form, together with the person or organisation
responsible for the mitigation action. If collaboration is required with other agencies, or if the
problem lies within the jurisdiction of another agency, then this must be recorded on the form.
A list of environmental issues of concern should then be drawn up. and these issues should be
prioritised in terms of urgency, severity, available budgets, whether the problems and their
solutions are confined to the road reserve or affect off-road areas, and the need for collaboration
with other departments/organisations (eg. District Environmental Officers, Local Environment
Committees, Forest Department, National Wetlands Conservation and Management Programme.
Department of Gender and Cultural Affairs, etc).
8.3.2 Development of Protection/Mitigation Measures
Once evident and potential impacts have been identified and their causes determined, appropriate
mitigation measures, or means to prevent impacts altogether. can be developed.
This must also be done by the district engineers in consultation with road inspectors and
overseers, other relevant specialist organisations and the local communities.
Thereafter these measures should be assessed for their technical and economic viability, so that
they can be prioritised and included in the annual maintenance budgets. If the measures appear
unreasonably expensive, alternative mitigation measures may have to be developed.
However, if the impacts are of an urgent and serious nature, then mitigation costs may have to be
covered by emergency funds or through contributions by other agencies.
8.3.3 Budgeting for Environmental Management during Maintenance
Budgeting for maintenance is done as part of the normal cycle for road sector maintenance
activities.  Budgets have to be completed by April each year for inclusion into the following
year's budget.



69
The types of environmental management activities that will need to be undertaken in the
following year will be determined through the condition surveys and other monitoring
mechanisms that are put in place by the ELU in the MOWHC and/or the environmental unit in
RAFU/Road Agency. The costs for environmental management activities can therefore be
calculated, and subsequently included in the annual road maintenance budgets as separate items.
Using experience from elsewhere in Africa as a guideline, environmental management activities
cost in the region of 2 to 5% of the annual district road maintenance budgets.
8.3.4 Work Programme
The proposed environmental protection/mitigation measures should be included in the annual
work programme for each district, and should specify a schedule for implementation of these
measures, depending on the available budget and the flow of funds.
8.3.5 Implementation of Mitigation/Protection Measures
While maintenance works are being carried out, care must be taken to adhere to environmental
protection clauses stipulated in the MOWHC's General Specification, particularly in terms of
location of workmen's camps, rehabilitation of quarries and borrow pits, clearing vegetation,
conduct, etc. The maintenance contract should therefore make special reference to these clauses
(refer Annex IV).
8.4 Local Involvement in Road Maintenance
The involvement of local communities in the identification of environmental/social problems and
causes of these problems, and in developing mitigation measures has been mentioned in Sections
8.3.1 and 8.3.2 above. Involving local communities in road maintenance has several benefits:
local people can assist in identifying environmental and social impacts that are not obvious
it promotes awareness in the importance of environmental protection in road maintenance
local people develop a sense of ownership of the road
it facilitates the recruitment of labour, especially for labour-based road works.
Thus it is essential that they are participate fully from the planning, through implementation to
maintenance stages. RAFU/RA could play a catalytic role in involving these communities in
their road projects.
8.5 Inter-Aaencv Co-oneration
In identifying actions for mitigation for certain impacts it will be necessary to coordinate with
other government agencies, including the District Environment Offices, Local Environment
Committees, NGOs or community based organisations (church groups, women's groups).
Frequently, these mitigation measures are actually the responsibility of other relevant agencies,
rather than the MOWHC or RAFU/Road Agency. For example, problems associated with forests
(forest fires, timber harvesting) must be tackled by the Forest Department. Traffic police are
required to manage traffic so as to reduce the number of road accidents. The Uganda Wildlife
Authority is responsible for seeing that wildlife is not endangered by vehicles on roads traversing



70
tlhroughi national parks. These agencies/organisations would therefore have to bear the brunt of
mitigation costs.
Nevertheless, because these impacts are induced by roads or road work activities, the MOWHC
and RAFU/Road Agency should take the initiative in implementing mitigation by organising
meetings, paying for all or part of the mitigation costs, and seeking expertise from the relevant
organisations.  On the other hand, these organisations may have budgets available for
environmental protection, but mav not have the capability to execute the desired mitigation
measures.



71
9. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, EVALUATION AND AUDITING
9.1 Environmental Monitorinis
Monitoring is defined as the continuous and systematic collection of data in order to assess
whethier the environmental objectives of a road project have been achieved.
Environmental monitoring has the following purposes:
* it provides information on the characteristics of an impact, in terms of magnitude.
significance, extent, persistence and probability of occurrence;
* it enables changes in the natural, physical and social environment to be measured;
* it ensures that the mitigation measures proposed in the Environmental Management Plans are
implemented satisfactorily.
9.1.1 Monitoring Road Works
Monitoring must be done regularly for all road projects. It should be done at three levels:
I .    during the construction phase
2.    during the defects liability period
3.    as part of maintenance of roads and the road network
During the construction phase, road works activities should be monitored by the Resident
Engineer and the Contractor, in order that these activities do not cause unnecessary damage or
disturbance. Where the road works are taking place in environmentally sensitive areas, such as
national parks or forest reserves, then the Resident Engineer's staff may include an
Environmental Officer to ensure that construction practices are environmentally and socially
acceptable.
During the defects liability period, the responsibility for monitoring lies with the Resident
Engineer.  The Engineer should be assisted by an Environmentalist, and therefore allowance
must be made in the contract documents for an environmental input during this period.
Monitoring is very much part of the maintenance management system, and is done by means of
condition surveys (biannually) and road inventories (once in 5 years, or more frequently if
deemed necessary). Environmental monitoring should be included into this system by devising
environmental monitoring forms specific to a particular road, or for the road network within a
district. Depending on the nature of the anticipated impacts, monitoring may have to be carried
out at shorter intervals. These forms should be completed by the district engineers when they are
conducting their condition surveys and inventories, and submitted to the respective
environmental units and district environmental officers for review and analysis.
9.1.2 Indicators for Environmental Monitoring
In order to monitor improvement, regression, benefits and disadvantages, indicators must be
identified. These indicators must have direct relevance to the performance target. An example
of a performance target is the prevention of erosion, and so the objective of introducing
mitigation measures is to ensure that erosion is avoided or minimised.



72
In these guidelines it is not possible to identify indicators that apply to all roads, as different
roads will have different conditions and distinct environmental issues of concern which will
require monitoring.  However, for the purposes of illustration, examples of environmental
indicators for road projects are provided in Table 9.1 below.

73
9.1.3 Data Collection
Data collection is the basis for monitoring and evaluation.  It is therefore important that
appropriate methods for data collection are specified. As more and more data is collected, it is
equally important that all data is stored in an organised and easily retrievable manner. In order to
collect data efficiently, the following must be taken into consideration:
* data must be specific
* it must be reliable (good quality)
* it must be compatible with other data that has been obtained during the baseline survey in the
EIA study
* data collection must be cost-effective
* collection methods must be consistent
* data must be properly collated, stored and managed
* data must be made available to other agencies upon request.
9.1.4 Monitoring Plan
Each road project should have its own monitoring plan. This essentially defines a procedure for
monitoring. In developing a monitoring plan, a number of issues need to be stipulated:
* the objectives of monitoring
* the purpose of the mitigation intervention(s)
e indicators that need be monitored
* a schedule for monitoring
* monitoring methods to be employed
* how data that is gathered will be used
- how the public should be involved
- responsibility for monitoring
- how will costs associated with monitoring be covered.
9.1.5 Public Involvement and Inter-Agency Cooperation in Monitoring
The involvement of local communities is important in the monitoring process. Since they are
most affected by road works, it is likely that local communities would be able to identify some of
the more relevant monitoring indicators. They would also be able to participate in data collection
by recording certain measurements, eg. the number of times over a given period that a road
overtops. Some information is best obtained directly from the local communities, such as that
relating to compensation.
Inter-agency cooperation is beneficial in monitoring, because roads and road works impact on a
number of sectors. For example, soil erosion caused by runoff from a road is the concern of the
MOWHC, the Ministry of Agriculture, and any NGOs or community groups that may be
involved in land improvement/management activities.
Cooperation with communities and other agencies can also reduce monitoring costs, because it
would be in the interest of these other agencies to monitor certain parameters. Thus the cost of
monitoring and analysis can be shared, or in some cases (eg. catchment protection) taken on
entirely by the other agencies.



74
9.2 Evaluation
Evaluation is the process by which data that is collected during monitoring is analysed with the
aim of:
* assessing any changes in baseline conditions (eg. degradation of a forest along a road)
* assessing whether recommended mitigation measures have been successful
* ascertaining whether road works activities comply with requirements in the MOWHC's
General Specification for Road and Bridge Works, Road Design Manual and Maintenance
Manual, other national standards and regulations (eg. whether water quality in streams near or
crossing a road has been affected, or workmen are wearing protective gear such as ear-muffs
and face masks)
* determining the reasons for unsuccessful mitigation
* developing and recommending alternative mitigation measures or plans to replace
unsatisfactory ones
* identifying trends in environmental improvement or degradation through examining impacts
* identifying impacts that were not anticipated by the EIA study.
The interpretation of data must be consistent for any given indicator (ie. the benchmarks on
which analysis is based must be the same).
Evaluations are carried out as specially commissioned impact studies, or in-house by the ELU in
the MOWHC or the environmental unit within RAFU/Road Agency. They should be done every
6 months to one year.
Monitoring and evaluation as described in the sections above correspond to self-monitoring as
described in the NEMA EIA guidelines.
9.3 Environmental Audits
Environmental audits compare actual and predicted impacts, and thereby assess the accuracy of
the investigations carried out during an EIA study. Environmental audits may include cost
benefit analysis to compare the advantages of including mitigation.
The objectives of environmental audits are to:
* assess the effectiveness of the environmental management system, ie. the mitigation and
monitoring plans;
* determine whether conditions provided for in the MOWHC's General Specification and
Conditions of Contract have been implemented and enforced;
. assess whether these conditions contributed to environmental management of the road or
district road network:
. propose changes that are necessary in road sector policies in order to ensure sound
environmental management in road works activities.
As ElAs are essentially planning tools, audits serve to improve that planning process by
examining the effectiveness of individual ElAs and the EIA process in predicting impacts and
proposing sustainable mitigation measures.



75
The Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations of 1998 require the developer to conduct an
initial environmental audit between twelve and thirty-six months after the completion of the road
project. Depending on under whose jurisdiction a particular road project falls, the environmental
unit within RAFU/RA or the ELU in the Ministry must prepare an environmental audit report
which is to be submitted to the Executive Director of NEMA for review and comment. Provided
monitoring and evaluation as described above are conducted regularly, auditing would simply
entail an overall evaluation.
Environmental audits are carried out by either of the environmental units, or these units may
commission an independent person or firm to conduct the auditing.
NEMA  may also conduct an audit through a designated inspector if it feels that the
environmental audits carried out by the environmental unit or ELU are unsatisfactory, or if it
receives information from another party that would necessitate such an audit .



76
10. GUIDELINES FOR MITIGATION OF SOCIAL IMPACTS
Environmental impact assessments must also address the human or social environment, which
include the social and socio-economic impacts due to a road project. One of the main objectives of
socio-environmental impact assessment is to predict and prevent or moderate unacceptable adverse
social environmental effects on people from the proposed actions or projects.
This is done through involving the community and all other stakeholders so that changes can be
recommended at the planning, design and implementation stages. This is in accordance with Part
III of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations. 1998 (Statutory Instruments Supplement
No. 8). Social environmental impact analysis should be carried out at every stage of the EIA
process.
The main stages of the EIA process for the road sector are as follows:
*      Project planning
*      Preparation of project brief
*      Screening
*      Preparation of TORs for Environmental Impact Reviews
e      Preparation of TOR for Scoping
e      Preparation of TORs for EIA Studies
-      Review of Environmental Impact Reviews and Assessments.
10.1 Proiect Planninz
At the planning and design stage of all road projects, MOWHC/RAFU/RA must ensure in the
design that people are an integral part of the environment and are going to be active participants in
the overall project environment. Depending on whether the road project is a new facility or
rehabilitation/maintenance of an existing facility, the following guidelines will apply:
New Road Facility
the MOVrHC, RAFU or the Road Agency will focus on preventing social impacts;
the need for the new road versus possible social impacts must be justified;
during the design, the consulting engineer/EIA study team must describe the main phases of the
road project; vis-a-vis the project cycle to ensure that the stakeholders are in the picture.
* the consulting engineer/EIA study team should take note of the significant socio-cultural issues
within at least a 100 metre corridor of the new road facility (refer Koji and Hoban, World Bank
Technical Paper No. 376, 1997);
the consulting engineer/EIA study team should formulate a plan to prevent undesirable socio-
impacts if possible at the design/planning stage.
Existing Road Facility
* the MOWHC/RAFU/RA will focus on rehabilitating and mitigating further impacts;
. the MOWHC/RAFU/RA include socio-environmental issues at the planning stage in order to
avoid project difficulties and costly delays later on (as was the situation with the Zana-Kibuye
Road in Kampala 1998);
* the consulting engineer/EIA study team will identify which, if any, aspects of the existing road
have caused unacceptable socio-environmental impacts;



77
as part of the environmental audits, the MOWHC/RAFU/RA  should carrv out a socio-
environmental audits to assess the extent of current impacts.
10.2 The Proiect Brief
The project brief must be prepared in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment
Regulations, 1998, and the guidelines in Chapter 5 of this document. For the purposes of socio-
economic impacts the MOWHC/RAFU/RA will ensure the following:
* key socio-economic activities and cultural issues within a 5 km3 corridor of the proposed road
facility are highlighted in the brief;
* the methodology for addressing gender concerns during recruitment of personnel and
distribution of socio-economic benefits to the local community is clearly detailed and where
possible the requirements of the Local Government Statue, 1995 are fulfilled (Affirmative
Action On Women);
. the engineer in RAFU who is designated to prepare the project brief consults a competent
sociologist.
10.3 Screening and Scoping:
Past experience has shown that during the time between the planning of the road project and the
actual commencement of road works, communities tend to immigrate into the proposed road project
areas in the hope of getting compensation before the project starts. It is recommended, therefore,
that apart from carrying out the screening in accordance with the guidelines proposed in Chapter 5,
the screening exercise should also address the following:
* Include in the baseline data the actual numbers of people and their activities prior to the
commencement of the full EIA;
e Publicise through official channels the intention and extent of the proposed road project;
e Ensure public participation during scoping.
Although Category I projects are normally exempt from ElAs, it will be necessary for
MOWHC/RAFU/RA to examine gender concerns with respect to recruitment, employment and
management during the implementation of road works. These include routine maintenance works,
such as clearing roadside vegetation and the periodic grassing of embankments.
10.4 Preparation of TOR for Environmental Impact Reviews
The scope of work as included in the TOR for the Environmental Impact Reviews should clearly
indicate the requirement and proposed methodology for public involvement (see Chapter 11).
The legal requirement for Uganda was not identified but corridor width can vary between
100 metres to 10 km.



78
10.5 Preparation of TOR for ScoDing
The requirements of the scoping exercise have been discussed in Chapter 5. In addition the
MOWHC/RAFUIRA will ensure that the scope of work for the scoping exercise includes the
following:
* Meeting of key stakeholders and other relevant agencies to discuss the potential impacts and
various alternatives;
* Consultation with potentially affected communities and institutions/organisations;
* Prioritising environmental and social issues of particular relevance to the road project.
10.6 Preparation of the TOR for the Environmental Impact Assessment Studies
The scope of work for EIA studies will normally require that social impacts be addressed in great
detail. In addition, requirements and methodologies for public involvement must be emphasised
(refer Chapter 11). This is necessary especially if compensation and/or resettlement are anticipated
(Guidelines for Compensation and Resettlement are addressed in Chapters 12 and 13).
10.7 Review of Environmental Impact Reviews and Statements
EIRs and ElSs will be reviewed by the Environmental Liaison Unit within the MOWHC or the EU
in RAFU. The units must bear in mind that the EIR Report/EIS will be submitted to NEMA, where,
if deemed appropriate, it will be forwarded to other stakeholders/agencies for further scrutiny. The
completeness of the assessments includes a statement on public involvement and the inclusion of
the views of local communities with regard to the road project process.



79
11. GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC CONSULTATION
NEMA and World Bank Guidelines are complimentary with respect to public involvement il
environmental assessment (refer NEMA EIA Guidelines 1997, and World Bank January 1997).
The Environment Impact Assessment Regulations, 1998, Part III, Section 12, require the
beveloper/Agency (MOWHC/RAFU/RA) to take "all measures necessary to seek the views of the
people in the communities which may be affected by the project.
Public involvement is necessary for road projects:
*      whichi affect local communities;
*      which require resettlement or land expropriation;
*      with affirmative action for specific beneficiary groups;
where community cooperation is required to succeed;
*      that may trigger economic and social hardships for neighbouring communities;
*      for which there is doubt about the social impacts.
Methodologies for involving the public should be designed and implemented in a flexible manner
adapting and responding to the local communities and conditions. They should be cost-effective so
that they do not cripple the environmental assessment budget. That is why public involvement
should initially be built into the EIA study budget. Public involvement activities must be carried
out in an open and transparent manner.
Public involvement is an essential element of environmental management of roads. It consists of
three stages:
*      information dissemination
*      consultation, and
*      stakeholder participation.
These stages of involvement can be applied at various times throughout the EIA process as well as
the road project cycle, and may be used either one at a time or simultaneously. It is necessary,
therefore, to develop procedures and skills for informing the public and other interested parties
about road development proposals. MOWHC/RAFU/RA should play a catalytic role in ensuring
that local authorities will be responsible for getting people to participate in the various stages of the
road project.
11.1 Information Dissemination in Road Sector Proiects
The project brief should be a concise and information-rich document which should be disseminated
to the general public and other stakeholder institutions/organisations well in advance of the EIR or
EIA study.
Channels of communication may include:
*      Local Council information channels;
*      District Environmental Office;
*      Local Environmental Committees;
Community based organisations (women's groups, church groups)
*      NGOs
*      Public displays and Newsletters.



80
11.1.1 Information Solicitation in Road Sector Projects
The consulting engineer conducting the EIA study should seek people's views so as to initiate
constructive dialogue between the road proponents, ie. MOWHC/RAFU/RA and other stakeholders.
This also has the advantage of lending ownership of the road, making recruitment of labour easier
(for construction and maintenance purposes), and reducing the incidence of vandalism to structures.
11.2 Consultation
Consultation is a two way flow of information and ideas between the developer
(MOWHC/RAFU/RA) and the stakeholder community. MOWHC/RAFU/RA will be required to
initiate the consultation process through the consulting engineers/EIA study team.
Under consultation, the following should be made clear:
What is being asked of the public;
*      How and when the public should contribute;
*      Whom should members of the public contact if they want to participate.
11.3 Stakeholder Participation in Public Consultation
It is increasingly being realised that a more extensive and early involvement of stakeholders in
the EIA process would be beneficial to the proposed road project. Benefits include a better
understanding by the stakeholders of the potential impacts of the proposed project; identification
of contentious issues and possible ways and means to resolve these; establishment of transparent
procedures for project implementation, completion and operation; etc. Associated with these
benefits, however, are a number of constraints related to the identification of all relevant
stakeholders, adequate types and procedures for communication between different linguistic and
cultural entities and literacy levels; time and cost implications; etc.
Stakeholder Identification
It is important that a careful identification of the various stakeholders, i.e. individuals, groups of
individuals, or institutions with interests in a project or programme4, takes place as early as
possible, preferably during the identification / planning stage of the project. Additional to that,
adequate procedures for their participation are required to make sure that their views and
suggestions are fully incorporated.
Based on expected impact of the project, stakeholders are normally divided in primary and
secondary stakeholders:
. primary stakeholders are those directlv affected by the (intended) road project. In most
projects primary stakeholders can be categorised according to social analysis, ie. divided by
gender, social or income class, occupational or service user groups, etc. Quite often,
categories of primary stakeholders will overlap (eg. women and low income groups,
fisherman and ethnic minorities).
4 From: Short guidance note on how to do stakeholder analysis of aid prOJects and programmes: Richard Montgomery,
Centre for Development Studies, Swansea - UK; May' 1995; p.1



81
secondary stakeholders are intermediaries in relation to the (intended) road project, in other
words, those not directlv affected by the (intended) project. They can be divided into funding,
implementing, monitoring and advocacy organisations, or into governmental, non-
governmental and private sector organisations and individuals.
In many projects it will also be necessary to consider a third category of stakeholders, so called
key individuals (sometimes referred to as tertiary or external stakeholders) who can
significantly influence, or are important to, the success of the project. Those would include, for
example, heads of departments or agencies who have formal institutional objectives as well as
personal interests at stake; or politicians, local leaders, VIP's and others with social and religious
influence.
In relation to road construction, these three categories of stakeholders are usually the following:
1. Primary Stakeholders: Families (seriously) affected by the project, so called (S)PAFs:
(Seriously) Project Affected Families5.
2. Secondary Stakeholders: The general population in the project area (who are not PAFs).
including special interest groups, community based organisations (CBOs), relevant
government organisations, etc.
3. Tertiary Stakeholders: local formal and informal leaders, VIP's, religious leaders, politicians,
etc.
A fourth and final group of stakeholders could be distinguished if the road project is of a labour
intensive nature, ie. requiring a larger number of labourers than available in the project area. This
group is (by definition) external to the area and will only arrive at the start of the implementation
of roadworks, and normally remain only for the duration of the implementation. However,
special measures will need to be taken to adequately accommodate this workforce so as to
minimise adverse impacts.
11.4 Responsibility for Ensuring Public Involvement
The responsibility for ensuring public involvement rests with MOWHC/RAFU/RA. At the same
time the community involvement ensures that the road development is people driven.
11.5 Methodologies for Public Involvement
The right to free speech and public involvement is guaranteed by the Constitution of Uganda. In
case of doubt, participants can remain anonymous so that they may not be required to sign
questionnaires and the like. However, for completion of the Public Consultation Report and/or the
EIS, it is desirable to have a list of the people who were involved in the consultations.
There are basically three main means of involving stakeholders in the EIA process:
.  information dissemination, ie. the proponent provides information to the stakeholders in a
'one way' process;
. consultation, i.e. a 'two way' process of communication between the proponent and the
stakeholders;
5 The term "Seriously Project Affected Families" needs precise definition for instance "families who either loose their
houses, more than 60% of their annual income, or more than 50% of their assets, including land".



82
participation, i.e. a process of discussion and reaching consensus bv both parties on the basis
of shared responsibilities.
It is desirable that the first contact with the stakeholders is as comprehensive as possible and
follows a participatory approach, ie. that a number of issues are addressed simultaneously,
satisfying the requirements of the stakeholders (expressing their ideas on the intended project) as
well as those of the intended project (information gathering). During the feasibility study, a
number of distinct but related activities should be undertaken by project staff. These activities
may include the following:
1. Stakeholder analysis: Identification / definition of the various categories of stakeholders and
their interests, importance and influence:
2. Meetings with each distinct group of stakeholders at the various locations to share information
on the intended project, and subsequent identification of individual SPAFs and PAFs;
3. Household interviews with all SPAFs and PAFs, and a random selection of families and
organisations from the (remaining) general population in the project area:
4. Interviews with key informants (formal and informal leaders, government officials, etc.);
5. Focus group discussions in each settlement to discuss potential compensation packages and
(other) mitigation measures.
6. Definition and establishment of a project based structure to ensure ongoing dialogue,
feedback, and consideration / incorporation of views expressed by the various categories of
stakeholders.
Depending on the magnitude and sensitivity of the impacts, the following methodologies may be
used individually or in combination:
Open house
Interview survey
Public meetings/public hearings
-      Individual/group discussions
-      On-site-consultations
Rapid Rural Appraisal
11.5.1 Open House
This is useful at the initial stages and during the presentation of results and reports. It takes the
form of public displays or newsletters, and reports on the project and on options and designs
adopted.   These can  be displayed  at public  buildings and  busy  community  centres.
MOWHC/RAFU/RA representatives should be at these places to receive comments, suggestion and
protests. They should also answer queries. Announcements on these displays should be carried on
both electronic and print media.
11.5.2 Interview Survey
This is best achieved by use of an appropriate questionnaire or a pre-determined check list. Caution
must be taken to get a truly representative sample of the affected groups. This can be achieved
through random sampling within the affected community. Questionnaires should be well structured
so that they can be digitised for analysis using a suitable socio-analysis package or any other
appropriate spreadsheet programme.



83
Designing of questionnaires is a specialised activity, so the EIA study team should have the
expertise to design appropriate and applicable questionnaires.
11.5.3 Public Meetings/Hearings
During the EIA process, NEMA invites the public to comment on the EIS (refer Environmental
Impact Assessment Regulations. 1998). Based on these comments, the Executive Director of
NEMA will determine whether a public hearing is required. The Lead Agency (ie.
MOWHC/RAFU/RA) are responsible for organising the hearing. They will be required to present
their opinion to the participants.
Public hearings must be carefully designed otherwvise they may become chaotic, or even be hijacked
by other powerful groups - (Ref. public hearings on water hyacinth control by NEMA, 1997). So to
avoid thiis, procedures should be established which should include:
Notification of the public hearing should be made at least ten days prior to the hearing and
publicised through both electronic and print media as appropriate or any other suitable
media. The notice should include full information regarding time, agenda, and information
to the effect that no decisions will be made on matters outside the agenda. In addition the
notice should take into account the gender and other minority representation particularly
with respect to timing and suitability of the venue;
*      Rules of the hearing;
*      Provision of information;
*      Seeking of participant inputs:
*      Discussion of implementation.
Use should be made of an experienced, impartial and capable moderator. The EIA study team
should take minutes of the proceedings.
11.5.4 Individual or Group Discussions
Individual or group discussions are another useful method to accommodate views of minority
groups and other disadvantaged people. The selection of groups should include:
Minorities or disadvantaged peoples;
People with special knowledge or interests with respect to road development;
*      Specialists/Technocrats;
*      Political and opinion leaders;
*      Affected residents;
*      any others who may be provide input to the ElA process.
Often it is more useful to separate the groups to avoid intimidation or to take into account gender
concerns.
11.5.5 On-Site Consultation
If there is a time constraint or there are no meeting facilities, then on-site consultation with local
communities can be undertaken. Site inspection tours (for a bridge or other structure on the road)
may have to be conducted which would have to include experts and other sectoral representatives.



84
11.5.6 Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA)
This is undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team and supplements the interview survey.
The RRA team composition should include:
*      Community development specialist;
*      Technical specialists (eg. environmentalist, ecologist, water resources expert. etc) who have
an understanding of the likely impacts;
Local experts who understand the language and culture;
*      A recorder.
The rapid appraisal should use sketch maps showing the road location of the road in urban or settled
areas. Such maps should be drawn by the participants themselves. In addition, the base map
showing the entire road network should be explained by a local person to enable participants to
contribute. Depending on the availability of resources, the groups can be gender desegregated
during the appraisal meetings.



85
12. GUEDELINES FOR COMPENSATION
12.1 Introduction
Compensation is considered when steps to minimise impacts on people are not possible or
insufficient. Compensation provisions are supposed to provide enough resources for the affected
communities to purchase replacement properties. They should also ensure that displaced people are
not worse off, economically and socially, than before their displacement
In environmental management, compensatory measures are necessary if they:
aim to make up for losses or damage (for example a borrow pit can be converted into road
side picnic areas and scenic lookouts);
*      are more cost effective than mitigation (eg. drilling wells for the community);
*      provide services to the community (eg. access roads, markets, etc.); and
*      provide environmental resource "banking" (eg. restoration of valuable on habitats).
The Roads Act makes it an offence for anyone to make any developments within the road reserve.
(Legal aspects pertaining to compensation have been described in detail in Chapter 2 of Volume IV
of this report).
For FRSP sub-projects, therefore, compensation would have to be paid for land, property and crops,
where land is acquired for new roads, realignments, widening and dualising of carriageways and for
increasing existing road reserves. However, no compensation need be paid for any buildings,
property or crops that were erected or grown in an area already designated as road reserve.
12.2 Constraints to Monetary Compensation
There have been cases where compensation provisions and property acquisition practices did not
provide sufficient resources to enable affected communities to purchase replacement assets. There
are several reasons for this which include the following:
*      ISUnder-valuation of assets by government valuers;
Changes in price of the alternative properties;
*      Delayed payments leading to loss of value (eg. because of inflation);
Unsuitable manner of payment whereby it is not clear whether people should be paid a
lump sum or instalments;
Misappropriation of funds earmarked for compensation.
In view of the foregoing, monetary compensation may not be meaningful to local communities.
Thus there is a need to put in place a community driven development plan to implement
compensation. Furthermore, compensation/resettlement during road development is complicated
by the fact that while road works necessitating compensation and resettlement are the responsibility
of RAFU/Road Agency, compensation issues are handled by the Ministry of Water, Lands and
Environment, and resettlement is under the jurisdiction of Office of the Prime Minister. This
creates coordination problems since the different budgets may not be easily synchronised and leads
to unnecessary delays in project implementation.



86
12.3 Compensation Guidelines
Past experience in Uganda, and in particular road projects, highlights the need for legislated
compensation. The legislation requires that only owners of properties that have to make way for the
road project should receive compensation. It makes no mention of employees, tenants and squatters
who may be affected. This has been unfortunate because the majority of the affected people do not
receive any form of compensation particularly in urban areas.
The most recent example has been on the Zana-Kibuye Road in Kampala where only the few
propertied people will be compensated. This type of compensation does not include income
restoration and should not be recommended.
In order for compensation to be effective, it is essential that a comprehensive baseline survey is
done followed by the development of rehabilitation packages.
12.3.1 Objectives of Compensation
Article 26 of the Constitution of Uganda, 1995, states that compulsory deprivation of one's property
is prohibited except when taking possession or acquisition is necessary for public use. If this is
proved to be the case, as for a road, then acquisition is subject to prompt payment of fair and
adequate compensation.
Compensation should aim to minimise social disruption and assist those who have lost assets as a
result of a road project to maintain their livelihoods through income restoration.
12.3.2 Responsibilities
Compensation is paid by the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Water, Lands and
Environment.
While the modalities of paying compensation will be addressed by the EIA study team, RAFU/RA,
as the lead agency of the FRSP, should take responsibility for the compensation process. The EU
within RAFU/Road Agency should be assigned the specific responsibility of effecting
compensation.
12.3.3 Community Participation
It is important that affected persons, RAFU/RA and the EIA studv team start interacting right from
when it is first realised that compensation may be necessary, ie. during project planning or the
feasibility stage.
Various members of the community should also be involved in negotiations, including:
* Informal leaders and representatives;
* LC Officials;
Other formal leaders;
Local NGOs and CBOs;
Local Environment Committee.



87
12.3.4 Baseline Survey
Effective compensation requires that a comprehensive baseline survey is carried out, which should
include:
i)     An up to date field-based census of the number of people who will be displaced. the
magnitude of displacement, income levels and assets and some idea of occupational
categories;
ii)    An assessment of encroachment on to the road reserve;
iii)   Information on the resource base of the affected population;
iv)    Extent to which groups will experience total or partial loss of assets;
v)     Public infrastructure and social services that will be affected;
vi)    Formal and informal institutions (eg. CBOs, NGOs, churches, etc.) that can assist in
designing and implementing the resettlement programmes;
vii)   Names of affected families should be recorded as early as possible to present influx of
population ineligible for compensation.
12.3.5 Legal Framework
The EIA study team should determine the legal requirement for compensation including the
existence of local bylaws, if any. In addition, it should work out a framework for co-ordination
between the different players in compensation.
12.3.6 Valuation for Lost Assets
The EIA study team should pay special attention to the current values of assets and should value
each asset individually. Eligibility criteria for the affected people/households must be established.
The study should also take note of changes in price and values of assets between evaluation and
compensation.
12.3.7 Payments
The EIA study team should draw up a payment plan which will streamline procedures so as to avoid
delayed payments.
The study should establish the best criteria for payment either in instalments, or pre-season or lump
sum, depending on the socio-economic characteristics of the society in question.  Peasant
communities are often unable to properly manage large sums of money following compensation.



88
13. GUIDELINES FOR RESETTLEMENT
13.1 Introduction
The FRSP will cover road network improvement. road network administration and capacity
building. Under the road network improvement component, it is likelv that road development will
affect communities where new roads will pass through people's properties and dwellings.
Examples include the Kampala Bypass, dualisation of urban sections of trunk roads, realignments
of existing roads which are to be improved. This may lead to involuntary displacement of people
and to the need for compensation. Because involuntary displacement is an agent for disrupting and
impoverishing communities it should be avoided, or at least minimised. It is imperative, then, that
displaced persons should be not only be adequately compensated for their losses at replacement
cost, but in addition they should be given opportunities to share in road project benefits, and should
be assisted in improving their livelihood.
13.2 Resettlement Policy Framework
In Uganda, the resettlement policy is currently under development by the Commissioner for
Resettlement in the Office of the Prime Minister. A White Paper is currently being prepared. It
would appear that the resettlement policy is designed to meet the needs of people who have been
affected by disasters. The disasters have been man made (eg. wars) or natural (floods). In this case
resettlers are given basic tools and necessities to start a new life. In many cases resettlement has
been on a case by case policy and often donor dependent. This has often resulted in serious
negative effects on the displaced people. Nevertheless, examples of projects that have necessitated
resettlement in Uganda include national parks, housing projects, refugees and the Owen Falls Dam
construction.
On the other hand the World Bank's fundamental policy goal is to improve living standards and
earning capacities of displaced persons.  In this way involuntary resettlement of people is
transformed into an opportunity for development and self-improvement as they are enabled to share
the benefits of development projects which cause their displacement. The concern is that displaced
groups are further economically disadvantaged. There is the possibility that they will engage in
appropriate income generation activities that will result in environmental degradation. The World
Bank's policy is to avoid involuntary resettlement of indigenous or ethnic minority groups.
13.3 Obiectives in Resettlement
The main objective in resettlement is to ensure that the displaced population receives benefits from
the displacing project. Involuntary resettlement, therefore, should be an integral part of the road
project and should be handled at the onset of the project, ie. at the planning and feasibility stages.
When communities or individuals are forcibly moved, it is likely that production systems are
dismantled, kinship groups may be scattered, jobs may be lost, and social networks may collapse
leading to a host of other socio-economic ills. This is why involuntary resettlement should take into
account all the socio-economic characteristics of the affected people.



89
13.4 Basic Requirements for Resettlement Plans
There are at least four basic requirements for road projects where resettlement will occur. These are
as follows:-
13.4.1 Baseline Surveys
It is important that comprehensive baseline survevs of affected populations/communities are done.
Inadequate baseline data can result in project planners lacking a realistic picture of the numbers or
the social and economic organisation of affected people.
In the past, topographic maps/surveys have been used to assess baseline socio-economic
characteristics. This method should be discouraged, because often these topographic maps are
outdated and their information does not exactly correspond with the ground truth.
13.4.2 Resettlement Timetables
It is essential that a resettlement timetable, which is well coordinated with proposed roadworks
activities, is put in place so that the resettlement exercise is not left to be implemented towards the
end of the road project. Resettlement timetables should provide for phased resettlement to allow
construction/improvement works and resettlement to take place at minimal cost. Thus resettlement
can be synchronised resettlement with the gradual advance of the road works, especially in densely
populated areas like Kampala.
13.4.3 Restoration of Lost Incomes
Resettlement plans must target restoration of lost incomes due to the road project. In densely
populated areas (eg. the Kampala Bypass or urban sections of trunk roads that are to be dualised)
costs for compensation and resettlement will be substantial. The desirable plan to restore lost
incomes must include compensation costs, resettlement costs, administrative costs, rehabilitation
costs and costs of lost local government or Central Government public assets. To minimise losses
to the community, it is essential that compensation is paid up front and compensation
timetable/programme is put in place.
13.4.4 Resettlement Budget
Inadequate financial resources for resettlement programmes leads to their failure. Therefore it is
necessary to prepare an adequate budget to meet the costs of resettlement. There are two aspects to
preparing the resettlement budget: firstly, if the budget is too low, then the funds will be inadequate
and this will lead to delays in implementing the FRSP; and secondly, if the budget is excessive, it
may discourage donors from investing in that particular road, and the Government may not be able
to afford such costs.
The overall attractiveness of the FRSP will depend on whether adequate resettlement finances have
been provided to ensure income restoration.



90
13.5 Contents of a Compensation and Resettlement Plan
Where the FRSP will displace people involuntarily, severe socio-economic problems are likely to
arise. It is necessary therefore that the RAFU/RA ensures that the displaced population receives
benefits from the FRSP. This can only be possible if a people oriented resettlement plan is evolved
and implemented. Resettlement plans should include the following key components:
13.5.1 Objective
The objective of the plan should be well considered to the effect that the displaced people should
benefit from the FRSP through compensation assistance in moving, and assistance to improve their
former living standards and any other considerations relevant to the road project area.
13.5.2 Policy
The current government policy on resettlement should be stated, as well as other regulations
particularly with respect to land tenure, local governance and environment. The FRSP donors'
policy on resettlement should be included here.
13.5.3 Organisational Responsibilities
In the context of the road sector in Uganda, there are at least three actors involved in resettlement.
These are the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment (compensation), the Prime Minister's
Office (resettlement) and RAFU/RA (Lead Agency). RAFU/RA, as the Lead Agency of the FRSP,
will take responsibility for resettlement and identifying and coordinating all the other players in
resettlement. RAFU/RA should also liaise with the MOWH-C on these matters.
The Environmental Unit within RAFU/RA should be assigned the specific responsibility of
coordinating resettlement.
13.5.4 Community Participation
The resettlers, RAFU/RA and the EIA study team must begin dialogue as soon as it becomes
apparent that resettlement may be necessary, ie. at the time of project planning or the feasibility
stage. Public involvement will assist in the following:-
* Identifying cultural and communal property;
* Identifying cultural/social groups which should move together;
* Sensitisation of both host and resettlement communities. This should be done well in advance;
 Identification of various resettlement alternatives;
* Identification of vulnerable groups which should be protected. Such groups will include women,
the landless and other minorities.
Community involvement should include the following:
*  Informal leaders and representatives;
*  LC Officials;
*  Other formal leaders;
*  Local NGOs and CBOs;
*  FRSP officials (MOWHC);



91
* Local Environment Committee;
* Disadvantaged groups such as women, orphans, the landless and other minorities.
13.5.5 Baseline Survey
It is essential that the resettlement plan is based on the most recent information about the scale and
impact of the displacement. The baseline survey should include:
i)     An up to date field-based census of the number of people who will be displaced, the
magnitude of displacement, income levels and assets and some idea of occupational
categories, distinguish between SPAFs and PAFs;
ii)    An assessment of encroachment on to the road reserve;
iii)   Information on the full resource base of the affected population;
iv)    Extent to which groups will experience total or partial loss of assets;
v)     Public infrastructure and social services that will be affected;
vi)    Formal and informal institutions (eg. CBOs, NGOs, churches, etc.) that can assist designing
and implementing the resettlement programmes;
vii)   Names of affected families should be recorded as early as possible to prevent in-flows of
population ineligible for compensation.
13.5.6 Legal Framework
For purposes of the FRSP it is important to note that the land is vested in the people (Constitution of
Uganda,1995). In addition RAFU/RA will have to determine the legal and administrative
procedures with respect to resettlement.  These procedures should not undermine the stated
objective for resettlement. The RAFU/RA should work out a framework for coordination between
the RAFU/RA, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment and any
other agency involved in the resettlement process.
13.5.7 Alternative Sites
With regard to alternatives for resettlement sites, the EIA study team needs to:
i)    identify possible alternative sites together with the host and resettlers;
ii)    identify the productive potential of alternative sites as well as availability of other sources
of income;
iii)   identify the comparable employment opportunities, infrastructure, services and production
opportunities.
iv)    identify and prepare relocation sites and drawing up time-tables and budgets for
resettlement.
RAFU/RA, with assistance from the MOWHC, will put in place legal arrangements for land title
ownership and for guarding against land speculation.



92
13.5.8 Valuation of and Compensation for Lost Assets
Resettlement plans must target restoration of lost incomes due to the FRSP. In order to effect this,
the plan should:
i)     pay special attention to the legal arrangement land title, registration and site occupation;
ii)    sensitise the affected communities on the laws and regulations on valuation and
compensation;
iii)   establish eligibility criteria for affected households;
iv)    specify mechanisms to prevent further illegal encroachment or squatting on the road
reserve;
v)     establish access to communal facilities.
13.5.9 Land Tenure, Acquisition and Transfer
RAFU/RA should review the land tenure system both in the host community and the affected
community. RAFU/RA, the MOWHC and the Ministry for Water, Lands and Environment should
together work out the compensation eligibility for land dependent populations. Evaluation and
grievance procedures should be explained to the community making sure that both customary and
titled resettlers are equally treated.
The plan should take into consideration the time required to process land titles.
13.5.10 Access to Training and Credit
If the baseline survey indicates that the resettlers cannot get the same employment opportunities as
before then the plan must include alternative employment strategies for the displaced people. It
may be necessary to institute vocational training, employment counselling, extension of credit
(Entandikwa Scheme) and any other as may be identified.
13.5.11 Shelter, Infrastructure and Social Services
The plan should provide for infrastructure at the new sites. It is preferable that the GOU (through
the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment and the Office of the Prime Minister) provides
suitable building materials while settlers construct their own dwellings according to their culture
and tastes. RAFU/RA should facilitate this.
13.5.12 Environmental Protection and Management
The EIA study for FRSP roads requiring resettlement should cover all areas where resettlers are
likely to go. The rehabilitation process and subsequent developments should be environmentally
and socially acceptable.



93
13.5.13 Implementation Schedule
It is essential that a sound schedule for executing the resettlement operation evenly over the
duration of FRSP road projects requiring resettlement is put in place so as to avoid "end-bunching".
The resettlement plan should include an implementation schedule for each activity covering the
initial baseline and preparation, actual relocation and post relocation economic and social activities.
In addition, phases of resettlement should be synchronised with phases in road
construction/improvement.

ANNEX HI: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF ROADS
1. CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPACTS
An environmental impact is a change in an environmental attribute which is brought about by an
activity related to a proposed project. During an EIA of a proposed project such as a road, the
following characteristics of each of the impacts must ideally be determined, and when ever possible
quantitative measures of these characteristics must be given;
*     direct or indirect,
*     direction, (positive or negative),
*     distribution in space,
*     timing,
*     duration,
*     reversibility, and
*     probability of occurrence.
An impact could arise as a result of an activity which is directly related to the project. The
improvement in the movement of people is a direct impact of a road project. This improvement in
transportation may cause migration of economically active persons to urban areas. Migration is an
indirect impact of the road as it results from one of the direct impacts of the road.
1.1 Direction
Environmental impacts also differ in their direction, in that some impacts are positive (beneficial)
while others are negative (adverse). The improvement in transportation in an area is a positive
environmental impact. Relocation of households or business activities that are in the right of way of
the road is a negative impact. The same impact may affect different groups in a different manner.
Loss of woodlands due to the road development which causes a reduction in the available firewood is
a negative impact to most households, but to firewood vendors this may be a positive impact as this
creates a market for them.
1.2 Distribution in space
The distribution of environmental impacts also varies in space. The loss of woodlands due to a road is
not going to affect all areas equally. In some areas this loss will be considerable, while in others it
may be negligible.
1.3 Timing
Impacts differ in their timing in that some impacts will occur during the planning, construction, or
operation of a road project. There are instances when a road is closed for ever, that is
decommissioning of the road. Decommissioning of a road may have its own specific impacts, such as
increased travel costs for the affected communities. Environmental impacts may occur soon after an
activity has been started, e.g. soil erosion along a poorly designed or managed side drains. However
some impacts will be delayed in their occurrence, e.g. improvement in economic performance.



A - 3
1.4 Duration
Impacts can be classified in terms of their duration as being short-term, long-term, continuous
and/or intermittent. Noise produced by heavy vehicles used during construction of a road is a short-
tern impact. However, noise arising from regular traffic once the road is operational is a long-term
impact. If such noise only occurs at some specific times during the day, it is an intermittent impact.
But if noise occurs all the time, then it is a continuos impact.
1.5 Reversibility
Environmental impacts can also be classified as being reversible or irreversible. With a reversible
impact the environmental attribute can revert back to its original state. Vegetation is often destroyed
along access or detour roads used during road construction. However, these temporary roads can
usually be rehabilitated enabling the vegetation cover to re-establish to its original status. The loss of
productive soils along the road to be developed is an irreversible impact.
1.6 Probability of occurrence
The chances of environmental impacts occurring are also variable. Some impacts will definitely
occur, e.g. loss of vegetation cover along the right of way of a road. However, there may be an
element of uncertainty about the occurrence of some of the impacts, e.g. impoverishment of rural
areas due to out-migration, or increased poaching along a new road that runs through a forest reserve.



A-4
2. METHODS OF IMPACT IDENTIFICATION
There are several methods of varying complexity that have been developed for impact identification
and assessment. The most commonly used methods are
professional judgement,
*      checklists,
*     matrices, and
*     map overlays, and
*     Geographical Information System (GIS).
For very complicated projects or impacts, mathematical or physical models are used. Such a model
could be used to analyse the effects of a bridge on flow processes and consequently on erosion and
deposition of sediments along a channel.
2.1 Professional Judgement
Environmental impacts can be identified on the basis of professional judgement. With this method
experts in various disciplines use their training and experience to determine the potential
environmental impacts of a proposed road project. A vegetation specialist will come up with a list of
what he/she considers would be the impacts of a proposed road on vegetation. Similarly other experts
will come up with their lists of the likely impacts. The disadvantage of this method is that the
identification procedure tends to be subjective and not focused. Therefore all the potential impacts
are not likely to be identified. In addition, it does not give an opportunity for public participation
in impact identification and analysis.
2.2 Checklists
One of the simplest and most commonly used method of impact identification is the use of a
checklist. This is a list of all relevant environmental attributes which the proposed road project may
impact on. Those doing the environmental impact study will go through this list and decide whether
the project will impact on each of the environmental attribute. The table given below shows a
simplified checklist.

The checklist can be modified so that instead of having a simple list of environmental attributes, a
questionnaire is used. Answers to these questions can be scaled so as to indicate the magnitude and
significance of impacts. Checklists have the advantage of being simple to use and the public can
participate during impact identification and assessment. A visual presentation of the results enables
decision-makers to easily comprehend impacts of a proposed project. One of the disadvantages of
checklists is that project activities which cause these impacts are not given. Therefore those who
will be doing the environmental impact study are likely to miss some impacts since not all project
activities may have been identified. Furthermore, there is no distinction between direct and
indirect impacts.



A-6
2.3 Matrices
Matrices are also used to identify environmental impacts. Environmental attributes are listed on one
axis of the matrix, while on the other axis project related activities are given. The matrix enables the
analysts to identify environmental impacts by examining whether the interaction of each of the
project related activities with each of the environmental attributes will cause an impact. The table
below gives a matrix which can be used during impact identification.

Matrices enable stakeholders to participated during impact identification and analysis. The
magnitude and significance of impacts can also be indicated in a matrix. This is often done by using a
scores which may vary from -10 to + 10. Some of the disadvantages of matrices are that indirect
impacts may not always be identified since these do not arise as a result of the interaction of a
project activity and an environmental attribute. The distribution of impacts in space is not given. The
assessment of impact magnitude and significance can be subjective.
2.4 Map overlays and geographical information systems
Map overlays are used to identify impacts and indicate the areas in space where impacts will arise.
This method is ideal for linear development projects such as roads. The relevant environmental
attributes are mapped, e.g. land use map. These maps can be produced from aerial photographs. The
area on which the project such as a road will be located is then mapped or superimposed on the same
map. This will show the locations of various land uses that will be affected by the road. Alternatively,
these environmental attributes are mapped on transparent papers. They are then superimposed over
each other to give the areas covered by these different environmental attributes. A map showing the
location of the proposed project is then superimposed on top of all these maps. This will enable the
identification of areas covered by the various environmental attributes which will be impacted upon
by the project at specific locations. The greater the number of environmental attributes that are
affected by the project at the various locations, the higher the magnitude or intensity of the impact.
This method is ideal for selecting road alignments that will have the least impact, and also for
making a visual presentation of areas likely to be affected by the project.
A geographical information system (GIS) is a computerised data base of spatial data. Each of
the environmental attributes is stored as a separate coverage in a GIS. The process of overlaying maps
of various environmental attributes and a map showing the location of the project can be done



A-8
digitally, instead of the manual process described above. The use of GIS requires trained personnel
and slightly expensive equipment. However, the prices of both hardware and software used are
gradually decreasing.



A - 9
3. MITIGATION AND MONITORING
3.1 Objectives of mitigation
Mitigation is part of an EIA process whose objectives are;
i.    to eliminate adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project,
ii.   to minimise those impacts which cannot be eliminated,
iii.   to protect the right of the public to compensation for adverse impacts, and
iv.   to maximise positive environmental impacts of a proposed project.
Mitigation measures deals mostly with those impacts that are regarded as being significant.
Mitigation and environmental monitoring when a project has been implemented form the
environmental management plan of the project.
Measures that are put in place as part of mitigation can only be effective if the following information
about the impact is known
*     the cause of the impact,
*     when it will occur,
*     how it will occur, and
*     where it occur.
Without such information mitigation measures may be directed at the wrong causes, or at
inappropriate times.
3.2 Forms of mitigation
There are various measures that can be put in place in order to mitigate for impacts. Firstly, the
project could be abandoned in order to avoid any impacts. Such instances arise where a project will
be located in sensible areas, e.g. national park or residential areas. A project could also be abandoned
due to lack of technology to minimise impacts. The required mitigation measures could be so
expensive that the project becomes economically unjustifiable.
Relocating a project is one way of minimising or eliminating environmental impacts. With respect to
roads, this could mean changes to the alignments in order to avoid settlements. Changes in design
can also minimise impacts. For example modification to the slope along the road alignment could
have significant effects on the rates of soil erosion along side drains.
Those who are adversely affected can be compensated as a way of mitigating for adverse impacts.
Compensation may take various forms. Farmers who lose agricultural lands to a road could be offered
altemative pieces of land. Social services such as schools and health centres could be improved in an
area as a way to compensate for the inconvenience brought about by a road. Monetary compensation
is another form of mitigating for adverse impacts.
3.3 Environmental monitoring
Environmental monitoring of a project before and after its implementation is also done as part of an
impact management plan, and the objectives of this monitoring are:



A - 10
*     to ensure compliance with conditions for project approval,
*     to determine the effectiveness of mitigation measures,
to assess the accuracy of impact prediction that will be done during EIAs for each these
road projects,
*     to provide baseline conditions against which future conditions may be compared with, and
*     establish any new impacts that may arise after implementation of these projects.
The responsibilities of various parties in implementing mitigation measures, and the environmental
monitoring programme should be clearly spelt out. These parties include government agencies, the
developer, and affected members of the community.



A- 1
4. IMPACTS OF ROAD PLANNING
4.1 Sources of Impacts
Environmental impacts of road projects will arise at the different stages for road development which
are planning, construction, operation, and in some cases decommissioning of the road. Some impacts
will occur at all these different stages while others occur only at one or two stages of the road
development project. The activities that occur during the planning of a road are;
*     assessment of the need for a road,
*     selecting the alignment of the road,
*     surveying and marking the right of way of the road,
*     identification of sites for quarries and borrow pits,
*      identification of workmen's camping sites,
*      identification of locations for diversions and public utilities to be affected, and
*     negotiating with owners and occupiers of lands to be acquired for by the road.
The impacts that may arise from these activities are described below.
4.2 Social and political instability
During the assessment of the need for a road project, certain sections of the society may feel that
their concerns are not being fairly considered. This may cause these communities to view central
government or the local authority as being biased against them and therefore generate social and
political instability. This may manifests itself in non-cooperation in other development initiatives.
When road construction begins such ill feelings lead to vandalism of equipment used during road
construction. If the local community is expected to contribute materials or labour during road
construction, those members of the community who view the initial assessment of the need as being
biased will be unwilling to co-operate. This impact can be severe if such views are held by
communities covering a wide region or specific ethnic groups.
Mitigation: The public should be involved in assessing the need for a proposed road. Those who are
likely to be affected should be informed even at this early stage. If the community is expected to
contribute to road construction, they should also be informed about what they are expected to
contribute. The alignment of the road should fit into the development plans of the region.
Monitoring: MOWHC should maintain open lines of communication with other government
agencies, and relevant local authorities. Inter-agency meetings should be routinely undertaken to
enable other government agencies and local authorities to report any problems associated with the
planned road works, and particularly land acquisition.
Method of Analysis and Assessment: This section gives suggestions on how the above impacts
could be analysed, and the potential sources of data required for such analysis. The area of influence
of the proposed new road, road that will be upgraded, or will have its pavement strengthened has first
to be delimited. This is done by determining all those areas that are nearer to this road than any other.
Map overlays can be used for this purpose. If all the roads in that particular area have been captured
in a GIS, this delimitation can be done using computers. Communities existing within the area of
influence of the road are then identified. The views of these communities regarding the proposed
route of the road and road works will have to be established. This can be done through
*     questionnaire surveys,
*      informal discussions with selected members of these communities
*     public meetings/hearings, and
rapid rural appraisal.



A- 12
The data gathered is then analysed to establish the views of these communities. The significance of
these impacts is assessed based on the proportions of various groups within the community who
indicate that they will be affected by the proposed road works. This assessment should be done for
the various social groups, e.g. males, females, youth and the elderly, farmers, etc.
Possible Sources of Data for this analysis

Statistics Department, Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning,
District Offices of Government Departments
4.3 Land values
The likelihood of a road being developed in an area may affect land values. If the road is perceived as
bringing economic opportunities such as the development of commercial enterprises, this may
increase land values and rentals particularly at small centres. Those who own properties at these
centres will benefit. However, those who are renting such properties for residential and/or
commercial purposes may be adversely affected.
The values of lands over which the road is planned to pass may depreciate in their values
particularly if the level of compensation is below market rates. Such properties may be difficult
to dispose if prospective buyers are aware that some of the land will be taken up by the road. For
those regions that were previously inaccessible or with poor transport, the possibility of the road
being developed in such an area may cause land values to appreciate before road construction has
started.
Mitigation: Stakeholders should be informed about when the proposed road construction is likely to
take place. The likely benefits of the proposed road such as improved access to commercial centres
and areas that were previously inaccessible should be maximised in selecting the road alignment.
Monitoring: MOWHC and Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment should monitor land values
during the period when those who have been forced to relocate due to the road are in the process of
purchasing alternative pieces of lands. This is best done through routine meetings at the district level
during which issues related to the proposed road works are discussed.
Method of Analysis: Potential changes of land values are best analysed based on case studies. This
entails selecting regions with similar physiographic and socio-economic conditions which have had
similar road projects. The effect of road projects on land values are then determined by comparing
land values before and after the road project. If changes in rentals are likely to occur, a comparison
of pre- and post road project rentals for these case studies can also be used as a basis for analysing
such impacts. The effect of these changes on various population groups will have to be examined.

A- 13
4.4 Agricultural Activities
The impacts of road planning on agricultural activities will depend on the benefits and costs which
farmers perceive as arising from the road. Farmers who are likely to lose pieces of their lands to
the road may down scale their operations as they perceive the future to be uncertain. This often
occurs if the persons to be affected are not adequately informed about when the road will be
developed, and the exact areas to be affected. For those roads that will cause relocation of
subsistence farmers, if these farmers have not been clearly informed about when this relocation will
take place, some of them may abandon cultivation of food crops in anticipation of being relocated.
This will result in food shortages and there the need for central government to provide food. Farmers
may also abandon soil conservation practices if they expect to be relocated as a result of the
planned road.
Mitigation: Farmers who are likely to be adversely affected should be informed about the timing of
road construction. If any relocation has to take place, those affected should be given a chance to
indicate the form of compensation acceptable to them. The alignment of the road should be selected
so that it maximises benefits such as improvement in agricultural production. This may require that
roads linking areas that are agricultural productive with the planned main road should also be
developed.
Monitoring: It is recommended that MOWHC, the Department of Agriculture, and other government
agencies should routinely meet to brief each other on possible adverse and beneficial impacts of the
road. Agricultural records that are periodically collected by those in charge of agricultural activities
will form the basis of monitoring impacts of the proposed road works on agricultural production.
Method of Analysis: The method of analysis of impacts of road planning on agricultural activities is
similar to that for social and political stability. Attitudes of farmers to the road project need to be
established. Existing agricultural practices in the area of influence of the road have to be determined.
Impacts of road planning on agricultural practices in other areas with similar physiographic and
socio-economic conditions that have had similar projects can also be used.

5 IMIPACTS OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION
5.1 Sources of Impacts
Road construction has several components or activities that are likely to cause environmental
impacts. The activities to be undertaken will depend on the scale of construction. Some of the
activities that are likely to take place during road construction are given below.
Establishment of construction camp
Construction of temporary/permanent accommodation
Provision of sewage disposal facilities
Development of a water source
Construction of workshops
Transportation of construction materials and equipment
Recruitment of the labour force.
Preparation of the road site
Clearance of vegetation
Removal of top soil
Diversion of streams
Demolition of buildings
Earthworks
Removal and placement of earth from cut and borrow pits
Construction of detours and access routes
Ouarrying and Borrow pits
Blasting
Crushing and screening of materials
Excavating borrow materials
Transportation of crushed stones and borrow materials
Asphalt Plant Operation
Screening and mixing of aggregates.
Heating of bitumen and aggregates separately and then jointly using wood or fuel.
Transportation of asphalt concrete mixes to the road for laying using paver.
Drainage provision
Construction of drainage structures, e.g. culverts, bridges.
Retraining of rivers and erosion protection works.
Excavation of side drains, mitre drains, and cut-off drains.
Pavement Construction
Construction of pavement layers and surfacing using different layers.
Construction of erosion protection works.
5.2 Loss of Productive Soils
Roads are ideally located on stable soils with flat to moderate slopes. Such soils are also ideal for
agricultural purposes. The area occupied by the road will never be used for agricultural purposes.
Therefore productive soils which occur on the road will be lost and never be available for
agriculture. This will be a direct and irreversible impact of road development. The magnitude of this



A- 15
loss may be insignificant at the regional level, but quite significant to individual farmers affected by
this loss.
Mitigation: The road alignment should be selected so as to minimise loss of lands that are being used
productively for agriculture. Where loss of productive soils is inevitable, the width of the road should
be minimised in these areas. Farmers who lose productive lands should be compensated.
Monitoring: It is recommended that MOWHC should collaborate with the Department of
Agriculture, and local authorities to monitor agricultural production, and household incomes for those
who will have lost significant proportions of their agricultural lands to the road.
Method of Analysis and Assessment: The productivity of soils occurring along the selected route of
the road has to be determined. During preliminary analysis and assessment, the hard copy and digital
Soil Map of Uganda produced during this study should be used to establish soil types occurring along
the road. This information should then be augmented by field work which is aimed at determining the
exact soil types along the proposed route of the road. Agricultural practices along the road will also
assist in determining the productivity of these soils. Soils occurring along the road are then classified
into the following groups which were used in the 1996 State of the Environment Report For Uganda
(NEMA, 1996):
*      Soils of very high to high productivity
*     Soils of moderate productivity, e.g. clay loam,
Soils of fair productivity, e.g. sandy loam, yellow loam, red sandy loam, sandy,
X     Soils of low productivity, e.g. stony loam, rocky and coarse soils, peat loam,
*      Soils of negligible productivity, e.g. hydromorphic soils mainly on swamps,
*      Soils of nil productivity, e.g. skeletal soils or exposed hard rock.
The percentage area of the road covered by any of the above soil groups should then be determined
which assists in assessing the significance of the impact. For each of the property holders who will
lose some land to the road, the proportion of his/her land with the above soils, and that which will be
lost to the road should be used to establish impact significance for each property owner. A measure of
the economic loss can be obtained by determining incomes which farmers would have obtained under
current land use practices from the affected pieces of land. The loss needs to be expressed as a
percentage of total income in order to establish the significance of the loss.

5.3 Soil erosion
Road works can initiate and/or accelerate soil erosion through various activities which offset the
balance between factors which stabilise and those that tend to destabilise soils. Heavy vehicles that
are used during construction compact soils resulting in the reduction of their infiltration capacities.
This promotes overland flows or runoff. Therefore temporary access roads and detours which are
not rehabilitated at the end of road construction, will cause overland flow which initiates soil
erosion. In areas with steep slopes and erodible soils, gully erosion can be easily formed on these
roads. The various cuts and embankments made along the road tend to reduce the stability of slopes.
Landslides are not uncommon on cuts with unstable slopes. The concentration of flows at both inlets



A- 16
and outlets of culverts tends to cause scouring. Such increases will enable the flow to scour and
cause soil erosion. Side drains in areas with steep slopes have a similar effect.
Quarry and borrow pits that are not rehabilitated often experience mudslumps which initiate gully
erosion, particularly in semi-arid areas with poor vegetation cover, or soils which are prone to
pipeflow.
Clearing of vegetation along the roadside and due to other road construction activities causes a
reduction on the vegetation cover. The soil is exposed to rain drop impact which causes soils erosion.
Vegetation provides organic matter to the soil, while roots bind the soil together both of which inhibit
soil erosion. Loss of vegetation will therefore cause a reduction in the organic matter content and
roots, which will weaken the soil structure making it erodible.
Soil erosion arising from road construction related activity can be both a short and long-term impact
depending on whether measures are put in place to arrest it. The rate of soil erosion tends to increase
with time. Therefore initially soil erosion will have a small magnitude, but once gully erosion has
been initiated then the impact will have a large magnitude. Soil erosion should always be regarded as
a significant impact since once gully erosion begins, it is difficult if not impossible to control. It
should also be regarded as a significant impact since soil erosion will often threaten the safety of the
road. In arid and semi-arid areas, soil erosion is already a major problems, therefore any further
increase in the area affected should be regarded as being significant.
Mitigation: Structures for draining runoff from and along access roads and detours should be put in
place. The Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications Road Design Manual (MOWTC, 1994)
gives guidelines on the design of drainage channels and culverts in order to minimise soil erosion.
According to these guidelines, flow velocities should be between I and 3.5 mls for culverts, and not
more than 0.6 m/s for unlined side drains, catchwater berms and mitre drains. The Road Design
Manual recommends the following measures to minimise scouring of culverts
- composite headwall/wingwallUapron structure,
* endwall structure,
- mitre structure, and
* projecting end.
Measures recommended by MOWHC for minimising scouring at bridges include
* gabion matresses,
* hand place or dumped rip-rap,
* plain or grouted stone pitching, and
. concrete.
Soil erosion within drainage channels such as side drains, catchwater berms and mitre banks can be
minimised by
* concrete lining,
* stone pitching,
* grass sodding, and
* reducing their slopes.
Quarries and borrow pits should be rehabilitated after use. The MOHWC's General Specifications for
Road and Bridge Works (Volume IIIA) requires in sub-section 3105 that



A - 17
"On completion of his operations in a borrow area, the Contractor shall reinstate the entire
area so as to blend with the surrounding area and to permit the re-establishment of
vegetation .... All haul roads shall be obliterated and the surface scarified, earthbanks
constructed to prevent erosion...
Owners of properties on which quarries and borrow pits occur should be consulted in order to
determine their preferred rehabilitation method. Some land owners may prefer to use these pits for
storing surface runoff.
The removal of vegetation along the roadside should be minimised. Temporarily cleared areas should
be re-vegetated as soon as possible. Stockpiles should not be placed adjacent to streams or on slopes.
Covering of stockpiles during the wet season should be considered.
Monitoring: The resident engineer should ensure that environmental mitigation measures agreed
when the road project was approved are implemented by the contractor. MOWHC will have to
monitor that contractors abide by its specifications regarding construction of measures to minimise
soil erosion at culverts and bridges, and within drainage channels. It is also the duty of MOWHC to
verify that rehabilitation of haul roads, and borrow areas are undertaken. MOWHC will ultimately
have the overall responsibility that NEMA conditions for project approval are complied with.
Method of Analysis:. The analysis of the potential for scouring along drainage channels requires the
knowledge of flow velocities that are likely to occur within these channels. Manning equation is one
of the most commonly used technique for estimating flow velocities in channels. This requires
knowledge of the slope along a drain, cross-sectional properties of the drain (channel shape, likely
depths of water, cross-sectional area, and wetted perimeter), and materials forming the channel (i.e.
cohesive, non-cohesive soils, lining). When the range flow velocities in drainage channels have been
established, then the possibility of materials forming the channel being moved by flowing water is
determined using sediment transport fromulas. Observations made on drains with similar slopes and
occurring in areas with similar rainfall patterns can also be used to estimate the likelihood of soil
erosion taking place in the drainage channels to be constructed along the proposed road.
Soil profiles on cuts should be established through field observations. Shallow soils occurring above
impermeable formations are prone to slipping on steep slopes. Accumulation of runoff along slopes
may initiate rock falls. The area drained by side drains can be used to estimate volumes of expected
runoff on these slopes.

5.4 Runoff
Roads intersect drainage basins or catchment areas. A road may act as a barrier to the natural
flow of surface water. If facilities for draining this water which has been obstructed are poorly
designed, this will lead to damming of water. The conventional structures used to drain water are



A- 18
culverts, side drains, mitre drains and bridges. Culverts concentrate flows at their inlets and outlets
resulting in increased rates of flow, and consequently scouring. They may also silt up and causing
ponding upstream of a road, and perhaps a loss of wetland areas downstream. This impact often has
a small magnitude. However, if this leads to soil erosion then the impact although initially minor
should be regarded as being significant. Such soil erosion as has already been indicated may
endanger the road itself, and be a hazard to traffic.
Side drains and other drainage structures which intersect water flowing towards the road and then
dispose this water onto open lands may flood agricultural lands and homesteads. Flooding of
cultivated fields may be a minor impact when the whole length of the road is considered. However, as
far as the individual farmer is concerned this impact could be very significant as it may adversely
affect family incomes and the provision of food.
Deposition of eroded materials, boulders and tree logs and branches may take place at bridges and
culverts. Such deposition will restrict flows and cause streams to overflow their banks causing
localised flooding which may disrupt traffic. Where a river just overflows its banks without any
disruption to traffic, the deposition of silt on the river banks will eventually cause water logging.
Water used for road construction may be sourced from nearby streams and dams. Such use may
deplete the available surface water resources. The supply of water for watering both domestic and
wild animals will be adversely affected. Where the local community sources its water from these
open water bodies, they will also be adversely affected.
Mitigation: The Ministry of Works, Housing and Communication Road Design Manual gives
procedures that should be used to design bridges and culverts so that they do not cause flows to over
flow onto banks, erosion and deposition of materials transported by flowing water. The standard
procedure requires that a design flood should be estimated for each culvert and bridge. The Road
Design Manual specifies that the return period of design floods for minor bridges should be I in 20
years, while this is I in 25 years for major bridges. The recommended technique for estimating design
floods is either the Rational Formula or the United States Soil Conservation Method.
Runoff from mitre drains or offshoots should not be disposed onto agricultural lands or towards
homesteads. Excessively long side drains which can accumulate high volumes of water should be
avoided as such water can flood small streams.
In areas where there is limited water for road construction, water for road construction purposes
should be obtained from sources that do not adversely affect the local community. This may entail
sourcing water from distant water sources. Alternatively boreholes could be drilled for use during
road construction. After the completion of road construction, these boreholes should be handed to the
local community for its own use.
Monitoring: The resident enginerr should monitor that all drainage structures comply with their
designs, and that water used for road construction does not cause adverse impacts to communities.
MOWHC should periodically consult local communities to establish any adverse impacts of
abstraction of water for road construction.
Method of Analysis: The amount of runoff that is likely to be generated by catchments intersected
by the road should be determined. This will require measurement of catchments areas upstream of the
road, and then use the Rational Formula to estimate flows formed on these catchments. The capacity
of culverts and bridges to discharge these flows without causing ponding upstream of the road is then
assessed.



A- 19
The magnitude of the impact of soil erosion on the road can be quantified by estimating the total
length of the road affected that is likely to be affected. An economic indicator for this impact which
may be used is the cost of repairing damaged sections of the roads. If eroded sections of the road are
likely to cause accidents, an estimate of the value of goods transported on this road could be included
in estimating the potential economic loss.
The impact of abstracting water for road construction on water supply, can be quantified in terms of
volumes taken and the number of people and animals adversely affected. Water prices for raw water
can also be used to quantify the impact. If the depletion of water will cause households to seek distant
sources of water, then the extra time and distance covered in seeking alternative sources should be
included in measuring the impact. Prevailing costs of labour in that community or productivity per
capita could be included in quantifying the impact. The significance of this impact will depend on
whether the use of water for road construction will deplete local water resources or not. If the local
water resources will be depleted, then the impact should be regarded as significant particularly if
distant water sources have to be used by the local community.

5.5 Groundwater
In regions where the water table is near the surface, drainage facilities are often installed during road
construction in order to lower the water table. Excavations along cuts, quarries and borrow pits may
lead to the drainage of groundwater. This will again lower the water table which has potential
adverse effects on the supply of water to nearby wells. Road embankments may obstruct the flow
of groundwater resulting in the increase in water tables upstream of the road. Such a rise in the water
table will cause water logging. Waterlogging has potential adverse impacts on crop production if this
affects cultivated lands. This can also pose a danger to both domestic and wild animals as they may
get stuck in the mud. The rise in water tables does however improve water supply to wells.
In arid and semi-arid regions, water used for various road construction activities including that for
domestic purposes by road construction workers is obtained from boreholes. This is likely to put
pressure on existing boreholes. The supply of water to local communities may be compromised.
Where hand pumps are used, they may break down due to overuse. In some cases the local
communities have been forced to source water from distant sources due to the depletion of
groundwater as a result of its usage during road construction. The impact of road construction on
groundwater resources can be quantified using the same approaches as those for surface water
resources.
Mitigation: Excessive drainage of groundwater should be avoided near wells and boreholes used for
water supply. Sub-surface drainage structures should be put in place where the road is likely to cause
an increase in water tables that will cause waterlogging.
Monitoring: Where water for road construction is obtained from boreholes, particularly those used
by the local community, The resident enginerr should regularly consult community leaders of any
problems that may arise. MOWHC on its part should also regularly consult these leaders.



A -21
Sanitary facilities should be provided at sites where workers are accommodated. This will entail
putting up toilets and facilities for the disposal of solid wastes. Workers should be sensitised about
implications of wanton disposal of waste, and there should be standing rules prohibiting such
practices. Unlined pit latrines should be avoided in areas with shallow water tables. Ministry of
Works, Housing and Communication General Specifications for Road and Bridge Works Volume
IIIA requires that the contractor shall put up adequate sanitary arrangements.
Used oil should be taken for recycling and should never be disposed onto open lands or in pits.
Monitoring: The resident enginerr should monitor that all wastes are disposed following agreed
procedures. Potential impacts of eroded soils on water quality is best monitored by MOWHC
monitoring that no significant soil erosion takes place due to all road construction activities.
MOWHC should keep open lines of communication with other government agencies such as
Fisheries Department, Department of Water Development, Uganda Wildlife Authority, so that
MOWHC is informed of any water quality problems arising from road construction.
Method of analysis: The potential for soil being washed into rivers is analysed using methods
described in 2.5.3 and 2.5.4 above. A preliminary analysis of the likely impact of sediments from the
road on water quality can be done by comparing peak flows from a drain along a road to those
occurring on the stream into which it discharges. If peak flows from such a road drain are relatively
small in comparison to those on the stream into which it drains (e.g. less than 10% of peak flows on
the relevant stream), then it is likely that the stream has adequate flows to dilute sediments
originating from the road. However sediments originating from the river may significantly affect the
water quality if a river already has considerable sediments. Swamps and sluggish rivers may not have
adequate dilution due to low flow velocities.
The impact on water quality can be quantified using changes in the values of relevant water quality
indicators, e.g. turbidity. Where a road crosses wetlands which have species that are likely to be
adversely affected by a proposed road, then an inventory of species occurring in such wetlands must
be compiled. The sensitivity of these species to changes in various water quality factors should be
used to determine the potential impact of changes in water quality due to road construction. The
status of the species affected need to be determined including whether they are endemic, protected,
rare or endangered. If such wetlands are used as sources of food by the local community, then an
economic value can be given on the basis of prevailing market prices of products obtained from them.
The potential impact of poor sanitation on the spread of water borne diseases is established by
determining the size and proportion of the population that uses sources of water that are likely to be
contaminated due to road construction activities. This will require an assessment of the drainage
patterns to establish areas downstream of road construction camps. Records of health institutions
should also be used to establish prevalent water borne diseases in areas likely to be affected by road
construction.

5.7 Air quality
Heavy vehicles used during construction will generate a lot of dust. Quarrying and all various
earthworks do also produce dust. In areas with a substantial vegetal cover and infrequent rains, dust
will be deposited on plant surfaces. Such deposition may interfere with pollination and
photosynthesis resulting in stunted plant growth. This impact will mostly affect plants in the vicinity
of road construction activities that generate dust. In most cases this impact is minor as it is restricted
to a narrow stretch along these dirt roads. For most road construction projects the impact will be
insignificant since dust which accumulates on plant surfaces will eventually be washed away by
falling rain.
If heavy vehicles pass through dirt roads which are near settlements, dust produced may stain
clothing particularly on washing lines. Similarly if these vehicles pass near shopping centres, dust
generated may be deposited on items being displayed for sale. Those shops that are exposed to this
impact may find customers shunning their goods. This impact may arise during road construction
only and may be minor if only a small population is affected. However, if these gravel roads will be
used after construction, dust may become a major impact to those who will always be exposed to it.
For both residential and commercial areas the impacts of dust could be significant. Households
will always have to use extra soap for washing clothes. Dust is a health hazard as it can lead to
silicosis. Dust is often contaminated with bacteria and fungal spores which may cause respiratory
infections. Business enterprises will lose customers to those locations not exposed to dust.
Heavy vehicles used during construction may produce gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide,
sulphur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen that may adversely affect residents located near the roads
used. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the speed and direction of prevailing winds in
relation to settled areas and population densities in the affected areas. If gaseous emission get to
undesirable levels, this can cause respiratory diseases such as asthma particularly among the very
young and elderly.
Mitigation: Sites which generate dust such as at quarries, borrow pits, and along access routes and
detours should be watered to prevent dust generation. The use of materials with low dust for paving
the road will reduce dust production. Planting of trees and hedge buffers between the road and
settlements will minimise the amount of dust that will get to these settlements.
Monitoring: The resident enginerr should ensure that watering of haul roads used during road
construction is undertaken in order to minimise dust formation. It is suggested that MOWHC should
collaborate with Ministry of Health to determine any adverse health effects of road construction. This
should be done through regular inter-departmental briefings meetings dealing with the road project.
Method of Analysis: The distance between quarries, access roads, and other potential sources of
dust, and settlements should be used to determine the likely impact of dust. During preliminary
analysis 1:50 000 maps can be used to establish settlement patterns in the areas where dust is likely to
be produced. The direction of prevailing winds will also assist in determining areas likely to be
affected by dust. Barriers to the movement of dust such as vegetation need also to be identified in the
field. Ministry of Health officials should be consulted regarding possible health impacts of dust and
vehicular emissions in the project area.

5.8 Vegetation
Clearance of vegetation along the right of way of the road, at quarries and borrow pits, and camping
sites will cause a loss of vegetation. Vegetation clearance may cause loss of rare species, species of
medicinal and commercial values. Fragmentation of habitats may create sub-units which are
weak and easily invaded by other species. Workers employed during road construction may also
cause substantial losses of vegetation when they seek firewood for heating bitumen and/or domestic
purposes.
MitigationVegetation should only cleared where it will interfere with road construction and/or
present a hazard to traffic. In such instances, the local community and/or responsible agency should
be given a chance to harvest trees with a commercial value. Local herbalists should be given a chance
to salvage trees with medicinal uses. Seeds of rare species should be collected for replanting at
preferably sites in the same locality. Some of these seeds should be sent to the national herbarium for
storage.
Workmen involved in road construction should be provided with sources of energy for cooking and
warming, e.g. paraffin, gas, electricity. Cutting of trees for firewood by the workers should be strictly
forbidden. The only firewood which the workers should be allowed to use is that obtained from trees
cleared along the road way.
Materials should not be stockpiled on vegetated areas. Revegetation of areas where vegetation was
removed or destroyed should be considered. Areas where soils were compacted during road
construction such as along temporary access roads, the soil should be loosened through ripping to
enable infiltration of water and growth of plants.
Method of analysis: During preliminary analysis, both the hard copy and digital maps of vegetation
in Uganda produced during this study should be used to establish vegetation cover in the road project
area. The National Biomass Study Map (Forest Department) will assist in identifying types of
vegetation occurring along the proposed road. An inventory of vegetation occurring along the road
should then be undertaken. This will entail the determination of species composition, densities, and
maturity. The proportion of the area covered by each species or vegetation community to be affected
by road project in comparison to the total area covered by the species or vegetation community is one
measure of the magnitude of the impact. An economic value of the vegetation lost is another possible
measure of the impact of vegetation clearance. Such a value may be based on economic uses of
particular species, e.g. costs of timber, fuel wood, fruits, etc. Where trees are cleared in areas used for
recreation or tourism, the prices paid by individuals to travel and stay in such forests is another basis
for valuing vegetation losses. The legal status of vegetation species occurring along the road needs to
be established. The Department of Forest has to be consulted in this regard. Lists produced by the
Convention of the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) should also be used



A -24
Monitoring: The resident engineer should monitor that only trees which occur within the road
reserve, and those which were marked for clearance are cut. It is also recommended that the Forests
Department should undertake periodic inspections of vegetation clearance where road construction is
taking place.

5.9 Animals
Clearance of vegetation during road construction may destroy or disturb habitats of animals. Roads
cutting through hilly areas may destroy breeding sites of birds some of which may be endangered.
Noise produced during road construction may cause migration of some animals. A road may cross
corridors used by animals during their daily and/or seasonal movement for feeding and breeding.
Such an interruption may affect a whole generation as it may not be able to breed. Animals are prone
to collide with construction vehicles particularly reptiles, and nocturnal animals which are blinded by
headlights. Fragmentation of animals habitats and their populations into small isolated populations
may lead to their demise. Road construction crews may also engage in poaching animals. The
magnitude of the impact on animals will again depend on the type of species affected, their values
and status. For those species that are widespread in the affected region, the impact could be minor.
Although poaching may be minor it could be significant as it may attract other poachers.
Mitigation: Where significant habitats are destroyed due to road construction, attempts should made
to find sites where such habitats can be recreated through planting of relevant tree species. In the
event that a road crosses animal corridors, facilities to allow animals to cross the road should be
considered, e.g. wildlife tunnels. Re-alignment of the road should be considered to prevent
fragmentation of animals habitats. Traffic signs to warn motorists about the presence of animals
should be put up where ever animals are likely to be found on the road. Endangered species should be
relocated to areas where they are not threatened by the road.
Poaching of wild animals by road construction workers should be strictly prohibited. It should be
made clear to all the workers that anybody found poaching animals will be dismissed and presented
to law enforcement agencies for prosecution.
Monitoring: Where road works are likely to affect wildlife, the Uganda Wildlife Authority should
take a lead in monitoring these impacts. The contractor should monitor that his/her employees are not
involved in poaching. MOWHC and Uganda Wildlife Authority should liaise with the police so that
they assist in monitoring poaching.
Method of analysis: During the preliminary analysis, the locations of National Parks and Forest
Reserves in relation to the proposed road should be used to determine if road construction activities
are likely to affect wildlife. Where a road passes through or close to these areas, then the Uganda
Wildlife Authority should be consulted to determine potential impacts of road construction. Field



A -25
work will then has to be undertaken to substantiate any impacts that may have been identified. Type
of species and their characteristics such as population, density, habitats need to be determined. The
specific technique to be used to obtain these characteristics will depend on types of species. Local
communities should also be consulted. The legal status of these species should be established by
examining the Uganda Wildlife Statute and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered
Species. The Uganda Wildlife Authority should be consulted in order to determine the significance of
any impacts that may be identified

5.10 Commercial activities
Workers engaged during road construction will often have high disposable incomes. Where the
number of people employed is high, this increase in local incomes will increase business activity in
the project area. Contractors may also engage local entrepreneurs to undertake some of the repairs to
equipment which will also improve local incomes. The local community may also sell some of their
agricultural produce to construction crews. This again improves households incomes. The magnitude
of business activity generated by each road construction project will depend on the number of
employees recruited during construction.
Mitigation Measures: Contractors involved during road construction should where ever possible
obtain various types of goods from the local area, and within Uganda. Local commercial
enterpreneurs should be given first preference when sub-contracting road construction related tasks,
e.g. provision of food, fuels, offices and accommodation, transportation of road construction
materials, earthworks.
Method of analysis: The analysis of potential impacts on commercial activities requires that an
inventory of commercial activities within the road project area, and goods that can be supplied locally
should be compiled. Business organisations can assist in obtaining this information.
Sources of Data
Ministry of Trade
5.11 Unplanned settlements
Construction projects often hire casual workers who may be coming from distant places. Contractors
provide housing for their semi- or permanent employees. When these casual workers come from
distant places and there is no accommodation provided for them, these workers will  erect
temporary structures for their accommodation. Such unplanned settlements may also attract



A -26
members of the local community without adequate shelter. These settlements may with time develop
into major unplanned settlements which obstruct local development plans. They may also require the
provision of social services such as health and educational facilities which will not have been
budgeted for. The magnitude of this impact will depend on the number of employees who are likely
to be accommodated at these unplanned settlements. In areas that are prone to infectious diseases,
the development of unplanned settlements needs to be regarded as a significant impact. An unplanned
settlement in one area often induces the development of similar settlements in other regions.
Mitigation: Road construction contractors should give preference to locals when recruiting the
labour force so as to minimise the development of unplanned settlements. Contractors should provide
accommodation for all their workers not recruited from the local area. Unauthorised structures should
not be allowed at camps housing the workers.
Monitoring: The contractor should ensure that MOWHC conditions regarding erection of structures
is complied with. MOWHC should also ensure that this requirement is satisfied through their own
inspections, and consulting local authorities and community leaders.
Method of Analysis: The 1:50 000 maps should be used during preliminary analysis to determine
settlement patterns in an area. District officials should then be consulted to establish land use plans in
the road project area. Rules of local authorities regarding the development of settlements should be
established, including their ability to control the development of settlements. Then the potential of
unplanned settlements occurring can then be assessed

5.12 Employment opportunities
Road construction projects offer employment opportunities even to those with minimal skills
particularly in rural areas. The creation of employment opportunities is a positive impact which
can be quite significant depending on the number of people recruited. Some of the employees are
recruited without any skills, but may develop them during road construction.
The creation of employment opportunities may also have negative impacts. School children may
abandon their education due to the attraction of immediate incomes.
Mitigation: Preference should be given to the locals when recruiting the labour force. School going
children should never be engaged as employees during the road construction project.
Monitoring: MOWHC should review recruitment procedures of unskilled workers to ensure that
local communities are given the first preference when recruiting such workers.
Method of analysis: The potential number of employees to be recruited from the local community
has to be established through consultations with contractors who have undertaken similar projects.
Officials in the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communication will also be able to assist in
undertaking this task based on experience with road projects. The availability of people who can be



A -27
recruited from local communities needs to be established through discussions with local authorities,
and/or questionnaire surveys. Average income levels in these communities will have to be compared
with likely wages/salaries during road construction.
Sources of data
Local authorities
Statistics Department
5.13 Social services
Workers recruited during road construction and their families will often use social services such as
educational, health and water supply occurring in the project area. If the number of people brought
into the project area is relatively high in comparison to the capacity of the facilities available,
negative impacts may arise due to excessive pressure on the limited resources. The local
community will be adversely affected as they compete for the same resources with employees of the
road project. This impact can be quite significant if people pay for education, health, and water since
road construction workers will have relatively high incomes and can get priority in accessing these
services.
Mitigation: Contractors should strive to recruit the labour force from the local community in order to
minimise overloading of the social infrastructure. In regions with limited social services and where
the contractor will have a relatively large labour force which will reside at one location for a
considerable time, the contractor should strive to provide facilities such as clinics.
Monitoring: It is recommended that MOWHC consult regularly those providing social services in
order to identify any undesirable pressure being exerted on these services.
Method of analysis: The likely number of employees who will be recruited during road construction,
and the population of their dependencies that will be accommodated at camps for road construction
crews will have to be estimated from reports of Ministry of Works, Housing and Communication
dealing with previous road construction projects. The possible impact which such a population can
cause will be determined based on the likely changes on social services such as number of patients
per nurse/doctor, school pupils per teacher, availability of potable water per capita. This analysis will
require that the prevailing status of these social indicators are obtained through reviews of reports of
the Statistical Department, interviews with relevant officials, or questionnaire surveys.

5.14 Cultural heritage
Cultural heritage includes sites of archaeological, historical, religious and cultural importance. These
sites may be important at the local, national and international levels. During excavations made along
the road and at quarries and borrow pits, these sites can be easily damaged or destroyed completely.



A -28
Noise, blasting, and settlements for road construction crews located near such sites often diminish
their values. The magnitude of impacts on cultural heritage will depend on whether the site is
important at the local, national or international levels.
Mitigation: Siting of roads near sites of cultural significance should be avoided where ever possible.
If the road will destroy archeological and historical sites, national agencies responsible for these
aspects should be consulted in order to deternine the best solution for such a problem. Where a road
will necessitate removal of graves, local leaders and religious leaders should be consulted about the
best procedure to undertake such rituals.
Monitoring: The contractor's site engineer and MOWHC should regularly consult community
leaders of any possible adverse effects on cultural heritage.
Method of analysis: During preliminary analysis the map of the locations of archeological and
historical sites produced during this study should be used to determine if a road project is likely to
affect any of these sites. Consultations should be undertaken with local communities to determine any
archeological, historical and cultural sites including graveyards that may be impacted upon by the
road. The assessment of the significance of potential impacts should be done in consultation with the
Antiquities and Museums Department. The proportion of the population that will be concerned about
impacts on these sites is a possible measure of the magnitude of the impacts. The significance of
these impacts could be assessed taking into account national and/or international legal provisions
which protect these sites.

5.15 Aesthetics and landscape
Excavations made along cuts, at quarries and borrow pits may create visually obtrusive features. Sites
at which spoil materials are dumped may have a similar effect. Roads that cut across valleys, forests
and hilly areas may impair the natural beauty of the landscape. The magnitude of this impact is
difficult to assess. The proportion of the population which regards such changes to the landscape as
being objectionable is one possible indicator of the impact. Where these changes affect areas used for
tourism and recreation, the price which visitors are prepared to pay in order to enjoy such features
is another possible indicator which can be used to analyse this impact.
Mitigation: Quarries and borrow pits should not be located on prominent relief features that will be
visually obtrusive. Spoil materials including solid waste produced at camping sites for road
construction crews should be properly disposed.
Monitoring: It is recommended that MOWHC does regularly consult organisations providing
services to tourists in the project area to establish any adverse impacts that may arise during road
construction.



A -29
Method of analysis: The analysis of the impact of a road project on the aesthetical appeal of the
landscape can be analysed by consulting local communities, operators of tourism enterprises and
tourists. With respect to landscapes used for tourism, incomes generated by tourism operators can be
used in valuing these landscapes. Prevailing prices of land in areas with unique landscapes is another
approach which can be used.

5.16 Health and safety
Construction crews may facilitate the transmission of diseases in the project area, e.g. diphtheria,
malaria, tetanus, sexually transmitted diseases (AIDS). Poor sanitation at construction camps may
cause water borne diseases. Diseases that are endemic in the project area may also be transmitted to
other areas by construction crews. During road construction various ditches, trenches, disused tyres,
and containers are sometimes left lying around, and these can collect water. Such water provides
breeding sites for various disease vectors like malaria. The spread of such diseases can significantly
affect the local community.
Detours along the road being constructed pose a danger to traffic particularly if there are inadequate
road signs.
Mitigation: Road construction workers should be informed about diseases that are prevalent in the
project area, and how they can minimise their transmissions. Condoms should be made available to
construction crews. Contractors should provide workers with sufficient accommodation for married
couples to stay together.
Monitoring: The contractor should regularly consult those providing health services to determine
any changes in disease patterns that may be associated with road construction. MOWHC will also
have to regularly discuss with their counterparts any health implications of on-going road
construction.
Method of analysis: Diseases that are prevalent in the road project area and areas from which road
construction crews will be recruited, and the transmission modes of these diseases should be
established from records of health officials. The rates of transmission of these diseases should also be
obtained from the same sources. This information is then used to estimate the potential for the road
project to affect occurrences of these diseases.
The potential for accidents occurring due to road construction is analysed by examining areas of
potential conflicts between road construction traffic, current flows of vehicular and pedestrian traffic
in the project area. Current traffic flows could be obtained through interviews and/or questionnaire
surveys with inhabitants of the project area. The origins and destinations of various road users will
need to be established from these interviews and surveys. Discussions with district road engineers
will assist in obtaining most of this information. Maps indicating current traffic flows, and that of
road construction vehicles will assist in identifying locations where accidents may occur due to road
construction activities.

5.17 Noise
Heavy vehicles used during construction generate noise which may be undesirable if this occurs near
settlements. Such noise can hinder communication. Schools and hospitals are particularly
vulnerable to this impact. If construction takes place at night, noise produced by vehicles may
disturb sleep. Disturbance to sleep affects the productivity of workers and the performance of school
children. The impact of noise generated by construction vehicles will decrease with distance from
the source of such noise.
Mitigation: Access roads for haulage trucks used during road construction should not be located near
schools, hospitals and residential areas. Heavy vehicles should not be used at night near residential
areas.
Monitoring: Where road construction takes place near settlements, school heads and community
leaders should be regularly consulted to assess any adverse impacts that may be due to noise.
Method of analysis: During preliminary analysis, the location of road construction activities in
relationship to settlements can be established using 1:50 000 maps of Uganda, and the hard copy and
digital map of population density produced during this study. If a road passes through areas with high
population densities, noise produced during road construction is likely to cause adverse impacts.
Field surveys will then have to be undertaken to determine the type of settlements and their distances
from the route of the road, and sound barriers that may occur between the road and settlements, e.g.
high ground, forests. The size and nature of human population that is likely to be impacted upon by
noise produced from road construction activities has to be established from surveys. The assessment
of the significance of noise will take into account problems which such noise will cause, e.g.
disruption of sleep, communication problems in places of worship and at schools.

6. IMPACT OF ROAD OPERATION
6.1 Sources of Impacts
The environmental impacts of a road after its construction will arise due to
*      traffic on the road, and
*      the existence of the road.
Some of the impacts that are experienced at this stage will have been initiated during road
construction.
The methods of analysing these impacts, and potential sources of data for these analysis are similar to
those given for impacts of road construction activities. Therefore these methods and sources of data
are not repeated in this section.
6.2 Soils
The concentration of flowing water in various drainage structures such as culverts, side and mitre
drains will cause the flow to have relatively high velocities. These velocities may be sufficient to
initiate soil erosion. Subsurface flow of water along steep slopes on cuts can lead to mass
movements such as landslides and mudslumps.
Mitigation: Drainage structures should be designed so that they can contain expected flows along
them. Where there are steep slopes along drainage structures, energy dissipating facilities should be
installed, e.g. rip rap cascades. Paving of drainage structures can also be included to avoid soil
erosion.
6.3 Runoff
Once a road becomes operational, it will have very low infiltration rates. Most of the rainfall falling
on the road surface will form storm flows. These flows will be drained away from the road using
side drains. When this runoff is disposed on agricultural lands, it often causes flooding of these
lands. Silt deposited by this water impedes drainage. This will reduce crop productivity. Storm
flows formed on road surfaces may cause flooding on small streams. This impact can be significant if
the road intercepts runoff particularly in steep areas.
Mitigation: Mitre drains should not discharge into or towards cultivated lands and homesteads.
There is a need to have sufficient mitre drains in order to avoid flooding of streams into which side
drains will eventually discharge into.
6.4 Groundwater
Roads which intersect groundwater aquifers will lower the water table through seepage into side
drains. This may adversely affect groundwater supplies into nearby wells which are used by local
communities. Embankments may obstruct flow of groundwater resulting in the raising of water
tables. This will improve the supply of water to nearby wells. Increases in water table has potential
adverse effects if this causes water logging on agricultural lands.
Mitigation: Avoid excessive drainage of groundwater nearby wells used for water supply.



A - 32
6.5 Water quality
Poorly maintained gravel roads are prone to erosion. Similarly the shoulders of paved roads which are
not regularly maintained can be eroded. The concentration of water in various drainage structures
may also cause soil erosion. The eroded soils are likely to end up in streams which will increase the
turbidity of their waters. Such changes in turbidity deteriorates the quality of water. Phytoplankton
growth is inhibited by high turbidity which can adversely affect fish and other aquatic organisms
which feed on these phytoplanktons.
Accidents involving trucks ferrying hazardous substances may result in these substances being
washed into nearby streams. The impact will greatly depend on the type of hazardous substances that
has been spilled. There have been cases whereby a whole river has been affected by these substances
leading to the death of fish and other aquatic organisms. This impact can be very severe if human
beings consume such fish without knowing that the death of these fish was due to hazardous
substances.
Poorly maintained heavy vehicles may leak oil and diesel. The effect of such leakages tend to be
noticeable where these vehicles go up steep slopes. These materials accumulate on the road during
the dry season and are eventually washed into nearby streams during the wet season. This deteriorates
the water quality which over the years may cause changes in the composition of aquatic ecosystems
in the affected rivers.
Mitigation: Gravel roads should be maintained so as to avoid erosion of the pavement. Grass should
be planted along the unpaved road shoulder.
A contingency plan to deal with accidental spillage of hazardous substances as a result of road
accidents should be put in place. Trucks ferrying extremely hazardous substances should avoid
densely populated areas. It may be necessary that when such trucks are passing through an area,
agencies responsible for dealing with emergencies should be notified.
Vehicles inspections should be undertaken routinely and unroadworthy vehicles should not be
allowed on the roads. Education campaigns aimed at sensitising owners of vehicles about the
advantages of maintaining their vehicles should also be mounted.
6.6 Air quality
Dust generated along gravel roads will increase the concentration of particulate matter in the air near
such roads. If gravel roads are located close to settlements, these changes in air quality may cause
respiratory and eye infections. Dust does also stain clothing requiring frequent washing. The
settlement of dust on structures such as works of art impairs their aesthetical appeal.
The generation of dust by traffic passing through shopping centres causes objectionable impacts.
Dust which settles on products for sale will result in customers shunning the affected shops, and
consequently moving to shops not exposed to such conditions. A similar impact will be experienced
by offices exposed to dust.
Gaseous emissions from vehicles contain carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and
lead. These emissions present several health hazards such as respiratory infections, affecting the
brain (lead). Lead from vehicle emissions contaminates the soil, from which it is absorbed by plants.
These plants along the road may provide fodder to animals including livestock, and therefore lead



A -33
from vehicle emissions will affect the whole food chain. The adverse impacts of vehicular emissions
are likely to occur in areas that experience traffic congestion, (i.e. urban areas) and where vehicles
accelerate and decelerate to go over steep slopes. In Africa, the adverse impacts of gaseous emissions
are of significance in urban areas mostly. If the concentration of these emissions reach undesirable
levels, they may cause diseases. The World Health Organisation standards for the concentration of
carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and lead can be used as a basis for assessing if
the impacts of these gaseous emissions will be significant.
Mitigation: Paving of sections of gravel roads that pass through densely populated settlements
should be considered in order to minimise dust generation. Traffic congestion should be minimised in
built up areas by having adequate traffic management systems which are based on regular reviews of
the ability of the road network to handle the prevailing traffic loads. Some of the measures that can be
put in place to minimise congestion are provision of diversion routes and traffic lights.
6.7 Vegetation
Dust generated along gravel roads during the dry season settles on vegetation occurring along these
roads. This dust may affect pollination and photosynthesis of plants on which it settles, resulting
in stunted plant growth. This will only affect plants occurring along a narrow corridor on either side
of the road.
Persons using roads may cause fires when throwing away cigarettes, and not extinguishing fires
which may have been started when warming and/or cooking while waiting for public transport. These
fires can affect large areas particularly in forested areas. In semi-arid areas under savannah
woodlands, these fires cause major problems and destroy pastures. Human life and property could
be endangered by these fires. On the positive side, roads act as firebreaks which minimise loss of
vegetation, human life and property when bush fires occur.
Roads may improve access to areas with forest resources. Illegal cutting of vegetation for firewood
for domestic and commercial use may result. Excessive harvesting of forest resources such as fruits
and timber is a potential adverse effect of the improvement of access to these areas. In some regions
the movement of tourist has resulted in the development of wood craft business. While this has
positive benefits in terms of household incomes, wood carvers can cause major adverse impacts on
vegetation. Wood carvers are selective with respect to the tree species they harvest. Such selective
harvesting has threatened some tree species with extinction.  Roads may also facilitate the
transmission of plant diseases.
Mitigation: Road signs waming road users not to start fires should be erected in areas with protected
forests. Farmers should be encouraged to construct fire guards. The road agency should collaborate
with local authorities and agencies responsible for the management of forests in order to prevent
illegal cutting of trees. Communities should be encouraged to develop woodlots from which they can
get fire wood and timber.
6.8 Animals
One of the major and most frequent impact of the use of roads are accidents involving both
domestic and wild animals particularly along roads with no fencing along them. The loss of
domestic animals particularly those used for draught power will adversely affect agricultural
activities. In some rural areas, livestock is the only viable investment, and therefore these accidents
will adversely affect any form of goods and services which could have been realised through such an
investment.



A - 34
Accidents involving wild animals may threaten endangered species particularly where a major road
goes through a national park. Roads may also improve access to areas with wild animals which
may result in poaching. Traffic noise may cause some animals to migrate from near the road. Roads
may also intersect corridors used by animals for moving daily or seasonally to feeding and breeding
grounds. If facilities to allow animals to cross these roads are not in place, then some species may be
threatened.
The transportation of livestock using the road may facilitate the spread of animals diseases such as
chicken pox, foot and mouth diseases.
Mitigation: Erect a fence along a road to prevent livestock getting onto the road. Education
campaigns aimed at sensitising communities about the dangers of letting livestock getting onto the
road should be undertaken. Road signs warning motorists about the presence of livestock and wild
animals should be erected where necessary. Speed limits should also be considered where animals are
likely to be found on the road. Wild life tunnels and culverts should be put in place in areas where
animals need to cross the road, e.g. forest reserves and parks.
6.9 Social interaction and community cohesion
Roads may disrupt traditional communication channels. Traffic on such roads will make it difficult
for the elderly and children to interact with colleagues across the road. This will result in split
communities. The movement of people may introduce alien and undesirable social practices
resulting in the dilution of social norms. Various vices such as crime, prostitution and break up of
families are some of the possible consequences. Major highways which are used by particularly by
international trucks are notorious for prostitution and breaking up of families.
Mitigation: Facilities to enable pedestrians to cross the road should be put in place in densely settled
areas. The road agency should collaborate with other agencies to mount education campaigns
sensitising communities about adverse effects of promiscuity.
6.10 Rural-urban migration
Road construction facilitates the movement of people, and one of the major and adverse impact of
this is rural-urban migration. The economically active find it easier to migrate to urban areas in
search of employment. The elderly, women and children are left behind to take care of themselves.
Crop production decreases due to lack of labour. Hunger and poverty become the norm for those
families and communities which experience significant migration of the economically active. Several
initiatives to improve these communities have failed due to the lack of economically active persons.
Rural-urban migration may also have beneficial impacts. Those who move to urban areas relieve
population pressure on the land in rural areas. They will also bring back new ideas to the rural areas
when they visit or retire to the rural areas. Household incomes are improved due to remittances from
urban areas. Such incomes can be used to improve the rural infrastructure, e.g. housing, water supply,
payment of school fees and for health services, purchasing of agricultural inputs.
Mitigation: The road agency should collaborate with other agencies so that the economic benefits of
the road are maximised, and therefore reduce rural-urban migration e.g. improvement of access to
markets may require construction of small roads linking agriculturally productive areas with the main
road.



A -35
6.11 Commercial activities
During the upgrading of roads to major roads, small commercial centres are in some cases by-
passed. Such centres will experience a decline in business activity. This may lead to bankruptcy and
consequently distress and loss of household incomes for those who own such enterprises. In some
cases the improvement of roads will make commercial centres much more accessible resulting in
improved business activity. This will lead to the growth of these centres with similar benefits being
realised in their hinterlands.
The improvement in a road may offer an opportunity to rural farmers to sell their produce. Such
development may boost agricultural production and improvement in household incomes. A road
may also offer an opportunity for the local community to sell crafts to tourists. This is a growing
industry which has had major and positive impacts to some communities. The development of road
side stalls often provides employment opportunities to women and the youth in rural areas where
there is usually limited opportunities for these groups.
Mitigation: Road development should include the provision of adequate parking spaces at shopping
centres. Where there is a potential for the development of road side stalls, space should be provided
for such needs.
6.12 Unplanned settlements
Positive benefits of roads such as improvement in business activities at commercial centres, and road
side stalls may induce the development of unplanned settlements. Initially temporary shelters are
erected at these centres and where road side stalls are located. These temporary shelters may lead into
squatter settlements. These unplanned settlements may be located within the road reserve or areas
earmarked for other uses.
Mitigation: The road agency should collaborate with the local authority during planning and
construction of the road. The local authority should be made aware of the possibility of unplanned
settlements developing along the road, and it should put in place measures for preventing such
developments. This will require the involvement of communities.
6.13 Cultural heritage
The improvement of access to areas of cultural heritage can bring positive impacts as more people
appreciate the importance of these sites. This may generate revenue for the maintenance of these
sites. An influx of excessive numbers of people to these sites has potential adverse effects. There may
be destruction to these sites.
Visitors to regions which were previously inaccessible may introduce believes and practices which
are not compatible with the prevailing norms. The elderly are often adversely affected as they lose
control over the youth. Traditional leadership structures are often weakened by the introduction of
these alien believes.
Mitigation: In areas with archeological and/or historical sites that are of interest to the public, roads
accessing these sites from the main road should be put in place. The local community and national
agency responsible for these sites should be involved in improving access to them.



A -36
6.14 Healtb and safety
Road transport may facilitate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (WIV), particularly those
roads used by trucks which have to cover long distances. Epidemics are easily spread when human
movement is facilitated by roads. Most epidemics such as cholera and malaria have spread easily
within and between countries in Africa due to the existence of roads. Rural areas are particularly
vulnerable as it often takes a considerable time before these epidemics are detected. This is
exacerbated by poor health facilities in rural areas.
Road operations often result in accidents involving human beings. Such accidents are quite common
where non-motorised traffic use the same roads as those used by vehicles. Some of the locations that
are prone to such accidents are where roads pass near schools and densely populated settlements.
Settlements along the road with inadequate lightning at night are also vulnerable to these accidents.
Upgrading of roads has positive impacts in terms of reducing traffic accidents.
Mitigation: Health education campaigns should be mounted in order to reduce promiscuous
activities. Facilities to enable pedestrians to cross the road such as under passes should be put in
place in densely settled areas. Road signs indicating the likelihood of pedestrians on the road should
be included. Speed limits can be incorporated where a road passes through a settled area. Basic
elements of road safety should be introduced in the school curricula.
6.15 Noise
Traffic movement may produce undesirable noise. This noise is produced by vehicle engines and
suspension, road-tyre wear, and in some cases passengers. Where a road passes near a settlement, the
noise produced may cause communication problems. Excessive noise near schools and hospitals
has major adverse impacts.
Mitigation: Roads that are likely to have heavy traffic should never be located near settlements.
Creation of forest belts between a road and settlements will reduce the exposure to noise for these
settlements.



A-37
ETA GUIDELINES FOR ROAD MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES
7.1 Introduction
The Ministry of Works, Housing and Communication (MO WHC) are responsible for maintenance of
9443 km of the classified road network which consists of 2133 km of paved roads, and 7310 km of
gravel roads. The objectives of MOWHC's road maintenance programme which are spelt out in their
maintenance manual are to
i.    keep all links of the road network safe and with an all-weather access,
ii.    minimise the need to undertake rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads,
iii.   protect the investment in the road infrastructure, and
iv.    support economic activities.
MOWHC's road maintenance programme is implemented by its 21 maintenance stations each of
which is headed by a district engineer, executive engineer, or office-in-charge. These maintenance
stations service equipment used for road maintenance, and supervise road works. It is the intention of
MOWHC that most of the road maintenance work will in future be undertaken by private contractors.
MOWHC classifies road maintenance works into a) routine, and b) periodic maintenance works.
Routine maintenance works consists of those activities that are routinely and continuously undertaken
on the road. Routine maintenance works could be undertaken manually (labour-based), or as
mechanised operations. Periodic maintenance comprises those activities which are done after some
time but not routinely, and as a once-off operations.
7.2 Routine manual maintenance
This will often involve the following activities
grass cutting,
ditch cleaning and cutting,
*     cleaning and minor repairs to culverts and bridges,
*     building scour controls,
*     repair of structures,
*     local sealing of bituminous surfaces,
*     filling on unpaved surfaces,
*     cleaning of drainage structures, and
*     repairing and replacing traffic signs.
Most of the activities which are undertaken during routine manual maintenance will have very little
environmental impacts. Ditch cleaning can result in mitre drains being directed towards agricultural
lands and homesteads. This will cause discharges from mitre drains to flood these agricultural lands
and homesteads. Flooding of agricultural lands will result in reduced crop yields, while discharging
of water onto homesteads creates a nuisance on these properties. In addition if such water collects
near homesteads, disease causing vectors (e.g. mosquitoes) can breed in this water.
Poorly constructed scour controls often fail and resulting in soil erosion along side drains.
Borrow areas from which materials for filling unpaved surfaces are sometimes not rehabilitated.
Collapsing of side slopes of borrow pits initiates gully erosion. Pits which are not rehabilitated are
a hazard to human beings and livestock. These pits create very unsightly landscapes.



A -38
Lack of or inadequate road signs warning other road users about on-going labour based
maintenance work can cause road accidents.
Manual road maintenance has several beneficial environmental impacts. It provides employment
opportunities to the local communities. Household incomes increase through this employment.
When road maintenance works are done by members of the local community, they will have a sense
of ownership of the road which is likely to improve their attitudes towards other public
infrastructural facilities, e.g. boreholes, electricity and telephone lines. These changes in attitudes are
likely to reduce incidences of vandalism of public property. The involvement of local communities
is likely to result in prompt repairs to damages on the road.
Mitigation: Mitre drains should not discharge towards or into agricultural lands and homesteads.
Scour controls should be constructed according to the MOWHC's specifications. Where erosion of
side drains is problematic such as in hilly areas, hand placed rip-rap, stone pitching, and concrete
lining should be considered.
Borrow pits that are used from one year to the other should have their slopes stabilised by
smoothening them. Borrow pits that are no longer in use should be rehabilitated. This may involve
backfilling these pits if materials for doing so are available, or stabilising side slopes.
It is a requirement that road signs warning other road users about on-going road maintenance work
are erected irrespective of whether it is manual or mechanised maintenance.
7.3 Routine mechanised maintenance
Mechanised routine maintenance falls into classes described below. The definitions used by
MOWHC in their Maintenance Manual are the ones given below. Impacts of these activities and the
suggested mitigation measures are given below.
Heavy grading
This involves reshaping and re-compaction of formation using materials recovered from drainage
channels and/or borrow areas. These materials are scarified and watered before compaction using a
grader that will make 14 to 16 passes.
The establishment of borrow areas may cause loss of lands or limit productive uses of these sites.
The values of properties on which these borrow areas will be established are likely to depreciate.
Borrow pits which are not rehabilitated may initiate gully formation through collapsing of side
slopes. Stagnant water in these pits may provide conditions conducive for the breeding of disease
causing vectors. Unrehabilitated borrow pits mar the landscape, and are a hazard to human beings,
livestock and wildlife.
Trucks transporting borrow materials can generate dust. If this dust is produced near settlements, it
will have several adverse effects. Dust can stain household goods resulting in frequent washing of
these goods. Dust may contain bacteria and fungal spores which can cause respiratory and eye
infections.



A -39
Haulage trucks will produce some noise particularly when they move over gravel roads. Such noise is
not desirable near schools, places of worship and hospitals. If these trucks transport borrow
materials during the night and near settlements, the noise produced will disrupt sleep. Such
disturbances adversely affect the productivity of employees and school children.
When haulage trucks use community maintained service roads as access roads, they may damage
such road particularly during the wet season. Consequently these roads may be out of service, which
adversely affects transport services to these communities.
Traffic using the road under maintenance is likely to be delayed during periods when portions of the
road are closed to traffic. Such delays may adversely affect employees going to work.
Mitigation: Owners of lands on which borrow pits will established should be adequately
compensated for the loss in both land use and values.
Borrow pits which will be used over several years should have their slopes stabilised by smoothening
them. Disused borrow pits should be restored to as far as possible their original conditions unless the
relevant land owners wish to use them for other purposes. Restoration of borrow pits will entail
backfilling, or stabilising their side slopes so that they do not collapse.
If haulage trucks pass through settled areas and produce dust, then these roads should be watered to
eliminate dust formation.
Haulage trucks should not use exhaust brakes in densely settled areas so as to minimise noise
production. Borrow materials should not be transported at night through settled areas. If there will be
a substantial number of haulage trucks ferrying borrow materials, then routes which pass near schools
and hospitals should be avoided, in order to minimise the adverse effects of noise.
If contractors use community maintained service roads, then they should improve these roads in order
to handle heavy trucks. Any damages caused to these roads by those doing road maintenance, should
be repaired by them.
Road signs waming other road users about on-going road works should be installed as a matter of
course.
Medium grading and light grading
Medium grading entails restoration of crossfalls on the road to the side drain so as to facilitate
drainage of water from the road. The grader will have to make 2 passes. Light grading consists of
blading the road to remove surface irregularities, and it will be done in I pass by a grader. Activities
undertaken during both medium and light grading are not likely to cause significant impacts since
there are no materials that will be imported.
Disruption to traffic could arise as a result of these road works.
The abstraction of water used for watering the road before compaction may deplete water sources
used by the community. This impact is likely to occur in semi-arid regions. If the water is obtained
from boreholes, excessive use of these boreholes may result in the break down of pumps.
Mitigation: Road signs warning other road users about on-going road works should be erected along
the road.



A -40
In regions with limited water supply, water for road maintenance should ideally be obtained from
sources that will not compromise water supply to local communities.
Shoulder grading and re-gravelling
Shoulder grading involves the reinstatement of the road shoulder to its original width and level or
profile using fill materials from borrow pits. It is done by blading of the road shoulder to remove
surface irregularities, and establish a correct interface with the road pavement profile. Shoulder re-
gravelling involves the re-instatement of the road shoulder to its original width and level or profile
using fill materials from borrow areas.
There are no significant impacts that are likely to arise from these activities except unsightly litter
that may result from improper disposal of materials removed from side drains. Such materials should
be use for backfilling borrow pits, or given to local farmers as compost material.
Premix pothole patching
This involves repairs to potholes on bituminous pavement surface using a mixer of bitumen and
aggregates.
The disposal of loose materials excavated from potholes to be repaired may litter the landscape
when disposed improperly.
The use of firewood for heating bitumen used for pothole patching will cause some loss of
vegetation. If local communities are using the same source for their firewood needs, then the supply
of firewood to these communities will be compromised.
Excess oil not used for drying the aggregates may be disposed in such a way that it is easily washed
into streams resulting in the contamination of water. Contamination of surface water adversely
affects aquatic ecosystems.
Potholes that are excavated for repair, and left open over night are extremely hazardous to traffic.
Accidents occurring at such spots will lead to the loss of life and property.
The lack of proper road signs warning road users about on-going road works can lead to accidents.
Mitigation: Materials excavated from potholes earmarked for repair should be used for backfilling
borrow pits or any other pits.
Fire wood used for heating bitumen should be obtained from woodlands approved by either the
Forest Department or local authority.
Unused oil should always be taken back to workshops, and if there is a need to dispose it, it should be
sent for recycling.
MOWIHC's Road Maintenance Manual states that excavated potholes should never be left open over
night. If patching cannot be done on the same day, then crushed rock or river sand should be used to
fill them up for the night.
Road signs should always be erected when ever there is some on-going road works.

Mechanical ditch cleaning
Mechanical ditch cleaning is done so as to re-establish the cross-section and longitudinal profile.
Debris removed from ditches which are left lying around can be washed easily into streams, and
therefore causing a short-term change to water quality. Materials removed from ditches should be
used for backfilling pits so as to eliminate such adverse impacts.
Culvert Repair/ Replacement
This will involve repairing or replacement of damaged culverts. Routine repairs of culverts will often
involve repairs to the wingwall, headwall, and apron. These repairs will have minimal environmental
impact.
Some environmental impacts may arise during the replacement of a culvert. The major impact is the
disruption of traffic.
During excavation across the road in order to allow the laying of a culvert, some of the excavated
materials may be washed away by streamflow. Excavated materials which are used for backfilling
and are left lying around may also be washed into the same stream. These materials may cause some
short-term changes to water quality. Such changes may adversely affect aquatic organisms, and those
who abstract water for various uses downstream of the culvert under repair.
Mitigation: Road warning signs should be erected so as to wam road users about road works at the
relevant culverts. When a culvert is being replaced and this is likely to cause delays in traffic, road
users should be warned about such possible delays through both the electronic and print media.
Advice on alternative routes should also be provided. Replacement of a culvert should be undertaken
as quickly as possible so as to minimise the duration of any adverse effects.
7.4 Periodic Maintenance
Re-gravelling and spot re-gravelling
According to the Maintenance Manual re-gravelling is " the continuos overlaying of an existing
gravel road throughout its length with a new layer of selected gravel wearing course to a compacted
thickness of 150 mm over the full width of the pavement and shoulders". It is aimed at re-establishing
the original design cross-section, longitudinal profile and horizontal alignment. Spot re-gravelling is
done on selected short discontinuous lengths of the road.
Clearance of vegetation at sites where excavation of gravel and borrow materials will take place
will cause a loss of vegetation. Some of this vegetation could have been important sources of
firewood to the local community.
The creation of pits for excavating gravel and borrow materials often causes a depreciation of land
values. However, for those property owners who prefer to sell gravel and borrow materials for road
works, this could be a source of income particularly for which have limited alternative uses.
Both gravel and borrow pits sited on prominent relief features will mar the landscape.
If gravel and borrow pits are not rehabilitated on completion of road works, they could pose a hazard
to both human beings, livestock and wildlife.



A - 42
Borrow pits which are no longer in use may initiate gully erosion through the collapse of unstable
side slopes.
The collection of stagnant water in disused gravel and borrow pits may lead to the breeding of
disease causing vectors.
Soil may be washed away from access road without adequate drainage structures used by haulage
trucks. This soil has the potential to silt streams receiving it.
Haulage trucks moving along gravel roads are likely to generate dust during dry periods. If this dust is
generated near settlements, it can have several adverse effects. Dust will stain household goods, and
therefore necessitate frequent washing. Goods for sale which are exposed to such dust may lose their
value. Dust has the potential to cause respiratory and eye infections. Noise produced by haulage
trucks near settlements will create a nuisance, or even cause communication problems. If several
haulage trucks pass near schools, hospitals, and places of worship, such noise can disrupt activities at
these institutions. Noise also disrupts sleep.
During gravelling of the road, the flow of traffic may by disrupted causing delays.
Mitigation: Trees that are supposed to be cleared at both gravel and borrow areas should be marked
first so as to avoid cutting of trees which do not interfere with excavations.
Owners of properties on which gravel and borrow pits will be sited should be adequately
compensated for both the resources to be extracted, and the loss in value of their properties.
Gravel and borrow pits should where ever possible not be located on prominent relief features in
order to eliminated their objectionable visual intrusion. Where gravel has been extracted from hill
slopes, land owners could be encouraged to develop houses on these sites.
Disused pits should be backfilled using spoil materials if this is available. Backfilled pits should then
be revegetated. Where land owners wish to use these pits for other uses, e.g. collection of water, their
side slopes should be stabilised by smoothening them so as to minimise their collapse and gully
formation, and the hazard to human beings and livestock.
If stagnant water is likely to collect in gravel and borrow pits which are still under use or left open for
other purposes, land owners should be encouraged to spray the water to prevent breeding of
mosquitoes.
Access roads used by haulage trucks should have drainage structures that fulfil MOWHC's General
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
Watering of the road during maintenance works should be undertaken if dust is being produced
during earthworks.
Haulage trucks should not use exhaust brakes in settled areas so as to minimise adverse effects of
noise. Access roads passing near schools and hospitals should be avoided if possible. In densely
settled areas, earthworks should not be undertaken at night.
