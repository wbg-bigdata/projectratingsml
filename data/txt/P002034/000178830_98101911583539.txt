NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
RIVERS STATE
Summary and Conclusions
i.        The Federal Military Government of Nigeria (FMG) has requested
Bank assistance to finance an oil palm project in Rivers State. This report
appraises a nucleus estate/smallholder project for which a US$30.0 million
loan is proposed.
ii.       The rapid growth in the Nigerian economy in recent years has to a
large extent bypassed the agricultural sector. In fact, in some respects
the boom elsewhere in the economy has made life more difficult for the rural
producer, for instance by the rapid bidding up of wage rates. It has become
increasingly clear, however, that the stagnation in the agricultural sector
cannot be allowed to continue. In the domestic market, the rapid growth in
purchasing power has resulted in price escalation and an increasing import
bill for foodstuffs (up from N50 million in 1970 to N440 million in 1976).
In the international context, Nigeria must in the longer term rebuild the
export capacity of her agricultural sector, the decline of which has been
temporarily masked by the oil boom. For palm oil, the target for the con-
ceivable future can only be to reduce domestic shortages and Nigeria's im-
pending dependence upon foreign supplies. According to estimates made in this
report, domestic demand for palm oil in 1985 will be in the region of 780,000
to 830,000 metric tons per annum, while the supply capability will not exceed
640,000 tons. An import gap of 140,000 to 190,000 tons is therefore projected,
even after taking account of the three Bank projects already approved.
iii.      The present project would plant 10,000 ha on a nucleus estate and
10,000 ha on smallholdings in the Elele-Ahoada area. The planting program
would be carried out over the period 1978-1982. The smallholder program
would be implemented by a Smallholder Management Unit (SMU) to be established
under the Rivers State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).
A grant/credit package in cash and kind to assist in meeting establishment
and maintenance costs would be channeled to smallholders by the SMU, working
in conjunction with local cooperative societies. The SMU would also operate
an extension service to provide technical advice to smallholders. In addition
funds for staff training are included in the project. A roads units, to be
established within the SMU, would be responsible for upgrading 400 km of roads
within the project area. The State-owned company RISONPALM Ltd. would estab-
lish and operate the nucleus estate, construct and operate two 40-ton ffb/hour
palm oil mills (one of which would be funded under the Bank Loan) and estab-
lish a fruit collection system capable of handling the production of both the
nucleus estate and the smallholders.



- ii -
iv.       The project includes a small component which would pave the way
for future development of coconut palms in southern Nigeria. Funding is
provided for a study by consultants of the region's potential for coconut and,
subject to the finding of this study, the project would support the establish-
ment of 120 ha seed garden to provide high yielding hybrid planting material
for future development projects. Funds for a feasibility study of a Phase
II Oil Palm Development are also included in the project.
v.        Project costs over the six and a half year development period
(1978-84) are estimated at N54.0 million (US$83.0 million). The Bank loan
of N 19.4 million (US$30.0 million) would finance 36% of total project costs;
it would be equivalent to all foreign exchange costs, including those incurred
in 1977/1978 (regarded as a start-up year). The remainder of the project costs
would be financed by the Federal Military Government N 13.3 million (US$20.5
million) or 25%, by the Rivers State Government N 20.1 million (US$30.9
million) or 37%, and by participating smallholders N 1.2 million (US$1.8
million) or 2%.
vi.       Vehicles, tractors, fertilizers, chemicals, road-making equipment,
other equipment and farm inputs valued at about N10.3 million (US$15.8 million)
net of contingencies, would be procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines for those contracts valued over
US$75,000, and through competitive bidding and in accordance with local proce-
dures satisfactory to the Bank for contracts less than US$75,000. For contracts
under US$10,000, direct competitive shopping would be employed. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference or the applicable import
duty, whichever is lower. Contracts for houses, stores and buildings, which
are valued at N6.0 million (US$9.2 million), would be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding. Construction of roads would be undertaken by the
project on force account. A laLrge part of project cost would be salaries,
operating expenses, training costs and field establishment costs, valued at
N16.9 million (US$26.0 million) which are unsuitable for competitive bidding.
The services of consultants and expatriate staff valued at N2.3 million
(US$3.5 million) would be obtained in accordance with procedures acceptable
to the Bank. An amount of N18.5 million (US$28.5 million) would cover
contingencies.
vii.      The Bank loan would b,e disbursed over a six and a half year period
1978-1984 as follows: (1) Nucleus Estate (a) 100% foreign exchange costs of
field establishment (excluding labor, locally procured seeds and cover crops,
and land acquisition), housing, civil works, offices, stores, and other build-
ings, or (if locally procured) 35% of these expenditures, totalling US$8.1
million; (b) 100% of foreign exchange costs of vehicles and equipment, in-
ternational staff salaries, consultants, feasibility study, training, man-
agement fee and operating costs or (if locally procured) 75% of these costs,
amounting to US$12.8 million; (2) Coconut Seed Garden, 100% of the foreign
exchange costs of the coconut seed garden or (if locally procured) 45% of



- iii -
these expenditures, totalling US$0.8 million; (3) SMU - (a) 100% of foreign
exchange costs of field establishment (excluding labor, locally procured
seeds and cover crop) and housing or (if locally procured) 50% of these
costs totalling US$1.9 million; (b) 100% of foreign exchange costs of road
construction (excluding local staff salaries), staff training, international
staff salaries, vehicles and equipment, consultants and operating costs or
(if locally procured) 30% of these expenditures totalling US$3.7 million.
Retroactive financing of up to US$1.25 million is proposed for recruitment
of international staff and purchase of land clearing equipment. Disburse-
ment of the Bank loan would be against import documentation, contracts and
certificates of expenditure: the latter would be scruitinized by Bank super-
vision missions and independent auditors.
viii.      At full maturity in 1990 the combined estate and smallholder project
would produce annually about 47,250 metric tons of palm oil for domestic
consumption and 10,126 metric tons of kernels for export. Valued at the
Bank's price forecasts for world markets in 1985, the annual foreign exchange
value of output would be US$23.0 million (constant 1977 terms).
ix.       Based on a fresh fruit bunch price of N40 per ton, smallholder
gross return (including return to labor input) from a 2 hectare planting
would start at N254 in the first year of yielding (four years after planting),
rising to N578 per annum over the farmer's loan repayment period, and there-
after to N814 a year. The gross return per manday of labor input would rise
from N3.9 in the year of first production, to N8.6 during loan repayment,
and an eventual N12.9. These returns compare favorably with local wage
rates of about N2.0 per manday.
x.        During the establishment period the project would create 18,750
man years of employment. At full maturity the project would provide wage
and salaried employment for about 2,000 people. Based on an average farm
size of 2 ha about 5,000 farmers would benefit. The average family size
is 7, so about 35,000 family members would be direct beneficiaries from
the smallholder component.
xi.       The estimated economic rate of return is 15.2%.
xii.      On the basis of the assurances obtained at negotiations and set
out in Chapter IX, the project is suitable for a US$30.0 million Bank loan,
for a period of 20 years including a five-year grace period on principal.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Federal Military Government of Nigeria (FMG) has requested
a Bank loan to help finance planting of high yielding oil palms in Rivers
State. This report appraises a project that would establish 10,000 ha of
nucleus estate and 10,000 ha of smallholder plantings as Phase I of a program
that would eventually establish 40,000 ha of high yielding palms.
1.02      The first Bank loans for agriculture in Nigeria were for the
Western State Cocoa Project (1971, Loan 764-UNI, US$7.2 million), now com-
pleted, and the Second Cocoa Project (1974, Loan 1045-UNI, US$20 million),
which is being successfully implemented in the former Western and Mid-Western
States 1/. Following an identification mission in 1972 loans were made for
three integrated agricultural development projects in the north: Funtua
Project (1974, Loan 1092-UNI, US$29 million), Gusau Project (1974, Loan
1099-UNI, US$19 million), and Gombe Project (1974, Loan 1164-UNI, US$21 mil-
lion); a Rice Project (1974, Loan 1103-UNI, US$17.5 million) in the former
East Central and South East States 2/; a Livestock Project (1974, Loan 1091-
UNI, US$21 million); and three Oil Palm Projects; Nucleus Estate/Smallholder
Oil Palm Project, Western State 3/ (1975, Loan 1192-UNI, US$17 million),
Nucleus Estate/Smallholder Oil Palm Project, Mid-Western State 4/ (1975, Loan
1183-UNI, US$29.5 million) and Smallholder Oil Palm Project, East Central
State 5/ (1975, Loan 1191-UNI, US$19 million). The northern agricultural
development projects are being implemented successfully; the remaining proj-
ects have experienced delays but are expected to make up lost time as manage-
ment gains experience. Two further agricultural development projects in Benue
and Plateau States recently became effective (Ayangba: 1977, Loan 1455-,UNI,
US$35 million, Lafia:  1977, Loan 1454-UNI, US$27 million).   Most of the
projects are encountering substantial cost overruns due to rapid internal
inflation, and supply of local funds to existing projects already represents a
serious problem. Currently under appraisal are two more agricultural develop-
ment projects (Bida and Ilorin), a forestry project and a project to establish
an Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute.
1.03      The project was identified by the Federal Department of Agriculture
and the Resident Mission in Lagos in May 1975, and subsequently prepared by a
consultant firm SOCFINCO Ltd, engaged by the Ministry of Trade and Economic
1/   Following the creation of the new states, the project is now executed
in Oyo, Ogun, Ondo and Bendel States, and project assets and liabilities
are being divided accordingly.

Development. The feasibility studies were completed in December 1975 and
April 1976 and the project was appraised in October/November 1976 by Messrs.
Bevan, Hachero and Ody (Bank), Bogaerts, Hallgrimson and Olivin (Consultants).
II. BACKGROUND
The Economy
2.01      Following the recent creation of seven new states, the Federal 2
Republic of Nigeria comprises L9 States.  It covers an area of 924,000 km
and has an estimated population of 77 million. The skewness in income dis-
tribution means that the majority of the population have incomes below the
estimated national average of US$380 (1976), particularly in rural areas,
where economic activities are based primarily on smallholder farming with low
level technology. In urban centers, average incomes are higher but unequally
distributed.
2.02      Economic growth in Nigeria over the last six years has occurred in
two phases: from January 1970 until the end of 1972 was a period of rehabili-
tation and, with the economy responding to pent-up demand, postponed invest-
ment and production were quickly realized. Following a year of consolidation
and slower growth in 1972, the second phase was characterized by a resumption
of growth generated by increased public sector activities. This was accom-
panied by inflation, supply shortages and infrastructural congestion as excess
capacity diminished. Although primary sector performance was disappointing,
the economy continued to grow rapidly because of the phenomenal expansion of
the service sectors; from 1970-76 GDP rose at an average rate of 7.4% per
annum.  Nigeria's economic development has been increasingly dominated by
oil, which by 1976 accounted for 31% for GDP, 93% of export earnings and
82% of total Government revenues, surpassing the agricultural sector in all
areas except employment. The Third National Development Plan covers the
five-year period April 1975-March 1980. Revised plan allocations are US$68
billion, but due to slippage the effective program is projected at US$45
billion. The plan has been reviewed by the new Government and more emphasis
has been given to health, housing and agriculture.
The Agricultural Sector
2.03      General.  Approximately 61% of Nigeria's population is dependent
on agriculture which accounts for about 23% of GDP, 5% of total export
earnings and 62% of non-oil exports. Agricultural production is almost
entirely in the hands of smallholders whose levels of technology and
productive efficiency are low.
2.04      Cropping patterns vary within the country's main ecological zones.
In the forest zones of the South, where rainfall is bimodally distributed over
a wet season of up to 8 months, the agricultural economy is largely based on
tree crops with annual staples providing subsistence and subsidiary income.



- 3 -
In the Guinea and Sudan Savannah zones of the north, rainfall is monomodal
within a six-month spread and production is based almost entirely on annual
crops. Between these two zones is an area known as the "middle belt" support-
ing southern Guinea and transitional forest savannah vegetation and a mix of
annual and tree crops. Little development has occurred in this "middle belt"
which forms an important food production reserve for the nation.
2.05      Although general economic growth has been high, agricultural
sector performance has been disappointing, with average annual growth in
1970-1976 of only 0.9%, less than the population increase. Serious drought
conditions in the north led to a sharp fall in output in 1972 and 1973;
production of millet and sorghum, major northern food crops, fell 15% in
1973, and groundnut production fell by 35% between 1972 and 1974. Millet
and sorghum output recovered significantly due to favorable weather condi-
tions in 1974 and 1975, but groundnuts continued to suffer from disease
and other problems. Growth is still impeded by the low level of technology,
declining productivity on existing farms and substantial migration of the
rural labor force to urban centers. Nevertheless, agriculture provides
employment for three quarters of the labor force. The share of agriculture
in GDP (in current terms) declined from 49% in 1970 to 23% in 1976.
2.06      Food crop production over the last decade has not kept pace with
demand, resulting in increased food prices and a rise in imports (from N50
million in 1970 to around N440 million in 1976). Agricultural exports are
equally unsatisfactory, suffering from increased demand in the domestic market,
the present level of the exchange rate, and the failure until recently of the
monopsonist marketing boards to offer adequate price incentives for export.
Thus, although cocoa continues to be an important export, production remains at
the level of the early 1960's. In the case of groundnuts, falling production
combined with increasing domestic demand has eliminated exports altogether.
2.07      Although palm oil production has risen since the civil war, it has
not yet recovered to pre-war levels. Rising population and incomes have led
to a buoyant local demand and soaring prices, and no significant quantities of
palm oil have been exported for several years. The Bank is already assisting
in the development of three oil palm projects in Nigeria (loans 1183-UNI;
1191-UNI; and 1192-UNI), which in 1985 will contribute about 32,000 tons
of palm oil per annum increasing to 100,000 tons by 1990. Nonetheless, the
prospect for the next 10-15 years is of a widening gap between demand and
supply. It is projected that by 1985, the shortfall will amount to 140,000-
190,000 tons per annum (see Annex 1).
2.08      Development Strategy.  Government is aware of the need to improve
performance in the agricultural sector and to invest the substantial revenues
from oil t-) expand and diversify the rest of the ecoromy. In the revised
Third-Five-Year Deve]opmenL Plan, N3.0 billion has been earmarked for
agriculture to support a targeted growth rate of 5%. The program includes
development of several major river basins for irrigation, dissemination of
modern farmiing techniques to smallholders, improved input distribution and
marketing services and support for various integrated development projects.
Rural development will be promoted with complementary investments in



- 4 -
secondary and feeder roads, rural electrification, health and other social
services.
2.09      Government's main short-term objective is to improve internal price
stability in basic food crops and to ensure adequate food supplies to the
rapidly expanding urban centers. To complement this, Government's longer-term
objectives are to create an efficient agricultural industry, to reduce popula-
tion drift to urban centers and to revive Nigeria's agricultural exports.
2.10      Development Constraints.  The main development constraint is the
lack of effective agricultural support services. Produce evacuation is ham-
pered by lack of feeder roads, and many farmers have to travel long distances
to unevenly distributed and unreliable sources of inputs.
2.11      Input demand, at the present heavily subsidized prices, is high and
as a result of supply problems black market activities are common. However,
even in areas of high input consumption, yields are low and many farm opera-
tions are not viable in economic terms.
2.12      Rapid development in the non-agricultural sectors and rising stand-
ards of education have led to reaction against poor returns to labor and the
drudgery associated with traditional agriculture. This has encouraged the
drift of young people away from rural areas and has resulted in a sharp rise
in hired labor rates. This can only be reduced through encouraging applica-
tion of advanced farming techniques, which are particularly adapted to larger
farming units-either group or individually operated, as a complement to
support for smallholder development.
2.13      The Federal Government is generally aware of these constraints and
of the need for further improvement in planning and executive capabilities
at both State and Federal levels. Furthermore, there is a dearth of technical
and managerial personnel at all levels, which suggests a need for greater
rationalization of the responsibilities of public agencies and also much
closer coordination in the activities of such agencies, if the effectiveness
of available manpower is to be maximized.
2.14      Agricultural support services remain almost entirely in the public
sector, and present subsidy policies have removed the incentive for private
sector participation. Giveni Nigeria's size and massive development program,
Government will need progressively to divest itself of its responsibilities
for input-and produce-marketing to private enterprise; this would require
an appropriate economic framework and redefinition of the role of Federal
and State agricultural ministries.
2.15      Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy.  Since 1971, the Bank has
been involved in 12 tree or food crop projects (see para. 1.02).  During
this time the success of the three northern projects (Loans 1092, 1099 and
1164-UNI) has demonstrated the advantages of planned agricultural develop-
ment implemented under a structure which allows State control while affording
management full operational autonomy. As a result, both Federal and State
Governments are anxious to replicate this experience elsewhere. There is
also increasing interest in the involvement of the commercial sector which
is being pursued under these projects.

2.16      Experience of implementing the ongoing projects has reinforced Bank
concern over a number of critical policy issues, resolution of which are vital
for medium and long-term sector development and which must be taken into con-
sideration in future Bank operations. First: subsidizing inputs (fertilizer,
insecticides, herbicides), irrigation water rates, tractor hire charges, in-
terest rates and other similar items is encouraging inefficient resource use,
distorting resource allocation, discouraging development of farm support ser-
vices by the private sector and straining Government's fiscal and adminis-
trative resources. It is estimated that at the current level of subsidies,
fertilizer subsidies alone in 1980 could amount, allowing for projected in-
creases in utilization, to about N100 million annually (about US$150 million).
Second: input procurement and distribution has been centralized at the
Federal level, resulting in inefficient supply to farmers and a needless
additional burden on the already overstrained agriculture public administra-
tion. Third: State and Federal funding has been unsatisfactory, creating
severe problems for Bank projects. Fourth: the combination of official
credit policies with the disappointing performance of NAB means that no
viable financial framework has been created for the development of either
smallholders' or commercial agriculture. Fifth: market intervention by the
commodity boards has not been fully effective in stabilizing iilernal prices
of agricultural commodities (particularly for the non-scheduled food crops),
maintaining price incentives to producers and encouraging a competitive mar-
keting infrastructure. These problems are further exacerbated by inadequate
rural feeder road systems. Finally, shortages of experienced manpower at
managerial, administrative and technical levels are major constraints in the
planning and implementation of development programs.
2.17      Resolving these issues is very difficult and Government has sought
Bank financial and technical support. For example, Government has infon ally
requested the Bank to review subsidy, interest rate and pricing policies and
the forthcoming Economic Mission will analyze the problems and make recom.nenda-
tions for future Bank lending. The provision of infrastructure comprising
roads, service centers, input distribution and improved extension systems
forms a major component of the Bank's existing and proposed agriculture devel-
opment projects. The short-term solution for the management and administra-
tion constraint adopted in Bank-supported projects in Nigeria is internation ?
recruitment and the establishment of special project management units. How-
ever, in the long-term, training of Nigerian management staff is essential
and Government has requested the Bank to consider financing an Agricultural
and Rural Management Training Institute. A proposal was prepared by consul-
tants, and the project was appraised in February/March 1977.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      The project area, which covers some 2,800 km  of the Rivers State,
includes the previous Ikwerre and Etche divisions and parts of Ahoada, Obio
and Ogba-Egbema divisions: these have now been incorporated in the new
Ahoada, Ikwerre-Etche and Port Harcourt City Locnl Government Council areas.



-6-
Climate
3.02      Rainfall distribution is characterized by a long rainy season from
early March to end November. Mean annual rainfall in Ahoada (situated in the
west) is 2,640 mm and the mean annual water deficit is estimated at 225 mm
(amongst the lowest in West Africa). Annual sunshine is estimated at 1,400-
1,500 hours.  Mean annual temperatures are 26  - 28 C and are good for oil
palm cultivation (see Maps IBRD 10561R1 and 10562R1).
Vegetation
3.03      There is considerable variation in vegetation.  In the east of the
nucleus estate, population density is low and vegetation consists mainly of
oil palm grove mixed with fallow; about 60% can be classified as forest rem-
nants or secondary jungle, with a high density of medium sized trees. In the
west of the estate, about 40% can be classified as forest remnants and sec-
ondary jungle, with wild palms varying between 50 and 150 trees/ha. All
recently cleared areas are heavily infested by Eupatorium Odoratum. 1/
Topography/Hydrology
3.04      Two basic geological foundations cover the project area:  the
Coastal Plain Terrace and the Sub-Recent Niger Terrace, the latter covering
most of the western sector. The Coastal Plain Terrace relief is only very
slightly undulating with gradual slopes to the south. A few depressions
accumulate water to form small swamps and the topography is broken by a few
large rivers. The lower altitude of the Sub-Recent Niger Terrace has a
network of small streams flowing into the tidal flats.
Soils
3.05      The soils of the Coastal Plain Terrace are deep with clay content
increasing with profile depth. They have a good structure, are free draining
and are suitable for oil palm cultivation. On the Sub-Recent Nigeria Terrace
only very limited areas of water logged or patches of very sandy soil are
unsuitable for oil palm cultivation.
Population
3.06      The project area population is estimated at between 240,000 a d
300,000 (see Map IBRD 12590) with average densities of 90 to 100 per km
Within the nucleus estate area, the density is low. The average nuclear
family size is 7, and about 70% derive the majority of their income from
agriculture or fishing. Agricultural work is seasonal, and during peak
periods there is some temporary inward migration of laborers from neighboring
states. Rural labor markets are well developed, and a significant proportion
of agricultural work is performed for money wages.

7-
Land Tenure
3.07      Generally land is vested in the various communities, transactions
being under the direct control of the community head in consultation with
chiefs and elders. Land may be given (though unrecorded) by the community
to an individual as his personal and disposable property. Alternatively,
land may be given by the community to a family 1/ under the provision that
the family head may transfer it outside the family only with the consent and
sanction of the community elders. Although title to land is generally un-
recorded, family and individual rights are usually well known and accepted
within the community. In general the traditional system provides adequate
security of tenure for planting permanent crops. There is increasing indi-
vidual ownership in some areas, especially close to towns and absentee owner-
ship is becoming common. Under the new Land Act enacted in April 1978, all
land is vested in the State. While it is not yet clear how the provisions will
operate in practice, it is most unlikely that they will adversely affect the
project: indeed implementation could well be facilitated. Under the project,
the selection process would be designed to restrict participation to those
directly engaged in farming (Annex 5 Appendix I).
3.08      The Public Lands Requisition Law provides for Government land
acquisition for public use. This may be by voluntary transfer or compulsory
acquisition with payment of reasonable compensation. Compulsory acquisition
generally takes place through gazetting and requires little time. Compensa-
tion for land acquired for the nucleus estate would be in the form of a down
payment and annual rental acceptable to the landowners and to the Bank. It
was a condition of Board presentation that at least 3,000 ha of land had
been acquired by the State and conveyed to RISONPALM on a lease basis of not
less than 50 years under conditions acceptable to the communities involved.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that the balance of 8,000 ha
would be acquired by the State and conveyed to RISONPALM, with all boundary
alignments agreed with local communities and final traces cut and clearly
marked not later than March 31, 1979. It was agreed during negotiations
that the acquisition and conveyance of the 8,000 ha would be a condition of
disbursement against estate development.
Farming Systems
3.09      Farm sizes in the area vary considerably, but according to a recent
unofficial survey, the average family has about 0.7 ha under food crops at any
given time, another 4 ha lying fallow. Each farm is usually divided into 4
or 5 separate plots. The most important food crop is cassava, grown both for
consumption and sale, and the heavy demands of this crop upon soil fertility
in the more densely populated areas leads to shortening of the fallow period.
Yam and plantain are also widely grown and marketed, and smaller quantities
of cocoyam and maize are produced, mostly for family consumption. Oil palms
1/   The "Family" in this context means the extended family or kindred unit
and may include several generations.



- 8 -
are widespread, mostly in wild groves but occasionally on smallholdings but
maintenance standards are low. Coconut palms are not common, despite the
apparent suitability of soil and climatic conditions.
Communications
3.10      Communications to and within the project area are exclusively by
road. The area contains 202 km of existing asphalt roads and about 1000 km
of earth roads and tracks. Main roads in the north, west and south are
satisfactory, but the east is served only by earth tracks. However, two
asphalt roads to the area are planned for construction before 1980.
3.11      The road density is high (0.50 km/km ) but earth tracks (80% of the
network) are difficult if not impossible to pass in the rainy season. Further-
more, the area east of the Otamiri and Ogochia rivers is isolated from the rest
of the project area as there are no motorable bridges across the rivers. A
temporary bridge over the Otamiri is scheduled for construction shortly by the
State Government, but construction of the Ogochia crossing has not yet been
scheduled.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   General Description
4.01      The primary objective of the project would be to assist in partly
filling the shortfall in domestic palm oil requirements, estimated at some
190,000 tons per annum by 1985 (see para. 2.07). This would be achieved by
establishing 20,000 hectares of high yielding oil palm on a nucleus estate and
associated smallholdings, which would produce 47,250 tons of palm oil at full
development in 1990. In addition, the project includes the improvement or
reconstruction of about 400 km of earth roads serving the smallholder community,
feasibility studies for a second phase oil palm project and a coconut project,
and a coconut seed garden. The project would be implemented over a six and a
half year period, 1978-1984.
4.02      Planting would be carried out over the period 1978 through 1982 as
Phase I of a 40,000 ha program during the period 1977 through 1986.

- 9 -
4.03      The Project, which in concept and design is largely as proposed in
the SOCFINCO Ltd. feasibility studies, includes four main components:
(i) Establishing a Nucleus Estate
(a) planting 10,000 ha by the State-owned company
RISONPALM Ltd, using a management agency for
implementation;
(b) constructing and operating one palm oil mill
to process estate and smallholders production;
and
(c) establishing a fruit collection system to be
operated by RISONPALM for estate and smallholder
production.
(ii) New Planting/Replanting Smallholdings
(a) establishing a Smallholder Management Unit (SMU)
within the Rivers State Ministry of Agriculture
and Natural Resources to implement the smallholder
planting program (10,000 ha);
(b) operating a Grant/Credit scheme for participating
smallholders;
(c) training staff and smallholders at selected insti-
tutions and through in-service courses; and
(d) improving about 400 km of earth roads to facilitate
all-weather distribution of inputs and collections
of fruit bunches from smallholders.
(iii) Coconut ProJect Identification and Preparation Study and
Establishing a Coconut Seed Garden of 120 ha over the
period 1978 through 1982.
(iv) Feasibility Study for Phase II Oil Palm Project
B.   Detailed Features
(i) Nucleus Estate
4.04      The estate component would form part of the oil palm development
of RISONPALM Ltd. - a recently established state-owned limited liability
company. Development of the estate would be carried out under a management
contract with an internationally recognized firm acceptable to the Bank.
For details see Chapter VI, paras. 6.07 and 6.08.



- 10 -
4.05      Planting Program.  RISONPALM would develop 10,000 ha east of Elele
oil palm estate, between Umu Dioga in the west and Ozuzu in the east (see
Map IBRD 12590). Planting would be carried out from 1978 through 1981 as
Phase I of a 20,000 ha nucleus estate program through 1985/86. To attract
a resident estate labor force for maintenance and harvesting 400 houses would
be built, each with an 0.2 ha vegetable plot. As labor is expected to be
in short supply it will not be possible to clear the land manually. For
this reason project costs include heavy equipment to enable land clearing
to be carried out on force account by the estate. The Nigerian Institute
for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) is expected to supply Grade I wilt-tolerant
seeds to the project. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
Rivers State would obtain confirmation from NIFOR not later than September 1
each year, that the Institute would supply the required seeds for the follow-
ing season, failing which the project would be free to order from other
available sources including sources outside Nigeria.
4.06      Palm Oil Mills.  Fruit production, which would not start until 1982,
would initially be processed at the existing Elele plantation mill. The
20,000 ha planting program under the project would require, at full production,
two palm oil mills. One of the mills would be financed under the project and
construction would start in 1980. Construction of the second oil mill would
start in 1983. One mill would be located in the south of N.W. Estate and the
other east of the N.E. Estate, near the Otamiri River. The first mill would
reach a capacity of 40 tons/hour by 1985 and the second mill 40 tons/hour by
1989. Phasing of the mills would be as follows:
1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988    1989
Required Capacity
(tons ffb/hour)      2.8    7.3   18.7   36.0   47.7   56.1   60.2    62.5
Installed Capacity
(tons ffb/hour)
Mill 1             -      10     20      40     40      40     40       40
Mill 2             -       -      -       -     10      20     30       40

From 1990 onwards capacity required by Phase I plantings would be at least
65 tons/hour, leaving a small reserve.  During negotiations assurances were
obtained that early in 1979 RISONPALM would engage consultants satisfactory to
the State and the Bank to prepare design specifications and tender procedures
for the first palm oil mill; the design specifications and tender procedures
would have to be satisfactory to the Bank. Invitations to tender would be
issued at least three years before the mills are scheduled to start operating;
tenders for the first mill would be issued at the end of 1979 and for the
second mill at the end of 1982. Contractors would be required to provide
training for Nigerian technical staff in Europe at plants producing mill

equipment and in Nigeria during mill erection and commissioning. Mill capac-
ity must meet estate and smallholder production levels and during negotiations
it was agreed that it would be a condition of disbursement for the mill that
the Bank had received satisfactory confirmation from SMU and the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit (MEU) of the Federal Department of Agriculture that the
mill could process all oil palm fruit produced by the nucleus estate and
smallholders.
4.07      SMU and RISONPALMI shall agree on an acceptable percentage of esti-
mated smallholder production to be delivered to the mills for processing.
Assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
4.08      Fruit Collection System.  At full maturity annual FFB production
would be 125,000 tons on the nucleus estates and 100,000 tons on the small-
holdings, with 800 tons and 600 tons respectively being collected daily in
the peak months. The maximum distance smallholders would be required to carry
bunches would be 600 m to the roadside. The bunches would be heaped in nets
distributed to farmers by the project and hoisted by cranes mounted on the
collecting vehicles. At collection points, bunches would be weighed and the
farmer would be given a receipt for the amount and quantity of fruit delivered.
Collection would be organized to take place over a week, on the same day at
the collecting point; it would be identical in the nucleus estates with the
exception that nets would be distributed to harvesters on the day of collection
(details are at Annex 6). The organization of the fruit collection system
would be the responsibility of the estate and oil mills management (para. 6.10).
(ii) Smallholders
4.09      The Smallholders Management Unit (SMU) would be responsible to the
Rivers State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MAINR) for the
smallholder component. SMU would have a high degree of financial and admin-
istrative autonomy and would be responsible for appraising smallholder appli-
cations and supervising the technical and financial services involved in
the field establishment and post-maturity stages. The SMU planting program
of 10,000 ha would be carried out from 1978 through 1982. Details of SMU's
structure and functions are given in paras. 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05 and
Annex 10.
4.10      Grant and Credit Scheme.  In the early 1960's an oil palm re-
habilitation scheme was introduced to the then Eastern Region (now Imo State,
Rivers State and Cross River State) under which the problem of providing
producers with an incentive to replant was overcome by providing smallholders
with grants-now an integral part of FMG's agricultural development policy -
consisting of cash payments, planting materials and other farm inputs. In
1975, three Bank-financed oil palm projects were approved under which small-
holders are provided with grants in kind and credit in cash that, combined
with fair producer prices, are expected to provide farmers with sufficient
incentive to plant palms that take nearly four years to come into bearing and
produce revenue. Smallholder participation in these projects, which are still
in the establishment phase, has been good. Under the proposed project small-
holders' returns (para 7.08) justify applying the same grant/credit incentive.



- 12 -
4.11      The project would provide grants and credits to smallholders planting
or replanting a minimum of 1 ha to a maximum of 10 ha. One ha is the smallest
unit that is considered practical to administer under the project, while at
maturity more than 10 ha would require the average farm family to hire labor
for its oil palm and other food crop cultivation. In order to strengthen the
local cooperative movement to the stage where it could eventually assume many
of the functions of SMU, participants would be expected to be members of
registered or officially recognized cooperatives and would be required to sign
grant/credit agreements with SMU and their cooperatives (para 6.06). During
negotiations assurances were obtained that these arrangements would be employed
and that the terms of the agreements would be acceptable to the Bank.
4.12      The total costs of clearing, planting and maintaining the palms for
four years until they come into production are estimated in constant 1976
terms at about N672 (US$1,035) per hectare. SMU would distribute (a) as grant
and in kind, palm seedlings, cover crop seeds, wire netting, fertilizers and
chemicals to a value of N260 (US$400) per hectare and (b) as credit, in cash,
N300 (US$462) for payment of labor. The credit would bear interest at 9.5%
for 13 years with 7 years grace during which interest would be capitalized.
Each smallholder would contribute about N110 (US$169) per ha in the form of
labor and tools. Monthly repayments would be calculated on a per hectare
basis and deducted from each smallholders ffb proceeds. In constant 1976
terms monthly repayments by the smallholder would amount to N9.0O (US$13.86)
per ha, and the cooperative would repay to SMU N8.00 (US$12.32) equivalent to
an annual interest of 7.5% (see para. 6.06). Cash payments during the pre-
harvesting period would only be made after physical inspection to ensure that
technical standards laid down by SMU had been followed. The loan agreement
between SMU, the cooperative and the smallholder would include an undertaking
by the smallholder to sell his ffb to the nucleus estate mills. Details of
the grant/credit scheme are in Annex 5.
4.13      Training.  Senior and middle level SMU and Nucleus Estate staff
would receive training at the Management Training Institute (ARMTI) to be
established by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Technical training would be provided for Senior Officers, Nursery Staff, Field
Staff and Smallholders of the SMU. There are shortages of trained and expe-
rienced Nigerian technical staff at many of the levels required by this
project, and it is therefore clear that the project would have to do a lot of
training and upgrading of staff itself. Agricultural Officers (AO) or above
would be given 3-6 months training in planting techniques and management on
large successful oil palm development schemes or commercial farms. Agricul-
tural Assistants (AA) supervising nurseries would receive twelve months
special training in nursery techniques from germinated seed state to field
planting.  Other Agricultural Assistants would be given a 2-3 months intensive
course in modern planting techniques at the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm
Research (NIFOR) followed by a similar period of practical training in the
supervision of field operations on existing estates. In addition, all SMU



- 13 -
field staff would be trained in smallholder appraisal and grant/credit super-
vision procedures. Staff would also be trained elsewhere in West Africa and
for some senior officers possibly in the Far East for which funds are provided.
Smallholder training would be developed on a group activity basis, with some
courses of I to 2 day duration, and would include: (a) outlining application/
appraisal procedures and loan agreement conditions, (b) demonstrating plant-
ing, maintenance and harvesting practices. A training schedule and cost
estimates are given in Annex 8 table 17.
4.14      Road Improvement.  No improvement of paved roads is required in
the project area but earth roads require upgrading. The proposed fruit
collection road network is 592 km (164 km of existing and 78 km of planned
asphalt roads, and 350 km of earth roads). In addition, a further 50 km
of earth roads are required to link the smallholders' area with the oil
mills. Construction costs of asphalt roads (estimated at N 9.4 million)
are not included in the project as they form part of the State and Federal
development plans 1976-1980. However, improvement of 400 km of earth roads
by a Roads Division in SMU is included in project costs. A temporary bridge
over the Ogochia river is also included; this must be constructed to serve
the project planting program, as the timing for construction of a permanent
bridge (which is part of the State Development Plan) is uncertain. Total
cost of the road component is estimated at N 1.3 million, including estab-
lishing and operating an equipment servicing workshop. Maintenance costs
following the 4 year construction period are estimated at N 80,000 per annum.
In line with Government policy the Local Government Authorities (LGA's) would
assume this responsibility (for details see Annex 4).
(iii) Coconut Project Identification and Preparation Study and
Establishment of Coconut Seed Garden
4.15      Both the Federal and State Governments are interested in small-
holder and estate coconut development for which many areas of Southern
Nigeria are well suited. Yields of 4 and 4.5 tons of copra per ha can be
expected from smallholdings and estates respectively, using improved hybrid
dwarf x tall material. However, any coconut development would be contingent
upon a local supply of high yielding material.
4.16      To determine whether coconut development is feasible, the project
includes about 12 man-months of consultants costing US$134,000 for coconut
project identification and preparation in 1978. The study would: (a) assess
prospects for developing coconuts in the tree crop belt of Nigeria, including
assessment of Kaincope disease, (b) prepare proposals for smallholder and
estate coconut development. If the study demonstrates that coconut development
would be viable, establishment of a coconut seed garden would be scheduled for
initial planting in 1979. It is proposed that a 120 ha seed garden of hybrid
dwarf x tall coconuts would be established during the period 1979-1982. The
seed garden would comprise 100 ha of "mother trees" (yellow and red dwarfs)
and 20 ha of "pollinators" (selected West African and Pacific Talls), the
selected seeds being imported from Ivory Coast, Benin and the Far East.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that the consultants selected



- 14 -
for the coconut project identification and preparation study would be accept-
able to the Bank and that the results of the study would be submitted to the
Bank for comment. It was agreed during negotiations that it would be a con-
dition of disbursement against the coconut seed garden that the coconut de-
velopment proposals are satisfactory to the Bank. (Details are given in
Annex 7).
(iv) Feasibility Study of Phase II Oil Palm Project
4.17      The project includes six man-months of consultants costing US$67,000
to prepare a Phase II project (para. 4.03) for implementation starting in 1983,
emphasizing expansion of smallholder oil palm plantings and completion of the
oil palm mills started under this project (para. 4.06). During negotiations
assurances were obtained that the terms of reference for the study and the
consultants chosen to undertake it would be acceptable to the Bank.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A.   Project Costs
5.01      Project costs during the six and a half year period 1978-1984, in-
cluding start-up costs in 1977/1978, are estimated at N54.0 million (US$83.0
million). If taxes and duties are excluded costs would be N52.7 million
(US$81.2 million). The foreign exchange component would be N19.4 million
(US$30.0 million) or 36% of total project costs.

5.03      Cost estimates are based on prices obtained during appraisal,
updated to reflect mid-1977 prices, and include a 5% physical contingency.
Price contingencies are calculated on base line costs plus physical contin-
gency and allow for compounded increases in foreign exchange costs of: (a)
vehicles, equipment, utilities and furniture and farm inputs of 4.5%, in the
second half of 1977, 7% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6% thereafter; (b) housing,
buildings, oil mill, construction of roads and consultant services of 4.5%
in July-December 1977, 8% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% thereafter; and (c)
salaries and operating costs of 3.5% in late 1977 and 7% thereafter. A price
contingency of 20% compounded annually has been applied for all local costs,
other than salaries and hired labor, to account for internal inflation. 1/
Contingencies are equivalent to 34% of total costs.
B.   Financial Arrangements
5.04      The proposed financing plan is detailed in Annex 9, Table 1 and
summarized below:

- 17 -
5.05      The Bank loan of US$30.0 million (36% of project costs) would be
equivalent to the foreign exchange costs, including US$2.2 million in 1977/
1978, the start-up year. It would finance about 40% of the nucleus estate
component or N 10.1 million (US$15.5 million), 45% of the coconut seed garden
or N 0.4 million (US$0.6 million) and 25% of Smallholder Management Unit or
N2.3 million (US$3.6 million), while N 6.6 million (US$10.1 million) would be
reserved for unallocated expenditures.
5.06      The Bank loan would be made to FMG for 20 years, including five
years grace on repayment of principal and onlent to Rivers State Government on
the same terms. FMG would provide an allocation equivalent to 25% of project
cost amounting to N 13.3 million (US$20.5 million). Assurances to these
effects were obtained during negotiations. It was agreed during negotia-
tions that the execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between FMG and the
State Government, which would cover both onlending of the Bank loan and the
FMG allocation duly authorized or ratified by all necessary corporate and
Governmental action, would be a condition of effectiveness.  The Rivers State
Government would finance 37% of project cost or N 20.1 million (US$30.9 mil-
lion) from the State budget and participating smallholders 2% or N 1.2 mil-
lion (US$1.8 million) in the form of labor and tools.
5.07      In turn, a portion of the Bank loan amounting to N 10.1 million
(US$15.5 million), plus N 8.0 million (US$12.3 million) of the total State
contribution and N 6.1 million (US$9.4 million) of the FMG total contribution
would be onlent to (or as necessary invested as equity in) RISONPALM Ltd.,
by the State Government to cover part of the nucleus estate cost. The loan
amounting to N 50.2 million (US$77.3 million) would be at 9% per annum for 25
years including a grace period of 10 years.  Due to the RISONPALM cash flow
position in the early years an extended grace period is required. In addition,
and in any case, there would be an equity contribution to RISONPALM Ltd. by
the State Government of at least N 4.2 million (US$6.5 million). Assurances
to these effects were obtained during negotiations. It was agreed during
negotiations that the execution of a subsidiary loan and equity subscription
agreement between Rivers State Government and RISONPALM Ltd. duly authorized
or ratified by all necessary corporate or governmental action would be a
condition of effectiveness. The proportion of the Bank loan, and FMG and
State Government contributions to total nucleus estate project costs would be
40%, 25% and 30% respectively.
5.08      The financing arrangements detailed in paras. 5.05 through 5.07
cover the funds needed for the six and a half year development period plus
start-up costs in 1977/1978 totalling N 4.0 million (US$6.2 million). The
start-up costs include foreign exchange costs of N 1.4 million (US$2.2 mil-
lion) which are included in the Bank loan, N 1.0 million (US$1.5 million)
provided by the Federal Government, N 1.6 million (US$2.5 million) provided
by the Rivers State Government.
5.09      To avoid delays in project implementation, heavy equipment must
be purchased to clear land for planting in 1978 and international staff
must be recruited as soon as possible after negotiations. It was agreed



- 18 -
during negotiations that retroactive financing of up to US$800,000 be made
available for the purchase of heavy equipment and US$450,000 for recruitment
of international staff, for eligible expenditures incurred after January 1,
1977.
C.   Procurement
5.10      Vehicles, tractors, fertilizers, chemicals, road-making equip-
ment, other equipment and farm inputs valued at about N 10.3 million (US$15.8
million) net of contingencies would be procured through international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines for contracts over
US$75,000, and through competitive bidding and in accordance with local
procedures satisfactory to the Bank for contracts less than US$75,000. For
contracts under US$10,000, direct competitive shopping would be employed.
Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference or the
applicable import duty, whichever is lower. Experience has shown that con-
tracts for houses, stores and buildings, which are valued at N 6.0 million
(US$9.2 million), are not attractive to foreign contractors due to dispersed
locations, small size of contracts and competitiveness of local contractors;
such contracts would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding.
Construction of roads would be undertaken by the project on force account
in view of the absence of local contractors working on earth road construc-
tion. A large part of project cost would be salaries, operating expenses,
training costs and field establishment costs valued at N 16.9 million (US$26.0
million) which are unsuitable for competitive bidding. The services of
consultants and expatriate staff valued at N 2.3 million (US$3.5 million)
would be obtained in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
An amount of N 18.5 million (US$28.5 million) would cover contingencies.
5.11      During negotiations assurances were obtained that the following
supplemental procurement procedures shall apply in the procurement of fer-
tilizer by the Federal Fertilizer Unit (FFU) of the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development on behalf of RISONPALM and SMU:
(i) RISONPALM and SMU shall furnish FFU, no later than 16
months next preceeding April 1st of the year of util-
ization, with details of the quantities, specifications
and packaging of fertilizer required, and details of
the timing and delivery points for the fertilizer;
(ii) FFU shall prepare tender documents for the said fertil-
izer in accordance with procedures consistent with
those set forth in the Bank's Guidelines referred to
in Schedule 1 to the Project Agreement for the Project
on the basis of international competitive bidding
(ICB);
(iii) after review by RISONPALM and SMU, FFU shall issue
tenders;



- 19 -
(iv) FFU shall review and evaluate returned bids, and after
review with RISONPALM, SMU and the Bank award, before
April 1st of the year preceeding utilization, contracts
following ICB procedures; and
(v) after receipt of the fertilizer at RISONPALM and SMU
stores, RISONPALM and SMU shall on the basis of satis-
factory shipping documents provided by FFU, request
the Bank to reimburse the foreign exchange cost of the
fertilizer to FFU.
(vi) In the event that the contracts for fertilizer have not
been signed by April 1st of the year preceeding utiliza-
tion, then management of both RISONPALM and SMU shall
have the right to procure their fertilizer requirements
directly under ICB procedures. However, in view of time
constraints fertilizer requirements for 1979 shall be
ordered for delivery by FFU by the end of January 1979.
D.   Disbursements
5.12      The Bank loan would be disbursed during 1978-1984 as follows:
Category 1 - Nucleus Estate:
(a) 100% of foreign exchange costs of field establishment,
(excluding labor, locally procured seeds and cover
crops and land acquisition) housing, civil works,
offices, stores, and other buildings or (if locally
procured) 35% of these expenditures, totalling US$8.1
million;
(b) 100% of foreign exchange costs of vehicles and equipment
international staff salaries, consultants, feasibility
study, training, management fee and operating costs or (if
locally procured) 75% of these costs, totalling US$12.8
million.
Category 2 - Coconut Seed Garden:
100% of the foreign exchange costs of the coconut seed
garden or (if locally procured) 45% of these expenditures,
totalling US$0.8 million.
Category 3 - Smallholder Management Unit
(a) 100% of foreign exchange costs of field establishment
(excluding labor, locally procured seeds and cover crops)
and housing or (if locally procured) 50% of these costs,
totalling US$1.9 million;



- 20 -
(b) 100% of foreign exch,ange costs of road construction (ex-
cluding local staff salaries), staff training, interna-
tional staff salaries, vehicles and equipment, consultants
and operating costs or (if locally procured) 30% of these
expenditures, totalling US$3.7 million.
Category 4 - An unallocated amount of US$2.7 million.
5.13      Disbursements would be fully documented.  Those against field
establishment and operating costs in Categories 1 (a and b), 2 and 3 (a and b)
would be against certificates of expenditure to be retained by the nucleus
estate or SMU for review by supervision missions and the auditors.
E.   Budgets, Accounts and Audits
5.14      Annual budgets would be prepared by the nucleus estate for approval
by the Board of RISONPALM Ltd. and by SMU for approval by its Steering Com-
mittee (see para. 6.02). These budgets as approved shall be furnished to RSG
and FMG for their review not later than five months before the commencement
of each fiscal year. The nucleus estate and SMU would prepare quarterly
cash flow statements which would be submitted to the RISONPALM Board and
SMU Steering Committee respectively and would operate on the basis of these
statements unless informed otherwise. The nucleus estate and SMU would
prepare for prompt submission to the Bank, quarterly and annual progress
reports including summaries of expenditures and use of funds. During negotia-
tions assurances were obtained that the above procedures would be followed.
5.15      On the basis of the approved annual budgets, *the State and Federal
Governments would make budgetary allocations and, thereafter, would make
available to the nucleus estate and SMU all necessary funds quarterly and
in advance. Separate bank accounts for the nucleus estate and SMU would be
opened and adequately funded, and this would be a condition of effectiveness.
5.16      The nucleus estate and SMU would keep records, in accordance
with sound accounting practices, to reflect their operations and financial
positions and would have these audited by a firm of independent external
auditors acceptable to the Bank; the audited accounts and the auditor's
report would be submitted to the Bank within four months of the end of the
fiscal year. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Organization and Management
6.01      Project implementation would involve:  the Smallholder Management
Unit (SMU), RISONPALM Ltd, and the Federal Department of Agriculture's Moni-
toring and Evaluation Unit (MEU).



- 21 -
Smallholder Management Unit (SMU)
6.02      General.  SMU would be responsible for the smallholder program.  It
would have a high degree of financial and administrative autonomy as a compo-
nent of the Rivers State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).
During negotiations it was agreed that the publication in the Gazette, notices
establishing SMU and the Steering Committee in a form satisfactory to the Bank
and that SMIJ's management positions have been filled would be conditions of
effectiveness.  The Steering Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of
MANR and comprised of Government agency representatives, would determine SMU
policy, approve work programs and budgets and review quarterly reports.
Details of the SMUJ structure and operational procedures are in Annex 10. A
mechanized accounting system would be set up for SMU by consultants whose
qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment (including
terms of reference) shall be satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations
assurances to this effect were obtained.
6.03      Management Structure and Staffing.  SMU headquarters would be
at Ahoada with regional units at Ahoada, Isiokpo and Okehi. SMU would be
staffed primarily with existing MANR personnel. At headquarters, senior
management would comprise a General Manager, Controller of Field Operations,
Controller of Finance, and Roads Engineer. These posts would be filled by
staff with qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of service
satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations assurance to this effect was
obtained. If suitably qualified Nigerians are not available, the posts would
be filled initially through international recruiting. The Managers of the
three regional units would be equivalent to experienced senior agricultural
officers.
6.04      Operational Procedures.  Notices calling for applications from
smallholders and giving details of the scheme would be publicized through
local newspapers, radio and public administration offices. To make efficient
use of field staff, particularly during planting when the heaviest intensity
of farm visits is required, a zonal system would be used. Thus, in any given
year, smallholder applications would be restricted to specific zones. Any
shortfall could be met by having an adjacent reserve zone for which applica-
tions could be requested but only accepted if required. Applications would
be called in January and closed in March preceding the planting year. SMU
would inspect applicant's smallholdings to ascertain suitability and eligi-
bility and, in consultation with the cooperatives, the farmer's credit status.
Applications would be approved by a Planting Authorization Committee (PAC)
composed of SMU General Manager as Chairman, Controller of Field Operations,
Controller of Finance and a cooperative societies representative.
6.05      SMU would provide technical supervision and advice and ensure that:
(i) if Eupatorium covered more than 30% of the area to be planted, then SMU
shall assist the smallholder in clearing this weed by providing spraying
facilities the cost of which would be charged to the smallholder's credit
account; (ii) old palm trees were felled before new planting/replanting;
and (iii) only controlled intercropping during the first two years would



- 22 -
be permitted in the new planting of palms. Maintenance of suitable hus-
bandry standards including those above would be conditions of smallholder
participation. During negotiations assurances to these effects were obtained.
6.06      Purchase of Smallholder ffb.  The mill would provide a schedule
of ffb purchases and amounts due to smallholders, and credit SMU who, after
deducting loan repayments due to the State Government, would pay the balance
to each cooperative. The cooperative, after deducting the interest spread,
would distribute the balance to its members (see para. 4.12). The coopera-
tives would guarantee the repayment of the loans by their members.
RISONPALM Ltd.
6.07      RISONPALM Ltd. is a limited liability company formed on November 24,
1975 in accordance with the Companies Decree of 1968, and is responsible for
development of the oil palm estates formerly operated by Rivers State Agricul-
tural Production and Marketing Corporation (APMC). The members of the Board
of RISONPALM were appointed on April 4, 1977 by the Rivers State Executive
Council and include representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture,
Finance, and Trade and Economic Development (Details are in Annex 10).
6.08      Management of the Nucleus Estate Unit (NEU) would be provided by
management consultants, under a management agreement with terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. Senior management staff would initially comprise a
General Manager, Financial Controller, Two Field Managers and two Mechanical
Engineers all of whom would be appointed with qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of service satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations
assurances to these effects were obtained. It was agreed during negotiations
that the execution of this Management Agreement and the appointment of these
key staff would be conditions of effectiveness.
6.09      Responsibility for construction and operation of the project oil
mill would be included in the Management Agreement (see para. 6.08). Senior
management for the mill would comprise a Mill Manager, a Processing Engineer
and subsequently a Maintenance Engineer. Staff recruited would be appointed
with qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of service acceptable
to the Bank, and where suitably qualified Nigerians were not available the
posts would initially be filled through international recruitment. The
management agreement would specify that Nigerian personnel should be provided
with training and on-the-job managerial experience to enable them to fill
senior managerial and technical positions at an early stage.
6.10      Management of NEU and the mill would be responsible for establish-
ment and operation of the fruit collection system for both the estate and
the smallholders (see para. 4.08).
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU)
6.11      The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Federal Department of
Agriculture was established in Benin City, Bendel State in 1975 under Loan
1183-UNI. Its role is to monitor financial and technical performance of



- 23 -
projects to evaluate their economic and social impact, and to assist in the
planning of new projects. MEU would be involved in monitoring and evaluating
the proposed project but no further financing is required.
6.12      The progress of MEU to date has been mixed.  After initial recruit-
ment delays, the international complement of staff will soon be completed.
Good progress has been recorded on the technical monitoring aspect, and a
start is now being made on the economic evaluation. The demands of admin-
istration have impeded the work of financial monitoring. However, the main
weakness of the unit so far has been the difficulty in recruiting Nigerian
counterpart staff, and until this problem can be overcome the future of the
unit cannot be assured.
VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMER BENEFITS,
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS TO GOVERNMENT
Yields and Production
7.01      Nucleus estate and smallholder oil palms would begin yielding in
the fourth year after planting. At full maturity the estates are expected
to yield 12.5 tons of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per ha but smallholder yields
are estimated at 10 tons per ha, reflecting lower standards of maintenance.
Oil extraction rates are assumed to rise from 18% in the first harvesting
year to 21% at full maturity in the fourth year; kernels are estimated
at 4.5% of ffb. These estimates are in line with those experienced with
equivalent planting material under similar ecological conditions in West
Africa.
7.02      At full maturity in 1990 the project would produce annually about
47,250 tons of palm oil and 10,126 tons of kernels. The nucleus estates
would produce about 56% of total output and project smallholders the balance
(see Annex 3).
Market and Prices
7.03      In 1975, palm oil production in Nigeria was estimated at 500,000 tons
of which all but 35,000 tons was consumed domestically. This is in marked
contrast to the pre-civil war period when exports were considerable; for
example, in 1965 production was 574,000 tons and exports were 152,000 tons.
Annex I discusses likely trends in domestic supply and demand. Some oil
palm areas were destroyed or damaged during the civil war, but new plantings
are now coming into bearing, and production in 1985 is estimated at 640,000
tons per annum. Demand forecasts have drawn on a Bank study on the relation-
ship between income levels and consumption of fats and oils. Assuming a
population growth rate of 2.5% annually and a GNP growth rate of 6.4% per
annum to 1980 and 4.0% thereafter, and allowing for some substitution for
palm oil, total domestic demand for palm oil in 1985 is projected at approxi-
mately 800,000 tons. This indicates that, without the proposed project there
will be a supply deficit of up to 200,000 tons of palm oil per annum by 1985.

7.04      Commodity Boards are authorized to purchase all palm oil and kernels
offered for sale. Under these arrangements the Boards have, in the past,
purchased oil surplus to domestic requirements and exported it through the
Nigerian Produce Mark-ting Company (NPMC). Oil available for export in Rivers
State has declined rapidly in recent years and is now nonexistent, but the
domestic market for palm kernels is limited and the bulk continues to be
exported. The Marketing Boards, which largely functioned in the past as a
taxation mechanism rather than a price stabilization agency, jealously guarded
their rights to purchase palm oil surplus to domestic needs, and in particular
considered estate production to be for export. In recent years, however,
estates have sold oil domest:ically although the Boards retain their purchasing
authority. Given this situation, assurance was obtained during negotiations
that RISONPALM Ltd. would be permitted to sell project produced palm oil at
the most favorable market va:Lue. This assurance was obtained in the case of
the previous Bank assisted Oil Palm projects.
7.05      Domestic palm oil prices have risen considerably in recent years,
and now exceed world market 'Levels in the absence of imports. There is
considerable geographical and seasonal variation, but in Rivers State, 1976
retail prices for 4 gallon tins varied between N 600 and N840 per metric ton
(US$900 to US$1,430 at current exchange rates). Prices for a 0.65 liter
bottle were often higher but showed greater variations. The comparable Market-
ing Board purchase price was N 295 per ton for SPO (Special Grade Palm Oil) and
N 265 for TPO (Technical Grade Palm Oil) and producers who can do so naturally
prefer to sell in the free market. If, as expected, Nigeria becomes a major
importer of palm oil it is questionable whether domestic prices will remain so
much higher than international prices. For project benefits, therefore, the
Bank's forecast of world market prices has been used as a basis (see Annex 15).
7.06      Marketing Boards have in recent years purchased 90% of palm kernel
production. Until 1973 the Boards fixed purchase prices at a level substan-
tially below export prices. Subsequently an attempt was made to set fairer
producer prices. However, in 1975-76 world kernel prices more than halved from
1974 levels, leaving Marketing Board producer prices well above world prices.
In calculating project benefits kernel producer prices have been based on the
Bank's projected 1985 world market price (see Annex 15).
Farmer Benefits
7.07      Most project farm families would be able to plant and maintain
2 ha of oil palm without affecting present farming activities. Assuming
development of the 2 ha at one time, production would begin in the fourth
year from planting and full bearing would be reached in the eighth year.
Over the four-year development period farmers would receive a gross return
from the cash element of the grant/credit equal to about N 1.70 per manday
worked; the current unofficial farm wage rate is about N 2.00. A farm budget
is given in Annex 12.
7.08      Assuming a farmgate price of N 40.0 per ton of ffb, the gross
return (in constant 1976 terms) from 2 ha would start at N 254.0 in the
first year of production (year 4) rising to N 578.0 during the farmer's



- 25 -
repayment period (Years 7-12) and thereafter would average about N 814.0.
These returns compare favorably with those obtainable from alternative
tree or food crops even where improved management and planting material
are used. A 2-ha planting would require about 60 mandays a year for
maintenance and harvesting, and gross returns per manday would rise rapidly
from N 3.9 in the year of first production (Year 4) to an average of N 8.6
during Years 7-12 of loan repayment and N 12.9 thereafter.
7.09      Official data on smallholder farm incomes are sketchy.  However,
a recent unofficial socio-economic survey of the project area conciuded
that "60% of families have an annual income of between N600 and N1,600".
It may therefore be concluded that, for a relatively low labor input, a
holding of 1 or 2 hectares of improved oil palm could make a substantial
contribution to family incomes.
7.10      The farm budget calculations are deliberately conservative using
a ffb purchase price of N40.0 per ton, which is compatible with long term
international price forecasts (in real terms). If oil prices on the Nigerian
market remained at or close to recent levels, farm incomes could exceed the
forecast subject to increased costs, particularly labor. The actual purchase
price paid by RISONPALM to smallholders would be determined periodically by
a Price Policy Committee (PPC) which shall be established by January 1, 1982
in a form satisfactory to the Bank. It shall be responsible for the estab-
lishment, in accordance with principles acceptable to the Bank of a formula
for calculating the price of fresh fruit bunches of oil palm purchased by
RISONPALM from smallholders participating in the project. During negotiations
assurances to these effects were obtained. The formula proposed is discussed
in detail in Annex 11, and is in line with the arrangements agreed for the
previous Bank-assisted oil palm projects. The formula is designed to give the
smallholders a price that fairly reflects the revenues from oil sales at
prevailing market prices, while making provision for the mills to cover their
costs including depreciation, and earn a reasonable return on capital.
Financial Returns to RISONPALM Ltd.
7.11      RISONPALM Ltd. is a wholly owned State Government company and cash
deficits and surpluses ought to be considered in the light of the State Govern-
ment cash flow. The projected cash flow for RISONPALM Ltd. in 1976 constant
prices is in Annex 13. The cash flow shows that there would be annual cash
surpluses from 1982 through 1984; deficits would result thereafter through
1989, largely as a result of debt service repayment to State Government. The
peak annual deficit during this period would be N 2.3 million (US$3.5 million)
which would have to be met from commercial bank overdraft facilities or by the
State Government. From 2002 onwards, when State Government debt services are
completed annual surpluses would be N 9.2 million (US$14.2 million). These
surpluses would be available to meet increased smallholder producer prices,
for investment in further oil palm development, and for distribution to State
Government.



- 26 -
Financial Implication for State Government
7.12      The State Government cash flow is at Annex 14.  The cash flow
incorporates the IBRD loan and the Federal Goverment grant but it does
not take account of surpluses arising in RISONPALM Ltd. which is a wholly
owned State company (see para 7.11). From 1977 through 1987 the cumulative
deficit would rise from N 1.0 million (US$1.5 million) to N 44.0 million
(US$57.8 million). From 1994 through 2001 annual surpluses would accrue, by
which time the cumulative deficit would have been converted to a cumulative
surplus of N 62.2 million (US$95.8 million). Thus while there would be a
substantial burden on the State Government budget until full production is
reached, thereafter substantial surpluses would accrue. On this basis ex-
ternal financing of Phase II of the project from 1983 through 1986 is
warranted.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The principal direct benefits from the project would be additional
annual production of 47,250 tons of palm oil and 10,126 tons of kernels at
full maturity in 1990. In world prices (constant 1976 terms) this would
have a value of US$23 million. The palm oil would substitute for imports,
while kernels would be exported thus making a significant contribution to
the Nigerian balance of payments.
8.02      The economic rate of return is estimated at 15.2%.  Principal
assumptions are at Annex 15, including the sensitivity analysis. A 10%
reduction in benefit together with a 10% increase in costs reduces the
rate of return to 12.2%. The rate of return is comparable to similar
oil palm projects in Nigeria and elsewhere in West Africa.
8.03      At full maturity, there would be about 2,000 full time employment
opportunities created on the estate, in mills and with SMU. In addition,
extra employment and incomes would be generated and improved within the
smallholder sector. About 5,000 families (35,000 people) would benefit
directly from the smallholder component.
8.04      The project would involve training a considerable number of local
personnel in agricultural extension and management techniques and administra-
tion of agricultural credit schemes.
8.05      The project would upgrade about 400 km of roads and construct bridges
at two critical river crossings. Additional benefits excluded from the rate
of return are improved farm to market transport conditions which would assist
the entire project area population.
8.06      If the proposed coconut feasibility study confirms that coconut
development is viable, this would provide a basis for diversification in Rivers
State and elsewhere in Southern Nigeria.

NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
RIVERS STATE
OIL PALM SECTOR
A.   Market Prospects for Palm Oil
1.        World Market.  World exports of palm oil, which stagnated through-
out the 1950s and early 1960s, increased at 15% a year after 1967, and by 1975
the share of palm oil in exports of all fats and oils had reached 13% -- the
second largest after soybean oil. The Bank's staff projects world production
of fats and oils to increase by 88% between 1976 and 1985. During this period,
palm oil will expand its share from 6.8 to 10.1%. Most of this will come from
oil palms planted during the late sixties which will reach peak yields during
this period. (New plantings between now and 1980 will not affect palm oil
output significantly before 1985.) Oil palm projects financed by the Bank
Group will contribute about 10.1% to world production of palm oil by 1985.
2.        Internal consumption of palm oil in developing countries is ex-
pected to grow rapidly during the next decade (1976-1985), while palm oil
exports (mainly to developed countries) are projected to grow even faster.
Thus, the share of palm oil in the world trade of fats and oils will rise
from 11.8% in 1976 to 22.9% in 1985. Malaysia will continue to dominate
exports followed by Indonesia: the Ivory Coast and Zaire will be the main
exporters in West Africa.
3.        Developed countries import about 90% of palm oil traded in inter-
national markets. Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom account for
almost 60% of world palm oil imports. While the shares of the three Euro-
pean countries declined slightly during the past two decades (1955-1975),
the United States' share in imports rose considerably, and by the early
1970s accounted for 11-12% of the world trade. The rise in U.S. demand
reflects the trend towards greater use of vegetable oils in consumer prod-
ucts and the decline in the price of palm oil relative to that of other
vegetable oils.
4.        Technically, most fats and oils are to some degree interchange-
able. In assessing the market prospects for palm oil, its physical charac-
teristics have to be taken into account. Palm oil is a "hard oil"; it con-
tains a larger portion of saturated fatty acids than most of its major
competitors (soybean oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, etc.), and unlike
the lauric oils (coconut oil and palm kernel oil), does not contain any
components which would guarantee it a market in which it is preferred over
other fats and oils. The supply of palm is highly inelastic, because



ANNEX 1
Page 2
harvesting will continue even if palm oil prices should fall below variable
costs. There are two main reasons: (a) producers have few alternative pro-
duction possibilities, short of uprooting the palms; and (b) they would have
to collect the ripe fresh fruit bunches anyway, to prevent plant diseases
caused by rotting palm fruit. The decision as to whether to extract the oil
will depend largely on the direct operating costs of the mill and the market-
ing costs for the end products (palm oil, palm kernel oil, and palm kernel
cake).
5.        The past decade saw a significant shift in the consumption away
from animal fats and oils to vegetable oils. Among the vegetable oils,
the demand for soft oils (soybean oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, etc,),
expanded more rapidly than the demand for hard oils (palm oil, coconut oil,
palm kernel oil). This trend is expected to continue. By 1985 the share of
vegetable oils in total fats and oils consumption will reach more than 70%.
Continued strong demand for soft oils combined with growing supplies of
hard oils will exert increasing pressure on prices for palm oil and other
hard oils. This has been taken into account in calculating the future eco-
nomic price for palm oil (see Annex 15). Palm oil enjoys one important ad-
vantage over the soft oils however; namely, low production costs which make
it an economically attractive product for many developing countries.
6.        According to Bank projections, world demand for all fats and oils
(based on 1974 constant prices) will rise to 51.7 million tons in 1980 and
57.4 million tons in 1985. Demand for vegetable oils which has grown at an
average rate of 4.2% between 1960 and 1975 is expected to reach about 37 mil-
lion tons in 1980 and 41 million tons in 1985. Meanwhile, world supply of
all fats and oils in 1985 is expected to reach 58.3 million tons. Almost
one-fourth of the total supply will come from soybean oil, about 10% from
palm oil. The total share of vegetable oils (hard oils and soft oils com-
bined) will be 70%, that of animal fats and marine oils, 30%. With world
supply of all fats and oils in 1980 expected to exceed world demand by a
margin of 1.5 million tons, prices for fats and oils (in real terms) are
expected to be around currenLt low levels. Between 1980 and 1985 demand
for fats and oils is projected to grow faster than during 1975-80, reducing
the gap between demand and supplies of fats and oils to 800,000 tons. Thus
prices are projected to recover from their 1980 low levels and to approach
again their level of the late 1960s.
Domestic Market
Supply
7.        During the early sixties Nigeria was one of the world's leading
producers and exporters of palm oil and palm kernels, accounting for about
40% of total production and nearly 3% of world trade. However, from 1960-
1966 annual production remained more or less stagnant. The civil war (1966-
1970) took place mostly in the palm belt of Nigeria which adversely affected
the oil palm industry. Many palm areas (wild groves and estates) and pro-
cessing facilities were then destroyed, large palm areas were cleared for
emergency food production and the whole socio-economic framework of oil palm



ANNEX I
Page 3
production and marketing was disrupted. Since the cessation of hostilities,
production has been increasing but has not yet attained the pre-war level.
8.        The major palm producing areas of Nigeria are located in former
Western, Mid-Western, East Central, South East and the Rivers States. Apart
from some commercial estates, farm settlement and rehabilitated groves, the
bulk of the palm products comes from wild groves. Since most palm oil pro-
duction is either consumed by the farm family or sold in local markets,
statistics on production (and consumption) are subject to considerable
uncertainty. In U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates, Nigerian palm
oil production reached a pre-civil war peak of 580,000 tons in 1966. The
FAO places the peak in 1965, at 574,000 tons. However, one estimate by
the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Agriculture placed pre-war production
at a level closer to 750,000 tons. Production has not returned to pre-war
levels as, according to USDA estimates, the post-war peak to date was achieved
in 1976 with production of 510,000 tons.
9.        What potential is there for further expansion in supply in the ab-
sence of new planting schemes? Nearly 90% of the present supply of palm oil
produced in Nigeria comes from wild groves. However, exploitation of wild
palms reached a maximum in the mid-1960s and any improvements in future ex-
traction rates through the introduction of more efficient processing will be
largely offset by decreased fruits production as trees age and become diffi-
cult to harvest. Production may also be depressed by felling of wild palms
for food crops as population densities increase in the southern states.
10.       As such, the scope for increasing palm oil production from exist-
ing sources is limited and is dependent upon new planting and replanting
programs. Prior to 1966 some plantings of improved palm on estates, farm
settlements and rehabilitated groves had been initiated, but in Eastern
Nigeria the program was halted during the civil war. The study group on
oil palm of the National Agricultural Development Committee estimated in
its report (June 1972) that until 1971/72 about 162,802 acres (66,000 ha)
of palm had been improved. In short, to compare the potential output from
trees already planted with levels achieved before the war one must consider
first the destruction of trees that were bearing in the mid-1960s, and
secondly new plantings (both pre- and post-war) that were not yet yielding
in 1965-66. On this basis it is estimated that total production from exist-
ing plantings, including improved palm planted before the civil war, is
unlikely to exceed 570,000 tons per annum.
11.       Some additional output will come from planting schemes in the
pipeline or under way. The three IBRD-assisted projects in Bendel, Imo
and Ondo States will develop 42,000 hectares with peak annual production
of 98,900 tons of oil. Allowing for implementation delays, their joint
contribution by 1985 may be around 32,000 tons. Another smaller develop-
ment already under way at Ohaji in Imo State may contribute up to 12,000
tons per annum by the mid-1980's. The Federal Military Government plans
to sponsor further new planting and replanting schemes, but it seems un-
likely that these will provide more than 25,000 tons per annum by 1985.
To summarize, estimated Nigerian palm oil production in 1985 might, under



ANNEX 1
Page 4
favorable circumstances, reaclh 640,000 tons without the proposed project,
which would add a further 26,000 tons in 1985 and 55,000 tons at full pro-
duction.
Demand
12.       The domestic market for palm oil is overwhelmingly for household
consumption in preparation of food. Industrial demand for soap and margarine
production has probably averaged less than 20,000 tons per annum, which is
3-4% of total output. Nigeria has ceased to be important on world markets
since the start of the civil war, though there have been small quantities
exported in good years (e.g. 1975). See Tables 1 and 2. 1/
13.       As explained above, the informal processing and marketing arrange-
ments make it impossible to produce precise estimates of output or household
consumption of palm oil within Nigeria.  What is clear, however, is that pres-
ent consumption and production are practically identical.  In other words,
given that there is virtually no inward or outward trade, any revision of
production estimates would have to be accompanied by a similar adjustment
to consumption figures, and vice versa. Working from its own production
estimates and official trade data, the U.S. Department of Agriculture con-
cluded that in 1976 the domestic market would absorb some 485,000 tons.
14.       An alternative approach is to concentrate upon estimating consump-
tion directly, rather than inferring it from production data. The Federal
office of Statistics is presently processing a survey of household consump-
tion patterns, but no results are yet available. The most recent surveys
for which final data are avaiLable date back to the mid-1960s. These gave
an estimated average per capil:a consumption of fats and oils of about 9.4 kg,
of which 90% was accounted for by palm oil. Both of these figures were sub-
ject to considerable regional variation, with the southern states showing
much higher average consumption levels than those in the north. These per
capita consumption figures, a:Lthough valuable, are now markedly out of date;
and aggregation of such per capita figures is itself problematic, in view
of the absence of population statistics that command widespread acceptance.
15.       Although the precise consumption level is difficult to assess,
future demand trends compared to supply potential may be somewhat clearer.
The limited opportunities for expanding supply within the next 10 years have
already been pointed out. On the demand side a major expansion must be ex-
pected, which may lead to further domestic price increases, or to substantial
and increasing imports or both.
1/   The Ministry of Trade permit scheme has apparently been used to restrict
the import of palm oil for consumption but small quantities of special
grade palm oil (2,000-3,000 tons per annum) have been imported in recent
years for industrial use by margarine producers, in the light of the
virtual non-availability of S.P.O. from the NPMC (see Table 2). It has
not been possible to confirm reports of imports of palm oil for consump-
tion purposes.

16.       Firstly, population is expected to continue growing rapidly.  The
Bank forecasts a future growth rate of 2.5% per annum, which appears in line
with recent experience. Average income levels are also expected to continue
their upward trend. The Bank forecasts that real per capita GNP will rise at
6.4% per annum until 1980 and 4.0% between then and 1985.
17.       The relationship between per capita income levels and intake of fats
and oils has been the subject of an extensive cross-country study within the
Bank. It has been concluded that the relationship is not a linear one, but
that the income elasticity of demand for fats and oils is in fact higher at
lower levels of income. In the ranges of average per capita incomes antic-
ipated in Nigeria over the next decade income elasticity of demand can be
expected to be around 0.63. Therefore between 1976 and 1985, aggregate con-
sumption of fats and oils in Nigeria is projected to grow at an average annual
rate of 7.8% from 1976 to 1980 and 5.1% from 1980 to 1985. In aggregate terms,
total consumption of fats and oils is predicted to rise from 565,000 tons in
1976 to 762,000 tons in 1980 and 978,000 tons in 1985.
18.       There remains to be discussed the likely share of palm oil in total
fats and oils demand. Palm oil is the most widely consumed edible oil in
Nigeria, lower in price than its nearest substitutes. Groundnut oil and
cottonseed oil (see paragraphs 19-21) are also consumed, as well as smaller
quantities of other products such as butter, melon-seed oil and coconut oil.
But at the present time it is likely that palm oil accounts for 85-90% of
total fats and oils consumption.
19.       Groundnuts are the second source of edible vegetable oils in Nigeria,
but the quantity of groundnut oil consumed is estimated to be less than 10%
of the consumption of palm oil. Groundnuts are produced in the northern
states, and an important part is consumed directly by farm families. There
is also some "backyard crushing". The Marketing Boards and NPMC have handled
groundnuts for commercial crushing and export. In the past a large propor-
tion of the crop has been exported directly, and in turn most of the commer-
cially milled oil has been exported. Over the past four years the groundnut
crop has been well below earlier levels as a result of climatic conditions
and disease. Many mills have suspended crushing operations, and in 1976 up
to 30,000 tons of groundnut oil were imported to meet domestic requirements.
Details of production and trade appear in Table 6.
20.       Groundnut oil consumption in Nigeria has probably averaged about
40,000 tons per annum in recent years, although the "backyard crushers" make
precise estimates impossible. Groundnut oil is a much higher priced commod-
ity than palm oil, both on international markets, where the price differential
has varied between 45% and 100%, and on the domestic Nigerian market, where
the differential has varied even more widely. Groundnut oil has therefore
been something of a luxury commodity, and while rising income levels may lead
to some substitution at the margin, its higher production costs preclude
groundnut oil's becoming a mass consumption item on the scale of palm oil.



ANNEX I
Page 6
21.       Small quantities of cottonseed oil are also produced and absorbed
by the domestic market (about 20,000 tons a year recently). The seed is a
by-product of the growing ot cotton for the textile industry and most cotton-
seed is used as animal fodder. However, mills have recently been opened that
are capable of crushing both cottonseed and groundnuts. Like groundnut oil,
cottonseed oil is a higher priced commodity than palm oil.
22.       In view of their status as luxury products some substitution towards
competing fats and oils and away from palm oil is to be expected. It is as-
sumed, therefore, that palm oil's share of the market will fall from 85-90%
at present to 80-85% by the mid-1980s. In summary, it is estimated that the
potential domestic market for palm oil by 1985 will be in the range of
780,000-830,000 tons per annum.
23.       The estimates of domestic demand and supply presented above lead
to the conclusion that a shortfall of some 140,000-190,000 tons of palm oil
may be expected in 1985 in the absence of further measures to expand output.
24.       Palm kernels.  Approximately 90% of kernel production has been pur-
chased by NPMC, through the Marketing Boards, for sale to local processors
or for export. Until the mid-1960's, there was very little local crushing
of kernels, and nearly the entire production was exported in kernel form.
Since 1965, however, several crushing mills have been established, and in
recent years have absorbed about a third of total kernel production, the rest
being exported directly. In turn, about half of the kernel oil from these
local mills has tended to go for export (see Table 4).
25.       The Federal Military Government has responsibility for setting the
producer price paid to farmers, and also the resale price to domestic crushers.
As Table 5 shows, NPMC's prices usually lagged well behind export parity
prices, and this led to difficulties after 1975 when world market prices for
kernels (and kernel oil) slumped. Local kernel crushers were still paying
boom prices for their kernel supplies, while their export sales prices for oil
had fallen very sharply. While awaiting a price review by FMG, several of the
Nigerian crushing mills were obliged to suspend operations.
Institutional Framework
26.       The majority of palm oil is produced by local methods and either
consumed at home or sold in village markets, by-passing official marketing
channels. The standard retail unit is the beer bottle (0.65 liter). Retail
and wholesale prices are subject to considerable variation, but seem to be
well above official marketing board purchase prices or indeed a probable
import parity level. Prices in Port Harcourt in July-September 1975 were
25-30 kobos per beer bottle, while prices for a 4 gallon tin were said to
fluctuate between N 10 and N 14. The quantities handled officially have
accordingly fallen to a very small proportion of output (see Tables 2 and 3).
27.       The declining importance of marketing boards is also a reflection
of the decline in Nigeria's status as a significant exporter of palm oil.
The official bodies have enjoyed a monopoly of sales of palm oil and kernels



ANNEX I
Page 7
for export and local processsing, and while these markets are still of major
importance in the case of kernels, they now account for only a trivial pro-
portion of palm oil sales. Unable to match the prices that producers can
obtain in local markets, the marketing boards' oil supplies have in recent
years been mostly limited to output from a few government-owned plantations
and mills.
28.       The official marketing system until recently consisted of a market-
ing board in each state. In the case of Rivers State this function was
performed by the Agricultural Production and Marketing Corporation (see Annex
2). The marketing boards were responsible for purchasing agricultural produce
including palm oil and palm kernels and other commercial crops. 1/ Produce
was purchased through locally appointed Licensed Buying Agents, operating
on a fiscal margin per ton of producer known as a block buying allowance.
The purchasing prices have been fixed annually by the Head of the Federal
Military Government, following the abandonment of earlier arrangements under
which the marketing boards themselves fixed these prices.
29.       At the federal level the marketing boards were associated with the
Nigerian Produce Marketing Company, which enjoyed a monopoly of sales for
export and sales to domestic processors. The above organizational structure
was replaced in April 1977 by a new system of commodity boards. Each board is
being established on a national basis and will take over the present responsi-
bilities of the NPMC and the marketing boards for one particular commodity or
group of commodities. Palm oil and kernels are among the commodities to be
handled by the new Palm Produce Board.

STATE INSTITUTIONS
1.        The Ministry of Trade and Economic Development is responsible for
coordinating development proposals within Rivers State. Five-year plans are
drafted at state level, and finalized after submission to the federal author-
ities. The current plan period runs from 1975 to 1980. The original plan
document envisaged a five-year program of N 472 million, of which 10.1% was
earmarked for agriculture, plus a further 2.8% for forestry, fisheries and
livestock. The new State Administration is now reviewing all programs in
the plan.
2.        The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) is respon-
sible for formulating and executing agriculture, livestock, fisheries and
forestry development programs. It also operates research programs, and
supervises the work of the School of Agriculture and Fisheries.
3.        The Extension Division of MANR has a small headquarters staff of 9
senior and intermediate level personnel under the Chief Agricultural Officer.
The field staff is organized geographically, with the state divided into 6
zones. Staff in each zone should be headed by a Senior Agricultural Officer
(or Senior Fisheries Officer) but currently these posts are filled by staff
of Agricultural Officer level. The total provision for senior and inter-
mediate level staff for the Divison is 278 posts, but in October 1976 only
176 posts were filled. The shortfall is at the intermediate levels of Agri-
cultural Superintendents, Agricultural Assistants and Field Overseers.
4.        Extension activities of oil palm development to date have been
limited to distribution of NIFOR improved planting material. The program
has suffered from delays and wastage of planting material, and does not
provide the intensive technical assistance and follow-up required.
5.        Since the civil war there has been little opportunity for MANR
staff to gain experience operating agricultural credit schemes. In March
1976, however, a Supervised Agricultural Credit scheme was formally launched
by the Ministry, with an allocation of N 500,000 for the year 1976-77. The
purpose of the scheme is to provide small loans, mostly in kind, with annual
interest at 2%; the loan repayment period depends on the crop, with tree
crop loans having the longest term. A new section has been formed within
MANR to operate the credit scheme, and the aim is to allocate at least one
credit officer to each of the former administrative divisions. Although
loan application forms have been distributed, in October 1976 no applica-
tions had been processed, and no loans granted.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
6.        Training in agriculture within the state is provided by two insti-
tutions. The MANR's own School of Agriculture and Fisheries at Onne operates
a one-year crash training program, and reported an intake of 110 students in
1976. The School of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the College of
Science and Technology, Port Harcourt, offers an eight-term diploma course
in general agriculture, comprising six terms of course work and two of prac-
tical farming. The student population in mid-1976 was reported as 142. Both
institutions have experienced difficulties over physical facilities, and the
MANR School also suffers from a lack of permanent teaching staff.
Agricultural Production and Marketing Corporation
7.        APMC was the result of a merger between the Rivers State Marketing
Board (see Annex 1) and the Rivers State Development Corporation in August
1974. In consequence, APMC had a dual role, that of a marketing board, pur-
chasing commodities through Licensed Buying Agents, and that of a direct pro-
ducer. In the latter role, APMC operated estates and mills on behalf of the
State Government, including the present Elele Oil Palm Plantation, a number
of palm oil mills, and several rubber plantations.
8.        APMC was reorganized in April 1977, when the marketing board system
was changed (Annex 1). The Marketing responsibilities passed to the Palm
Produce Board, and the direct production role was divided between two newly
established companies, one of which assumed all assets in the rubber sector,
while the other - Risonpalm Ltd. - took over the assets and management of
State interests in oil palm, including the proposed project. Details of
Risonpalm Ltd. are in Annex 10. As existing APMC management personnel do not
possess the capability and experience to implement new planting schemes senior
staff for the proposed project will be recruited locally and internationally.
Cooperatives
9.        The Rivers State cooperative movement consists of primary societies
(507 at 6/30/75), secondary unions (8 local cooperative unions and coopera-
tive credit unions) and three apex organizations at state level. Legal steps
required to form a cooperative are minimal. After an application has been
approved, the cooperative becomes an unregistered society; it can be fully
registered after satisfactory performance under supervision. Of the 507
primary societies, 289 were registered and 218 unregistered.
10.       In the four divisions most affected by the proposed project the
number of registered primary societies, and their membership as of late 1976
were as given in the table below. Many other societies were still at the
"'unregistered" stage. It would assist project implementation if members of
unregistered societies, for which applications had already been approved,
could be incorporated in the credit scheme.

Total                   77                            2,397
11.       Of the three apex boclies, the Rivers State Cooperative Produce
Exporters Ltd. acts as a licensed buying agent for APMC handling palm kernel
and cocoa output of the primary societies. The second apex organization,
the Rivers State Cooperative Supply and Consumers Association Ltd. performs
a wholesaling function, supplying commodities to primaries for resale. The
third apex body is the Rivers State Cooperative Union Ltd. which acts as a
spokesman for the interests of the state cooperative movement.
12.       In contrast to many other states, there is no cooperative bank or
financing society in Rivers State. The State Government has allocated N 1.5
million for funding a cooperative bank, but is awaiting a Federal Government
review of the financial system. This is expected to result in a definition of
policy for development of the banking system, which will enable the State Gov-
ernment to decide whether to establish a bank or a financing society. The
latter would be easier, since a financing society may be registered by the
Registrar of Cooperative Societies under the Cooperatives Ordinance with a
minimum of formalities, while a bank must satisfy the more stringent Banking
Ordinance provisions including a minimum capitalization of N 600,000. In
either case, the members of the bank or financing society would be the primary
cooperative societies, which could hold accounts with and receive loans from
apex organizations.
13.       The Cooperative Division of the Ministry of Rural Development and
Social Welfare is responsible for regulating the cooperative movement. Each
society's books are supposed to be inspected by the division every six months.
Before the civil war, there operated a system of traveling secretaries who
assisted the primary societies with bookkeeping, but this has not been re-
established. The Cooperative Division has been hampered by a shortage of
staff and in late 1976, the Registrar reported a limited professional staff
of 2 assistant registrars, 5 cooperative officers and 5 assistant coopera-
tive officers. Until recently, salaries within the Cooperative Division
have not been attractive compared with similar Government positions although
a recent adjustment should lead to some improvement in staff recruitment and
retention.
14.       The project would strengthen the cooperative movement, both through
the financial resources that it would channel to the primary societies (see
Annex 5) and also through the technical assistance that the credit staff of
the SHU would provide to the officers of the cooperative societies in the
project area. The credit officers and loan assistants would work closely with
those societies whose members participated in the project, and SMU would co-
ordinate its activities with those of the cooperative division.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF ESTABLISHMENT AND PRODUCTION
A.   Climate, Soils, Vegetation, Pests and Diseases in Project Areas
1.        It has been shown that the main influence on the bunch yield of the
oil palm in West Africa is the severity of the dry season two years previously
and that the general level of yield for any soil class is related to the water
deficit. 1/

project lies in an area with a mean annual rainfall of + 2,500 mm (100").
This annual rainfall increases rapidly to the South of the project area
while it decreases slowly towards the North. It is usually considered
ample for the oil palm if the monthly distribution is even.
3.        A feature of the rainfall pattern in Rivers State is a single long
rainy season from March to mid-November. From March onward the rainfall in-
creases to a peak in September (the mean for 11 years in AHOADA is 500 mm
with annual variations ranging from 280 to 700 mm), and then decreases rapidly
in October and November. The dry season (including months with less than 100
mm) lasts 3 to 4 months from mid-November to the end of February. It should
be noted, however, that annual rainfall varies considerably from year to year,
this being a general feature of the climate in West Africa.
4.        The water deficit not only varies with the annual rainfall, it also
depends on the monthly rainfall distribution. The water deficits shown in Map
2 have been calculated by a standard I.R.H.O. formula which assumes a soil
water reserve of 200 mm and an evapo-transpiration of 150 mm in months with
less than 10 days' rain, and an evapo-transpiration of 120 mm in months with
10 rainy days or more. Water deficits vary considerably from year to year
and this is reflected in the marked variation in annual bunch yields charac-
teristic of planted areas in Nigeria.

5.        Map 10561R1 shows the iso-deficit lines estimated from the water
deficits of the stations marked. These water deficits are related to two
periods: 1950-1962 and the early seventies. The Map shows that the proj-
ect lies in areas having a mean annual water deficit between 200 and 250 mm.
These water deficits are among the lowest in West Africa.
Temperatures
6.        Mean monthly temperatures in AHOADA, situated in the project area,
lie between 26oC and 28oC with mean maxima varying between 29oC and 36oC and
mean minima between 2OoC and 23oC. The highest temperatures are experienced
at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season.  The
mean monthly minimum temperature always exceeds 18oC which is considered
to be a critical minimum temperature for oil palm cultivation. There is no
inhibiting effect on the growth of the oil palm and mean temperatures are
very close to 28oC which is considered to be the optimum for growth and
production.
Humidity
7.        Mean monthly humidity is always very high, especially in the rainy
season.   The effect of the harmattan wind during the dry season is probably
very limited as the relative humidity is fairly steady during this period.
This factor can be considered as being satisfactory for oil palm cultivation.
Sunshine and Sky Radiation
8.        Sunshine records in Rivers State are only kept for Port Harcourt
airport which is situated 5 km south of the project area. On the basis of
the limited data available, it is estimated that the mean annual sunshine is
about 1,400 hours. For a long time, sunshine of 1,800 hours was considered
a prudent minimum for the optimum photosynthetic activity, whilst 1,500 hours
was accepted as the lowest limit. Recently, however, the IRHO noted that
there is no direct relationship between sunshine (recorded with a Campbell
Stokes) and the actual sky radiation (cal/cm/day) which controls photosyn-
thetic activity. The following data assembled by the I.R.H.O. and quoted
by SOCFINCO in its feasibility study confirm this assumption.

9.        The yields of 18 tons/FFB year are obtained in Ecuador despite the
low sunshine, but on very good soils and with a rainfall which is satisfac-
tory on the whole, albeit very badly distributed. The above data show that



ANNEX 3
Page 3
a total of 1,400 hours annual sunshine certainly has no inhibiting effect on
growth and production but as a precaution, a coefficient of correction of 95%
(Ratio R.S./I.C. for sky radiation) is applied to the potential yield deduced
from the relationship between production and water deficit (Figure 1).
Topography
10.       The largest part of the project area is situated on the Coastal
Plain Terrace (Pliocene - Pleistocene - Eocene - Oligocene - Miocene) which
covers a very large part of Southern Nigeria. This plain is of low altitude
and slopes gently towards the south. The topography is flat or very slightly
undulating; a few small swamps are encountered mostly in the southern part.
Only four rivers (Sombrero, Otamiri plus its tributary, and Imo Rivers) cross
the plain and flow to the south. The southern part of the smallholder area
is more dissected by small rivers which flow towards the Tidal Flats (Mangrove
area).
11.       The rest of the project area is situated on the Sub Recent Niger
Terrace (early Holocene - late Pleistocene) which occupies an intermediate
position between the Coastal Plain and the Delta Plain. This terrace is also
very flat but due to its lower altitude it is dissected by a network of smaller
streams and creeks fringed by narrow strips of swampy areas. The relief of the
project area is very suitable for the layout of the Nucleus Estate (plots of
100 ha) and road construction would be easy. In the smallholder area it would
be necessary to build some bridges over the main rivers and to install culverts
across the streams in the Sub Recent Terrace.
Soils
Soils of the Coastal Plain Terrace or "Acid Sands"
12.       These soils are classed in the ferrallitic soils (French system) or
in the Oxisols order (U.S.D.A. system). The parent materials are unconsoli-
dated grits and sandstones. According to Vine they are mainly classified
in the yellow CALABAR FASC. Typically these soils are deep, homogenous, free
of coarse elements (particles above 2 mm), never waterlogged (except in swampy
depressions). The dominant color is generally dark brown becoming clearer
and brighter down the profile as the clay content increases. The consistency
is friable, slightly or not at all plastic, and sticky. Internal drainage
is satisfactory.
13.       SOCFINCO and I.R.H.O. pedologists surveyed a zone of 68,000 ha
(1,000 km of traverses were cut) which included the nucleus estate sites for
phase I and phase 2 and a small proportion of the smallholder areas. During
this survey different soil series were identified according to their fine
particle content at 2 ft level (60-80 cm). Generally the top soil (above
60 cm) is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam or even sandy clay loam while the
sub soil (below 60 cm) varies from sandy loam to heavy sandy clay loam.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
14.       The main features of the classification in soil series are briefly
described below:
Yellow-brown Plateau Soils
Light sandy clay series (sandy loam) of EGBEDA. This soil
series occupied only a very limited sector in the North
West part of the smallholder area. Fine particle content
at 2 ft level: 15-20%.
Sandy clay series (sandy loam) of ELELE occupies a large
area in the North-West part of the Nucleus Estate (Phase
1). Fine particle content at 2 ft level: 20-30%; clay
content at 2 ft level: +25%.
Heavy sandy clay series (sandy clay loam) of OBELE is not
most representative of the Nucleus Estate (Phase 2). Fine
particle content at 2 ft level: 35-42%; clay content at
2 ft level: +35%.
Red-brown Plateau Soils
Light clay sandy series (sandy clay loam) of OMERULU occupies
almost all the North-East Part of the Nucleus Estate (Phase 1)
and is also represented in the North-West part. Fine parti-
cle content at 2 ft. deep: 23-38%; clay content at 2 ft
deep: +25%.
15.       The soil maps contained in the SOCFINCO study give the geographi-
cal location of the different soils series - these maps cover a small part
of the smallholder area which was too large to be surveyed with traverses.
But reconnaissances were made by SOCFINCO and by the mission along the
roads (smallholdings would be developed within strips 600 m wide along
the roads). These reconnaissances showed that similar types of soil occur.
16.       A high proportion of the balance between total earth and fine
particle content consists of coarse sands which provide good drainage and
give a friable consistency to the soils, favorable to root development.
SOCFINCO also give some data on the water holding capacity of the soils
which compares very satisfactorily with that of similar soils of other
areas in West Africa where oil palm grows well.
17.       The soils are acid and the organic matter content is fairly high
for these soil types. The total phosphorus content is very high but the
potassium levels are very low and the magnesium levels are low for oil palm
cultivation. The base saturation is low or medium; this is very common in
the rainy equatorial zone.
18.       In conclusion it can be said that the physical characteristics of
the Coastal Plain Sands are quite suitable for oil palm cultivation but that
the potassium and magnesium deficiencies would have to be made good by fer-
tilizer.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Soils of the Sub-Recent Niger Terrace
19.       The most frequent type of soil encountered in the flat areas of
the part of the Sub-Recent Terrace included in the smallholders area is
rather similar to the lighter series of the Coastal Plain Sands. The top
soil is dark brown on top and then brown, while the sub-soil is mainly yel-
low but can also be brown or beige. Generally, the top soil is a sandy
loam or a sandy clay loam with a clay content ranging from 15 to 25% and
a low silt content. There can be some variations in the silt content; a
few profiles have been identified as silty sandy loam. All these soils
are suitable for oil palm cultivation.
20.       The strips of waterlogged soils along the little streams and some
patches of very sandy soils encountered (during the reconnaissance carried
out at the time of the mission) along the Western border of the smallholder
areas should be rejected. The S.M.U. field officers would have to cross-
check the physical soil characteristics during their visits to the fields
when the farmers applied to join the scheme.
21.       There are no chemical data for the soils of the Sub-Recent Niger
Terrace, but due to the general effect of weathering and leaching in the
equatorial zones these soils can be expected to be low in potash and
magnesium.
Vegetation
22.        In the Eastern area of the Nucleus Estate (phase 1), where the popu-
lation is scanty, the vegetation consists mainly of oil palm at different den-
sities (a few up to more than 100/ha) mixed with fallow at various stages of
regrowth. A high proportion of this sector is under secondary regenerated
jungle and includes trees of medium size and height (umbrella trees) at a
rather high density. Some remnants of the original rain forest are also
encountered in this sector.
Nucleus Estate, Eastern Sector: distribution of the various vegetation types
in percentage of the total area:
Forest remnants                                 15
Secondary regenerated jungle                    46
Fallow (regrowth ages 2-3 years)                30
Tree crops                                     1
Food crops                                     8
Total                       100
According to the percentage of land under food crops the mean turnover period
is approximately 12 years, but some ateas may be more frequently farmed than
others.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
23.       In the Western area of the Nucleus Estate, also sparsely populated,
the density of wild nalms is generally high but there are fewer trees than
on the Eatern side. ihe area under food crops is also small.
Nucleus Estate, Western Sector: distribution of the various vegetation types
of vegetation in percentage of the total area:
Forest remnants                                  5
Secondary regenerated jungle                    33
Fallow (regrowth ages 2-3 years)                50
Tree crops                                     1
Food crops                                    11
Total                       100
According to the percentage of land under food crops the mean turnover period
is approximately 9 years.
24.       In the smallholding areas where population density is high, the
proportion of land under cultivation increases, the fallow is younger and
the density of trees, including oil palms, is lower. The most advanced stage
of exploitation of the original rain forest is found in the Southern and
Eastern sector (east of the OTAMIRI River) of the project areas where few
trees remain. In those areas the land is under food crops (mostly cassava
and yams) and young fallow.
25.       Eupatorium Odoratum 1/ is present in all recently cleared areas.
It invades the fields very rapidly after harvest and is the dominant species
in young fallows.
Pests and Diseases of Oil Palm in Rivers State
Pests
26.       Coelaenomenodera Elaeidis (Leaf Miner) is a permanent hazard in
West Africa and a severe outbreak occurred in Cowan Estate (Bendel State)
in 1967. It was identified in the ELELE Plantation during the Appraisal
Mission. Generally there is an effective biological control; the intro-
duction of some species of the parasite fauna will help this control.
Spraying with Parathion can 'be used in the case of severe outbreaks - the
I.R.H.O. is currently studying control with systemic insecticides.
27.       Oryctes (Rhinoceros beetle).  The population is small in Rivers
State. Damage to coconut is very limited. A cover crop overgrowing the
decaying trunks of oil palm will prevent the beetles laying their eggs and
multiplying. In case of infestation, ethyl chrysanthemate traps can be
placed on the plantings.

ANNEX 3
Page 7
28.       Root Borers.  The caterpillar of a Coleoptera beetle bores into
the roots which are destroyed by the subsequent rot. This pest has been found
near BORI. The I.-R.H.O. is studying its control in the Cameroons.
29.       Leaf eating caterpillars.  Various species have been observed in
Nigeria but generally they do not cause severe damage and they can be con-
trolled with insecticides.
30.       Other insects - Rhynchophorus Phoenicis, a palm weevil, can cause
damage when rodents are not controlled; Temnoschoita quadripustulata is also
present but is seldom a serious pest in nurseries.
31.       Rodents (rats and cutting-grass - Agoutis) are abundant and can
cause severe damage to young palms. The latter are protected against the
rats by collars of wire netting and also with baits made of poison. Cutting-
grass are killed by hunters.
Diseases
32.       Fusarium Oxysporum (Vascular Wilt) was already present in ELELE
plantation in 1974. Muriate of potassium can slow down the spread of the
disease. It is recommended that Wilt tolerant planting material is used
for new plantings in areas where Wilt has been identified.
33.       Cercospora and Anthracnose were reported in neglected nurseries
near BORI. They can be controlled with Dithane, Benlate, Pelt and Bavistine.
Sometimes it may be necessary to spray fungicides during the first years in
the fields.
34.       Blast.  The losses resulting from Blast in the nurseries are diffi-
cult to determine in Nigeria. In other countries of West Africa the annual
losses vary a lot, but in some years they can be as high as 70-80%. The
I.R.H.O. recommends shading of the nurseries during the dry season. Losses
due to blast in on-going Bank project nurseries have not been severe in spite
of a policy of no shade. It must however, be emphasized that in these
nurseries sprinkler or mobile irrigators have been in use. SOCFINCO pro-
pose using shade in the dry season until convinced that the incidence of
blast can be fully controlled by irrigation alone.

36.       The yield of this new planting material is much higher than that
of the Extension Work Seed produced in the previous years, but its Wilt
tolerance has as yet not been verified.
37.       The water deficit is 330 mm at NIFOR where, as can be seen above,
the estimated yield is 12.4 tons FFB/ha. Figure 1 shows that in the Ivory
Coast, by reason of the relationship between water deficit and yield, the
latter increases from 14 tons/ha to almost 17 tons (20%) when the deficit
falls from 330 mm to 250 mm (the maximum water deficit in the project area
in Rivers Sate). Assuming the same relationship for NIFOR planting mate-
rial in the conditions of Rivers State, and applying a correction factor
of 95% to allow for lower sky radiation, the potential yield would be 12.4
tons x 120% corrected x 95% = +14 tons/ha when the estate reached peak pro-
duction.  The oil/bunch ratio is unaffected by climate.

The yield for smallholdings is expected to be lower because most of the farms
would be planted in heavily cultivated areas and because experience has shown
that husbandry standards are not as high on small farms as on well managed
estates.
C. PROPOSED CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES
39.       To obtain well established early bearing palms in West Africa cer-
tain basic practices must be followed. The more important of these being:
(a) to use seeds of high-yielding planting materials (hybrids
between Dura Deli and African Pisifera);
(b) to raise the seedlings in two-stage polybag nurseries with
correct manuring and watering;
(c) to carry out vigorous culling of all abnormal or poorly-devel-
oped seedlings at the end of both nursery stages (pre-and main);
(d) to fell, burn and windrow the vegetation when preparing
the land. It may also be necessary to plough in order
to eradicate noxious weeds such as Eupatorium odoratum;
the aim being to have clean planting sites with easy
access to the young palms;
(e) to sow an adequate quantity of cover crop seeds;
(f) to field plant the seedlings as early as possible in the
rainy season (April-May in Rivers State conditions);
(g) to sow pueraria in late February, early March; to control
the vegetation by circle weeding, and to eliminate harm-
ful weeds in the interrow, especially during the first
years after planting;
(h) to ensure adequate manuring, whatever the age of the palms;
(i) to ensure the palms enjoy good phytosanitary conditions.
Unless these requirements are met fully, the yields expected in this project
will not be attained.
Germination
40.       The seeds would be germinated by NIFOR in water-heated or electri-
cally operated germinators. The "Dry Heat" method now commonly used ensures
at least 80-85% germination. The process takes approximately 100 days. The
germinated seeds - in the first stage of differentiation between pulmule and
radicle known as the "white point" stage - would be delivered to the Project



ANNEX 3
Page 10
packed in special containers to avoid any damage and losses during transport.
Normally it is assumed that 250 germinated seeds are required per ha to be
planted.
Pre-Nurseries
41.       The two-stage nursery in polybags (pre-nursery and main nursery)
is recommended because it makes supervision of the very young seedlings
easier during the first months after sprouting. The following are recom-
mendations for nursery equipment and practices:
(a) the polybags of 200 gauge (average size H 20 cm x W 10 cm
laid flat, with 20 holes pierced in the lower part for
drainage) should be filled with top soil;
(b) the top soil (0-20 cm) should be collected under forest or
in old fallow, sieved and disinfected (2 g Aldrin - 1 g
Cryptonol in 10 1 water for 200 bags) 2 weeks prior to
planting; two weeks after planting the bags should be
treated again with Cryptonol alone (1 g for 10 1);
(c) the germinated seeds should be planted from December through
February with the radicle downwards and at a depth of 2 cm;
(d) a shading cover should be provided, made of palm fronds
placed on a wooden frame to protect the seedlings; the
pre-nursery should be surrounded by a wire fence;
(e) the bags should usually be hand-weeded, but could be
weeded chemically before the plumule sprouts with a
solution of 0.2% Ametryne (Gesapax);
(f) there should be regular watering (2 mm/day);
(g) a monthly fertilizer dressing (type 12-12-20) should be
given at the rate of 100 g in 10 1 water for 4000 seed-
lings; the bags must be well watered just afterwards
to avoid burns;
(h) regular pest and disease control measures should be
practiced to avoid insect proliferation (Dieldrin,
Carbaryl, Dimethoate) and to prevent fungus diseases
(Dithane, Pelt, Benlate);
(i) Culling of all abnormal seedlings should be done before
transplanting to the main nursery at the 4-leaf stage;
losses due to culling can be estimated at 20%;
(j) the standards are:
- approximately 4 m2 of pre-nursery per ha planted;
-  length of pre-nursery period 3 to 4 month.



ANNEX 3
Page 11
Main Nursery
42.        Given that distances are not too great (over 30 km) it is easier
and more convenient to have only one central nursery, the site being well
levelled, drained and weeded (manually or chemically).
-    the nursery should be surrounded by wire netting;
-    the polybags of 500 gauge (average size 50 cm R1-  40 cm W
laid flat with 50 holes perforated in the lower part for
drainage), should be filled with top soil and given basic
fertilizer dressing dissolved in water; the soil must be
well tamped down in the bag when filling;
-    the bag should be placed before the seedlings are trans-
planted.
43.        The effect of Blast has not been closely studied in Nigeria, but as
the disease exists in most West African countries it is provisionally recom-
mended that, as a precaution, the nursery be shaded during the dry season
(October to the end of February) with palm fronds laid over a wood and bamboo
frame. This cover should be sprayed with Carbaryl to stop caterpillars de-
stroying it. To reduce the cost of shade, bags should be placed at the be-
ginning of the nursery period at a spacing of 40 x 40 cm in beds of 5 rows
of bags (45,000 seedlings per ha of nursery); in mid-February when the Blast
season is over, the shade should be removed over two weeks, half the first
and half the second, and the bags placed at 70 x 70 cm to allow for growth
(17,000 seedlings per ha of nursery); special arrangements such as alternate
bands with and without shade reduce handling when the plants are put out at
the wider spacing.
44.       Transplanting of pre-nursery seedlings takes place from mid-April
through June; care must be taken not to earth up the root bulb and to ensure
good contact between the earth ball and soil in the bag.
45.       Watering is essential during the dry season and should be done at
least every other day. The monthly quantity varies with the age of the
seedlings; when they are more than 6 months old the quantity of water should
be the equivalent of 180 mm of rain/month. Mechanical irrigation with the
aid of sprinkles or by self propelled irrigation systems ensures even dis-
tribution of the water and is the most economical method for large nurseries
(an advantage of central nurseries).
46.       Weeding can either be done manually as often as necessary or chem-
ically if qualified staff is available. For chemical weeding the following
can be used:
(a) before the bags are placed, an inexpensive total weed-
killer (sodium chlorate at the rate of 15 kg/ha) to clean
the soil;



ANNEX 3

(b)  to treat the substratum in the bags, Ametryne (Gesapax 80)
can be used as follows:
- 2-4 weeks after transplanting, spray with a 0.2%
solution of Ametryne at the rate of 1,500 1/ha of
nursery;
- 4 months after transplanting, spray with a 0.4%
solution of Ametryne at the rate of 1,500 1/ha of
nursery.
(c) fungus control: Dithane (200 g/100 1) or Pelt (150 g/1,100 1)
or Benlate (100 g/100 1) against Cercospora and Anthracnose;
(d) pest control: Dieldrine (300 g/100 1) against Temnoshoista
and termintes, Carbaryl (100 g/100 1) against leaf eaters,
Dimethoate (40 g/100 1) against scales, baits for rodents.
47.       The fertilizer rates depend on the fertility of the top soil used
to fill the bags. The following average rates can be recommended:

nursery.
48.       Culling of abnormal seedlings is done just before they are trans-
planted to the field. Total losses including culling can be put at 20%.
49.       The norms are:
-    approximately 100 m2 of main nursery per ha planted,

-    192 seedlings transplanted from the nursery x 0.8 153 seed-
lings ready for field planting (143/ha planted + supplying),
in April/May,
-    Duration of main nursery April/May to April/May, i.e. 12
months. If there are delays in seed deliveries it is possi-
ble to raise good seedlings in only 8 months; however, 12
months should be considered a maximum. It is preferable
to avoid planting seedlings in the nursery in September.
Land Preparation
Nucleus Estate
50.       The vegetation cover varies from place to place (see para Vegetation),
which means that the method of land prepration would vary as well; however, the
general lines are as follows:
In forest remnants and secondary regenerated jungle areas where
Eupatorium is less abundant:
(a) manual underbrushing;
(b) the trees would be felled with crawler tractors equipped
with KG blades and tree pushers. A 300 h.p. tractor will
be used where the vegetation is heaviest, but very often
a 140 h.p. tractor will be sufficient, the assistance of
teams with chain saws being provided if necessary;
(c) the biggest logs should be cut into 4-6 m sections with
chain saws;
(d) the vegetation should be burnt during the dry season;
(e) after burning the remaining timbers would be windrowed
with 140 h.p. tractor;
(f) if Eupatorium appears in the interrows it should be era-
dicated before the cover crop is sown. Some trials using
herbicides prior to sowing covers have been carried out
but the results to date are not conclusive. Given this
situation, it is assumed that regenerated growth of
Eupatorium in the interrows will be removed by two cross
ploughings using a Rome Plow TRH followed by stacking
and burning. Reinfestation is always liable to occur
even in areas of dense vegetation, as this weed is present
along the roads and in young fallows.
51.       In areas where the wild palm grove is dominant (North-West side)
the land clearing methods will be similar but more spraying or ploughing may
have to be done. The palms provide less shade and light encourages the
growth of Eupatorium.



ANNEX 3
Page 14
52.       In areas already cleared (fields or young fallows) ploughing will be
necessary as spraying may not be effective. When the density of trees and old
stumps is low, it might be possible to plough after underbrushing and before
tree felling.
Smallholders
53.       The plant cover varies more than on the Nucleus Estate site.  The
majority of the individual farms will be in areas of palm groves, fallows and
crops (see para Vegetation). The main problem will be the eradication of
Eupatorium. Unless spraying by special teams of the S.M.U. proves effective 1/
Eupatorium rhizomes will have to be removed by digging out manually. Satis-
factory elimination of Eupatorium will be one condition for the payment of
credit to the farmers.
54.       It is recommended that the S.M.U. organizes chain-saw gangs to assist
farmers in felling and clearing land prior to sowing covers. Farmers would be
charged at cost which is estimated to be N 46.35 per ha compared with N 105 per
ha if manually felled and cleared by farmers.
Cover Crop
55.       Pueraria javanica is the legume most frequently used in West Africa
as a cover crop. Its main purpose is to fix nitrogen and prevent the re-
establishment of harmful weeds such as Eupatorium, assuming that they have
been completely eliminated prior to the planting of Pueraria. There is prac-
tically no risk of erosion in Rivers State. According to some observations
made in OHAJI (Imo State) on the Ada-palm Estate, it is necessary to use
10-12 kg Pueraria seed per ha; with this quantity, the legume covers the
terrain very quickly and the labor requirements and costs for subsequent
weeding are lower.
Field Planting
56.       Plantings made early in the rainy season are more precocious, there-
fore field planting should be done from April to mid June only. Late plantings
in September and October are not recommended. The seedlings would be planted
at a 9 m triangular spacing at a density of 143 trees/ha.
57.       The earth ball should be damped in the nursery prior to transport-
ing to the field to stop it breaking, and a good contact between the ball and
the surrounding soil must be ensured by packing earth in the gap (without
pressing on the ball, however); the root bulb should not be buried. Careful
planting is vital if the young plants are to take well.
1/   It is proposed that the S.M.U. carries out screening trials with herbi-
cides during the first two years of the project.



ANNEX 3
Page 15
58.       It is recommended that a wire guard should be placed around each
plant at the moment of planting as a protection against rodents. The net-
ting does not offer complete protection, but it avoids heavy losses during
the first 18 months in the field; its removal at the end of nl must not be
forgotten.
Field Establishment - Sequence of Operations
59.       Figure 2 gives a bar chart of the sequence of operation during years
n-2, n-I and nO. The rains prevent any mechanical work from June to end of
October.
Maintenance of the Young Plantings (nO - n6)
60.       Standard maintenance:  a circle is kept clean 1 ft beyond the per-
pendicular of the frond tips; selective weeding in the interrows to stop re-
growth of weeds; pruning limited to the removal of dried leaves when bearing
starts. Supplying of missing plants in nO and nl. Special care must be taken
to avoid reinfestation by Eupatorium; continuous patrolling by special teams
can be very effective on the Estate, but smallholders will require strict
supervision by S.M.U. field staff and payment of credit must only be made if
maintenance work is satisfactory.
Ablation
61.       This operation, which consists of excising the first inflorescences
when the young spathes are developing, can only be carried out on the Estates.
It is started when 50% of the trees have young inflorescences and stopped
towards the middle of n3 when the trees have a mean girth of 5 ft. This in-
creases initial bunch weight and concentrates the first production in a shorter
period of time without any loss of total production.
Maintenance of Mature Plantings
62.       Hand weeding of the circles (radius 60") in the smallholdings, and
the possibility of chemical ring weeding from n7 on in the Estate. Slashing
and selective weeding of the interrow vegetation replacing the Pueraria from
n6/n7 onwards. Pruning should leave at least one green frond under a ripening
bunch.
Harvesting
63.       Standard harvesting technique:  small, narrow-bladed chisel from n3
to n5, to avoid cutting the green fronds; then a short-handled axe or pole
knife from n6 to nIO; finally a pole knife of a length adapted to the height
of the trees from nlO onwards.
Phytosanitary Control
64.       Throughout the life of the plantation and particularly in the early
years periodical inspections must be made so that attacks by pests (rodents,
Oryctes, Rhyncophorus, caterpillars, etc.) and diseases can be discovered in



ANNEX 3
Page 16
time. On Estates this check is made by the estate staff, whilst in the small-
holdings it should be done by the S.M.U. field staff.
Manuring
65.       The recommended applications based on soil analyses are as follows:
Fertilizer rates in kg/tree
Ammonium            Potassium           Magnesium
Year                        sulphate            chloride             sulphate
0 (planting)                0.5 ( 72)           0.25 ( 36)           0.15 ( 22)
1                           1.0 (143)           0.50 ( 72)           0.25 ( 36)
2                           1.5 (143)           0.75 (108)           0.50 ( 72)
3                                 0             1.00 (143)           0.50 ( 72)
4                                 0             1.50 (215)           0.75 (108)
5 et seq.                         0             1.50 (215)           0.75 (108)
The figures in brackets are the applications in kg/ha/year. From Year 2 on
these theoretical rates will be adjusted in the light of leaf analysis and
fertilizer trial results.
66.        In young plantings the fertilizers are broadcast on the whole sur-
face of the weeded circle; this is also done in mature plantings unless the
interrow is sufficiently clear of plant debris for the fertilizer to be spread
mechanically over the whole surface. The dressing should be given in April at
the beginning of the rainy season, before the heavy rains set in.

NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
RIVERS STATE
ROAD IMPROVEMENT
Introduction
1.        Rivers State has a communication system in which all transport modes
are represented. There are 6,300 km of roads, 40 km of railways, numerous
navigable rivers and a domestic airport at Port Harcourt. Surface transport
is governed by the State's geography and by the presence of Nigeria's second
most important harbour, Port Harcourt, in the southern part of the State.
Thus, the main State transport lines consist of the navigable channel on the
Bonny River to Port Harcourt, and the trunk roads and railway lines radiating
from Port Harcourt towards Cross River and Imo States.
2.        The road network is predominant in the north, the coastal area being
heavily dependent on river navigation. There are 380 km of Federal trunk
roads, 2,900 km of State roads and 3,000 km of Local Government Authority
roads. Presently, however, division of responsibility for roads between
Federal, State and Local Governments is unclear. The Federal Government
constructs, but does not maintain, the trunk roads system; the State is re-
sponsible for construction and maintenance of the State roads and (with funds
provided by the Federal Government) maintenance of the Federal trunk road net-
work. A Federal Road Maintenance Center is planned for 1980, to relieve the
State of responsibility for maintaining the Federal roads. Local Government
Authorities are responsible for maintaining local roads and tracks.
3.        A 1976 reorganization of local government replaced the former Divi-
sions with larger units, Local Government Authority (LGA) areas. These will
henceforth receive a considerable increase in Federal and State funds and
local government will be increasingly responsible for local roads and tracks.
4.        A considerable road construction program is planned in the State
for the current development plan period (1976-1980). In addition to a Fed-
eral program for reconstruction and/or upgrading of about 60 km, the State
government plans a construction program costing N 39.2 million, covering 223
km and representing 22% of the development plan budget.
Communications in the Project Area
5.        The smallholder project area, centered about 40 km north of Port
Harcourt, covers 2,070 km2 or 12% of the land area of the State. It contains
164 km of existing asphalt roads and about 1000 km of earth roads and tracks.
There are virtually no gravel roads due to the lack of suitable gravel mate-
rial in the area. The main communication lines from the south, west and north



ANNEX 4
Page 2
of the project area are satisfactory, but the east part is deprived of all-
weather roads and is cut off from the center (where the oil mills will be
situated) by the Otamiri and Ogochia Rivers which are presently not bridged.
6.        The terrain is very flat, with soils consisting of fine to medium
grained sand with a clay content from 5 to 20%; permeability is high. Some
swampy areas occur in the south-west, the remainder being without any topog-
raphic features.
7.        The asphalt road network is generally satisfactory, but earth roads
are nearly all in poor condition. The principal reasons are (i) absence of
proper surfacing material and insufficient grading which produce heavily
rutted surfaces; (ii) insufficient clearing along the roads permitting the
drip-line of trees to reach the carriageway; (iii) insufficient and badly
maintained longitudinal and offshoot drains; (iv) insufficient superelevation
of the carriageway; and (v) the universal absence of a proper crown on the
carriageway to insure run-off of rainwater to the side ditches. The earth
roads are frequently impassable by motor vehicles during the rainy season,
a condition not acceptable to the project. The high density (0.5 km/km2)
of the earth road network is thus not an indicator of the adequacy of com-
munication within the rural parts of the project area. Bridges are, except
on the recently constructed trunk roads, mostly temporary structures erected
to alleviate damage from the 1967 civil war.
Project Road Component
(i) Selection
8.        All smallholder planting will be within a maximum distance of 600 m
on either side of the roads on which fruit collection is organized. This is
expected to result in 12 ha/km of planting along existing asphalt roads, and
20 ha/km along new roads upgraded to all-weather standards during the project
period.  This determines the road component of the project required to serve
the 10,000 ha of smallholdings to be planted:
Existing asphalt roads
165 km                                   2,000 ha
Planned asphalt roads
78 km                                   1,000 ha
Earth roads improved or constructed
under the project
350 km                                    7,000 ha
Link roads to oil mills
(outside the project area 50 km)
Total                       10,000 ha



ANNEX 4
Page 3
9.        The selection criteria for road to be included are (i) an equitable
distribution of project benefits, avoiding concentration along existing lines
of communication; (ii) economy of road works, avoiding costly swampland and
river crossings whenever feasible. Maintenance of improved or constructed
roads would form part of the project during the 4-year construction period.
10.       The network to be established contains 210 km of new construction
and 190 km of road improvement works (see map). In addition, a temporary
bridge over the Ogochia River at Umuaturu is included as no firm timing is
available from the State Government for construction of a permanent bridge
(to be part of the planned east-west road).
(ii) Design
11.       Design standards are outlined in Figure 1.  The carriageway would
be one lane 4 m wide, with a 1.2 m shoulder and a ditch on either side. Prim-
ary design considerations are:
-    satisfactory drainage, featuring (i) a profile crown of not
less than 15 cm to insure run-off from the carriageway to
the longitudinal ditch; (ii) continuous longitudinal ditches
not less than 50 cm deep; (iii) off-shoot drains and culverts
adequate for transporting and disposing of flash flood water;
(iv) removal of the tree drip-line from the carriageway and
shoulders;
-    adequate compaction to stand up to the foreseen truck axle
loads (about 7 tons).
12.       The terrain and topography present no obstacles to these require-
ments. Traffic volumes are not expected to exceed 20 vehicles per day, but,
in view of the terrain, a design speed of 40 km per hour is recommended.
The flat terrain in the project area does not warrant detailed design work
for the longitudinal profile and cross sections, but after staking the
centerline the slope of roadside ditches and the position and dimensions
of offshoot drains should be established in tabular form from reconnaissance
on the spot. Although the soils are in general permeable and the length of
offshoot drains thus moderate, the drains would have to be tightly spaced
to avoid excessive depth of the side ditches; the average distance between
the drains would be about 60 m, with an effective area of absorption of about
15 m2 each.
13.       Surfacing with gravel of other selected material is not considered
necessary, in view of the low traffic volume expected and the high cost of
material, which would have to be transported over prohibitive distances from
quarries outside the Rivers States.
14.       Culverts would be designed in concrete pipes, 80 cm in diameter,
with concrete head walls. In the area east of the Sambreiro River, the need
for culverts is modest, about one for every km of road, whereas west of the
river it increases to more than one per km. A total of 375 culverts are
included in the program. The bridge on the Ogochia River would be a standard



ANNEX 4
Page 4
temporary bridge (Bailey bridge or equivalent) requiring no design work except
for foundations and abutments. The design work does not warrant engaging
staff, outside firms or individuals. All design work would be done by the
project's roads engineer, assisted by a team of surveyors.
(iii) Construction Methods and Costs
15.       The high cost of labor (about N 2.00 per day) rules out construction
by labor intensive methods (except where required to avoid destruction of farm-
land (offshoot ditch construction), and mechanical construction methods would
be used. The main construction unit would be the motorgrader, assisted by a
light bulldozer for clearing and stockpiling. Compaction would be done by a
self-propelled rubber wheel roller and a wheel-loader, and three light dump
trucks would provide material for embankments.
16.       The dozer would carry out clearing of bush, level the terrain and
remove the topsoil where required for grader access. Except for swampy areas,
the grader would then construct the cross section using the naturally occurring
soil materials by moving earth from ditches to the center of the road. The
roller would compact the carriageway section, and ditches would be rectified
by hand. Offshoot drains would ordinarily be cut by hand or, if the topography
and land use permit, by the grader. Embankments for swampland crossings would
be constructed by the dozer, wheel loader and dump trucks, fill material being
compacted in 15-20 cm thick layers by the roller.
17.       Concrete pipes for culverts should be placed on a cushion of sand-
fill and lean concrete, and the surrounding trench compacted by hand ramming.
The head walls should be simple rectangular protections in mass concrete.
The positions of the culverts should be marked by casting reflecting signs
about 50 cm high in the head walls.
(iv) Workshop
18.       To service equipment, the nucleus estate workshops would be used.
The first of these, built in 1977, would be fully occupied with estate equip-
ment maintenance by 1979. In that year, the second estate workshop would be-
come operational, and would for the next two years undertake repair of Road
Division equipment. The costs of this service are included in the road
component project costs.
(v) Work Volumes and Costs
19.       Required work volumes for improvement, construction and maintenance
work respectively are in Table 1, together with equipment requirements for key
units. An even spread for key units (Table 3) over the construction period
(4 years) determines the annual volume of construction, improvement and main-
tenance work to be carried out annually. The estimated work programs, which
are summarized below, are ahead of planting programs requirements:

Construction                    90             70         50          --        210

Maintenance                     --            130        240         330        700
Maintenance of improved or constructed roads form part of the project during
the 4-year construction period. Capital and operating costs of equipment are
given in Tables 5-7, with a costs summary in Table 1.
20.       Total costs of the roads program are estimated at N 1.3 million in-
cluding equipment, workshop costs, drainage works, maintenance expenditure on
equipment and personnel costs.
(vi) Execution
21.       There are no local contractors working on earth road construction,
and neither the State nor Local Government Authorities have satisfactory ex-
perience in building and maintaining earth roads. The road program would
therefore be carried out by a special unit, the Road Division, set up under
the Smallholder Management Unit. A road engineer with experience in earth
or gravel road construction and maintenance would be recruited to head the
Division. If no local qualified engineers were available, this position
would be filled by international recruitment. If so, a Nigerian engineer
would also be engaged and trained during the first two years of operation.
22.       Construction of the temporary bridge at Umuaturu which is included
in project costs would be done by State Ministry of Works contractors, with
payments being made directly by the State, against the Ministry's certificates
of completion.
23.       A cost accounting system should be established and operated by the
SMU in project costs during the entire works period, to define total and
partial costs of construction for improvement and maintenance, respectively.
(vii) Maintenance
24.       LGA's in the project area presently have no mechanized equipment
for road maintenance and all work is done by hand; the maintenance crews
have one laborer for every four kilometers. This would be adequate if LGA's
also had equipment for grading and occasional repair of embankments.
25.       Maintenance of roads constructed or improved under the project
would be the Road Division's responsibility until 1981, when responsibility
would be handed over to LGA's. The Road Division equipment, which at that
time will have a residual life of 2-3 years, would be handed over to the
LGA's on the understanding that it would be used for project roads and



ANNEX 4

servicing of the equipment would continue to be carried out in the project
workshops, on a commercial basis. During the project period, LGA's should
second one or two foremen to project workshops for on-the-job training.

RIVERS STATE
Grant/Credit Arrangement for Smallholder
Background
1.        In the Oil Palm Rehabilitation Scheme introduced in the early 1960s,
and continued until the outbreak of the civil war, smallholders received grants
comprising (a) N 100 per ha in cash towards the cost of land clearing and com-
pensation for income lost, and (b) planting materials and fertilizers valued
at N 10 per ha. Under the three ongoing Bank-financed oil palm projects
(Bendel, Imo and Ondo States), the grant/credit scheme includes (a) a grant
for planting material, fertilizers and chemicals valued at N 170 per ha and
(b) credit in cash of N 100 per ha, for payment of labor.
2.        If Nigeria is to avoid becoming a major palm oil importer old wild
groves must be replanted with high yielding material. Past producer prices
for palm oil have been substantially below world prices, and the surpluses
accruing to the Marketing Boards have largely been used for development in
other sectors. Farmers have been unable to accumulate savings to replant
their farms and suffer loss of income when oil palms are removed, or other
crops displaced, to allow new planting or replanting.
3.        In previous rehabilitation programs, smallholders were allowed to
leave up to 20 palms standing until the palms came into bearing. In the pro-
posed project, all old trees would be removed before planting to avoid root
competition and reduced light which results from leaving old trees standing.
In addition, because of poor smallholder discipline and encroachment into
the root system of young palms, food crop intercropping during the first two
years of planting is not recommended. The introduction of these strict tech-
nical standards requires compensation for loss of income through the cash
element of the grant/credit package to ensure that participants respond.
Establishment Costs
4.        Estimated costs of smallholder clearing, planting and establish-
ment (end 1976 prices updated to reflect mid-1977 prices; fertilizers and
chemicals at full cost) are as follows:

/3   Excludes cost of delivery but includes hand tools provided by smallholders
at estimated cost of N 15.00.
Grant/Credit Terms
5.        Once accepted into the scheme, and provided he attained the husbandry
standards required, the farmer would receive the inputs needed to establish
and maintain his holding. This includes both cash (for hiring additional
labor) and materials, which account for 41% of total establishment costs over
Years -1 to 3.
6.        For accounting simplicity and comprehension by the farmer, materials
for planting would be in the form of grant and the cash advance would be medium
term loan. Of the N 558.60 grant/credit 'package' offered, about 38% would be
given as grant and the balance as loan; the combined grant/credit would cover
83% of estimated total establishment costs, the remainder (part of the labor
required and hand tools) being provided by smallholers.

/1   Fertilizers and chemicals fully costed.
7.        The estimated phasing of the cash assistance reflects labor required
and income loss offset and/or incentive needed before the smallholders palms
come into bearing. Part of the payment in Year 0 could be used by smallholders
for 'retroactive financing' of labor hired for clearing, and N 50 per ha would
therefore be paid early in Year 0 or just before planting. All cash payments
or supply of materials would be subject to a field inspection report verifying
that acceptable husbandry standards had been attained.
8.        The credit would be at 9.5% interest for 13 years from planting,
including a 7-year grace period during which interest would be capitalized.
Smallholder loans including capitalized interest would total N 510 per ha
after 7 years. Equal annual installments over 6 years would be N 115 per ha;
for simplicity, repayment would be deducted (at a monthly rate equivalent to
N 9.00 per ha) from individual smallholder fruit bunch sales to the mill.
9.        The loan terms proposed would provide a satisfactory net return per
ha to smallholders. Assuming a farmgate price of N 40.0 per ton of ffb, the
gross return (in constant 1976 terms) from 2 ha would start at N 254.0 in the
first year of production (Year 4) rising to N 578.0 during the farmer's loan
repayment period (Years 7-12) and thereafter would average about N 814.0.
These returns compare favorably with those obtainable from alternative tree
or food crops even where improved management and planting material are used.
A 2 ha planting would require about 60 mandays a year for maintenance and har-
vesting, and gross returns per manday would rise rapidly from N 3.9 in the



ANNEX 5
Page 4
year of first production (Year 4) to an average N 8.6 during years 7-12 of
loan repayment and N 12.9 thereafter.
10.       The majority of smallholders involved in oil palm cultivation also
grow food crops. The introduction of credit would establish an institutional
framework which could also be used to provide participating farmers with other
credit needs, e.g. food crops, using palm fruit sales income as collateral.
Once smallholders had established palms, SMU would aim to hand over the pro-
vision of short-term credit for regular inputs to cooperatives.
Arrangements for Grant/Credit Distribution
11.       SMU would be responsible for providing materials and cash to small-
holders. To be eligible for project grant/credit assistance, smallholders
must be members of a (registered) cooperative society. SMU staff would ap-
praise applicants for technical suitability and assess their credit worthi-
ness after consultation with the cooperative society. Applications would be
reviewed and approved by a Planting Authorization Committee (PAC) composed
of the General Manager as Chairman, the Controller of Field Operations, the
Financial Controller and a representative of the cooperative societies.
12.       Successful applicants would sign a loan agreement with their coop-
erative and SMU, in accordance with Federal and State legal requirements and
acceptable to the Bank. The Loan Agreement would stipulate the amount, terms,
conditions and schedule of loan repayments and would include an undertaking
by the smallholder to sell his fresh fruit bunches (ffb) to the central pro-
cessing mill.
13.       The grant/credit assistance would be limited to a minimum of 1
ha and a maximum of 10 ha per farm family. Delivery of materials for planting
would be made directly to smallholders by SMU vehicles. The procedures
involved in grant/credit distribution are summarized in Appendix 1.
14.       Credit facilities would be provided through SMU in conjunction with
registered cooperatives since an institutional framework for agricultural
credit is not yet sufficiently established in the project area. In addition,
both the small scale of the credit operation relative to SMU's other costs,
and the close relationship to SMU technical supervision make it desirable
for credit disbursement, accounting and recovery to be handled by SMU. The
smallholders' loan accounts would be integrated with the accounts and statis-
tics for the grant scheme. Since the additional cost of maintaining loan
accounts would be small, staff and equipment costs would be borne by SMU
(see Appendix 2).
Arrangements for Credit Collection
15.       Registered Cooperative Societies (RCS) would be used for credit
collection, and participation in the project smallholder scheme would be
restricted to RCS members for the following reasons:



ANNEX 5
Page 5
(a) they offer the best assurance of individual credit worthi-
ness;
(b) they provide a mutual guarantee of loan repayment, since
it is not feasible to rely on distraint of land or property
for loan recovery;
(c) by involvement in the project, the cooperatives would be
given direct responsibility to represent smallholders' in-
terest on the Steering Committee, the Planting Authoriza-
tion Committee (PAC), and the Price Policy Committee, all
of which would include State Cooperative movement repre-
sentative;
(d) involvement in the project would act as a stimulus to fur-
ther development of community/cooperative group activities
in smallholder agriculture; and
(e) payment to societies of a margin in recognition of their
loan repayment guarantees should benefit them financially
(provided their members maintain a satisfactory rate of
repayment) (see Appendix 3).
16.       The Risonpalm processing mills would provide SMU with a biweekly
summary of bunch purchases and a check for the full value. The SMU Account-
ing Unit would check this against its own bunch purchase slips (bps) and
analyze by cooperative society and individual smallholder, to determine the
loan repayments due. SMU would then credit each society's account with the
value of its members' bunch sales during the previous month, less credit
repayments due calculated on the basis of an interest rate of 7.5% (N 8.0
per ha planted per month over Years 8-13).
17.       On receipt of these funds each society would pay net amounts owing
to members after deduction of credit repayments at 9.5% (N 9.00 per ha planted
per month over Years 8-13).
18.       The procedures for credit repayment are summarized in Appendix 4.

3.        If Eupatorium infestation covered more than 30% of the area to be
planted then SMU shall assist the smallholder in clearing this
weed by providing spraying facilities the cost of which shall be
charged to the smallholders  credit account.
4.        If accepted, the smallholder, cooperative and SMU sign three-party
Loan Agreement (including Promissory Note).
5.        PAC authorizes planting (1-10 ha per family).
6.        SMU issues first cash payment (N 50 per ha) after clearing and
delivers first materials for planting.
7.        SMU continues to supply materials as appropriate, subject to
acceptable progress reports and regular inspection from field
assistants.
8.        Each smallholder's participation in scheme reviewed annually by
PAC (based on inspection reports by field assistants) and ter-
minated if necessary, after adequate warnings have been given.
9.        On satisfactory annual review by PAC, SMU issues annual cash
payments in arrears.
10.       After the establishment period, when plantings start producing
at least 4 tons/ha in Year 4, SMU makes available seasonal inputs
(viz fertilizer) on short-term credit to smallholder, if required.
Loan Agreement endorsed by smallholder, cooperative and SMU. Short
term credit probably not required after year 8, when full yield
attained.

Grant/Credit Accounting Control for Smallholders
1.        3SMU would have to maintain separate accounts for individual small-
holders (analyzed by cooperative society) to record the following basic in-
formation:
(a) disbursement of grant components in kind during the estab-
lishment period;
(b) disbursement of medium-term credit in cash during the
establishment period;
(c) disbursement of seasonal credit in maturity (Year 4 from
planting);
(d) weight, grade and value of fresh fruit bunches sold to
the mill by dates;
(e) deductions made for repayment of medium-term and seasonal
credit;
(f) block payments to cooperatives.
2.        SMU would have to maintain smallholder accounts, each requiring 4-5
entries per year during the development period and 25 per year when harvesting
commences. Since the recording requirements would be too numerous to be done
manually, provision would be made for mechanical recording on individual cards
using simple accounting machines each capable of registering about 10,000
entries per month. These machines can be operated by a specially trained
typist. Based on an average farm size of 2 ha, 5,000 smallholder accounts
would be handled requiring 2 accounting machines.

Financial Effect on Cooperatives
1.        On the proposed phasing of distribution and repayment of the small-
holder loans of N 300 per hectare, repayments due from the smallholder to his
cooperative would be N 9.00 per hectare per month over 72 months, based on an
interest rate of 9.5%. If the cooperatives were charged interest at a rate of
only 7.5% in recognition of their guarantee of loan repayments by their mem-
bers, then their monthly obligation to SMU in respect of members' planted area
under the scheme would amount to only N 8.00 per hectare per month. Thus with
no default on members' repayments to the cooperatives the Societies would gain
a margin of N 1.00 per month or N 12.00 per year over the 6-year repayment
period.
2.        This margin would be sufficient to cover current repayment obliga-
tions to SMU with a rate of default or arrears of up to 11.1% of members' own
repayments. Net margin (loss) per hectare to cooperatives at different rates
of default/arrears are shown below:
Percent default/arrears on
smallholder repayments to            Net margin (loss to Cooperative

/1   The net margin for any intervening or higher rate of default can be
calculated as follows y = 12 - 108. x;
y = net margin (loss)
12.00 = annual margin to cooperatives at no default (108 - N 96.00 =
N 12.00)
108 = annual repayments by smallholder to cooperative (N 108.00)
x = percentage default.
Thus, provided that members' early repayments performance was reasonably satis-
factory (default of not more than say 5%) the cooperatives would fairly soon



ANNEX 5
Appendix 3
Page 2
accumulate surpluses to their account sufficient to tide them over any tem-
porary decline in members' bunch sales to the mill, due for instance to sea-
sonal low yields, and allow them to maintain full payment of their obligations
both to SMU and to growers. The importance of regular and prompt cash payments
to the smallholders is one of the main reasons for maintaining a 2% interest-
spread in favor of the cooperatives.
3.        Based on the smallholder planting program for the proposed project,
Table 1 summarizes the annual and cumulative effect of the credit arrangements
on the cooperative movement's finances, on assumed default rates of 0, 5, 10
and 11% (11.1% default marks break-even point for cooperatives).
4.        Table 1 shows that even with default on smallholder repayments of
5% the cooperative should accumulate sizable cash surpluses as a consequence
of the margin allowed to them on credit repayments to SMU. By the time annual
repayments reached their peak (project year 12), they would be in a position
to have accumulated a cash reserve approximately equal to two months' repay-
ments due to SMU. With satisfactory repayment performance by smallholders,
surpluses over and above a prudent level of reserves would be available for
financing of seasonal credit requirements or distribution to members whose
accounts were in good standing.

Smallholder Grant/Credit - Repayment
(Medium-term: Year 8 to 13, short-term: Year 4 et seq.)
1.        Collection system (mill) buys ffb from smallholder.
Copies of bunch purchase slip (bps) to:
(1) smallholder
(2) SMU
(e) mill
2.        Mill sends SMU two-weekly tabulation of bps and check for full
amount without deductions.
3.        SMU (Accounts Unit) checks total against own copies of individual
bps and analyses by cooperative coding.
4.        SMU posts credits to respective cooperative accounts with  SMU.
5.        From individual smallholder cards, SMU knows monthly repayment due
from members of each cooperative; debits this amount - based on N 8.00 per ha
(interest charged at 7.5%) - against each cooperative account.
6.        Check for net amount issued direct to cooperatives bank account;
cooperative supplied with schedule of individual member's repayments due -
based on N 9.00 per ha (interest charged at 9.5%) - and net amount due to
member.
7.        Schedule is balanced with check payment from SMU by credit entry for
interest spread on repayments due.
8.        Cooperative pays out its members in cash, net of repayments at 9.5%
(N 9.00 per ha); members can check own bps against cooperative's schedule.
9.        Any member failing to send sufficient ffb to mill to cover monthly
repayment would owe his cooperative; this debt would be shown on his individ-
ual card at SMU and as a debtor's item in his cooperative account at SMU,
and carried forward to the next month.

Fruit Collection System
General
1.        At full maturity in 1990 there would be about 250,000 tons to be
delivered annually to the mills for processing. During the peak production
season daily delivery from smallholders would be about 600 tons and from
estates 800 tons. The collection system is essentially the same for
smallholdings and estates.
Collection Systems
2.        Harvested ffb would be transported to roadside pickup points by
farmers and by harvesting teams in the estates. The maximum distance "head
carried" to the pickup point would be 600 m. From the pickup point to the
mills, average trucking distance is estimated at 20 km for the smallholdings
and 8 km for the estates.
3.        The trucks would be equipped with high-sided rear-tipping platforms
to accommodate up to 7.5 tons of ffb which would be placed on nets spread on
the ground at pickup points ready for loading. A crane would be mounted be-
hind the truck cab, equipped with a built-in scale to weigh the ffb when
loading.
4.        Collection nets should be made from synthetic fiber impregnated
against the effects of sunshine. The mesh should permit simultaneous loading
of loose fruits and bunches, and should not be larger than 2 cm x 2 cm.
5.        It is estimated that each truck serving the smallholder area would
make 3 trips a day during peak harvesting; for the estate each truck would
make 6 trips. On this basis the truck requirement at full production (1990
onwards) would be 9 for each estate and 27 for the smallholdings.
6.        The nets for smallholder collection from the smallholdings would
be distributed to farmers by the project - one net for every two ha - who
would be responsible for the nets. On the estates, nets would be distributed
by collection trucks on collection day.
7.        The trucks would be manned by a driver and two laborers to handle
nets and loading. Smallholders would be paid according to the weight and
quality of ffb weighed at pickup points. The truck driver would be respon-
sible for weighing and classification of fruit quality, and would issue
farmers receipts for delivery.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
8.        The fruit collection system would ultimately require a staff of 45
drivers, 90 laborers, two clerks and an accountant. It would be headed by
a transport manager with Lwo a6siscants, one for each mill, and would require
close cooperation between the transport manager and mill management.
9.        At full production, recurrent ffb collection costs would be about
N 375,000 annually. Renewal of trucks is estimated to occur after 4 years for
trucks serving smallho'lders, and 6 years for those serving estates. Nets are
estimated to last 4 years for smallholdings where each net would be used once
a week, and two years in the estates, where nets would be in daily use. De-
tailed cost estimates including equipment renewal are in Annex 8, Tables 10
and 11. With one net per ha and 60 nets per truck on the estates, net require-
ment would total 6,080 at full maturity.

Preparation of a Coconut Project and Establishment of a Seed Garden
1.        As a result of plant breeding and other research over the past 20
years the coconut palm, under suitable conditions, can now yield around 5
tons of copra or 3.5 tons of oil per ha per annum; future selections are
expected to produce 7 to 8 tons of copra or about 5 tons of oil per hectare.
These high yields have been obtained from hybrid material using the yellow
or red Dwarf crossed with the West Africa Tall.
2.        The climate and soils of the tree crop belt in Nigeria provide
suitable conditions for this hybrid material and yields between 4 and 4.5
tons/ha could reasonably be expected. Compared with oil palm, the coconut
palm is less demanding in terms of soil and water deficit conditions, enabl-
ing development in areas where oil palm yields would be low. Planting and
harvesting are similar to those for oil palm cultivation and coconuts could
be readily introduced into the smallholder sector. Estimated returns to
investment (see Appendices 1 and 2) are comparable with oil palm.
3.        Coconut has a wide ranging end-use market, some of the more impor-
tant being:
-    dry kernel or copra from which oil can be extracted for
use in soap, margarine, biodegradable detergents, cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals, etc. - the residual dry matter from the
oil extraction processing being converted into cattle
feed;
-    fresh kernel which can be consumed in its raw state;
-    dessicated coconut for use in the confectionary trade;
-    the shells can be converted into charcoal for use as local
fuel or in antipollution heating systems;
-    the coir fibre extracted from the husk, which can be made
into ropes, carpets, brushes, etc.
Research is also being carried out to perfect the extraction of protein and
oil directly from fresh kernel.
4.        In view of the projected expansion in consumption of animal and
vegetable fats and oils during the last quarter of this century (annual con-
sumption is expected to rise from around 50 million tons in the mid-seventies



ANNEX 7
Page 2
to about 62 million tons in 1985 and possibly 70 million tons in the early
90's), coconut oil production will need to be expanded considerably to retain
its present 6% share of the market.
5.        Both the Federal and State Governments have expressed considerable
interest in smallholder and estate coconut development. Based on a Federal
Department of Agriculture recommendation, the project includes the financing
of (a) a feasibility/project preparation study and (b) establishment of a
coconut seed garden. The Rivers State Government has already provided for
development of a seed garden in its 1976/80 development plan.
6.        Feasibility/Project Preparation Study:  The objectives of the study
would be to:
(a) assess prospects for developing coconuts in the tree crop belt
of Nigeria;
(b) prepare specific investment proposals for smallholder and estate
coconut plantings in Southern Nigeria.
The main components of the study are:
(a) Comparative Advantage/Disadvantage assessment of coconut to
other tree crops in the tree crop belt of Nigeria including
oil palm, cocoa and rubber;
(b) Location of coconut development potential - within the Nigerian
tree crop belt generally and more specifically in different
States. The study should include identification of areas
suitable for (i) smallholder and (ii) estate development: in
both instances infrastructure development (roads, bridges, etc.)
required should be included. (At this stage proposals should
be reviewed with Federal and State Governments to determine and
agree on specific projects in various States). The second
stage of the study would then proceed as outlined in (c) below.
(c) Physical, Technical, Financial, and Economic Analysis for pro-
posed planting programs should be prepared including processing
and marketing facilities.
The study should also include organization and management proposals. SOCFINCO
Ltd. has already carried out studies on behalf of the Rivers State Government
but a more comprehensive study is required to cover the entire tree crop belt
of Southern Nigeria. It is estimated that such a study would require about
12 man-months and a suitably qualified consultancy firm should be engaged in
early 1978 prior to the establishment of a coconut seed garden (if any). The
cost of the feasibility study project preparation has been estimated at around
N 80,000 (US$134,000).



ANNEX 7
Page 3
Establishment of Coconut Seed Garden
7.        To develop a sizable coconut sector in the tree crop belt of Nigeria,
steps need to be taken to establish a source of high yielding planting mate-
rial. The feasibility/project preparation study discussed above would start
in early 1978 and if this proves to be viable a coconut seed garden could be
scheduled for initial planting in 1979.
8.        A 120 ha seed garden of hybrid dwarf and tall coconuts is proposed
under the project.  The seed garden would be near the oil palm Nucleus Estate
and managed by an experienced plant breeder assisted by a suitably qualified
and experienced field manager. The seed garden would comprise :
(a) 100 ha of Dwarf "mother trees" - 50 ha of Red Dwarf and 50 ha
of Yellow Dwarf;
(b) 10 ha of West African Tall pollinators;
(c) 10 ha of Tahiti and Rennell Pacific Tall pollinators.
Details of establishment and maintenance costs of the seed garden are in Appen-
dix I and Annex 8 (Table 12). The required planting material will have to be
ordered from the Ivory Coast, Benin and Malaysia. Table 1 gives details of
the type, number of trees required and source of planting material.

9.        At full maturity, assuming a water deficit in the seed garden area
of between 200 and 250 mm, it is estimated that 1 ha of Dwarf mother trees
will produce enough seeds to plant 45 ha of hybrid coconuts. Table 2 shows
the estimated annual seed production levels and plantable hectarage for the
proposed seed garden during its first 20 years of production (1984 through

Table 2 shows that over a 20 year production period from 1984 through 2004 a
total of 25 million seeds would be produced, sufficient to plant about 83,000
hectares of high yielding coconuts.
Farm Budget for Copra
10.       Appendix 2 shows a hypothetical farm budget for a smallholder cul-
tivating coconuts. Table 2 to the Appendix summarizes the results for com-
parison with the oil palm farm budget in Annex 12. Subsequent tables to
Appendix 2 detail input coefficients, processing costs for a small kiln
operating on the 'Trinidad Method', and derivation of a farmgate price
on the assumption that the copra is exported.
11.       Coconut palm requires a higher labor input than the same area of
oil palm, for two reasons: first coconut palms are planted closer together
than oil palm, and a larger number of trees requires maintenance; second,



ANNEX 7
Page 5
for copra, a lot of processing is done on the farm including nut splitting
and extraction of fresh kernel. Once trees reach maturity, pre-processing
requirements account for half of the total labor input.
12.       The farm budget in Appendix 2 Table 1 assumes adoption of a coconut
grant credit scheme similar to that for oil palm under the proposed project.
It shows that farmers might expect a higher return to land (both gross return
and net benefits) from coconut than from oil palm, but at the cost of a higher
labor inputs. The return to labor is comparable for both crops.
13.       Assuming that oil palm and coconut are not normally in direct com-
petition for the same land, the analysis indicates that coconut development
could be economically attractive in Rivers State, and strengthens the case
for diversification into copra production.

NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
RIVERS STATE
Project Management, Organization and Staffing
1.        Project implementation would involve:
Risonpalm Ltd. - which would be responsible for establishing and
operating the nucleus estate and oil mills, and a smallholder fruit
collection system.
The proposed Smallholder Management Unit (SMU) - which would be
responsible for executing the smallholder component, including
appraising farmers' applications and supervising technical and
financial services involved in field establishment and post-
maturity stages.
The Federal Department of Agriculture's Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit (MEU).
B. Risonpalm Limited
Background
2.        In August 1974, the Rivers State Agricultural Production and Mar-
keting Corporation (APMC) was established to take over the Rivers State Devel-
opment Corporation (RSDC) and the Rivers State Marketing Board (RSMB). APMC
absorbed the functions of these two statutory bodies which included the large
scale production of cash and food crops and the purchase of gazetted agricul-
tural produce (palm oil, palm kernel, cocoa, copra, etc.) from local farmers
in Rivers State through Licensed Buying Agents (LBA). In addition, it ad-
ministers the Elele oil palm and rubber estates (Elele, Abara and Odagwa).
After project implementation, the rubber plantations of APMC would be op-
erated by the Delta Rubber Co. Ltd., and the oil palm plantation, including
marketing and processing by Risonpalm Limited.
Risonpalm Limited
3.        Risonpalm Ltd., a company which was incorporated under the Companies
Decree 1968 was formed on November 24, 1975, and which commenced operations in
March 1977, would be responsible for development of the APMC oil palm planta-
tions and the estate component of the project. The Board of Directors would
be appointed by the Executive Council of River State and would include repre-
sentatives from the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, and Trade and Economic
Development. The Board would be responsible for policy. Risonpalm's senior



ANNEX 10
Page 2
management for the nucleus estate would be provided by an international firm,
acceptable to the Bank, operating under a management agreement. The senior
management positions comprise a General Manager, Financial Controller, two
Field Managers and two Mechanical Engineers. Details of other senior and
intermediate level staffing requirements are shown in Table 1. On the com-
missioning of the first mill, senior staff required would include the Mill
Manager, Processing Engineer and Maintenance Engineer. Personnel recruited
for these senior posts would be acceptable to the Bank, and where suitably
qualified Nigerian were not available would first be recruited internationally.
The management agreement would specify that Nigerian personnel should be pro-
vided with training and on-the-job managerial experience to enable them to
fill senior managerial and technical positions at an early stage.
4.        Under the management agreement the nucleus estate would have a high
degree of administrative and financial autonomy. The estate would prepare
annual budgets using cost estimates in this report amended to reflect changes
in costs and estate development policies. These would be submitted to the
Board of Directors for approval. The estate would subsequently prepare
monthly cash flow statements, showing costs, revenues and additional capi-
tal requirements. The monthly statements would be reviewed by the Board of
Risonpalm, but estate management would operate on this basis unless informed
to the contrary by the Chairman of the Board.
5.        Based on the approved project estate budget, the State Government
would make annual allocations to cover its own contribution to project costs.
6.        The estate would:  (i) keep records to reflect all operations and
the financial position (in accordance with consistently maintained sound ac-
counting practices); (ii) have the accounts audited by auditors acceptable
to the Bank; (iii) submit copies of their audited accounts and the auditors'
report thereon to the Bank within four months of the end of each financial
year; (iv) cause the reports of the auditors to be of such scope and detail
as the Bank may reasonably have requested; and (v) furnish such other infor-
mation concerning their accounts as the Bank may reasonably require.
7.        The management of the nucleus plantation and palm oil mills would
also be responsible for establishing a regular fruit collection system to
cover the needs of both estate and smallholders. The fruit collection sys-
tem is discussed in Annex 6.
C. Smallholder Management Unit (S.M.U.)
General Objectives
8.        A Smallholder Management Unit (SMU) would be established to imple-
ment the smallholder replanting program. S1MU would have a high degree of
financial and administrative autonomy and would report to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  A Steering Committee comprised



ANNEX 10
Page 3
of Government agency representatives would determine policy and approve work
programs and budgets. When establishing SMU, a consulting firm acceptable to
the Bank would be engaged to set up a mechanized accounting system to meet the
needs of the smallholder project. The same firm would be required to advise
on the training required for staff to operate the system.
9.        SMU headquarters would be in Ahoada with Regional Units at Ahoada,
Isiokpo and Okehi. SMU would be staffed with personnel seconded from the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources or recruited elsewhere in
Nigeria or internationally. SMU would appraise new planting/replanting
applications and provide technical and financial services in the field es-
tablishment and post maturity stages. SMU planting techniques and standards
would be agreed with the Federal Department of Agriculture's Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (MEU) and Federal research institutions.
10.       The Steering Committee - Composition and Functions.  The Steering
Committee would comprise:
(i) Chairman - Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture
and Natural Resources;
(ii)  Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Finance or his repre-
sentative;
(iii)  A senior representative of the Cooperative Division of the
Ministry of Rural Development and Social Welfares;
(iv)  A senior representative of Ministry of Trade and Economic
Development;
(v)  The General Manager of Risonpalm;
(vi)  The General Manager of the Nucleus Estate;
(vii)  A representative of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture;
(viii)  The General Manager of SMU - who would be Secretary; and
(ix)  The Chief Agricultural Officer of MANR.
The Chairman would be authorized to co-opt up to three additional nonvoting
members and during the road improvement period a Ministry of Works and Hous-
ing representative would be co-opted. A quorum would consist of 6 voting
members and in the event of a tie, the Chairman would have a casting vote.
11.       The Committee would meet quarterly, and its principal functions
would be to:
(i) determine policy;



ANNEX 10
Page 4
(ii)  appoint the General Manager, the Controller of Field Opera-
tions and the Controller of Finance, for which Bank concur-
rence would be required;
(iii)  review the organization structure (see Charts attached to
this Annex) of the SMU, including terms of staff employment;
(iv)  approve the annual work programs and budgets;
(v) review quarterly progress reports and approve any work pro-
gram amendments; and
(vi)  approve the annual report and accounts.
Management Structure and Staffing
12.       Management Structure.  The management structure is outlined in Charts
1 and 2, to this Annex, the main divisions being:
(i) headquarters staff directing and supervising technical and
financial services operated by the Regional Units; liaising
closely with MEU in evaluating ongoing and planning future
programs establishing training programs for staff and farmers;
(ii)  Financial control, including budget preparation, control of
smallholder grant/credit and fruit payment accounts, internal
audit and general administration; and
(iii)  Regional Unit staff responsible for distribution and appraisal
of applications, supervision of grant/credit services, providing
extension and other services to the farmers.
After Risonpalm processing mills establish a fruit collection system, the Re-
gional Unit staff would need to liaise closely with the mills to ensure that
smallholders both understood and utilized the system. Deductions for loan re-
payments would be made from the value of fruit purchases. SMU's Controller
of Finance would be responsible for calculating: (a) the loan repayments due
to the State Government; (b) the balance to be passed on to the cooperatives;
and (c) the balance to be distributed to individual producers.
13.       Staffing.  The smallholder component would require suitably quali-
fied and experienced staff, recruited internationally if necessary. Middle
level technical and administrative positions would be filled by professional
or senior technical grade officers recruited from within the State or from
other States in Nigeria. Lower level field and administrative staff would
be recruited from existing Government agencies or the private sector. De-
tails of the numbers and phasing of professional and technical staff require-
ments are given in Annex 10 Table 1.



ANNEX 10
Page 5
14.       The General Manager.  The Chief executive of SMU would be delegated
full responsibility for implementing the planting/replanting program. He would
be directly responsible to the Steering Committee through the Permanent Secre-
tary of the Ministry of Agriculture. The person appointed should have a pro-
fessional qualification in agriculture and at least 10 years experience, 5 of
which should have been in a senior administration position.
15.       The Controller of Field Operations - would be responsible for orga-
nizing and directing the technical aspects of the program, including nursery
work, appraisal of applications, supervision of planting and maintenance in
the immature and mature stages. He would also be responsible for organizing
in-service training for all levels of fields staff. The person appointed
should have had at least 8 years experience of tree crop planting (oil palm,
cocoa or rubber), preferably at a senior management level with a commercial
organization.
16.       The Controller of Finance - would be responsible for the general
administration of the SMU and all project financial controls and procedures.
This man would need to be a well qualified accountant with at least 8 years
experience at senior management level preferably in agro-industry.
17.       The  Roads Engineer - would be responsible for establishing the
Roads Division and directing its operations for the first two years of the
project. He would be a qualified Civil Engineer with at least 10 years ex-
perience in road construction, including some experience with earth roads.
He would have completed at least one assignment including work planning,
technical standards, supply management and awards involving equipment to a
value of at least US$200,000.
18.       The three Regional Unit Managers - would be in charge of the field
operations at regional level and should be Senior Agricultural Officers (SAO)
with about 3 years experience at that level. Preference would be given to
SAO's who had experience of modern oil palm planting techniques, but in any
event, these officers would be given in-service training courses at NIFOR.
Other professional, technical and administrative staff of the Regional Units
would mainly be recruited from Government services or directly from tertiary/
secondary level educational institutions. In order to equip such staff with
the specialized techniques required for implementing this project, appropriate
in-service training would be given at selected institutions.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (M.E.U.)
19.       Under the three existing Bank financed oil palm projects, a Monitor-
ing and Evaluation Unit 1/ was set up in Benin as a division of the Federal
Department of Agriculture. This unit is primarily concerned with (a) finan-
cial and technical monitoring of on-going projects; (b) evaluating their
1/   For more details of M.E.U. see Report 474a-UNI (Supplement 4).



ANNEX 10
Page 6
financial, economic and socio-economic impact; and (c) providing assistance
in planning and preparation of future development programs. M.E.U. has been
operating since September 1975 and would be responsible for monitoring the
Rivers State Nucleus Estate/Smallholder Oil Palm Project.
20.       MEU staff work closely with Federal research institutions and uni-
versity faculties. Consultants acceptable to FMG and the Bank will periodi-
cally be used to cover specific activities such as research, business manage-
ment, processing engineering and project preparation. The MEU will prepare
progress reports for submission to Federal and State Governments, and, where
appropriate, external financing agencies.
21.       Project financial control systems will be examined by NEU at least
every six months with particular attention to the procurement, timing and pro-
cedures; disbursement methods; grant/credit accounting, produce price informa-
tion, and control of credit repayments. Technical evaluation will concentrate
on assessing standards being attained in nurseries, field planting, mainte-
nance, harvesting/tapping, produce collection, and processing. To facilitate
monitoring it will be necessary to establish an agreed system for quantitative
assessment of work in relation to field practices as inspection and field
supervisory staff must apply the same criteria.
22.       Continuous evaluation of the economic and socioeconomic impact of
projects will be carried out in conjunction with institutions such as the
Nigerian Institute for Social and Economic Research (NISER). In addition to
measuring financial/economic benefits accruing to participating farmers and
companies, assessments will be made of changes in employment levels, business
activity, consumption patterns, participation in education and other economic
and socio-economic indicators of community well being.
23.       The MEU will also assist in the planning and preparation of future
development programs by providing project management units and oil palm com-
panies with the basic support services required such as (a) providing detailed
guidelines for project preparation, (b) ensuring that services required from
other institutions are made available for project preparation, and (c) attend-
ing Steering Committee and Board meetings.
24.       The Nigerian specialist staff required to monitor the tree crop
projects will be given opportunities to receive advanced training in selected
fields of study.  This will include their being attached to specific institu-

taxes and financial charges. The financial charges would be adequate to pro-
vide a reasonable return on capital investment, sufficient to cover interest
charges, and margins for building up reserves and paying dividends. The re-
turn on capital would be measured as a percentage of net revalued fixed
assets plus working capital; this percentage would be agreed by the price
policy committee within a suggested 10%-15% range. Depreciation on fixed
assets would be taken on a straight line basis for short-lived assets, such
as those used for fruit collection; for longer lived assets, such as the
mill, it is suggested that a more appropriate basis would be to allocate
depreciation charges according to actual produce processed as a ratio of
total processing expected over the full life of the mill (this would avoid
placing unduly heavy depreciation charges on the low volume of throughput
expected in the earliest years of the mill). After subtracting these costs,
calculated on a per ton basis, from the revenue received from the sale of
one ton of produce, the price per ton of products net of all costs would
remain. This would be the base price.
4.        Applying the appropriate extraction rate of products to bunches to
this base price the price per ton of ffb could be calculated. Extraction
rates applied would be related to the mill's previous three months processing
results, with all participants receiving a price based on the overall average
extraction rate. While this would mean that producers with more mature trees
would be receiving slightly lower extraction assessment than might be justi-
fied, on balance the application of a standard extraction rate is considered
to be more practical from an operational standpoint.
5.        Any profits in excess of the agreed return on capital would be dis-
tributed to the smallholders in the form of a cash bonus at the end of each
half year. The amount paid to the individual smallholder would be propor-
tional to the quantity of fruit sold on the company over the period concerned.
Grading
6.        Having determined an ffb purchase price for Grade 1 fruit (suitable
stage of ripeness of tenera bunches) discount rates would need to be deter-
mined and agreed with producers to take account of:
(a) under- and over-ripe bunches;
(b) excessively long stalks;
(c) bunches with dirty fruits, stones, mud, etc.; and
(d) fruits from wild palm groves or dura material having a
lower oil content.
Since the mill would not have a captive market, prices offered would have to
be competitive with other bids prevailing in the area, and hence the minimum
price paid for ffb would be determined by prices prevailing in the local mar-
ket for a similar fruit. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that when deriving
a price per ton of ffb, the central mill could apply a combination of:



ANNEX 11
Page 3
(a) its own short-term selling price, say, a three-month average
from which it calculated a base price and hence an ffb price
per ton; and
(b) short-term trends in the local markets.
In the short-run, the mill might sustain losses in order to compete with local
market conditions. To anticipate changes in local market conditions, a monthly
index (adjustment factor) could be applied either to the base price or to the
ffb price calculated from the base price.

NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
RIVERS STATE
Economic Implications
A.   Employment
1.        The project would expand employment opportunities in two categories:
(a) with SMU, the nucleus estate and mills, and the road building unit; (b) on
smallholder's farms, partly by family labor but also outside labor.
2.        The nucleus estate will be the largest source of employment, rising
to a peak of 1,760 in 1980, during the heaviest phase of the planting program,
finally, settling at about 1,500 when all palms reach maturity. At the peak
of the smallholders' planting program, in 1981, SMU would require a labor
force of 240-190 in the three regional units, the remainder at headquarters.
This would be cut back to 150 or less in the absence of a second phase proj-
ect. In the early stages building requirements for the nucleus estate, the
mill and SMU might create 75 jobs on average for five years and employment
opportunities on the roads component would be similar. Finally, the two
mills, when operating at full capacity in the late 1980's would employ a
labor force of 290. In summary, wage and salary employment resulting from
the project at full development would be about 2,000 jobs.
3.        In addition, the project would substantially expand employment oppor-
tunities on participating smallholders' farms; labor requirements per ha are
detailed in Annex 12. They are heaviest in the planting year when labor
input is 140 mandays per ha. At full maturity labor input for maintenance
and harvesting is lower, about 31.5 mandays per ha per annum. Many farmers
with 2 ha would be able to provide the 63 days input themselves, while con-
tinuing food crop production, though some wage labor would probably continue
to be used. In terms of full-time job equivalents, the total maintenance
and harvesting requirement for 10,000 ha would be around 1,200 man years,
but in practice this would probably involve a much larger number (the antic-
ipated 5,000 participating smallholders, and any outsiders working for them)
each working on a part-time basis. The benefits accruing to the smallholders
are shown in Annex 12, Table 1.
B.   Economic and Financial Prices
4.        Price calculations for oil and kernels are shown in Tables I and 2.
On the assumption that the oil produced will be a substitute for imports,
while kernels will be exported, prices are derived from the Bank's latest
international commodity price projections. In the economic analysis, a shadow
exchange rate was used to take into account the distorting effect of tarifs
and quotas on the international parity of the Nigerian Naira, and identifiable



ANNEX 15
Page 2
taxes were netted out. For cash flow purposes a price of N 308.40 per ton was
assumed. This price represents a compromise between the two extreme assump-
tions - either that imports would continue to be restricted altogether, or
that imports would be completely liberalized without any compensating adjust-
ment to the official exchange rate.
5.        The coconut seed garden was excluded from the calculation of the
economic rate of return for the project, since it does not represent an
integral part of the oil palm project. Seedlings are generally traded inter-
nationally in only fairly small numbers, and then propagated locally, reflect-
ing the fact that it would not be economic to implement a large-scale planting
program using imported planting material. However, using 'import substitution'
prices for seedlings (but without shadow-pricing foreign exchange) it is
estimated that the economic rate of return on the seed garden component alone
would be in excess of 30%. The financial rate of return would depend upon the
sales price of seedlings, as shown below:
Coconut Seed Garden
Sales Price of Seedlings (kobo)    Financial Rate of Return (Z)
40                               9.4
50                              12.6
60                              15.2
C.   Economic Rate of Return
6.        Project benefits are assumed to comprise the production of palm oil
and palm kernels. Pricing of these benefits is discussed in Section B above.
The project life is assumed to be 30 years with no residual value. Social
benefits resulting from the road improvement program have not been included
in the calculations.
7.        Project costs have been adjusted for the economic rate of retun
calculations as follows:
(i) price contingencies are omitted, but 5% physical contin-
gency is included throughout the project life;
(ii) identifiable indirect taxes and import duties are excluded;
(iii) the market wage for labor is assumed to reflect its opportunity
cost, in view of the fact that rural labor markets in the project
area are highly developed and a large share of agricultural work
is performed for money wages;



ANNEX 15
Page 3
(iv)  a shadow exchange rate of N I:US$1.27 is applied to output
prices and all foreign exchange inputs. The rate of return
is then recalculated using the official exchange rate of
N 1:US$1.54.
8.        Based on the above assumptions (including the shadow pricing
of foreign exchange) the economic rate of return of the project is 15.2%.
9.        The sensitivity of the economic rate of return to changes in
costs and benefits was tested. An increase of 10% in all costs, combined
with a decrease of 10% in all benefits, reduced the rate of return to 12.2%.
Without shadow pricing of foreign exchange the rate of return is 13.3%. For
streams of costs and benefits see Table 3.
