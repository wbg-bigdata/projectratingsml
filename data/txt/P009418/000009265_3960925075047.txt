(CREDIT 1124-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Tech-
nical Assistance Project in Bangladesh for which Credit 1124-BD in the
amount of US$16.0 million was approved on March 31, 1981. The credit was
closed on April 30, 1986, one year behind schedule. It was fully disbursed
and the last disbursement was on July 22, 1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Technical Assistance Unit of the Asia
Region and is based, inter alia, on the President's Reports the Development
Credit Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda; and a draft completion report pre-
pared by the Borrower dated April 27, 1987. The Project Completion Report
is divided into two partss a completion report on the project as a whole,
and an annex providing a description of the performance of each subproject
financed under the credit.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Annex 2).

FOURTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1124-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives
The principle objective of the Fourth Technical Assistance (TA IV) Project
(Credit 1124-BD) was to provide a flexible source of foreign exchange for
technical assistance activities in cases where other financing was not readily
available on appropriate terms, or where IDA financing would permit more
expeditious preparation of projects for external financing. The immediate
objective entailed provision of funds for the preparation of high priority
projects and for institution building assistance to strengthen local
institutions responsible for project implementation. The long-term objective of
the project was to strengthen the Government's capacity for project preparation
and implementation (pare. 2.02-2.03).
Proiect Implementation
Disbursements under the project were initially slow but accelerated after
the preceding TA III Project (Credit 872-BD) was closed. The closing date of TA
IV was extended by one year to April 30, 1986. The final disbursements under the
project were made on June 6, 1986 (paras. 3.03-3.04).
The project financed 35 subprojects, of which one was cancelled and
another two had no disbursements. The project financed 21 subprojects for
project preparation and another 11 for institution building. Seventy-two
percent of the active subprojects were evaluated as having fully achieved the
stated objectives, while 28? of the subprojects were rated as a partial success
as they were transferred for completion to the Fifth Technical Assistant (TA V)
Project (Credit 1440-BD) (paras. 3.05-3.09).
Project Achievements
The project achieved its principle objective to prepare high priority
projects. As a result, IDA has so far financed six credits (amounting to SDR
346.3 million) based on technical assistance financed under this project. The
project also provided additional support to eight other IDA credits. Greater
emphasis on institution building and training was achieved under TA IV than
under the previous TA III Project (34.3Z of subprojects as against 12.7X)
(paras. 3.12-3.17).

Conclusions and Lessons Learned
The project has assisted the Government in developing a pipeline of
projects suitable for external financing. Improvements were also reflected in
the institution building and training aspects of the project. Strengthening the
project preparation and implementation capabilities of operating agencies and
line ministries was an unspecified goal for the project; there is no evidence,
however, that improvements were achieved through project activities.
The project has also continued the improv-ments shown in TA III in the
processing and management of technical assistance credits. A number of mutually
agreed steps has facilitated speedier processing of subprojects, and a reduction
of implementation delays.
The experience of TA IV provides a number of lessons for improving the
design and implementation of future TA credits:
-     incremental improvements can be achieved through simple
4ministrative measures to streamline subproject approval procedures
and consultant contract negotiations;
-     the monitoring and reporting on TA subprojects can be further
strengthened by emphasizing their substantive aspects in supervision
reports as well as in periodic reporting;
-     institutional development and training components would be greatly
enhanced if tnderpinned by an agreed strategy that can also address
long term systemic constraints;
-     processiv&g of follow-up operations need to be carefully assessed to
avoid making new operations effective before resources can be
effectively utilized (paras. 4.G1-4.04).



BANGLADESH
POURTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1124-BD
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTIOW
Proiect Identity
1.01        Credit 1124-BD for the Fourth Technical Assistance Project (TA IV)
was the fourth in a series of five technical assistance (TA) projects provided
to date by the International Development Association (IDA) to bangladesh.
Individual subprojects under the project were approved on the recommendation
of and supervised .jy the appropriate division of the Projects Department,
while overall credit supervision and coordination was performed by the
Technical Assistance Coordinator, Office of the Director, Projects of the
former South Asia Region.
Country Background and Priorities for TA
1.02        Bangladesh's limited absorptive capacity has been a key constraint
on the country's efforts to achieve a satisfactory rate of economic
development. A shortage of well-nrepared investment projects has inhibited the
government's ability to utilize fully the velume of development aid available
from bilateral and multilateral sources. The limited capacity of the
Government to identify and prepare good projects is not only a constraint to
the pace of development but also tends to leave a large part of the initiative
in project selection and design to aid donors. An important aspect of the
country's limited absorptive capacity is its weak development administration
and, in particular, the urgent need to strengthen the implementation of
existing projects. The Bangladesh authorities are aware of these problems and
have made some progress in improving project preparation and implementation
capacity. Nevertheless, there remains a continuing need for external technical
assistance in these fields. In recognition of this need, bilateral and
multilateral agencies concerned with development assistance to Bangladesh,
including IDA, have increasingly included quite large amounts of technical and
implementation aid in their overall commitments to the country.
1.03        Bangladesh has been a major recipient of technical assistance from
a wide variety of donors. While the UNDP and ADB provide substantial funding
of technical assistance, which is supplemented by tied financing from
bilateral agencies, these contributions have proved insufficient to meet
Bangladesh's considerable requirements for such assistance. The basic
justification for IDA's lending for technical assistance has therefore been to
provide an additional assured source of foreign exchange for TA activities in
cases where other financing was not readily available on appropriate terms and
conditions, or where IDA financing facilitated more expeditious preparation of
projects suitable for consideration by external aid agencies.
Bank TA Credits in Bangladesh
1.04        While the bulk of Bank-financed TA in Bangladesh has been included
as components of larger ongoing projects in various sectors, the Bank has also



- 2 -
undertaken to provide financing fer IDA credits specifically tailored to
address the TA needs of the country. There was seen to be a need for a
flexible source of TA funds, beyond those attached to individual Bank
projects, to provlde assistance quickly and to a broad range of activities.
Bangladesh was the second country in the Bank (after Indonesia) to ceceive
such free-standing technical assistance credits.
1.05        Five free-standing TA credits have been approved to date for a
total amount of USS 62.5 million equivalent. The agreement for the first
credit (409-BD) for US$4.0 million equivalent was signed on June 20, 1973. The
second credit (622-BD) was approved on April 8, 1976 for US$7.5 million
equivalent, and the third credit (872-BD) for USS10.0 million equivalent was
approved on December 21, 1978. The fourth credit (Cr. 1124-BD) was approved
on March 31. 1981 for US$16.0 million equivalent. The latest TA credit (1440-
BD) for US$25.0 million equivalent was approved on February 24, 1984 and is
currently ongoing (see Table 1).
1.06        Use of TA I (409-BD) was initially slow and disappointing,
reflecting in part disagreements between the Planning Commission and the line
ministries concerning their respective roles in project preparation and a
reluctance on the part of some Government officials to use external technical
assistance. Processing of requests for financing studies was further impeded
by slow Government procedures for selection of consultants and negotiation of
contracts. It took 3-1/2 years to commit the US$4.0 million equivalent
available under the project, more than one year longer than expected. The
credit was fully disbursed 1- June 1979, 3-1/2 years behind the original
closing date. The pace of commitment accelerated notably under the subsequent
credits. The TA TI (622-BD) was committed within about 2-1/2 years and
TA III (872-BD) within approximately the same time span. In each case the
credit was fully disbursed one year behind the respective original closing
date. The Government's procedures for selection of consultants and approval of
their contracts have remained slow under all the TA projects. The appointment
of a Project Coordinator (as agreed under TA III) to be specifically
responsible for following up progress on the credits, as well other
administrative steps taken by the Government and IDA, has assisted somewhat in
speeding disbursements. Unfortunately, during implementation of the ongoing
TA V project, the Government has again taken the position that IDA funds
should be utilized for TA activities only when bilateral or UNDP financing
cannot be identified. This has considerably slowed the utilization of TA V
funds.
1.07        An evaluation of the first three TA projects concluded that,
although progress had been slower than expected, the credits have made
important contributions to the preparation and implementation of specific
projects and have also facilitated more general improvements in overall
project preparation and implementation capacity. The simplicity and
flexibility of the credit procedures for commitment and disbursement of funds
permitted the proceeds to be used to meet urgent needs which often could not
be foreseen. TA IV should be viewed as a segment within a continuing process
of strengthening Bangladesh's investment capabilities for development and the
management of its project executing agencies.

UI. PROJECT OBJECT VES AND DESIGN
Prolect Formulation
2.01        With the increasing rate of commitments under previous TA credits
and the build-up of a pipeline of TA subprojects, the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) during the Spring of 1980 began discussing the possibility of a fourth
TA credit. The discussions were held as a part of the on-going supervision
effort and consequently no formal preparation or appraisal missions were
considered necessary. Preparation of the Fourth Technical Assistance Project
began in June 1980 and further discussions were held with Government during
supervision missions for TA III in July and Novembei 1980. Negotiations for
TA IV were held in Washington, D.C. during the month of February 1981.
Project Obiectives and Description                                                       S
2.02        The immediate objective of TA IV was similar to that established
for the first three, namely to provide an assured and flexible source of
foreign exchange for technical aesistance activities in cases where other
financing is not readily available, or where IDA financing would expedite
preparation of projects eligible for IDA consideration. Funds would be used
for the preparation of high priority projects and for technical assistance and
training programs dcsigned to strengthen institutions responsible for project
identification, preparation and implementation or for the improvement of
economic planning. Underlying the immediate objective was the longer term
objective of strengthening Bangladesh's capacity for project preparation and
implementation. The Government has often stated its perspective on TA as an
instrument for bringing about a transfer of technology and for training Its
staff, so that ultimately its need for conventional TA is eliminated. However,
for lack of a clear authoritative focus for TA, the Government has not been
able to translate its perspective into effective policies. The Bank's TA
projects therefore continue to play an important role until such time when
local capacity is effectively increased.
2.03        The amount of the credit (US$16.0 million equivalent) was based on
two main considerations: (a) maintenance of the ac"elerated rate of cormitment
achieved under TA III (averaging $3.7 million per annum) adjusted for
inflation over a three year period; and (b) the intensified project
preparation activity generated by the Government's Second Five Year Plan
(1980/81 - 1984/85). The administrative improvements introduced under TA III
(a project coordinator under ERD and a more formalized consultation procedure
for subproject approval) were to be continued. As in TA III, the project would
finance 1002 of all consultant services. In addition, the project would
finance foreign expenditures for equipment and materials, and for training
programs associated with project preparation or implementation. The
Government's contribution to individual subproject costs included the
financing of counterpart staff and support facilities - the provision of vhich
was included as an explicit condition of subproject approval by IDA.



-4-
Protect Design and Organization
2.04        In light of the ongoing series of TA projects in Bangladesh, the
design and organization of TA IV was largely based on the results and
experiences of the three previous TA projects. Although it .as estimated that
approximately 40 subprojects would be financed under the project, as these
subprojects could not be identified at the time of project preparation, the
proceeds from the credit were not pre-allocated. The timing of the project was
appropriate in that it avoided a break in commitment authority following the
completion of the previous TA projects and provided immediate funds to finance
the existing pipeline of TA subprojects.
2.05        As in the case of the previous TA projects, the overall
responsibility for the implementation of the project was given to the External
Resources Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Within ERD, a
Technical Assistance Coordinator was designated to ensure coordination among
the various government ministries and agencies involved in the implementation
of the proposed project. From the side of the Bank, approval and
implementation of individual subprojects would be supervised by the relevant
project division, while overall supervision of the credit would be carried out
by the Technical Assistance Coordinator in the South Asia Region.
2.06        Based on the experience gained from the earlier TA projects,
emphasis was placed on the improvement of procedures for subproject selection,
hiring of consultants and disbursement processing so as to continue to improve
the quality and speed of subproject execution. To reduce delays in subproject
processing, an explicit time schedule was included as a part of the standard
subproject application. The executing agency applying for assistance was
required to indicate the proposed consultant selection procedure as a part of
its application so as to avoid later interagency disputes which might delav
:onsultant selection. Nevertheless, the President's Report noted that the
project would continue to require close supervision and a heavier than usual
commitment of Bank staff time.
III. PROJECT D4PLDIENTATION
3.01        The Fourth Technical Assistaace Project was approved by the Board
of Executive Directors on March 26, 1981, signed on March 31, 1981, and became
effective on June 10, 1981. It was closed on April 30, 1986, one year after
the original Closing Date. The total amount committed and disbursed was
higher than under any of the previous TA projects in Bangladesh, and the
number of subprojects covered was about the same as under TA III project. The
level of performance achieved under the project permitted substantial
increases in future transfers of IDA TA resources, as evidenced by the larger
size of the subsequent TA V project CUSS 25 million equivalent).
Commitment and Disbursement
3.02        The entire credit of US$ 16.0 million equivalent was committed in
about three years and was fully disbursed by August 1986, one year and four
months behind the original closing date. As noted in the PCRs of the earlier
TA projects (Report No. 4550 and 6447), starting in 1975, Government



reluctance to utilize ID financing for TA began to decrease. Requests for TA
continued to increase under TA IV and a pipeline of potential TA subprojects
was developed for consideration under a future TA project. Recent experience
under the ongoing TA V project indicates, however, that IDA financing of TA is
again the funding source of last resort for the, Government.
3.03        A comparison of actual disbursements to those estimated in the
President's Report is given in Table 3. Although SDR 0.4 million was estimated
for the first year, there were no disbursements under Credit 1124-BD during
this period. The second year's actual disbursements were 322 of estimated
disbursements, and third year's actual disbursements were 622 of the estimated
amount. Disbursements were 75Z of the amount estimated as April 1985, the time
the credit had originally been expected to close. The credit was extended by
one year (April 30, 1986) to complete disbursements.
3.04        The pattern of commitment and disbursement was affected by both
the Third and Fifth TA Projects. In order to avoid a break in commitment
authority, TA IV was approved before the previous TA III project was fully
committed. In the beginning, disbursements under TA IV were slow because
activities were still ongoing under TA III. Only one subproject was committed
in the first year of project execution. Following the completion of TA III,
disbursements were accelerated under TA IV with the transfer of ongoing
subprojects from TA III. Similarly, subprojects which were not near completion
by the closing date for TA IV were transferred to TA V. This system of
approving subprojects which would require implementation beyond the closing
date had the benefit of increasing disbursements under the on-going project. A
distinct disadvantage, however, was that commitments and disbursemente under
the follow-up project very often lagged appraisal estimates. For example,
while TA V was effective on April 12,1984, the TA IV subprojects requiring
longer implementation were not transferred to TA V until June 1986, and the
first new subprojects under TA V were only approved in April 1986.
Overall Performance of TA IV
3.05        The project covered thirty-five subprojects, of which one became
inactive (subproject No. 13-12), two were not utilized (subprojects No. 13-27
and 13-31) and another ten were transferred for completion or continuation to
TA V (Tables 2 and 4). The number of subprojerts is higher than those approved
under TA I (18) and TA II (24) and slightly less than those covered under
TA III (39).
3.06        The project has achieved its basic objectives of project
preparation and institution-building and, through it, both IDA and Goveranent
have improved the process of selecting and implementing TA subprojects.
Twenty-one active subprojects were designed to finance project preparation and
feasibility studies, while the remaining eleven active subprojects were aimed
at institution building and training programs. The project led to six IDA
financed investment projects amounting to a total of SDR 346.3 million, and
supported another eight IDA investments (Table 5).
3.07        Although specific uses of the funds were not identifie. in detail
in the President's Report, the project also fulfilled another obie.tive to
diversify the sectoral composition of the subprojects financed. Tt.is emphasis
was started under TA III and was maintained in this project. Ten subprojects



- 6 -
with total disbursemeuts of SDR 5.7 million or 44.52 of the credit fell under
the general *cross-sectorals category. The remainder of the credit covered
various sectors (Table 6). Nine agricultural subprojects disbursed SDR 2.97
million (23.1Z)s four industrial subprojects disbursed SDR 1.6 million
(12.52); and, four transportation subprojects amounted to SDR 1.3 million
(10.22). Other sectors covered include two subprojects in urban and water
supply which disbursed SDR 0.9 million, and the remaining subprojects are
spread among the education, energy and communication sectors.
3.08        Achievement of specific objectives at the subproject level is
difficult to assess withs any precision. Nevertheless, subproject achievements
are analyzed here in terms of the criteria outlined in the PCRs for TA I, II
and III. In this analysis, full attainment of objectives means that the
subproject not only accomplished its terms of reference (TOR) satisfactorily
but it also produced the expected results (e.g. justification for the
investment). Partial attainment of objectives covers those projects where: (a)
TORs were inadequate for the preparation of the expected investment; or, (b)
not all of the subproject's objectives were accomplished.
3.09        In terms of the above criteria, the Government concluded in its
draft PCR that twenty-three out of the thirty.-two active subprojects (about
722) fully achieved their objectives, while another nine (28X) had partial
success. The latter were on-going at the close of the project and were
transferred to TA V. These numbers represent a significant improvement over
the results under TA III where 46S of the subprojects were considered fully
successful and 54S had partial success.
3.10        It is not clear from this analysis whether the subprojects were
rated as partial success because they were ongoing or because they were unable
to accomplish the stated objectives. In some instances, such as Trade and
Industrial Policy (TIP) Reforms (subproject No. 9) and ERD Phase I (subproject
No. 13-05), all the components of the subprojects were not completed under
TA IV and therefore the subprojects were transferred to TA V. Here, partial
success denotes that although the subprojects are achieving the objectives,
some components are not yet completed and are on-going under TA V. In the case
of Road Research Laboratory (subproject No. 12) and Audit and Accounting
Training (subproject No. 17), however, partial success refers to the long
delays in project implementation and the lack of success in completing all
components or meeting objectives. Yet other subprojects seem to have been
rated partially successful simply because they are on-going, although the
subprojects completed the objectives under TA IV and have undertaken new or
additional work under TA V (e.g. BVDB Small Water Scheme, subproject No. 7 and
Rural Non-Farm Employment, subproject No. 22).
3.11        The twenty-three subprojects undertaken and fully completed under
TA IV were all rated by the Government as having fully achieved their
objectives. It is not possible to independently assess the accomplishments of
the subprojects due to the dearth of formal reporting on the substantive
aspects of subproject activities and achievements, and the dispersal of the
project staff onto new assignments made it difficult to collect relevant
information on the subprojects even through informal interviews. Therefore,
the Government assessment of the performance of subprojects is accepted,
although some confusion remains regarding the definition and criteria for
judging partial successes.

Proiect Preparation ObAective
3.12        A principle objective of the project was to finance project
preparation activities and feasibility studies to build a pipeline of projects
for financing by IDA and other agencies. This objective has been met. Out of
the thirty-two subprojects reviewed, twenty-one funded mainly project
preparation and feasibility and SDR 6.2 million was disbursed for this purpose
(Table 7). Of these twenty-one subprojects, six have directly led to SDR 346.3
million in IDA investments,. while another five subprojects have provided
support to other IDA investments. The Ashuganj Power I$ Project (Credit 1254-
BD) with IDA investment of SDR 82.7 million is a good example of how readily
available TA funds (subproject No. 13.17, Ashuganj Power Preparation) provided
critical services for an investment package awaiting approval while an
intricate investment project was being put together. Similarly, subproject No.
8 led to the Third Drainage and Flood Control Project (Credit 1591-BD) for SDR
50.1 million, while subproject No. 13-09 (Chittagong Port Development Project)
prepared the SDR 54.0 million credit for the Chittagong Port Project Cr.
1247-BD). The subproject results were also instrumental in supporting Credit
1357-BD for the Enezgy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project
(subproject No. 5) and Credit 1399-3D for the Sugar Rehabilitation Project
(subproject No. 15).
3.13        An analysis was also made of each individual subproject dealing
with investment preparation to see if the stated objectives of the subprojects
were met. It was found that investment preparation enjoyed a high rate of
success, a trend also evidenced in the previous TA credits. In terms of the
criteria outlined in para 3.08, seventeen out of twenty-one subprojects were
considered to be fully successful and the remaining four were rated partially
successful.
Institution Building/Training ObJective
3.14        Another basic objective of the project was to provide institution-
building assistance which would strengthen the Government's capacity for
project planning, preparation and implementation through the provision of
management advice and training. The President's Report also emphasized IDA's
support of the Government's desire to use qualified local consultants to the
largest degree possible, either independently or in collaboration with foreign
firms. Under TA IV, eleven subprojects were specifically aimed at institution
building and training (Table 7).
3.15        Institution building and training aspects activities received
greater emphasis under TA IV than under the previous TA projects and generally
fared better than the previous projects in terms of the accomplishment of
objectives. Seven out of the thirteen subprojects directed at institution
building fully achieved their objectives while six registered partial success.
Of the latter, five are on-going under TA V while one has been dropped. These
results compare favorably with results from TA III where three of the ten
institution-building subprojects were considered fully successful.
3.16        The TIP Reform subproject under TA IV has contributed
significantly in bringing about important changes in trade and industrial
policies and shaping the country's future trade and industrial policy



directions. Four out of six components under the subproject have been
completed, and the remaining two are being completed under the TA V project.
Similarly, ERD Phase I subproject (No. 13-05) has helped strengthen EP.D's
processing and adminListration of TA projects, through effective cootdination
with different implementing agencies. Both the subprojects are on-going under
TA V. The Publlc AdminLstration subproject (No. 4) was successful in preparing
a project pro-forma for a Personnel MIS system, as well as a draft monitoring
and evaluation plan for a proposed investment project. Subproject activities
also led to the development of a scheme for seven new Regional Training
Institutes, selection of institutions abroad, and the development of master
lists for training materi4ls and equipment. The subproject has resulted in an
IDA investment project (Credit 1349-BD, Public Administration Training
Project). The BIWTC Dockyard Management Subproject (No. 13-37) was started
under TA III and completed under TA IV. Consultants under the ^ubproject
provided effective basic management and skill training for BIVTC dockyard
personnel. Subproject No. 14, the Chittagong Port Tariff Study, assisted in
the development of an effective cost accounting system and appropriate tariff
structure for the Chittagong Port Authority. Two projects with institutiLr;
building objectives were particularly affected by long implementation d,lays.
Seventy-five percent of the consultancy services under the Road Research
Laboratory Subproject (No. 12) have been completed, following a three-year
delay before a contract was signed with the consultants. Since then the work
has progressed satisfactorily and the subproject is being continued under
TA V. Subproject No. 17 (Audit and Accounts Training), designed to improve
training at the Audit and Accounts Training Academy and provlde specialized
training courses for the staff of Directorate of Audit, also experienced long
delays. The contract with consultants was not cleared by ERD due to procedural
complications, and was eventually signed two years after the subproject
approval. According to the Government, achievement of objectives under the
subproject will be ascertained during the preparation of the PCR for TA V.
3.17        The mixed results suggest that the effectiveness of institution
building efforts depended very much on individual subprojects, the strength of
the implementing agency, the quality of consultants, and the degree of Bank
involvement in reviewing the implementation progress of the subprojects. There
is also the suggestion from the correspondence and files that the Government
was generally less enthusiastic to use project funds to finance this type of
assistance vis-a-vis investment preparation. With the exception of TIP Reforms
(subproject No. 9), these subprojects also usually tend to be isolated
activities rather than the product of a coordinated strategy for institutional
development. Finally, lack of a long-term sector program on the part of the
Bank in many instances has limited the continuity required to address complex,
long term institutional issues. However, institutional components of future TA
projects can be improved by taking full account of broader constraints
(through diagnostic studies of agency-specific institutional problems) before
drafting TORs, and by embarking on well planned, time-phased institutional
programs that could be carried on within the context of overall sector
lending.
The Processing of TA
3.18        The processing, supervision and management of IDA financed TA has
improved during the course of implementation of the four TA projects. ERD has
provided smooth processing of subprojects and assisted requesting agencies in



- 9 -
the drafting of TORs and in the identification of consultants. A revised TA
form, prepared during TA III, continues to serve as a useful instrument for
clarifying the objectives of subprojects and for simplifying procedures. ERD's
Project Coordinator has also helped strengthen the monitoring and supervision
of iroject implementation. Only limited success has been achieved, however, in
quickly processing consultant contracts following the approval of the
subproject by the Bank and in developing cost structures and other guidelines
to evaluate consultants' proposals and contracts. 1l
3.19        While these inc-emental improvements in the Government's
processing of TA are to be commended, they have not yet produced a clear and
well established focus within the Government for the identification,
coordination and management of technical assistance. The absence of a central
authority (for assessing TA needs, TA planning, management of TA activities
and administration of TA personnel) is due largely to unresolved institutional
jurisdictions within the Government (particularly with regard to the
respective roles in TA formulation, funding and implementation of the Planning
Commission, MOF and line agencies), and the Government's continuing struggle
to define the extent of TA financing it needs. On the other hand, neither the
Government nor IDA thought it appropriate or realistic in this project to give
the question of TA management the priority and resources that could have
produced new viable institutional arrangements. It should be recognized
therefore that TA projects, while useful in financing specific feasibility or
institutional strengthening subprojects, do not appear to be the appropriate
mechanism for a policy dialogue with the Government on rationalizing the
Government's approach to technical assistance. UNDP has recently financed
reviews of project and commodity aid to Bangladesh and at the Government's
request is now financing an assessment of the effectiveness of past technical
assistance. Based on these studies, it is anticipated that the Government and
donor community will work to remove bottlenecks to the delivery of needed
technical assistance.
3.20        Even within the framework of incremental improvements, the
monitoring and reporting on the performance and effectiveness of the
subprojects financed under TA IV should have been further strengthened . Both
GOB and IDA have adequately supervised the procedural aspects of project
implementation. IDA has, in fact, devoted considerable resources to the
supervision of TA IV, from headquarters as well as through the Resident
Mission. Nevertheless, it is difficult to get from the files an adequate
assessment of subproject activities, particularly those that do not relate
directly to possible investments. The files tend to concentrate on important
contractual and other procedural matters at the expense of the substance of
the subprojects, i.e., the soundness of the objectives, the causes of
inefficiencies in implementation and the reasons for effectiveness or lack
thereof. This is not to say that the TORs or design and implementation have
not been adequately addressed. Many substantive reviews have taken place
between the TA Coordinators on both sides and between TA Coordinators and
1/ This is being pursued under TA-V. A draft 'Guidelines for Consultants'
Selection* has been prepared by ERD and reviewed by IDA. ERD also
completed a draft 'Standard Consultancy Contract' which was also reviewed
by IDA.



- 10 -
Project Officers. But these appear to have been for the most part ad hoc
reviews that were not reflected in formal reporting, either during
implementation or at subproject completion.
IDA Supervision
3.21        Eight supervision reports were submitted for this project by the
Bank's TA Unit during the period 1981-86. The reporting situation is
complicated in that technical responsibility and day-to-day supervision for
each subproject rests with Project Officers from various sector divisions
within the region as well as other areas within the Bank group. To ensure
proper supervision of individual subprojects in the future, formalized
completion reports should be prepared for each individual subproject by the
relevant sector division. The TA Unit which is responsible for monitoring.
coordinating and supervising the progress of the project as a whole would be
responsible for issuing these individual reports as part of a final
supervision report.
IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND 1ESSONS LEARNED
4.01        The Fourth Technical Assistance Project has achieved its primary
objective of helping Bangladesh develop a pipeline of projects suitable for
external financing. Six IDA credits have emerged from subprojects financed
under TA IV. The project has also supported another four IDA credits. Project
implementation has also reflected the diversification that was expected when
the credit was prepared.
4.02        TA IV furthered the improvements shown under TA III in the
processing of TA, thanks to the close cooperation end better supervision on
the part of both IDA and the Government. A number of administrative steps
agreed upon during negotiation of the project contributed to speedier
processing and approval of subprojects. timely selection of consultants, and
reduction of implementation delays. Some delay continue to take place in a
number of subprojects, but these are largely due to unresolved internal
institutional issues within the Government.
4.03        The Bank's approach to administering TA projects has evolved over
the years, with a formalized consultation procedure for subproject approval
now in place. A key decision was the creation of a Technical Assistance
Coordinator in the South Asia Regional Office to supervise Bank-financed TA
activities.2/ Besides monitoring commitment of funds under the TA projects.
the TA Coordinator reviews all TA contracts and TOR, and is responsible for
overall supervision of the projects. Approval and supervision of individual
subprojects is the responsibility of the project staff. Communication between
the TA Coordinator and project staff has been on an ad hoc basis and the
formal record does not indicate that the subprojects were technically
supervised on a regular basis.
21 The TA Coordinator currently operates out of the Technical Assistance
Unit, Technical Department, Asia Region.

4.04        The experience of TA IV suggests a number of considerations for
improving free-standing, multi-sectoral TA projects of this types
(a)   incremental improvements can be achie-3d (in streamlining TA
requests, accelerating disbursements and facilitating
implementation) through agreed, simple administrative measures
effectively implemented by TA Coordinators on both sides. These
measures should, however, be consolidated into durable
arrangements to provide the borrower with closer institutional
focus on it9 TA needs, on the coordination of available TA
resources, and on the management of TA implementation;
(b)   the monitoring and reporting on TA subprojects can be further
strengthened by emphasizing their substantive aspects in
supervision reports as well as in periodic reporting. The present
concentration on the procedural aspects of TA tends to obscure the
importance of the objectives of each subproject, changes or
revisions during implementation and their final results. Brief
completion reports prepared by the responsible sector division
would probably produce a much clearer picture on the effectiveness
and impact of the subprojects;
(c)   the Government has often stated its perspective on TA as an
instrument for bringing about a transfer of technology and for
training its staff, so that ultimately its need for conventional
TA is eliminated. However, for lack of a clear authoritative focus
for TA, the Government has not been able to translate its
perspective into effective policies. The TA credits will therefore
continue to play an important role until local capacity is
effectively increased;
(d)   institutional development and training components would be greatly
enhanced if underpinned by an agreed strategy that can also
address long-term systemic constraints;
(e)   processing of follow-up operations need to be carefully assessed
to avoid making new operations effective before resources can be
effectively utilized;
(f)   in view of the continuing difficulty in obtaining Government
concensus regarding role, financing, and delivery mechanisms for
TA, future TA projects should accept that project objectives be
limited to successful completion of subprojects desipned to
accomplish needed feasibility and design studies, and limited
institution building in support of future sector lending work.

On October 21, 1982 a contract was signed with M/S PRC Engineering
Consultants International, USA to prepare the feasibility reports on 10 (ten)
selected subprojects proposed to be included in a project reflecting the above
strategy.  Initially, reports of 4 (four) subprojects were appraised by the IDA
in June, 1983 and the rest were appraised in January 1984 with a suggestion to
include 30-35 subprojects (including previous 10) on the basis of set guidelines.
Since the feasibility study was in a continuous process of designing and
implementation of subproject, the original contract was amended with N/S PRC,
ECI for further 12 months to finalize the work as mentioned by the IDA in the
SAR of IDA Credit No. 1467-BD. The subproject has been transferred to TA-V

Final Disbursement                         : SDR 266,410
Objectives
This subproject was aimed to design and set up a model plant for jutton.
Since early 1970 the BCSIR was requested to study the possibilities of
diversifying the major crop of Bangladesh, jute, and in September 1973, GOB set
up a committee to evaluate production of jutton. The committee zecommended a
pilot plant for jutton and at the IDA's request in 1977 a project proforma was
submitted for approval; it was decided that IDA would be asked for funds from
622-BD (TA-II) for expatriate consultancy.
Since then, the subproject was financed from TA-II and TA-III. Most
of the study work was completed under TA-III, and the project was transferred
to TA-IV for financing the procurement of equipment for the plant.
After a long delay due to the differing opinions of BCSIR and the line
Ministry, the contract for procurement of equipment and machinery was finally
awarded in March 1981.
Evaluation
Most of the prestart-up activities were completed under TA-II and
TA-III; TA-IV allowed for final procurement of equipment and machinery. The
completion of the jutton plant has allowed the BCSIR to successfully develop its
laboratory processes for modifying jute fiber by phisco chemical treatment and
subsequent blending with cotton to produce a blended jute/cotton fiber "jutton"
with a ratio of 65/35. Some progress has also been achieved in blending jute
and cotton in a ratio of 35:65.

Obiectives
To prepare site and building plans and tender documents for facilities
of the Agriculture Research Project credit 828-BD, which also covers the
additional cost for architectural fees for both BARI and BARC.
Imnlementation
This subproject started under TA-II and after closure of TA-II was
transferred to TA-III and the subproject was completed under TA-11. A small
amount of SDR 1,700 was allocated under TA-IV (Credit 1124-BD) to facilitate the
final disbursement, but ultimately this was not required.
*Follow-up
The subproject supported IDA Credit 828-BD (Agricultural Research
Project) for BARC and BARI.
Evaluation
The primary reason for this subproject was to provide preliminary
services that would speed implementation of the project. This objective was only
partly met. Because of delays in the appointment of consultants, the investment
credit was in fact approved before work started on the subproject. However, some
success was achieved in the sense that project implementation might have been
even longer, had the appointment of the consultants not taken place under the
TA subproject. This subproject was particularly noteworthy for its successful
utilization of local consultancy services. The construction of BARC headquarter
building has been positively evaluated by a joint body consisting of consultants,
construction firms and representatives of BARC.
