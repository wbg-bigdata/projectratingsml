MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A
SMA,L COCONUT FARMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following Memorar.dum and Recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of the Philippines for US$121.8 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help to finance a small
coconut farms development project. The project would be cofinanced by a grant
from the United Kingdom's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) for US$1.3
million.
2.       Background.  The Philippines accounts for over 70? of total
international trade and 40Z of total world production of copra products. Some
925,000 coconut farms occupy about 3.0 million ha, or over 252 of total
agricultural land in the country. They are mainly smallholdings (half of which
are less than 1 ha each, and over 902 of which are less than 5 ha), and provide
incomes for some 16 million people. With over 842 of the 2.2 million tons
equivalent of annual copra production beinig exported, coconut-based products
are the third largest contributor of foreign exchange, accounting for 10? of
total merchandise export revenues and 402 of commodity exports in 1987.
3.       Recent market studies by independent consultants for the Bank and the
Philippine Government, have concluded that future demand for coconut products,
both for industrial uses and as an edible oil, is good provided Philippines can
sustain end-user confidenc.' in the continued availability of its supplies.
Although Philippines is the dominant world producer of coconut-based products,
its output could fall off over the coming 10-15 years because of declining
yields from its aging tree stock, unless serious replanting efforts are
undertaken. Coconut production is very much a smallholder operation in the
Philippines and, because most coconut farmers are impoverished, there has been
little private investment in replanting during the last decade.  The Government
launched a coconut replanting initiative in the late 1970s, but little was
accomplished as funds collected from the farmers by a levy on copra sales, with
an aggregate value of approximately US$1 billion, %-ere mostly diverted for
unrelated pu oses. Since that time, the Government has been unable to
implement an) meaningful coconut ;.eplanting or rehabilitation program, with the
result that the Philippines' producing tree stock is now increasingly senile,
much of it dating back to the 1940s.
4.       On the other hand, while the Philippines' ability to supply is at some
risk, world demand is quite favorable. Non-edible uses of coconut oil (mainly
for soaps and detergents) have accounted for more than 502 of consumption in



- 2 -
the US and close to 502 in Europe. Processing costs of coconut oil are lower
than those of its main competitor, palm kernel oil, and producers of industrial
chemicals have been showing an increasing preference for raw materials from
renewable natural resources rather than petroleum-based synthetics. Overall,
there are few economically attractive substitutes to the lauric oils for most
industrial purposes. With regard to edible uses, the general demand for
vegetable oils is expected to grow by about 32 p.a. over the medium-term, and
coconut oil, which is a preferred cooking oil in many parts of the world, would
certainly share in that growth. In other words, coconut oil's share of both
the non-edible and edible vegetable oil markets is easily sustainable, with
some room for modest expansion, unless end-users become convinced that they
cannot rely on a stable supply from the Philippines. In that event, they would
be prompted to make long-term investment decisions in favor of substitute
products, especially for industrial purposes, and that would be a major setback
for the Philippines itself and for other LDC coconut producers. Deterioration
of this industry would have important macroeconomic consequences for the
Philippines (particularly as regards loss of foreign exchange earnings) and
would seriously undermine the Government's rural poverty alleviation efforts.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would assist the
Government in launching a long-term development program for the smallholder
coconut industry, while providing timely and necessary investments during a
period of serious budgetary constraints. The Bank's broad expertise in this
type of smallholder tree crop operation would be brought to bear in this
program, which would eventually assist about one-third of the farm population,
most of whom are well below the rural poverty line. This is consistent with
the objective of poverty alleviation, which is accorded high priority in the
Bank's country assistance strategy for the Philippines.
6.       Project Objectives.  These would be to support an appropriate long-
term strategy for the coconut industry in the Philippines, which would increase
the incomes of small coconut farmers by improving coconut yields and copra
quality, and would boost foreign exchange earnings by ensuring a gradually
increasing and reliable supply of higher quality copra for processing and
export.
7.       Project Description.  To sustain these objectives, a long-term program
of coconut replanting and productivity improvement, supported by the necessary
infrastructure and strengthened Government services, would be set in place
through the proposed project. The five-year project would constitute the
critical first phase of a long-term small coconut farms development program
which, over the next twenty years, would rehabilitate the coconut industry and
ensure its continued contribution to the Philippine's export trade. The
project would develop and apply improved technologies, establish the
infrastructure and operating procedures and prepare the institutional and
financial bases for the program. The project consists of: (a) establishment
of seedgardens, nurseries and other infrastructure sufficient to sustain a



- 3 -
replanting program of about 50,000 ha per year; (b) replanting of 25,000 ha and
support for intercropping during the first three years of replanting; (c)
rehabilitation of 348,000 ha of middle-aged palms and the development of 50,000
ha of immature palms; (d) equipping of laboratories for aflatoxin assay and
research and demonstration of techniques, survey of aflatoxin origins and
incidence, and a pilot program to introduce hot-air copra driers to
smallholders in 2-3 major mill catchment areas; and (e) institutional
strengthening of the Philippines Coconut Authority (PCA). The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$176.6 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$91.1 (52Z). The latter includes US$1.3 million equivalent for technical
assistance and equipment, which would be co-financed by a grant from ODA. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. IBRD Map No. 21986R is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8210-PH dated May 1, 1990, is being distributed separately.
8.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government on the following: (a) by March 31, 1991, PCA would obtain use
of a suitable seedgarden site for 20 years; (b) PCA would contract only with
agricultural enterprises agreed with the Bank to produce hybrid seed; (c) PCA
would present to the Bank for comment annual project area coverage targets,
related plans and budgets and nursery development plans for the succeeding
year; (d) PCA would ensure that the posts of Head of the Central Project
Operating Unit and of the the Operations Planning and Management Department
would be filled by incumbents with training and experience agreed with the
Bar.k; (e) Government would ensure that sufficient extensionists would be made
available to enable PCA to undertake the project activities, and that such
staff would be acceptably trained; (f) farmers participating in the project
would be selected according to criteria agreeable to the Bank and would be
limited to either 1 ha of replanting, 3 ha of rehabilitation, or 4 ha of
nutrient support; (g) PCA would implement its new organizational structure by
September 30, 1990; and, (h) Government would prepare a specific plan for
financing the long-term coconut replanting program associated activities and
staffing of PCA by June 30, 1993 and begin its implementation by January 1,
1995. Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that: (i) acceptal .e
arrangements have been made for the establishment of at least one seedgarden;
(ii) formal approval of the new organizational structure of PCA' and (iii) the
establishment of the Central Project's Operating Unit. A condition of loan
disbursement for copra quality improvement would be the presentation of a
suitable plan for the implementation of a pilot scheme for improving drying
practices.
9.       Benefits.  The main project benefits would be:  (a) improved
productivity and farm incomes for small coconut farmers, tenants and resident
workers, who are a major poverty group in the country; (b) increased foreign
exchange earnings from coconut product exports; and (c) development of



- 4-
technical, financial and institutional bases for the long-term coconut
replanting program. Some 275.000 coconut farms (about 302 of total coconut
farms in the country) are expected to benefit from the project's replanting,
rehabilitation and technical support activities and about 180,000 farms from
the drying component. The project on-farm activities would generate about
12.3 million days of incremental work per year (equivalent to about 50,000
jobs) at full development. At the peak, incremental exports of coconut
products would be about US$97 million per year. The project would provide the
technical basis for improving planting material, cultural techniques and
pest/disease control in future phases of the long-term program. The
establishment of about 1,000 ha of seed gardenb would supply sufficient
material by the year 1997 for replanting the national coconut stand at a rate
of 50,000 ha per year, appropriate to the long run needs of the industry and
would reestablish confidence among end-users in the future supply of better
quality coconut-based products from the Philippines. The internal economic
rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 40X.
10.      Risks.  The main technical risks would be inappropriate site
selection, typhoon damage and possible reluctance or inability to continue the
use of inputs. Very conservative yield assumptions have therefore been adopted
and strict criteria for recipient selection have been devised. There is some
possibility that, despite strong interest and fiscal incentives, private
enterprises may be reluctant to invest sufficiently in hybrid seed production
until the full replanting program is visibly underway. In that event, PCA ma)
need to establish additional seedgardens itself and arrange for private
commercial management contracts. The long-term coconut development program
also depends on the willingness of the Government to eventually restore self-
financing arrangements (such as the earlier cess). Project benefits should
improve the climate for such action and the Government would prepare and
implement a long-term financing plan by the time the new seedgardens reach full
production. Finally, civil unrest could inhibit project activities in certain
locations but, as the project supports a national program, sufficient
flexibility exists to avoid such areas.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
