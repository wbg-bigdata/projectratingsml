MEMORANDU WAND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERhATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A HENAN HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandun and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $120 million, to help finance a Henan Highway Project. The loan would be
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to
Henan Province for 20 years, including five years of grace, at 75 percent of
the rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower with a 0.75 percent per annum
commitment fee on the outstanding balance. Henan Province would bear the
foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Henan Province is China's second-most populous prov-
ince, with about 85 million. Availability of water, a good amount of rain-
fall, and a moderate climate, make agriculture its main economic sector.
While the province's economy has been diversifying and has grown rapidly the
last five years (7.6 percent average annual growth since 1986, despite the
recession in 1989/90), it has an average per capita income 40 percent below
the national average and important pockets of poverty. About 10 million, or
12 percent of the province's population, are classified as poor. Lack of
transport infrastructure is an important contributing factor to this poverty,
as highlighted by the Henan Province Agriculture Project (Credit 2242-CHA).
3.        As a landlocked province, the transport system is essential to the
province's domestic and international trade. Due to the province's strategic
location, between the ocean and the coal exporting provinces to its west, and
the major north-south and east-west road and rail routes that cross it, Henan,
with its capital Zhengzhou at the center, is also a transport hub and a tran-
sit province of national importance.
4.        In Henan, economic and transport trends are taking place which are
similar to those elsewhere in China. The high economic growth rate is induc-
ing even higbhr rates in the demand for transport. Transport bottlenecks are
widespread, mainly as a result of insufficient transport infrastructure and
fleet, but also as a result of inadequate sectoral management, which hampers
efficient utilization of transport facilities. The diversification of the
economy, mainly to more light and agro-industry, and recent policies to
encourage more interprovincial trade, coupled with railways capacity con-
straints and recent substantial rail tariff increases for both passengers and
freight, are causing an even greater increase in the demand for road trans-
port. To meet such increased demand, the Province's Eighth Five-Year Plan,
1991-95, includes as priority investments construction of two national high-
ways crossing at Zhengzhou, North-South Route 107 and East-West Route 310.
The plan also includes substantial improvements and rehabilitation of provin-
cial and rural roads. Construction of the Zhengzhou-Luoyang section of Route



-2-
310 and assistance to the provincial and rural roads programs are the main
components of the proposed project.
5.        Leosons Learned from Previous Bank Oneratilons. China's highway
sector has received about 788 million in Bank Group financing under seven
projects. These projects provide for the construction of high-quality
national and provincial roads totalling about 1,276 km, and the expansion and
Improvement of some 3,250 km of rural roads and major bridges. The projects
also provide foreign technical ast stance and training of Chinese personnel in
highway-related areas and support studies on key issues of highway developmaent
such as pavement management and methods of financing the expansion, improve-
ment, and rehabilitation of the road network.
6.        The first Highway Project (Loan 2539-CiA/Credit 1594-CIA) was com-
pleted in mid-1991, and the Project Completion Report was issued June 29,
1992. The project clearly demonstrated the benefits accruing from improved
accessibility to communities deprived of adequate transport infrastructure in
economically less developed regions. The main lessons which could be drawn
from the project include the need to complete engineering design during proj-
ect preparation and the need to more carefully match the Borrowers' require-
ments with the technical assis ance selected. With respect to the ongoing
provincial highway projects, several major issues have been identified. These
include the relatively frequent changes in design, insufficient experience of
contractors leading to slow start-up of the contracts, and poor overall plan-
ning and worksite management. These experiences were reflected in the design
of the proposed project, which devotes more attention to:  (a) the readiness
and appropriateness of design; (b) the criteria for the prequalification of
contractors; (c) packaging civil works into large packages to attract foreign
contractors as well as the larger Chinese contractors; and (d) the composition
of technical assistance components.
7.        Rationale for Bank Groun Involvement. Helpinr, remove infrastructure
bottlenecks is a cornerstone in the Bank's assistance strategy for China.
Improving Henan's road system, given the province's position as a transport
hub of national importance, fits well in this strategy.  Further, transport
development is essential for the province's own economic development, and
Henan, as an inland, less developed province, also supports the objective of
according attention to the less privileged areas of China. The civil works
components of the proposed project are all for high-return, high-priority road
investments, and the Zhengzhou-Luoyang Expressway will have an economic impact
both nationally and provincially. The project also will help Henan Communica-
tions Department upgrade its capacity for the design and construction of mod-
ern roado, and will help it strengthen skills for economic analysis cf road
investments. The recommendations stemming from the proposed trucking study,
which will be the first provincial study of this kind in China, will serve
Henan but will also be useful to other provinces to identify necessary reforms
in road transport.
8.        Prolect Oblectives. The project objectives are tot  (a) improve
Henan's road network, with a particular focus on relieving congestion in the
heavily trafficked East-West Corridor, linking Henan and other provinces with
the new port of Lianyun Gang; rehabilitating and expanding the provincial
network, whose traffic is Increasing significantly throughout; and improving



-3-
rural roads; (b) strengthen highway sector agencies, mainly in the areas of
investment planning, construction and maintenance management, and environment;
and (c) make recommendations for Improving the efficiency of road freight
transport services, with a particular emphasis on enhancing competition and
facilitating entry by collective and small private operators.
9.        Prolect Delcrigtion.  The project consists of:  (a) civil works,
comprising construction of about 120 km access-controlled expressway between
Zhengzhou and Luoyang (about 105 km single carriage two lane and about 15 km
of double carriage four lane), together with service facilities and toll sta-
tions for administration and maintenance of the expressway, rehabilitation and
imprciement of five provincial roads (total of 180 km) and upgrading to year-
round condition of six rural roads (total of 112 km) mainly located in poor
areas in northwest Henan and, throughouat the province, a road improvement
program (RIP) fer rehabilitation and upgrading of provincial and rural roads
(total of about 740 km); (b) equipment for highway maintenance and operations,
including environmental monitoring; and (c) an institutional strengthening and
reform component, which will: provide training and equipment for five key
agencies of Henan's Communications Department; offer a comprehensive training
program for highway personnel at all levels; and study trucking services in
the Province and ways to improve efficiency.
10.       Proiect Implementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by Henan Province. The project cost is estimated at $300.7 million equiva-
lent, with a foreign exchange component of $120 million equivalent (40 per-
cent), and excludes taxes and duties. The Bank would finance $120 million
equivalent (100 percent) of the foreign exchange, or 40 percent of the total
cost. Retroactive financing for $3.0 million equivalent is recommended for
civil works already started in the archeological zone of the expressway, and
for related supervision. Expenditures incurred after March 31, 1992 would be
eligible for financing. The costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amount and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in the People's Republic of China are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10683-CHA, dated October 19, 1992, is being dis-
tributed separately.
11.       Proiect Sustainabilit.  China has a good record of providing ade-
quate resources, human, organizational and financial, to preserve its highway
network. Henan Province is no except;.on to this. It has a well established
organization for road maintenance, with a reasonable level of funding, and, as
a result, the road network is relatively well maintained. This situation is
not expected to change in the future, and financial resources allocated to
maintenance are likely to continue to be adequate. Highway revenues will
continue to increase with traffic, and toll revenues from the proposed
expressway will provide additional resources. Thus, the proposed project,
which focusoe on priority investments and which includes training, institu-
tional strengthening and equipment, should be a well sustainable investment.
12.       Agred Actions. At negotiations, agreements were reached with PRC
on the onlending arrangements for the proceeds of the loan to Henan Province.
In addition, agreements were reached with Henan Province concerning:



-4
(a) enviromuental protection measures for the Zhengzhou-Luoyang Expressway;
(b) land acquisition, resettlement and monitoring of resettlement for the
expressway, the roads in northwest Henan and those under the RIP program;
(c) preparation t d submission to the Bank of a study on toll rates proposed
for the expressway; and (d) Terms of Reference for the trucking study.
13.       Environmental Aspects. An Environmental Assessment (EA) for the
Zhengzhou-Luoyang Expressway was completed by Henan Provincial Environmental
Research Institute in 1989. The EA -.dentified several sectio ns of the pro-
pose4 expressway as having potentially significant impact on the environment,
notably related to archeological areas, noise, dust, traffic and social dis-
ruptions during road construction, and noise when the exprossway is in opera-
tion.  Such impacts are addressed by an Environental Action Plan (RAP), which
identifies methods to mitigate them. The engineering design and the technical
specifications for the expressway incorporate the mitigating measures
required, and appropriate arrangements have been made to ensure their compli-
ance during both construction and operation.
14.      Approximately 17,000 people will be affected by the construction of
the Zhengzhou-Luoyang Expressway. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was pre-
pared by Henan's High-Grade Highway Construction Authority which Bank staff
reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
15.       Since most of the provincial and rural roads to be financed under
the project involve primar.ly upgrading of facilities, rehabilitation and
maintenance of smaller roads, they are not expected to have a significant
impact on the environment. However, EAs and RAPs will be prepared as afpro-
priate. Land acquisition and resettlement procedures, whenever needed, will
follow similar procedures as for the expressway, and RAPs would be prepared
for all subprojects involving resettlement under the road improvement program.
16.       Program Objective Categories.  The project will help Henan, which is
a less developed province. Most of the rural roads to be financed by the
project will provide access to currently isolated, economically depressed
areas with year-round, motorized-access connections to cities, markets and
social services.
17.       Proiect Benefits.  Reductions of vehicle operating costs, travel
time and accidents will be the main benefits of the road investments. The
expressway will, in addition, generate substantial benefits to traffic remain-
ing on the existing road from reduction in traffic congestion, maintenance
costs, and in accidents to the nonmotorized vehicles that will continue to use
the road. The expressway will significantly enhance the province's ability to
expand intra- and interprovincial trade and the mobility of people. Benefits
from the rural roads will stem from the provision of all-veather, motorized-
access to and from markets. Some economic benefits will be lost from tolling
the expressway, but toll rates will be carefully set to minimize such losses,
and will be determined based on analysis of the Chinese exFerience accumulated
with other toll facilities. The project will also have significant institu-
tional benefit., and will contribute to reduce air pollution, but such bene-
fits are difficult to quantify and are not included in the analysis. The
estimated rate of return for the project is 28 percent.



18.       Risks.  Due to the lack of experience of Henan's Highway Department
vith the design and construction of modern expressways, and with the related
international procurement process, there is a risk of delays in the completion
of this wor!t. To minimize this risk, a detailed design review has been car-
ried out with the assistance of international consultants, and prequalifica-
tions and supervision arrangements have been tightened through the provision
of qualified international consultants and training for local supervision
personnel. An additional risk of delay for completing the expressway stems
from an archeological zone it traverses and the related engineering uncertain-
ties. To address this situation, Henan authorities have conducted extensive
surveys in this zone, including over one million borings, so as to minimize
chances that the expressway construction could encounter new archeological
findings and to prevent damage to cultural property and stoppage of construc-
tion activities as mandated by national and Henan laws. In addition, works in
this zone have been started ahead of the other sections to provide an addi-
tional time margin.
19.       Recommendatlon.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
