ANNEX D Environmental Assessment
D.1  Introduction
Environmental aspects covered here include firstly the relatively narrow environmental
impact of the proposed rehabilitation. Secondly, the wider impact of the surrounding
environment on the sub-project is analysed, as this may have a more important long-
term impact on the viability of the sub-project.
An Environmental Assessment Summary for the sub-project is presented as Table D.2.
Monitoring and mitigation measures necessary to overcome any identified problems
are discussed in the final section.
D.2   Description of the Proposed Sub-Project
The sub-project BRU4 is located in the Berat District in the south-central part of the
country, approximately 20-25km to the SSE of Lushnje City along a reasonably good
surfaced road. It is some 30km inland from the Adriatic coast, and lies in the eastem
part of the wide alluvial plain on the south bank of the Seman River, some 5km
downstream of the lowest part of the BRU3 sub-project BRU4 lies below, and to the
north-west of the Shpirag Goricani Hills (rising eventually to 1100m elevation). The
sub-project is some 6km NS and 4km EW at its widest parts. The elevation of most of
the sub-project varies from some 7-20m amsl. Soils in the commanded areas are all of
alluvial or colluvial origin, and are deep, of high to moderate nutrient and water
retenton capacities.
The BRU4 sub-project area totals some 1,290ha and comprises four main areas:
* SOOha supplied by the U3 canal from either the Fier or the Goricani pumping
station;
*  290ha supplied by the U3-1 canal from either the Fier or the Goricani pumping
station;  
* 100ha supplied from the Goricani reservoir (originally pumped by the Goricani
pumping station);
* 400ha supplied by the Korjani reservoir which received water pumped first by the
Fier pumping staffon and then by the Koliani pumping station.
Both U3 and US1- canals are supplied by some 10m of pumping from the Semani
River. Kurjani pumping station pumps through a head of 60m. Pumping to the Gorcani
Reservoir involves a head of 26m.
The 1290ha BRK4 drainage system drains mainly into the Roskovecit collector, except
for K57 which drains directly into the Semani River. Although design of the system is
good, poor maintenance and no cleaning have left system in poor condition.
The BRU4/BRK4 scheme is centred on the town of Drenovica and also includes
Samatica, Goricani, Clirimi and Rrere-Kumaraku villages. With better road access and
a warmer winter climate, agriculture in the area tends to be somewhat more intensive
than average in the areas benefiting from good irrigation and drainage.



Figure D.1 shows a location map for the main features of the project. Locations of soil
profile pits, and water samples for analysis, are also shown in this figure.
Full details of the sub-project's location, resources, agriculture, irrigation and drainage,
and proposed rehabilitation activities are presented in Chapters 2 to 6 of this sub-
project feasibility study.
D.3   Conclusions
As the proposed project essentially comprises the rehabilitation of deteriorated
irrigation and drainage facilities its impacts are generally positive in nature. In
particular, the rehabilitation will restore efficient irrigation and increase farm incomes
which will benefit the rural population, amongst whom there is considerable poverty.
Drainage rehabilitation will facilitate growth in the cooler and wetter months, and will
reduce surface run-off of fertliser nutrients and agro-chemicals. The improved
distribution of irrigation water will increase social equity, removing the disparity
between those at the head of the system and those without water at the tail.
However, a major environmental issue which will significantly impact on the sub-project
is soil erosion and flash run-off from surrounding areas of land. Most of these areas are
farmed by land owners of the sub-project. This issue is expected to be addressed by a
proposed watershed management component of SIDRP. Other issues, somewhat less
serious, include soil fertility, soil structure breakdown, and water quality, and these are
included in a proposed monitorng programme.
In the following sections D.4 to D.7 the environmental aspects of the sub-project are
reviewed in more detail. In the final section, D.8, a monitoring programme is proposed.
0.4  Irrigation Water Quality for BRU4
The original source of water for the BRU4 sub-project is the Semani River, which is
downstream of the BRU3 sub-project and the confluence of the Osumi and the Devolli
Rivers. The Devolli tributary in turn drains water from the KOUl and adjacent irrigaton
areas, and includes significant areas of ultrabasic rock materials. However the
substantial Banje dam and reservoir trap the water and any sediment. The Devolli
River drains some 270,000 ha.
The Osumi tributary drains water from most of the BRU31BRK1&2 sub-projects and has
a large watershed of some 225,000 ha upstream of the schemes. This watershed
drains mainly limestone country, with only a small area of ultrabasic materials and
virtually no industry or mining. Three lowermost pump schemes in the BRU3 sub-
project are below the confluence of the Osumi and Devolli Rivers.
Sediment levels observed in the source water and the rivers in September, 1998, were
very low, but the eroded surrounding hillsides suggested that current erosion rates are
high in places, and much of the eroded material is accumulating in the main canals.
The problem is most acute in the hill areas to the east of BRU4, as these include
unstable Pliocene marine clay parent materials which are highly erodible. Watershed
management in the main watershed and the local watersheds above the main canals
thus is of great importance.



Ten water samples were taken on 27th September, 1998 to represent irrigation and
drainage water qualities for the scheme. Locations of these samples are shown in
Figures D.1 and D.2. Samples were analysed at the laboratory of the Soils Institute,
and results were analysed by the Consultants' Irrigation Water Quality Analysis
spreadsheet.
Both Irrigation and Drainage water quality is extremely good, with very low EC (0.3-0.6
dSMm), TDS (240-400 mgAl) and SAR (0.1-0.9) values. According to the FAO (1985)
irrigation water classffication, this water would have no problems for most parameters
of salinity. However, with bicarbonate being the dominant anion, there may be some
problem over a long period with carbonate incrustation for sprinkler or drip irrigation.
Also, with very low ECw values, there may be a tendency for soil structure breakdown
and dispersion of clays. However, with well structured soils of high carbonate and
organic matter content, this tendency should be very small. Nevertheless, soil structure
and yields should be monitored over a long period to verify that this is so.
Comment Monitoring requirements are included in the monitoring programme.
D.5  Drainage Water Quality from BRKI and BRK2
D.5.1 Drainage Water which may be re-used for inigation
The above water quality values also covered drainage water, and no significant
problems would be experienced. The 'worst' drainage water sample analysed showedl
an EC value of 0.6dS/m, TDS of 410mg/i, and SAR of 1.0, which would still be
considered as excellent quality water.
D.5.2 Drainage Water passing through the sub-project areas
No problem waters were encountered. Even sample 4, covering effluent from a textile!
factory, showed very good quality water.
D.5.3 Drainage water passing out of the sub-project areas
The net increase of salinity of waters passing out of the BRKI and BRK2 sub-project
areas is extremely small, and no downstream problems should be encountered which
could be attributed to the sub-projects.
D.6  Soil SalinKy
No saline soils are present in the Berat area, and the immediate sub-project areas
contain no significant extents of 'problem soils'. However, the adjacent sloping
watersheds, particuladly in fte BRU4/BRK4 area, show areas of Pliocene marine clays.
These show high levels of exchangeable sodium and are highly erodible.



D.7  Long-term  Impacts of the Wider Environment on  the Proposed
Development
D.7.1 Erosion and flash run-off
Of greatest concem to the sustainability of these, and other sub-projects, is the very
severe problem of erosion and flash run-off from surrounding upland areas which are
the immediate watershed areas to the sub-projects. The problem is threefold:
* due to a high run-off coefficient of these upland areas, excessive run-off water flows
into the sub-projects areas, particularly during the months when it is not wanted
(October to March); this run-off flows into the main canals, which also act as high
level interceptors found on many other sub-projects;
* with the run-off water considerable quantities of eroded soil and rock are taken into
these canals, the reservoirs and the drainage lines; this material needs periodic
removal from the canals, at considerable cost;
* much of the resulting sediment ends up in the major rivers.
The surrounding upland areas above the sub-projects show very variable standards of
land use management, with an estimated current rate of erosion varying from
3tonneshalyear (c.0.2mm depth of soil removal),with the best land management, to
some 300tonnesihalyear (c 2cm depth) in the worst. Nationally, average rates of net
erosion have been placed at some 30tonnes I ha I year over the entfre landsurface of
the country (Korvaci, 1998). The best land uses are natural forest and well-established
treecrop plantations, with complete canopy cover and dense understorey vegetation.
The worst land uses under the communist period used to be cultivation on sloping
land: the current problem is more one of uncontrolled grazing by villagers on any
available adjacent land. The most worrying cases of this involve grazing in terraced
areas, where full-scale destruction of terraces in now occurring due to stabilising grass
and bush vegetation being eaten out, and animals and people forming pathways in a
slopewise direction which rapidly lead to gullying. This problem is particularly severe in
the land to the east of the BRU4 area.
The severity of this problem varies enormously from area to area, but is closely related
to distance from settlements, and to nature of parent materials. The worst problem
areas appear to be those of Pliocene marne clays: many ultrabasic soil areas are also
bad. Pliocene marne materals occur in the watersheds to the East of the BRU4 sub-
project
A high proportion of erosion may be associated with extreme rainfall events - for
example 1-in 5 24-hour rainfall amounts, which vary from about 80mm to 190mm over
the country, and are at the middle to upper part of this range within the sub-project
watersheds.
A programme urgently needs to be instigated in integrated watershed management,
which together with the existing irrigation and drainage rehabilitation programmes,
should promote long-term sustainability of agriculture in these districts. The main thrust
of such a programme would embrace six components:



i)    undertake studies on run-off/erosion, existing land use, and land tenure within
the sub-project watershed, and, based on these studies, devise a long-term
land zoning plan for the watersheds.
ii)   undertake reafforestation activities on publicly-owned land.
iii)   promote security of tenure on a long-term basis for all other appropriate upland
land areas. Ideally the same families farming land in scheme areas would also
have plots in adjacent upland areas. Granting of ftile could be conditional on the
following three measures being carTied out by the prospective land owners;
iv)   promote planting and management of perennial vegetation, with excellent
groundcover (olives, timber and fuelwood plantations etc);
v)   impose strct controls on grazing animals, particularly on areas which had been
previously terraced, and on steeper slopes and more erodible parent materials;
vi)   promote further active soil and water conservation measures, particularly
contour grass strips and hedges, tied contour drains, check dams and gully
plugs etc.
Comment A watershed management component for SIDRP has been proposed.
D.7.2 Flooding
Flooding may be a seasonal problem in both areas, due to both local flooding and main
rivers bursting their banks. The velocity of water passing through the BRU3 area would
suggest that a considerable amount of scouring could occur in the worst years, with a
tendency for the river bed to change course. This problem may worsen if upstream
watershed management issues are not tackled.
D.7.3 Under-use of Agricultural Chemicals, particularly Fertilisers
Under the excellent soils of the scheme areas, and provision of drainage and irrigation,
yield potential should be considerable: 6-7 tonnes J ha for wheat, and 8-9 tonnes I ha
for maize should be achievable. Actual yields, which are currently well under half of
these, are being constrained by several interacting factors. On removal of drainage,
flooding, and irrigation supply constraints, it is then increasingly important that yields
are not allowed to be limited by fertility constraints or outbreaks of pests and diseases.
Overall use of fertilisers are well under half of what they were under communist times,
and soil fertility is being 'mined' in most areas.
Increased use of fertilisers and pesticides, up to recommended levels, and according to
recommended practices, will enormously increase income and long-term sustainability
of the scheme, at relaUvely little environmental cost By making the economics of the
schemes more attractive, they will relieve pressure on the uplands, the problems of
which are more severe by a very large factor (see discussion above).



D.8   Monitoring Programme
The monitoring programme should be undertaken by a technical staff member with
agronomic experience. This could be an agronomist or technical person attached to the
WE or federation of WUAs, or a member of the Soils Institute.
D.8.1 Irrigation and Drainage Water
Monitoring of irrigation water flows in the main canal needs to be undertaken in relation
to local rainfall. This is expected to be a routine responsibility of the WE.
Irigation and drainage water quality needs to be monitored on an annual basis (late
summer) at the end of the first complete year of sub-project operation, with analyses
undertaken for all major anions and catons. A total of eight samples would be required:
three for irrigation water and five for drainage. This analysis would serve as useful
baseline data for the scheme. Thereafter only EC needs to be mnonitored, ideally by a
technical staff member from the WE or federation of WUAs.
The same drainage water samples need to be monitored for pestcide residues, with
the first year being taken as baseline data. On confirmation of any problems arising
downstream (eg fish kills, algal blooms) further monitoring of these sites should be
undertaken.
D.8.2 Soil Fertility Monitoring
Routine soil fertility testing needs to be undertaken both as essenrtal baserine data for
the project, and also on a 2-yearly basis as the project progresses in order to follow
fertility changes in relation to yield levels and applications of fertiriser and manure.
These sites can also be used to follow soil structure changes, including possible
deterioration of surface structure as a result of long-term use of low-EC irrigation water,
and tendencies of soils to show sub-soil pan formation, resticting root growth and
water movement.
A minimum of six farmers fields should be selected within the sub-project area,
representative of he best (most intensive) and worst (least intensive) farming
managemnent Cropping history of these fields should be recorded, including crops
grown, rainfall (local station), irrigation water, pesticides, fertilisers, manure, and other
ameliorants used, and yields obtained. Composite soil samples should be taken to
represent topsoil (0-20cm) and subsoil (20-60cm) of each field.
Samples should be analysed at the Soils Insite laboratory for full fertiliy analyses,
including exchangeable cations and pH(H20).
Plant tissue samples should be taken for trace-element analysis, including Fe, Mn, Zn,
Cu, Co, Mo, and B.
Soil pits to 2m depth should be excavated at each of the sites and routine descriptions
made. These should also include detailed description of soil structure, pore space and
continuity, and root density and continuity. This should also be related to water table
and drainage features.



D.8.3 Watershed Management
Monitoring of soil erosion and watershed management issues are extremely important
but need to be considered more as a separate project rather than a monitonng
requirement for this sub-project.
Advantages of inclusion of this sub-project in such a programme include: * most
upstream areas are managed by those farmers with irrigated land in the sub-project;
* with upland areas showing areas of Pliocene marine cday parent materials, the
erosion problem is particularly severe in this area;
* areas of degraded, acid soils could be improved by applications of fine, calcareous
sit matedals cleared from drains and canals downslope.
Apart from implementation activities on soil conservation measures, monitoring
activities would include:
* accumulation of materials in canals and drains. This would be undertaken as a
routine activity by WE staff, and a map compiled showing the relative severity of the
problem in different areas;
* studies on small plots on run-off and erosion, determining terminal sprinkler
infiltration rates and soil erodibility factors for the major soil types.
- studies on land use and land use changes in the upper watershed areas.
The last two studies should ideally be undertaken as MS-level thesis projects, but
under supervision from experienced land use and watershed management staff under
the SIRDP watershed management component
D.8.4 Equipment Needs
Standard soil and water monitoring equipment only is required for most analyses and
this is readily available in Albania. A maximum of US$200 per year would be needed to
undertake this routine analysis for this sub-project.
Analysis of pestcide residues requires more sophisticated (gas chromatography)
equipment, but this is available in the laboratores of the Institute of Public Health. It
would be advantageous to undertake some duplicate sampling (say 10% of the total)
and correlate results with those obtained from an experienced laboratory elsewhere in
Europe. This work would be undertaken as part of a country-wide programme: some 50
local samples at $50 per sample and 5 duplicate (foreign-lab) test samples at $200 per
sample would be required. (This would total $2500 for local costs and some $1000 for
foreign costs for a national programme.)
Sprinkler infiltration rate testing and soil erodibility testing, also undertaken in other
sub-project areas, would need supervisory assistance which would form part of the
watershed management component of SIDRP.
