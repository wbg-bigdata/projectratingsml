ANNEX D Environmental Assessment
D.1  Introduction
Environmental aspects covered here include firstly the relatively narrow environmental
impact of the proposed rehabilitation. Secondly, the wider impact of the surrounding
environment on the sub-project is analysed, as this may have a more important long-term
impact on the viability of the sub-project.
An Environmental Assessment Summary for ELU3 is presented as Table D.2. Monitoring
and mitigation measures necessary to overcome any identified problems are discussed in
the final section.
D.2  Description of Proposed Sub-Project
Elbasan ELU3 sub-project is located along the left bank of the Devolli River, and is served
by a gravity intake some 10km downstream of the partially-completed Banja Reservoir
(see Dam Safety Review, December, 1998). Some 897 ha (63% of the scheme) is uncder
gravity command, and was completed in 1947. This area (Zone A) comprises deep ferlile
alluvial soils in a strip of some 12km length and 1km width, with elevations varying from
75m amsl in the north to 43m in the south. Slope gradients are generally in the range 0.1-
1.5%. In addition, a further 518 ha are under command from 5 pump schemes, involving
indMdual areas of between 40 and 150 ha, and pumping heads above the main canal of
54 to 75m. These pump schemes were completed in 1975-80, with about half of the
pumps and 80% of the canal infrastructure still in working order.
The areas commanded by the five pump schemes comprise approximately 40% of
alluvialVcolluvial land of some 3-10% slope gradient (Zone B), 30% of moderately steep
colluvial footslopes and midslopes of 10-25% gradient (Zone C), and a further 30%o of
steep mid to upper slopes of some 25-40% gradient (Zone D). The lower and mid-slope
areas (B and C) include almost all the buildings in the area, including (from north to soutth)
the settlements of Lumasi, Qyrkani, Selvijasi, Klosi, Mollasi, Kamunahu, and Unasi. Only
Selita, at the southem extremity of the scheme, lies within Zone A. Perennial crops,
including olives, fruit-trees and grapes, are largely concentrated around these houseplots.
Although plots on the steeper land (Zones C and D) and cultivation activities are mostly
orientated along the contour, over 90% of the land is under seasonal cultvation, and both
gravity irrigation and soil conservation measures are rudimentary. Armual soil losses from
these steeper lands would be in the order of 2-8 times sustainable levels - ie some 30-120
tonnesih/year. However, soil losses in many cases are minimised by narrow field widths
and intensive culfivation methods. The latter in many cases include the use of hand-tools,
rather than animal or machine-drawn implements.
Above the scheme areas, a further 400-500ha of steep land is under rainfed seasonal
cultivation (Zone E), largely by the scheme's farmers. Both slope gradients and soil
erosion problems are considerably worse than in the commanded steep-land areas (C
and D). In about 20% of cases, erosion has been so severe that land has been
abandoned: in the worst case, underlying rock strata is visible at the groundsurlace.
Overall tree-cover for this zone is very low, although orchards of mature olives occur in
some areas. Higher (and rocky) land (Zone F) is under forest vegetation, largely
Mediterranean pine, and this merges into a zone of limestone cliffs, rising to an elevation



of some 600m. Main natural streams coming off the steep land have been straightened
and canalised, but sedimentation has been extremely rapid, and large quantities of
materials have had to be removed.
Main features of the scheme are shown in Figure D.1. A schematic block diagram,
showing the configuration of the scheme in relation to the above zoning structure, is given
in Figure D.2.
Full details of the sub-project's location, resources, agriculture, irrigation and drainage and
proposed rehabilitation acffvities are presented in Chapters 2 to 6 of this sub-project
feasibility study.
D.3   Conclusions
As the proposed project essentially comprises the rehabilitation of deteriorated irrigation
and drainage facilities its impacts are generally positive in nature. In particular, the
rehabilitation will restore efficient irrigation and increase farm incomes which will benefit
the rural population, amongst whom there is considerable poverty. Drainage rehabilitation
will facilitate growth in the cooler and wetter months, and will reduce surface run-off of
fertiliser nutrients and agro-chemicals. The improved distribution of irrigation water will
increase social equity, removing the disparity between those at the head of the system
and those without water at the tail.
However, a number of environmental issues have been identified which significantly
impact on the sub-project
- wasteful energy use in the pump schemes: water is pumpedto elevations of 54-75m
after which it falls to lower elevations and in some cases back to its original elevation;
* soil erosion from the steeper lands irrigated by the pump schemes (Zone D and much
of C); seasonal cultivations on these lands are not sustainable in the long-term, neither
under irrigation, nor under rainfed cultivation;
* soil erosion and flash run-off from surrounding areas of land (Zones E and F), much of
which is farrned by land owners of the sub-project.
The first of these is being addressed by redesign of the irrigation canalisation from the
pump schemes. Independent off-takes from the pipes will be installed at approximately
15m and 35m elevations, so that land commanded in Zones B and C can be served
independently.
The second will be addressed by a change of land use practices: pumped irrigation to
Zone D, and to steeper areas in Zone C will be conditional on installation of perennial
cropping together with soil conservation measures.
The last of these is expected to be addressed by a proposed watershed management
component of SIDRP.
In the following sections D.4 to D.9 the environmental aspects of the sub-project are
reviewed in more detail. In the final section, D.1O, a monitoring programme is proposed.



D.4   Configuration of Existing Pumped Irrigation Schemes
D.4.1 Existing Situation and Problems
A total of 518ha of land are served from five pumped irrigation schemes. Hectareage
served, pumping head, and lengths of tertiary canals in each case are as follows:
No. Scheme Name    Ha served        Pumping head(m)    Canal Length(km)
1.    Stet              62               62                 2.8
2.    Lumas             40                65                2.0
3.    Klos             134                54                3.85
4.    Mollas            150               65                3.9
5.    Linas            132                75                2.4
For the areas currently commanded by the five pump schemes there would appear to be
four main problems:
i)    Cost of pumping water: Pumping heads for four of the five schemes are
significanty above the 50m cut-off point.
ii)    Design of irrigation system: Offtakes at lower levels appear not to exist. Thus all
areas commanded by these schemes appear to require water being pumped to a
high head, whence it falls by gravity. This involves wasteful use of electricity, ancd
minimises control of the irrigation water itself.
iii)   Existing and potential erosion on steeper irrigated plots: Many areas of Zone C'
and all of Zone D are clearly not suited to sustainable long-term seasonal croppin)
due to steep slope gradients. Culfivation in the period 1980-91 was undertaken
under a very disciplined regime, involving contour plots, contour cultvation, and
considerable terracing. However, this system has broken down, and much
increased erosion is now occurring.
iv)   Population density and land tenure issues: Population density would appeair
considerably higher than for many sub-projects, with a result that much more of
the sloping land (C to E) has been developed for seasonal cultivation than in otheir
areas. Some 80o of Zones B and C appear to be cultivated, with the farmers
clearly heavily dependent on this land. Allocation of land appears to be fairly
evenly distributed, with each individual owning 1t10ha in Zone A and the same
extent somewhere in Zones B to E. (Average family holdings, as in other sub-
projects, are in the order of Iha in extent.)
D.4.2 Recommended Plan
D.4.2.1 Rehabilitation of Infrastructure in Zone A (897ha)
This should go ahead, but long-term dependence on successful implementation of
watershed management activities on the upper zones should be noted.



D.4.2.2 Rehabilitation of infrastructure in Zones B to D
i)    Offtakes from the main pipes should be constructed to serve Zones B(200ha) and
C (150ha) independently from D (150ha). These additional offtakes would be at
15-20m and 35-40m respectively above the main canal.
ii)   Zone B can be cultivated and irrigated with very slight limitations, although slope-
wise cultivation would be recommended;
iii)   Zone C can be cultivated to irrigated seasonal crops although with severe
restrictions, including rehabilitation of terraces, planting of tree-lines on the
contour, contour cultivation, and instillation of lock-and spill (tied contour) drains.
iv)   Zone D can only be cultivated to perennial crops, planted on the contour.
D.5   Water Availability Issues
The original source of water for this sub-project is the Banja Reservoir and Devolli River.
The reservoir has a catchment area of some 250,000 ha, but is only party completed. Its
present storage capacity is some 200m cubic metres, although lining to the dam will have
to be completed before this storage capacity can safely be achieved.
Current run-of-the-river water is sufficient for ELU3 together with all downstream
schemes. With the partial construction of the Banja Dam and its current maximum storage
capacity of 200m cubic metres, this is sufficient both for both Devolli River irrigation
schemes and for summer diversion of some 7m cumecs to the Shkrumbin River
Schemes.
However, lack of finance has held back final completion of both interim storage on the
Banja Reservoir, and sluice gates on the canal. Assuming completion of the dam lining
occurs before significant diversion of water through the trans-basin canal, there will be no
problems of water availability.
D.6  Irrigation Water Quality for ELU3
Sediment levels observed in the river water in early December, 1998, were moderate, but
much coarse-textured material and domestic rubbish was observed at the water off-take
from the river. Use of reservoir water as a source for much of the sub-project would mean
that much of the silt from the Devolli watershed area would be trapped In the reservoir and
would not enter the irrigation canal. Watershed management in the reservoir watershed
and the sub-watersheds above the main canal thus is of great importance.
Irrigation water sampling was undertaken from the Devolli River Source by DAI in 1996
and by HTSlBBVJHidromont in late September, 1998. Results from the two sources are
consistent. Irrigation water quality from the reservoir and headwaters is extremely good,
wfth very low EC (0.3-0.7 dS/m), TDS (220-600 mg/I) and SAR (<0.4) values. According to
FAO (1985) irrigation water classification, this water would have no problems for most
parameters of salinity. However, with bicarbonate being the dominant anion, there may be
some problem over a long period with carbonate incrustation for sprinkler or drip irrigation.
Also, with very low ECw values, there may be a tendency for soil structure breakdown and
dispersion of days. However, with well structured soils of high carbonate and organic



matter content, this tendency should be very small. Nevertheless, soil structure and yields
should be monitored over a long period to verify that this is so.
Comment Monitoring requirements are included in the proposed monitoring programme.
D.7   Drainage Water Quality from ELU3
D.7.1 Drainage Water which may be re-used for irrigation
Some of the drainage water from the sub-project is subsequently being reused ifor
irrigation further downstream. Such downstream water again showed very good waiter
qualities, with even the worst of the samples showing very low EC (0.6 dS/m), TOS (590
mgA) and SAR (0.4) values.
D.7.2 Drainage Water passing through the sub-project area
These waters were not sampled for chemical analysis, but on the basis of results of
neighbouring areas, no problems are expected.
A major physical problem, however, is the presence of large quantities of coarse-textured
materials in the side-streams cutting through the sub-project area. These streams in many
places have been canalised, and this accumulated sediment will need periodic clearing.
0.8  Soil Salinity and Toxicity
No saline soils nor ultrabasic soils are present in the ELU3 area.
D.9  Long-term Impacts of the Wider Environment on the Proposed Development
D.9.1 Erosion and flash run-off
Of greatest concem to the sustainability of this, and other sub-projects, is the very severe
problem of erosion and flash run-off from surrounding upland areas which are the
immediate watershed areas to the sub-projecL The problem is threefold:
* due to a high run-off coefficient of these upland areas, excessive run-off water flaws
into the sub-project areas, particularly during the months when it is not wanited
(October to March); this run-off flows into the main canals, which also act as high level
interceptors found on most other sub-projects;
* with the run-off water considerable quantities of eroded soil and rock are taken into
these canals, reservoirs and drainage lines; this material needs periodic removal,, at
considerable cost
* much of the resulting sediment ends up in the major rivers.
The surrounding upland areas above the sub-project show very variable standards of land
use management, with an estimated current rate of erosion varying from 3tonnes/halyear
(c.0.2mm depth of soil removal) with the best land management, to some



300tonneslha/year (c 2cm depth) in the worst. Nationally, average rates of net erosion
have been placed at some 30tonnes I ha / year over the entire landsurface of the country
(Korvaci, 1998). The best land uses are natural forest and well-established treecrop
plantations, with complete canopy cover and dense understorey vegetation. The worst
land uses under the communist period used to be cultivation on sloping land: the current
problem is more one of uncontrolled grazing by villagers on any available adjacent land.
The most worrying cases of this involve grazing in terraced areas, where full-scale
destruction of terraces in now occurring due to stabilising grass and bush vegetation being
eaten out, and animals and people forming pathways in a slopewise direction which
rapidly lead to gullying. This problem is particularly severe in Zones E and D in the sub-
project area.
The severity of this problem vanes enormously from area to area, but is closely related to
distance from settlements, and to nature of parent materials. Although the most erodible
parent materials (Pliocene marine clays and ultrabasic soil areas) are not mapped in the
area, pockets of very bad erosion, which appear related to parent material, are observed,
particularly in Zones E and D. Proximity to settlement and intensity of cultivation are
clearly aggravating th erosion problem.
A high proportion of erosion may be associated with extreme rainfall events - for example
1-in 5 24-hour rainfall amounts, which vary from about 80mm to 190mm over the country,
and are at the middle part of this range within the sub-project watershed.
An integrated watershed management programme urgently needs to be instigated, which
together wfth the existing irnigation and drainage rehabilitation programmes, should
promote long-term sustainability of agriculture in these districts. The main thrust of such a
programme would embrace six components:
I)    undertake studies on run-off/erosion, existing land use, and land tenure within the
sub-project watersheds, and, based on these studies, devise a long-term land
zoning plan for the watersheds.
ii)   undertake reafforestation activities on most of the degraded land in Zone E.
iii)   promote security of tenure on a long-term basis for all other appropriate upland
land areas. Ideally the same families farming land in sub-project areas would also
have plots in adjacent upland areas. Granting of title could be conditional on the
following three measures being carried out by the prospective land owners;
iv)   promote planting and management of perennial vegetation, with excellent
groundcover (fruit-trees, timber and fuetwood plantations etc);
v)   impose strict controls on grazing animals, particularly on areas which had been
previously terraced, and on steeper slopes and more erodible parent materials:
vi)   promote further active soil and water conservation measures, particularly contour
grass sbtips and hedges, tied contour drains, check dams and gully plugs etc.
Comment: A watershed management component for SIDRP has been proposed.



D.9.2 Flooding
Flooding does not appear to be a significant problem within the project area.
D.9.3 Under-use of Agricultural Chemicals, particularly Fertilisers
Under the excellent soils of the sub-project areas, and provision of drainage and irrigation,
yield potential should be considerable: 6-7 tonnes / ha for wheat, and 8-9 tonnes I ha for
maize should be achievable. Actual yields, which are currently little more than half of
these, are being constrained by several interacting factors. On removal of drainage, and
irrigation supply constraints, it is then increasingly important that yields are not allowed to
be limited by fertility constraints or outbreaks of pests and diseases. Overall use of
fertilisers are well under half of what they were under communist times, and soil fertility is
being 'mined' in most areas.
Increased use of fertilisers and pesticides, up to recommended levels, and according Ito
recommended practices, will enormously increase income and long-term sustainability of
the sub-project By making the economics of the sub-projects more attractive, they will
relieve pressure on the uplands, the problems of which are more severe by a very largle
factor (see discussion above).
D.10 Monitoring Programme
The monitoring programme should be undertaken by a technical staff member wiith
agronomic experience. This could be an agronomist or technical person attached to thle
WE or federation of WUAs, or a member of the Soils Institute.
D.10.1 Promotion and installation of perennial cropping
Within Zone D (150ha) and the steepest areas in Zone C (say 1/3 of a further 150hai),
rehabilitation of irrigation facilities should be conditional on changes being realised froim
seasonal to perennial cropping, together with much improved soil conservation. Suitable
crops would be olives, frui trees, and grapes.
D.10.2 Irrigation and Drainage Water
Monitoring of irrigation water flows in the main canal needs to be undertaken in relation to
local rainfall. This is expected to be a routine responsibility of the WE.
Irrigation and drainage water quality needs to be monitored on an annual basis (late
summer) at the end of the first complete year of sub-project operation, with analyses
undertaken for all major anions and cations. A total of eight samples would be required:
three for irrigation water and five for drainage. This analysis would serve as uselul
baseline data for the scheme. Thereafter only EC needs to be monitored, ideally by a
technical staff member from the WE or federation of WUAs.
The same drainage water samples need to be monitored for pesticide residuqs, with the
first year being taken as baseline data. On confirmation of any problems arising
downstream (eg fish kills, algal blooms) further monitoring of these sites should be
undertaken.



D.10.3 Watershed Management
Monitoring of soil erosion and watershed management issues are extremely important but
need to be considered more as a separate project rather than a monitoring requirement
for this sub-project.
Advantages of inclusion of this sub-project in such a programme include: * all upstream
activities are managed by farmers with irrigated land in the sub-project;
* farmers are heavily dependent on both steeper lands in the sub-project area, and
adjacent areas of Zone E;
* the erosion problem is particularly severe in the area;
* eroded areas (and any soil conservation activities) are very visible from the NS axis
road.
Apart from implementation activities on soil conservation measures, monitoring activities
would include:
* accumulation of materials in canals and drains. This would be undertaken as a routine
activity by WE staff, and a map compiled showing the relative severity of the problem
in different areas;
*  studies on small plots on run-off and erosion, determining terminal sprinkler infiltration
rates and soil erodibility factors for the major soil types.
* studies on land use and land use changes in the upper watershed areas.
The last two studies should ideally be undertaken as MS-level thesis projects, but under
supervision from experienced land use and watershed management staff under the
SIRDP watershed management component.
D.1AO Equipment Needs
Standard soil and water monitoring equipment only is required for most analyses and this
is readily available in Albania. A maximum of US$200 per year would be needed to
undertake this routine analysis for this sub-project
Analysis of pesticide residues requires more sophisticated (gas chromatography)
equipment, but this is available in the chemistry department of the local university. It would
be advantageous to undertake some duplicate sampling (say 10% of the total) and
correlate results with those obtained from an experienced laboratory elsewhere in Europe.
This work would be undertaken as part of a country-wide programme: some 50 local
samples at $50 per sample and 5 duplicate (foreign-lab) test samples at $200 per sample
would be required. (This would total $2500 for local costs and some $1000 for foreign
costs for a national programme.)
Sprinkler infiltration rate testing and soil erodibility testing, also undertaken in other sub-
project areas, would need supervisory assistance which would form part of the watershed
management component of SIDRP.
