ANNEX D Environmental Assessment
D.1  Introduction
Environmental aspects covered here include firstly the relatively narrow environmental
impact of the proposed rehabilitation. Secondly, the wider impact of the surrounding
environment on the sub-project is analysed, as this may have a more important long-term
impact on the viability of the sub-project. In this case analysis of two adjacent schemes,
sharing the same watershed areas and main drainage lines, has been combined. An
Environmental Assessment Summary for the schemes is presented as Table D.2.
Monitoring and mitigation measures necessary to overcome any identified problems are
discussed in the final section.
D.2   Description of the Proposed Sub-Project
The sub-project SHU4 is located in the southem part of the Shkoder District in the north-
west of the country. Its northemmost part is some 7km SE of Shkoder town, and its
southem edge, some 10km to the south, is some 12km north of Lezhe town. Most of the
sub-project lies on the right (W) bank of the old Drini channel. The sub-project is some 20
metres above sea level in the extreme north, and only 6m amsl in the south.
The sub-project lies within one of the wetter areas of the country, with mean annual
rainfall of some 1600mm. However, mean rainfall for the four-month period mid-May to
mid-September is below one-third of potential evapotranspiration, and thus any summer
cropping is heavily reliant on irrigation. Conversely, winter rainfall is extremely heavy, with,
some 700-800mm of run-off and leaching being experienced by even the best lands of the!
sub-project. Short-term rainfall intensities are also very high: 1-in-10 year maximum 24, 48
and 72-hour rainfalls being 150, 186 and 212mm respectively, and drainage systems have
to be designed accordingly.
Soils in the commanded areas are all of alluvial or colluvial origin, and are deep,
calcareous, of high to moderate nutrient and water retention capacties. Soils in the
adjacent upland areas, however, are shallow and very stony, and of low infiltration
capacity, and present major problems for watershed management
The main SHU4 sub-project area comprises some 3,410ha gross, of which is designed to
be irrigated and drained by gravity. The area is served by two drainage sub-projects,
SHK5 and SHK6. SHK5 covers some 1,490ha and occurs in four separate blocks. Stajka,
occupying 420ha, occurs in the extreme NE of the sub-project; Bushati, of some 270ha is
in the Central part Plesha Shjeza of 470ha is in the SE, on the left bank of the Dini, and
Bahbalush Kukel of 330ha is in the SW. All of these areas drain into the Drini. SHK6
covers some 1710ha and drains into the main KS-1 drain which runs north-westward
along the base of the Barbullshit (sic) ridge, and thence westward to the Buna River
channel and then the sea.
The sub-project area lies within the Bushat Commune, comprising seven villages. The
agricultural cooperative that it represented started in 1955 and was disbanded in 1991. It
specialised in the cultivation of wheat, maize, rice, sunflower, beans, vegetables and
melons. An additional village of Rranxa was part of a State farm.



The location of the sub-project in relation to surrounding areas and watersheds is shown
in Figure D.1. This also shows the locations of the oblique air photos, which are included
with this report. The more detailed configuraton of the sub-project is shown in Figure D.2,
which also shows locations of sampling undertaken.
Full details of the sub-project's location, resources, agriculture, irrigation and drainage,
and proposed rehabilitation activities are presented in Chapters 2 to 6 of this sub-project
feasibility study.
D.3   Conclusions
As the proposed project essentially comprises the rehabilitation of deteriorated irrigation
and drainage facilities its impacts are generally positive in nature. In particular, the
rehabilitation will restore efficient irrigation and increase farm incomes which will benefit
the rural population, amongst whom there is considerable poverty. Drainage rehabilitation
will facilitate growth in the cooler and wetter months, and will reduce surface run-off of
fertiliser nutrients and agro-chemicals. The improved distribution of irrigation water will
increase social equity, removing the disparity between those at the head of the system
and those without water at the tail.
However, a major environmental issue which will significantly impact on the sub-project is
soil erosion and flash run-off from surrounding areas of land. Most of these areas are
farmed by land owners of the sub-project. This issue is expected to be addressed by a
proposed watershed management component of SIDRP.
In the following sections D.4 to D.8 the environmental aspects of the sub-project are
reviewed in more detail. In the final section, D.9, a monitoring programme is proposed.
0.4   Water Availability Issues for the Sub-Projects
The orginal source of water for these schemes is the Drini River at the reservoir at Mjede.
Water exits the fiver by the Mjede gravity canal at 21 m elevation, from where it flows for
about 5 km in a westerly direction before tuming south to irTigate both SHU4 and LEU3
sub-projects. (For location of the sub-projects in these areas, in relation to the major Drini-
Buna watershed, and the Old Drini-Gjadri Watershed, see Figure D.1. Figure D.2 shows
the two sub-projects in greater detail, and the location of water samples taken for
analysis.)
With a very large catchment area above Mjede, and large storage capacity in the three
hydro-electric dams, there are no problems of water availability for the sub-projects.
0.5  Imgation Water Quality for the Sub-projects
With the impoundment of the Drini at the Mjede reservoir, and two other reservoirs
upstream, the amount of sediment accumulating in the Mjede canal is minimal. Although
sedimentation in the Drini Watershed is a major issue (as it is in all other watersheds in
the country), the source of the problem lies well outside the sub-project area. Sediment in
the river upstream settles in the three major reservoirs, again well outside the sub-project
area.



Seventeen water samples were taken on 5th September, 1998 to represent irrigation and
drainage water qualities for the two sub-projects. Samples were analysed at the laboratory
of the Soils Institute, and results were analysed by the Consultants' Irrigation Water
Quality Analysis spreadsheet.
Irrigation water quality from the Drini and the Mjede Canals is extremely good, with very
low EC (0.3dS/m), TDS (300mg/A) and SAR (0.1) values. According to the FAO (1985)
irigation water classification, this water would have no problems for most parameters of
salinity. However, with bicarbonate being the dominant anion, there may be some problem
over a long period with carbonate incrustation for sprinkler or drip irrigation. Also, with very
low ECw values, there may be a tendency for soil structure breakdown and dispersion of
clays. However, with well structured soils of high carbonate and organic matter content,
this tendency should be very small. Nevertheless, soil structure and yields should be
monitored over a long period to verify that this is so.
Comment Monitoring proposals are included in the monitoring programme.
D.6   Drainage Water Quality from SHU4 and LEU2
D.6.1 Drainage Water which may be re-used for irrigation
Some of the drainage water from the sub-projects is subsequently being reused fbr
irrigation further downstream, and this is the case for samples 2,3,4,and 5 taken from
different points on the middle part of the Drini River. These samples again showed very
good water qualities, with even the worst of the samples showing very low EC (O.5dS/In),
TDS (300mg/A) and SAR (0.2) values.
D.6.2 Drainage Water passing through the scheme area
-Scheme LEU4/LEK3 and surrounding land drains an area of approximately 8000ha
(2Qx4km). A major drainage pump lifts water by several metres into the Drini River,
approximately 3km above Lezhe. This drainage water passes into the scheme area, and
was observed by the Consultants to be problematic environmentally. In places, mainly
downstream of Lezhe town, the water is being used by local farmers for ad-hoc irrigation.
Three samples were taken of the waters in the main drain passing through this area
(samples 11, top, 12, middle and 13 bottom parts). The samples showed worsening water
quality as one passed down the drain, with EC increasing from 1.8, through 3.9 to 6.2
dSMm, TDS increasing from 1200 to 2800 to 4000mgA, and SAR increasing from 14.3
through 14.3 to 17.5. The upper sample would be classified as having severe chloride
toxicity problems; the other two samples would have a severe problem rating for salinity,
sodium and chloride. Any direct use of these waters for irrigation would lead to very
severe depression of yield.
D.6.3 Drainage water passing out of the scheme area
Samples 15, 16, and 1 & 1Q2 represent three positions on the lower Drini River, where
channel flow is very slow and where some tidal influences and possible intrusion of sea
water are being experienced. Samples 1 and 1/2, taken just South of Lezhe town at low
and high water periods respectively, show that tidal influences on water quality at that
position are negligible. Water showed similar EC and TDS values to that seen with
irrigation and drainage water elsewhere in the scheme, although sodium levels were



significantly higher, reflecting coastal influences. Sample 16 showed high salinity levels,
and sample 15 very high salinity, reflecting the degree of saline intrusion in these
positions. Engineers must thus resist the temptation to solve the problem of the Lezhe
town flooding by deepening the Lower Dnni Channel: such deepening would worsen the
problem of salt water intrusion.
Comment on D.6.2 and D.6.3: Salinity problems immediately outside the Sub-project area
have been identified as related to salinity in the adjacent LEU4/LEK3 scheme, and some
saline intrusion along the lower-most portion of the Drini channel. As the lower-most Drini
is the main drain from the sub-projects, any salinity problems experienced with ad-hoc
irnigation along this channel could (falsely) be blamed on these sub-projects. The above
analysis shows conclusively that the sub-projects have no salinity problems in their
drainage waters, but that the LEU4/LEK3 scheme and lower Drini saline intrusion could be
problematic. The monitoring programme would include these problem areas, even though
they lie outside the sub-project areas.
D.7   Soil Salinity
Saline soils were observed in the area of sample 14, with white salt incrustations being
observed on the soil surface in several areas. A total of some 300ha may be affected in
this area, and the area to the SW of Lezhe. Many areas showed bare soil surfaces, with
surface structure breakdown, and the presence of xerophytic shrubs.
Soil profile water samples from the area included Pedon 30, from 2.5km SSE of Lezhe.
This showed high subsoil salinity and remarkably high levels of nitrate.
Pedon 28, from the northern part of the SHU-4 area, showed low salinity levels, but again
remarkably high nitrate, which occurred in both topsoil and subsoil samples. (Nitrate levels
should thus be checked on any future sampling of soils in these areas.)
Comment Monitoring proposals have been included in the monitoring programme.
0.8  Long-term Impacts of the Wider Environment on the Proposed Development
D.8.1 Erosion and flash run-off
Of greatest concem to the sustainability of this, and other sub-projects, is the very severe
problem of erosion and flash run-off from surrounding upland areas which are the
immediate watershed areas to the sub-project The problem is threefold:
* due to a high run-off coefficient of these upland areas, excessive run-off water flows
into the sub-project areas, particularly during the months when it is not wanted
(October to March); excessive drainage and pumping costs resut, and expensive
interceptor 'high-level canals' have to be constructed;
* with the run-off water considerable quantities of eroded soil and rock are taken into
these high-level canals, and other reservoirs and drains; this material needs periodic
removal from the canals, at considerable cost;



* much of the resulting sediment ends up in the major rivers. The natural functions of
floodplains have been by-passed by the flood-protection and land reclamation
schemes completed in the period 1945-80, with the result that sediment is carried to
the sea, rather than being deposited in the floodplains.
The surrounding upland areas above the scheme show very variable standards of land
use management, with an estimated current rate of erosion varying from 3tonneslhalyear
(c.0.2mm depth of soil removal) with the best land management, to some
300tonnes/halyear (c 2cm depth) in the worst. Nationally, average rates of net erosion
have been placed at some 30tonnes I ha I year over the entire landsurface of the country
(Korvaci, 1998). The best land uses are natural forest and well-established treecrmp
plantabons, with complete canopy cover and dense understorey vegetation. The worst
land uses under the communist period used to be cultivation on sloping land: the current
problem is more one of uncontrolled grazing by villagers on any available adjacent land.
The most worrying cases of this involve grazing in terraced areas, where full-scale
destruction of terraces in now occurring due to stabilising grass and bush vegetation being
eaten out, and animals and people forming pathways in a slopewise direction which
rapidly lead to gullying.
The severity of this problem varies enormously from area to area, but is closely related tD
distance from settlements, and to nature of parent materials. Although most of the parent
materials in the area appear to be more stable limestone materials, close proximity to the
settlements and relatively steep slopes mean that they have come under cultivation and
grazing pressure. Run-off and erosion are thus severe.
A high proportion of erosion may be associated with extreme rainfall events - for example
1--in 5 24-hour rainfall amounts, which vary from about 80mm to 190mm over the country,
and are at the top of this range within the sub-project watershed.
A programme urgently needs to be instigated in integrated watershed management, which
together with the exsting irrigation and drainage rehabilitation programmes, shoulid
promote long-term sustainability of agriculture in these districts. The main thrust of such a
programme would embrace six components:
i9    undertake studies on run-off/erosion, existing land use, and land tenure within the
sub-project watershed, and, based on these studies, devise a long-term land
zoning plan for the watershed.
ii)   undertake reafforestation activities on publicly-owned land.
iii)   promote security of tenure on a long-term basis for all other appropriate upland
land areas. Ideally the same families farming land in scheme areas would also
have plots in adjacent upland areas. Granting of tite could be conditional on the
following three measures being carried out by the prospective land owners;
iv)   promote planting and management of perennial vegetation, wifth excellent
groundcover (olives, timber and fuelwood plantations etc);
v)   impose strict controls on grazing animals, particularly on areas which had been
previously terraced, and on steeper slopes and more erodible parent materials;
vi)   promote further active soil and water conservation measures, particularly contour
grass strips and hedges, bed contour drains, check dams and gully plugs etc.



Comment A watershed management component for SIDRP has been proposed.
D.8.2 Flooding
D.8.2.1 Convergence of flood waters.
Lezhe town and areas both upstream and downstream have previously suffered badly
from flooding, particularly over the period November-March. The flooding has been made
worse by pumping of floodwater from the LEU4A.EK3 areas at the same time that large
flows are occurring from the Drni/Gjadri Rivers from the north, and influx of run-off waters
in tributary streams from the east The completion of the eastem high level canal will give
some protection to the agricultural land, although it will afford no protection to Lezhe town.
A possibility which needs to be considered is to sacrifice the LEU4/LEK3 area for some
winter cropping, and not pump from this area at peak flood periods. The areas sacrificed
could be given preferential treatment for summer irrigation and cropping.
As was discussed above, due to possibilities of salinity intrusion, any deepening of the
Drini channel below Lezhe should be rejected.
The natural functions of lower floodplain areas have been by-passed many years ago,
with the reclamation of backswamp areas for agriculture.
D.8.2.2 Flood protection embankment
The Drini River drains the largest watershed of the country, including the area with the
highest rainfall and highest absolute run-off volumes and run-off coefficients. However,
flow is considerably regulated by three large hydroelectric dams, which are managed to
give a considerable element of flood protection to downstream land.
However, in spite of this flood protection buffer, flooding continues to occur, and for this
reason a flood protection bund has been constructed to prevent the Drini River from
resuming its old course.
D.8.3 Under-use of Agricultural Chemicals, particularly Fertilisers
Under the excellent soils of the scheme areas, and provision of drainage and irrigation,
yield potential should be considerable: 6-7 tonnes I ha for wheat, and 8-9 tonnes I ha for
maize should be achievable. Actual yields, which are currently well under half of these,
are being constrained by several interacting factors. On removal of drainage, flooding, and
irrigation supply constraints, it is then increasingly important that yields are not allowed to
be limited by fertility constraints or outbreaks of pests and diseases. Overall use of
fertilisers are well under half of what they were under communist times, and soil fertility is
being 'mined' in most areas.
Increased use of fertilisers and pesticides, up to recommended levels, and according to,
recommended practices, will enormously increase income and long-term sustainability of
the scheme. By making the economics of the schemes more attractive, they will relieve
pressure on the uplands, the problems of which are more severe by a very large factor
(see discussion above).
For the SHUJLEU sub-project areas, a further problem which must be considered is much
higher winter rainfall, and consequently leaching if fertilizer nutrients, than occur in other

sub-projects. This is likely to affect particulady the economics of N-fertilisation, and some
practical research work on this is called for. More frequent, and smaller N applications
may be the solution here.
D.9   Monitoring Programme
The monitoring programme should be undertaken by a technical staff member with
agronomic experience. This could be an agronomist or technical person attached to the
WE or federation of WUAs, or a member of the Soils Institute.
D.9.1 Irrigation and Drainage Water
Monitoring of irrigation water flows in the main canal needs to be undertaken in relation to
local rainfall. This is expected to be a routine responsibility of the WE.
Irrigation and drainage water quality needs to be monitored on an annual basis (late
summer) at the end of the first complete year of sub-project operation, with analyses
undertaken for all major anions and cations. A total of eight samples would be requiredl:
three for irrigation water and five for drainage. This analysis would serve as useful
baseline data for the scheme. Thereafter only EC needs to be monitored, ideally by a
technical staff member from the WE or federation of WUAs.
The same drainage water samples need to be monitored for pesticide residues, with the
first year being taken as baseline data. On confirmation of any problems arising
downstream (eg fish kills, algal blooms) further monitoring of these sites should be
undertaken.
0.9.2 Watershed Management
Monitoring of soil erosion and watershed management issues are extremely important but
need to be considered more as a separate project rather than a monitoring requirement
for this sub-project.
Advantages of inclusion of this sub-project in such a programme include:
*  many of the critical erosion areas, particularly in the land immediately to the east of the
K3-3 drainage canal, are managed by those farners with irrigated land in the sub-
project;
*  with further upland areas in the east of the Gjadri Watershed showing areas of
ultrabasic parent materials, the erosion problem is particularly severe in this area;
* any increase in infiltration rates in the watershed areas brought about by the
watershed management programme will reduce the very severe risk of flooding in
Lezhe town and neighbouring agricultural areas. ERRs for such a programme in this
area are thus likely to be very large.
Apart from implementation actMities on soil conservation measures, monitoring activities
would include:
* accumulation of rmaterials in canals and drains. This would be undertaken as a routine
activit by WE staff, and a map compiled showing the relative severity of the problem
in different areas;



* studies on small plots on run-off and erosion, determining terminal sprinkler infiltration
rates and soil erodibility factors for the major soil types.
* studies on land use and land use changes in the upper watershed areas.
The last two studies should ideally be undertaken as MS-level thesis projects, but under
supervision from experienced land use and watershed management staff under the
SIRDP watershed management component.
D.9.3 Equipment Needs
Standard soil and water monitoring equipment only is required for most analyses and this
is readily available in Albania. A maximum of US$200 per year would be needed to
undertake this routine analysis for this sub-project
Analysis of pesticide residues requires more sophisticated (gas chromatography)
equipment, but this is available in the laboratories of the Institute of Public Health. It would
be advantageous to undertake some duplicate sampling (say 10% of the total) and
correlate results with those obtained from an experienced laboratory elsewhere in Europe.
This work would be undertaken as part of a country-wide programme: some 50 local
samples at $50 per sample and 5 duplicate (foreign-lab) test samples at $200 per sample
would be required. (This would total some $2500 for local costs and some $1000 for
foreign costs for a national programme.)
Sprinkler infiltration rate testing and soil erodibility testing, also undertaken in other sub-
project areas, would need supervisory assistance which would form part of the watershed
management component of SIDRP.

(For location, see map, Figure D.1).
Photo 13
Above the southern suburbs of Shkoder town, looking ENE up the Drini valley. Note the
large hydropower reservoir extending upstream from right to left, and the Mjede danm,
offtake and canal at the right of the photo, behind which, and to the right, is the SHU4
area. The Drni River, prior to 1965, cut across this area, following its old channel anid
draining into the sea to the South of Lezhe town.
Note the braided channel of the new Drini/Buna River, indicating heavy deposition of
sediment load prior to completion of the dam. Some of these braided areas can now be
considered for reclamation to agricultural land.
Photo 14
The Mjede Dam, offtake and main canal can clearly be seen, as well as the irrigation
infrastructure pattem above the main part of the Shkoder scheme. Crops are maize,
alfalfa and fallow. The relative green has much to do with recent rainfall. Note bare upland
areas, suffering acute overgrazing, with very high run-off coefficients. Integrated water
management programmes of this and other similar land would do much to promote
economic and ecological sustainability of the sub-projects.

Looking east over the SHU4-6 area, Barbullshit village clearly seen in the centre of the
photo. The old Dnni channel, serving as the main drain for much of the further land in the
area runs from left to right Gramshi Village being seen on the far bank on the right The
Gjadrit River can be seen in the top of the photo.
Photo 16
Looking East across Barbullshit Ridge, separating the SHU4 and LEU3 areas from the
LEU4 and LEK3 areas in the foreground. The latter areas show deep peat soil, which are
suffering severe oxidation due to exposure and cultivation, with a result that the
landsurface has subsided more than 2m. This is increasing costs of pumping of drainage
water. This area should be considered as a winter flood buffer, being used for high-value
horticultural crops in the summer, for which the soils would have a high economic rating
(although low ecological rating, due to carbon oxidation).

COLLAGE OF PHOTOS TAKEN FROM THE AIR IN EARLY SEPT, 1998
(For location, see map, Figure D.l).
Photo 13: Above the southern suburbs of Shkoder town, looking ENE up the
Drini valley. Note the large hydropower reservoir extending upstream
from right to left, and the Mjede dam, of ftake and canal at the right of
the photo, behind which, and to the right, is the SHU4 area. The Drini
River, prior to 1965, cut across this area, following its old channel
and draining into the sea to the South of Lezhe town.
Note the braided channel of the new Drini/Buna River, indicating heavy
deposition of sediment load prior to completion of the dam. Some of
these braided areas can now be considered for reclamation to
agricultural land.
Photo 14: The Mjede Dam, offtake and main canal can clearly be seen, as
well as the irrigation infrastructure pattern above the main part of the
Shkoder scheme. Crops are maize, alfalfa and fallow. The relative green
has much to do with recent rainfall. Note bare upland areas, suffering
acute overgrazing, with very high run-off coefficients. Integrated water
management programmes of this and other similar land would do much to
promote economic and ecological sustainability of the sub-projects.
Photo 15: Looking east over the SHU4-6 area, Barbullshit village clearly
seen in the centre of the photo. The old Drini channel, serving as the
main drain for much of the further land in the area runs from left to
right, Gramshi Village being seen on the far bank on the right. The
Gjadrit River can be seen in the top of the photo.
Photo 16: Looking East across Barbullshit Ridge, separating the SHU4 and
LEU3 areas from the LEU4 and LEK3 areas in the foreground. The latter
areas show deep peat soil, which are suffering severe oxidation due to
exposure and cultivation, with a result that the landsurface has
subsided more than 2m. This is increasing costs of pumping of drainage
water. This area should be considered as a winter flood buffer, being
used for high-value horticultural crops in the summer, for which the
soils would have a high economic rating (although low ecological rating,
due to carbon oxidation).
