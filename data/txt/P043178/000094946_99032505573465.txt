ANNEX D Environmental Assessment
D.1  Introduction
Environmental aspects covered here include firstly the relatively narrow environmental
impact of the proposed rehabilitation. Secondly, the wider impact of the surroundling
environment on the sub-project is analysed, as this may have a more important long-term
impact on the viability of the sub-project.
An Environmental Assessment Summary for the sub-project is presented as Table D.2.
Monitoring and mitigation measures necessary to overcome any identified problems are
discussed in the final section.
D.2   Description of the Proposed Sub-Project
The sub-project PEU2 is located in the small Peqin District in the west-central part of the
country, approximately 35km due south of Tirana, with which it is connected by
reasonably good surfaced roads via Durres or Elbasan. It is some 20-30km inland from
the Adriatic coast, and lies in a wide alluvial plain on the south bank of the Shkrumbini
River.
The gross area of the sub-project totals 1,387ha, compfising 1,012 ha of gravity fed land
and 375ha of land requiring pumping. The main alluvial area, served by the main (Darsi)
canal, totals 831ha and is supplied by gravity canal from the Shkrumbini River,
supplemented by the Vashaj reservoir, to which water is pumped up during the winter
period. Other areas include:
* Gjocaj Reservoir commanded land, of some 150ha in extent, in the SW of the area;
* pumped area above the Gjocaj Reservoir, of 56ha in extent;
* Vashaj Reservoir commanded land, of some 3lha in extent;
* two pumped areas above the Vashaj Reservoir, totalling 319ha.
The sub-project is some 5km EW and 1.5km NS at its widest parts. The elevation of most
of the sub-project vanes from some 8-20m amsl, but areas of the reservoir schemes go up
to 60m.
Soils in the area commanded by the Darsi Canal are almost all of alluvial origin, and are
deep, calcareous and of high to moderate nutrient and water retention capacities. Slope
gradients are less than 1%, and mostly in the range 0.1-0.5%. Soils in the areas
commanded by the reservoir schemes are much more variable, mainly of colluvial origin,
but with some local areas of alluvium. Slope gradients are also more variable, but mostly
within the range 0-16%.
Figure D.1 shows a location map for the main features of the project
Full details of the sub-project's location, resources, agriculture, irrigation and drainage,
and proposed rehabilitation activities are presented in Chapters 2 to 6 of this sub-prcject
feasibility study.



D.3   Conclusions
As the proposed project essentially comprises the rehabilitation of detenorated irrigation
and drainage facilities its impacts are generally positive in nature. In particular, the
rehabilitation will restore efficient irrigation and increase farm incomes which will benefit
the rural population, amongst whom there is considerable poverty. Drainage rehabilitation
will facilitate growth in the cooler and wetter months, and will reduce surface run-off of
fertiliser nutrients and agro-chemicals. The improved distribution of irrigation water will
increase social equity, removing the disparity between those at the head of the system
and those without water at the tail.
However, a major environmental issue which will significantly impact on the sub-project is
soil erosion and flash run-off from surrounding areas of land. Most of these areas are
farmed by land owners of the sub-project. This issue is expected to be addressed by a
proposed watershed management component of SIDRP. Other issues, somewhat less
serious, include soil fertility, soil structure breakdown, and water quality, and these are
included in a proposed monitoring programme. Water availability could be a major issue,
but would be overcome by rehabilitation of the Vashaj Reservoir infrastructure and/or the
Devolli-Shkrumbini Diversion Canal and Banje Reservoir Dam lining.
In the following sections D.4 to D.8 the environmental aspects of the sub-project are
reviewed in more detail. In the final section, D.9, a monitoring programme is proposed.
D.4   Water Availability Issues
The source of water for this sub-project is the Shkrumbini River, diverted into the Darsi
Canal. Although the Shkrumbini watershed upstream of this diversion has an area of
some 220,000ha, the diversion is 1km below the Cengelaj Barrage, which diverts up to 7
cumecs of water into the Peqin Kavaje canal, for use in large irrigation schemes to the
north-west The river below the Cengelaj Barrage is thus almost dry in the late summer
period in many years. Water is thus pumped up to the Vashaj Reservoir in winter to
supplement run-off from the small (220ha) catchment area for that reservoir. The Vashaj
Reservoir, of 1,400,000cu metres storage capacity, was completed in 1984 and was
investigated-by the dam safety consultant (December, 1998 report).
An additional possible source of water for this sub-project is the Devolli-Shkrumbini
Diversion Canal which is supplied from the Banje Reservoir and Devolli River. The
reservoir has a catchment area of some 250,000 ha, but is only partly completed. Its
present storage capacity is some 200m cubic metres, although lining to the dam will have
to be completed before this storage capacity can safely be achieved.
However, lack of finance has held back final completion of both interim storage on the
Banje Reservoir, and sluice gates on the canal. When both works are completed, there
will be no problems of water availability.
D.5  Irrigation Water Quality for PEU3
Sediment levels observed in the river water in early December, 1998, were moderate, but
much coarse-textured material and domestic rubbish was observed at the water off-takes
from the river. Watershed management in the upper Shkrumbini watershed is of great
importance.



Irrigation water sampling was undertaken from the Shkrumbini River source by DAI in
1996, and from the Devolli River Source by DAI in 1996 and by HTS/BBVWHidromont in
late September, 1998. Results from the different sources are consistent Irrigation water
quality from the reservoir and headwaters is extremely good, with very low EC (0.3-0.7
dSMm), TDS (220600 mgI) and SAR (<0.4) values. According to FAO (1985) irrigation
water classification, this water would have no problems for most parameters of saliinity.
However, with bicarbonate being the dominant anion, there may be some problem ovfer a
long period with carbonate incrustation for sprinkler or drip irrigation. Also, with very low
ECw values, there may be a tendency for soil structure breakdown and dispersion of
clays. However, with well structured soils of high carbonate and organic matter content,
this tendency should be very small. Nevertheless, soil structure and yields shoulc be
monitored over a long period to verify that this is so.
Comment Monitoring requirements are included in the proposed monitoring programme.
D.6   Drainage Water Quality from PEU2
D.6.1 Drainage Water which may be re-used for irrigation
Some of the drainage water from the sub-project is subsequently being reused; for
inigation further downstream. According to DAI (1996) analysis from Rrogozhine, such
downstream water again shows very good water qualities, with even the worst of the
samples showing very low EC (0.7 dS/m), TDS (480 mgAI) and SAR (0.2) values. Any
increase in salinity caused by the scheme is thus extremely small.
D.6.2 Drainage Water passing through the sub-project area
These waters were not sampled for chemical analysis, but on the basis of results of
neighbouring areas, no problems are expected.
A major physical problem, however, is the presence of large quantities of coarse-textured
materials in the side-streams cutting through the sub-project area. These streams in many
places have been canalised, and this accumulated sediment will need periodic clearing.
D.7  Soil Salinity
No saline soils are present in the PEU2 area, and the immediate sub-project areas
contain no significant extents of 'problem soils'. However, the adjacent sloping
watersheds, particularly to the south of the PEU2 area, show areas of Pliocene marine
clays. These show high levels of exchangeable sodium and are highly erodible.
D.8   Long-term Impacts of the Wider Environment on the Proposed Development
D.8.1 Erosion and flash run-off
Of greatest concem to the sustainability of these, and other sub-projects, is the very
severe problem of erosion and flash run-off from surrounding upland areas which are, the
immediate watershed areas to the sub-projects. The problem is threefold:



* due to a high run-off coefficient of these upland areas, excessive run-off water flows
into the sub-projects areas, particularly durng the months when it is not wanted
(October to March); this run-off flows into the main canals, which also act as high level
interceptors found on many other sub-projects;
* with the run-off water considerable quantities of eroded soil and rock are taken into
these canals, the reservoirs and the drainage lines; this material needs periodic
removal from the canals, at considerable cost; .
* much of the resulting sediment ends up in the major rivers.
The surrounding upland areas above the sub-projects show very variable standards of
land use management, with an estimated current rate of erosion varying from
3tonnes)ha)year (c.0.2mm depth of soil removal) with the best land management, to some
300tonnes/ha/year (c 2cm depth) in the worst. Nationally, average rates of net erosion
have been placed at some 30tonnes I ha I year over the entire landsurface of the country
(Korvaci, 1998). The best land uses are natural forest and well-established treecrop
plantations, with complete canopy cover and dense understorey vegetation. The worst
land uses under the communist period used to be cultivation on sloping land: the current
problem is more one of uncontrolled grazing by villagers on any available adjacent land.
The most worrying cases of this involve grazing in terraced areas, where full-scale
destruction of terraces in now occurring due to stabilising grass and bush vegetation being
eaten out, and animals and people forming pathways in a slopewise direction which
rapidly lead to gullying. This problem is particularly severe in the land to the south of the
PEU2 area.
The severity of this problem vales enormously from area to area, but is closely related to
distance from settlements, and to nature of parent materials. The worst problem areas
appear to be those of Pliocene marine clays: many ultrabasic soil areas are also bad.
Pliocene marine materials occur in the watersheds to the south of the PEU2 sub-project.
A high proportion of erosion may be associated with extreme rainfall events - for example
1-in 5 24-hour rainfall amounts, which vary from about 80mm to 190mm over the country,
and are at the middle of this range within the sub-project watersheds.
A programme urgently needs to be instigated in integrated watershed management, which
together with the existing irnigation and drainage rehabilitation programmes, should
promote long-term sustainability of agriculture in these districts. The main thrust of such a
programme would embrace six components:
i)    undertake studies on run-off/erosion, existing land use, and land tenure within the
sub-project watershed, and, based on these studies, devise a long-term land
zoning plan for the watersheds.
ii)   undertake reafforestation acbvities on publicly-owned land.
iii)   promote security of tenure on a long-term basis for all other appropriate upland
land areas. Ideally the same families farming land in scheme areas would also
have plots in adjacent upland areas. Granting of title could be conditional on the
following three measures being carried out by the prospective land owners;



iv) promote planting and management of perennial vegetation, wifth excellent
groundcover (olives, timber and fuelwood plantations etc);
v)   impose strict controls on grazing animals, paricularly on areas which had been
previously terraced, and on steeper slopes and more erodible parent materials;
vi)   promote further active soil and water conservation measures, particularly contour
grass strips and hedges, tied contour drains, check dams and gully plugs etc.
Comnent A watershed management component for SIDRP has been proposed.
D.8.2 Flooding
Flooding may be a seasonal problem in lwer parts of the area, due to both local flooding
and main river bursfing its banks. The velocity of water passing through the PEU2 area
would suggest that a considerable amount of scouring could occur in the worst years, with
a tendency for the river bed to change course. This problem may worsen if upstream
watershed management issues are not tackled.
D.8.3 Under-use of Agricultural Chemicals, particularly Fertilisers
Under the excellent soils of the scheme areas, and provision of drainage and irrigation,
yield potential should be considerable: 6-7 tonnes I ha for wheat, and 8-9 tonnes I ha for
maize should be achievable. Actual yields, which are currently well under half of these,
are being constrained by several interacting factors. On removal of drainage, flooding, and
irrigation supply constraints, It is then Increasingly Important that yields are not allowed to
be limited by fertility constraints or outbreaks of pests and diseases. Overall use of
fertilisers are well under half of what they were under communist times, and soil fertility Is
being 'mined' in most areas.
Increased use of fertilisers and pesticides, up to recommended levels, and according to
recommended practices, will enormnously increase income and long-term sustainabilily of
the scheme. By making the economics of the schemes more attractve, they will relieve
pressure on the uplands, the problems of which are more severe by a very large faictor
(see discussion above).
D.9 Monitoring Programme
The monitoring programme should be undertaken by a technical saff member with
agronomic experience. This could be an agronomist or technical person attached tc the
WE or federation of WUAs, or a member of the Soils Instte.
D.9.1 Irrigation and Drainage Water
Monitoring of irrigation water flows in the main canal needs to be undertaken in relaticn to
local rainfall. This Is expected to be a routine responsibility of the WE.
Irrigation and drainage water quality needs to be monitored on an annual basis (late
summer) at the end of the first complete year of sub-project operation, with analyses
undertaken for all major anions and cations. A total of eight samples would be required:
three for irrigation water and five for drainage. This analysis would serve as useful



baseline data for the scheme. Thereafter only EC needs to be monitored, ideally by a
technical staff member from the WE or federation of WUAs.
The same drainage water samples need to be monitored for pesticide residues, with the
first year being taken as baseline data. On confirmatfon of any problems arising
downstream (eg fish kills, algal blooms) further monitoring of these sites should be
undertaken.
D.9.2 Soil Fertility Monitoring
Routine soil fertility testing needs to be undertaken both as essential baseline data for the
project, and also on a 2-yearly basis as the project progresses in order to follow fertility
changes in relation to yield levels and applications of fertiliser and manure. These sites
can also be used to follow soil structure changes, including possible deterioration of
surface structure as a result of long-term use of low-EC irrigation water, and tendencies of
soils to show sub-soil pan formation, restricting root growth and water movement
A minimum of six farmers fields should be selected within the sub-project area,
representative of he best (most intensive) and worst (least intensive) farming
management Cropping history of these fields should be recorded, including crops grown,
rainfall (local station), irrigation water, pesticides, fertilisers, manure, and other
ameliorants used, and yields obtained. Composite soil samples should be taken to
represent topsoil (0-20cm) and subsoil (20-60cm) of each field.
Samples should be analysed at the Soils Institute laboratory for full fertility analyses,
including exchangeable catfons and pH(H20).
Plant tissue samples should be taken for trace-element analysis, including Fe, Mn, Zn,
Cu, Co, Mo, and B.
Soil pits to 2m depth should be excavated at each of the sites and routine descriptions
made. These should also include detailed description of soil structure, pore space and
continuity, and root density and continuity. This should also be related to water table and
drainage features.
D.9.3 Watershed Management
Monitoring of soil erosion and watershed management issues are extremely important but
need to be considered more as a separate project rather than a monitoring requirement
for this sub-project
Advantages of inclusion of this sub-project in such a programme include: * many
upstream areas are managed by those farmers with irrigated land in the sub-project;
* with upland areas showing areas of Pliocene marine clay parent materials, the erosion
problem is particularly severe in this area;
* areas of degraded, acid soils may occur in places in the sloping lands in the south of
the sub-project, and these could be improved by applications of fine, calcareous silt
materials cleared from drains and canals downslope.
Apart from implementation activities on soil conservation measures, monitoring acivities
would include:



* accumulation of materials in canals and drains. This would be undertaken as a routine
activity by WE staff, and a map compiled showing the relative severity of the problem
in different areas;
*  studies on small plots on run-off and erosion, determining terminal sprinkler infiltration
rates and soil erodibility factors for the major soil types.
*  studies on land use and land use changes in the upper watershed areas.
The last two studies should ideally be undertaken as MS-level thesis projects, but under
supervision from experienced land use and watershed management staff under the
SIDRP watershed management component.
D.9.4 Equipment Needs
Standard soil and water monitoring equipment only is required for most analyses and this
is readily available in Albania. A maximum of US$200 per year would be needed to
undertake this routine analysis for this sub-project
Analysis of pesticide residues reqwires more sophisticated (gas chromatography)
equipment, but this is available in the laboratories of the Institute of Public Health.. It
would be advantageous to undertake some duplicate sampling (say 10% of the total) aind
correlate results with those obtained from an experienced laboratory elsewhere in Europe.
This work would be undertaken as part of a country-wide programme: some 50 local
samples at $50 per sample and 5 duplicate (foreign-lab) test samples at $200 per sample
would be required. (This would total $2500 for local costs and some $1000 for foreiign
costs for a national programme.)
Sprinkler infiltration rate testing and soil erodibility testing, also undertaken in other sub-
project areas, would need supervisory assistance which would form part of the watershed
management component of SIDRP.
