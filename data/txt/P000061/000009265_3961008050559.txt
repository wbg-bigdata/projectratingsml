MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ANGOLA
FOR A SOCIAL ACTION PROJECT
1.    1 submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to Angola for SDR 16.1 million, the equivalent of US$24
million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Social
Action Project. The Government and beneficiaries will provide US$8.6 million; co-
financing is being sought for US$ 18.6 miNlion.
2.    Background. Angola's decades-long civil war -- the longest in any country in
Africa -- has left the economy devastated and the vast majority of the population in
poverty. Annual inflation spiraled into 4 digits, and, despite a wealth of natural resources,
GNP per capita declined from an average of US$820 between 1986-88 to US$250 in
1994. Social indicators are low -- often well below averages for Sub-Saharan Africa.
With many areas of the country, especially in rural areas, still considered unsafe, massive
population movements, which left over 2 million people displaced by late 1994, still
continue. A 1991 Household Survey in Luanda found 64 percent of the population living
under the poverty line. A 1993 study prepared for a Poverty Workshop in Luanda
estimated that 86 percent of the population was unable to afford even a basic food basket.
3.    Since the Lusaka Accords of May 1995, a fragile peace prevails and the
Government and the people appear optimistic about the future. The Government has
committed to an economic reform program, begining with the recent realignment of the
official foreign exchange rate with the parallel market rate and the termination of the
subsidy on petroleum products. The proposed Social Action Project would be an integral
part of this reform program, helping to expand infrastructure in poor areas and provide
targeted interventions to poor communities. It would also buttress the political and social
support for the reform program, by showing that Government, through the Social Action
Fund (FAS), in partnership with communities, is willing and able to assist with high
priority local development efforts aimed at poverty alleviation, economic growth and
employment creation. Resumption of development and growth in rural areas would
contribute significantly to the re-establishment of confidence and security throughout the
country.
4.    Social sectors spending dropped sharply in 1992, when fighting broke out again
and military expenditures began to consume an ever-increasing share of Government
revenues, with the result that many health facilities, especially in rural areas, were
destroyed and those that remain need urgent rehabilitation. Against this background, it is
not surprising that between 1989 and 1993 most social indicators deteriorated
significantly. In 1993, under-five mortality was estimated at 320 per thousand and infant
mortality was 195 per 1000 live births. The crude mortality rate of 19 per 1000 is



-2-
significantly higher than the average in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Life expectancy at 45
years is among the lowest in SSA. Only 30 percent of the total population, primarily in
urban areas, have access to safe water, a factor which contributes to the prevalence of
many otherwise easily preventable diseases.
5.    More than 70 percent of Angola's population must be considered food insecure.
The Ministry of Health estimates that at least 20 percent of infants have been
malnourished every year since the mid 1980s. Poverty and food availability are directly
correlated to economic infrastructure and accessibility of markets and urban centers. The
war has devastated much of this infrastructure. Markets have been destroyed, storage
facilities are scarce, and access to both is severely hindered by poor road conditions.
6.    Like health facilities, many schools, especially in rural areas, were damaged or
destroyed during the civil war. Many rural areas are still considered unsafe and many
students and teachers have fted to urban areas where schools are severely overcrowded.
In Luanda, for example, classroom size averages 140 students. With the decline in rural
enrollments, national primary school enrollment rates have dropped to about 50 percent.
The quality of both urban and rural primary education suffers from deteriorating facilities,
where teachers are poorly-trained and are often demoralized by the lack of equipment and
books. In basic education, only a third of the children complete the first level (age 6-10)
without repetition.
7.    Project Rationale. The greatest challenge facing the Government of Angola at
present is to restore social confidence and promote the resumption of economic growth
with a sharp focus on poverty alleviation and job creation. Since much of the countryside
is still considered unsafe, large numbers of people remain in and around urban areas which
they perceive to be safer. A critical element in this program will be the provision of basic
social and economic infrastructure throughout the country.
8.    The Government has articulated a National Community Reconstruction Program
aimed at restoring social services and security in rural areas. However, given its current
technical, institutional and budgetary constraints, the focus at present is mainly on large
public works and infrastructure in urban centers. Recognizing that addressing community
needs was fundamental for the country's reconstruction and stability --even before the
peace treaty was signed -- Government requested IDA's assistance to set up a project to
support community-based rehabilitation of basic social, productive and economic
infrastructure. Several alternatives were considered for the implementation of a program
to meet these objectives. The Government realizes that its existing structure may be
adequate for serving the needs of the central urban areas; however, it is not well-suited to
serve outlying urban or rural areas, and it does not incorporate community input to the
extent necessary. Another model considered was the semi-public procurement agency
(known as AGETEP in several African countries) where the focus is on ensuring the access
of small contractors to the public investment programs. Currently this is not feasible in
Angola as the contracting industry is in its infancy and not geared towards labor-intensive
implementation. Furthermore, this approach has proved difficult to reconcile with a



ttnrd even a hacir thnd hnaket
-3-
completely demand-driven approach that would ensure the full participation of
communities in identification and implementation of sub-projects.
9.    The one remaining option is the social investment fund model which has been
successfully applied in several African and Latin American countries (including Zambia,
Bolivia, Ethiopia and Honduras). Restoring self-confidence in communities and building
community feeling is very important in Angola where the social fabric has been damaged
by years of conflict. Social investment funds have proved to be both successful in
encouraging community participation and sufficiently flexible to meet community demands
dt lower costs than Govemment. During the pilot phase the average investment costs per
square meter to rehabilitate primary schools was estimated at US$80, while it has been
estimated that the average cost of rehabilitating a primary school by the Government is
US$358 per square meter (see Schedule B1).
10.   On the basis of these considerations, Government decided to create a social fund.
Acknowledging the limitations of its bureaucracy in this type of activity, the Government
proposed that 9j.5% of the proceeds of the Credit be channeled through an autonomous
decentralized agency, the FAS, under the Ministry of Planning. During its pilot phase, the
FAS has proved its ability to react quickly and effectively to meet community demands.
Being part of the local community, staff at the provincial level are readily accountable to
the community and are immediately familiar with the most vulnerable and poor areas in
their provinces.
11.   Because poverty alleviation and human resource development are the most critical
areas to be monitored, a second small component of the Project has been designed to re-
establish basic statistical capacity. At present, because of decades of war, Angola has
virtually no capacity to conduct household and other national surveys to monitor changes
in the extent and nature of poverty.
12.   The Social Action Project is the response to Government's request for (i) a
streamlined and flexible approach to community needs for micro projects providing
economic and social infrastructure as well as support for directly productive investment,
and (ii) a Poverty Monitoring Component that will strengthen the country's capacity to
identify the needs of the population. The Project objectives are consistent with the
Govemment's own development objectives and reflect the priorities of IDA's country
assistance objectives, namely, poverty alleviation and human resource development.
13.   Project Objectives. The aim of the Project is to assist the population of Angola
through the difficult transition from war to peace, by reaching those segments of the
population that have been most neglected and at risk. The Social Action Fund
component of the Project is designed to improve access to basic services and to generate
employment for the poor in rural and urban areas through rehabilitating and equipping
community infrastructure in health, education, and water and sanitation. Economic
growth at the community level will be stimulated through the rehabilitation or construction
of economic infrastructure such as markets, rural bridges, earth-surfaced roads and safe



-4-
water points. The Poverty Monitoring component is intended to build institutional
capacity and establish an integrated system to monitor the living conditions of the
population. This will support the formulation of strategies and programs for poverty
alleviation and other policies for socioeconomic development. The component also
provides for financing and implementing policy-relevant research on poverty and social
issues, and performing systematic poverty monitoring through household surveys.
14.   Project Description. The Project will consist of two major components:
(a)   A Social Fund component (US$48.64 million or 93.5 percent of total
project costs) executed by the Fundo de Apoio Social (FAS) which will
finance sub-projects identified, prepared and implemented by local
communities on their own or with support from NGOs. These sub-projects
will be appraised and supervised by the Provincial Offices of the FAS;
(b)   A Poverty Monitoring component (US$3.34 million or 6.5 percent of total
project costs) executed by the Gabinete de Monitorizagdo das CondiYes
de Vida da PopulaVdo (GMCVP), located within the Instituto Nacional de
Estatistica (LNE).
15.   An IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance of US$2 million for the
creation of the FAS was approved in 1993. The Angolan Government created the FAS, in
October 1994, as an autonomous, decentralized agency to channel fimds to communities.
Administratively, the FAS is headed by the National Board of Overseers which sets policy.
The National Coordination Unit, the central body, gives technical support, coordinates and
supervises the activities of the provincial offices, and manages the flow of funds between
the Government and the provincial level. The Provincial Offices identify, approve and
disburse the finds and supervise the community-based projects. The Provincial Offices
inform and cooperate with a Provincial Board of Overseers. Currently the FAS is filly
established in four Provincial Offices: Benguela, Kwanza Sul, Namibe and Cabinda. To
date, 87 sub-projects have been approved, totaling US$1,656,000 equivalent, eight have
been completed and 20 are currently being implemented. Disbursement for sub-project
implementation averages US$30,000 per month per province. There are approximately
120 sub-projects in the preparation pipeline. These are mainly for schools, health posts
and water facilities (including water supply for cattle).
16.  Institution building is a major activity under both components of the Project. The
FAS is increasing the capacity of communities and NGOs to plan, appraise, manage and
maintain investment projects through the experience gained in this Project. Continuous
technical support for the GMCVP should increase the Unit's capacity to conduct and
analyze nation-wide surveys, and to present the results to policymakers.
17.   Schedule A gives a breakdown of the costs and the financing plan. Schedule B
presents preliminary financial analysis and lists key performance indicators. Schedule C
indicates methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule. Schedule D shows the



-5-
timetable of key processing events; and Schedule E , the status of Bank Group operations in
Angola. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 14822-ANG dated October 1, 1995 has been
distributed.
18.   Project Financing. Total project costs are US$51.99 million over a four-year
period, with IDA financing 46 percent. Communities benefiting from sub-projects will
contribute in cash or in kind 15 percent of the cost of individual sub-projects, the
combined total of which is estimated at some 12 percent of total project costs. The
Government will contribute 5 percent of total project costs. Discussions are underway
with other donors regarding the balance of required funding. Co-financing is being sought
for about US$18.3 million to finance additional sub-projects and related operating costs.
At the United Nations Round Table on Angola, held September 25-29, 1995, Govemment
and the FAS technical team presented the FAS as a recommended channel for community
financing. Several governments expressed interest. During the first quarter of 1996, the
borrower, IDA, and representatives of these governments will meet to confirm parallel
financing arrangements. The extent of co-financing will ultimately determine the scale and
timing of the Project. FAS operating costs are financed through the IDA Credit so that
Project implementation is independent from co-financing.
19.   Project Implementation. Day-to-day management of the FAS actvities is
managed by the existing NCU. Poverty-monitoring activities will be managed by the
GMCVP within INE. In implementing the Project, FAS will follow the policies and
procedures of its own Administrative and Procedures Manuals, both of which have been
reviewed and discussed extensively during project preparation and appraisal and which
serve as a comprehensive basis for guiding FAS's administrative and technical operations.
During negotiations IDA and the Govemment agreed to review and revise both Manuals
as necessary as a result of on-going experience. Revisions would be discussed and agreed
upon during regular supervision missions and at the mid-term review.
20.   Project Sustainability. The FAS is designed to have a limited lifetime. However,
the sustainability of the sub-projects to be supported by the FAS has been a major
consideration in project design. Social and economic infrastructure sub-projects should
be adequately maintained because the communities identify them and share in their
financing. This contributes to a strong sense of ownership. Every sub-project will have an
established functioning maintenance committee. One of the approval criteria for financing
of sub-projects is a commitment from both the community and the provincial government
which will assure the incremental financing and the manpower necessary to operate the
facilities on an on-going basis. All sub-projects are appraised for financial sustainability.
Sustainability of the revenue-generating sub-projects is promoted at the conception of the
sub-project by the development of a sound business plan, reflecting the obvious value for
the beneficiaries and incorporating elements likely to support their sense of ownership.
During the pilot phase, the average total investment costs per direct beneficiary has been
US$5. The rehabilitated structures are calculated to last about 10 years with basic
maintenance and without major repairs. During the pilot phase, sub-project incremental
recurrent costs averaged US$0.28 per year per direct beneficiary. That figure represents



-6-
around 1/900 of the GNP per capita. These figures consider only direct beneficiaries, not
the whole community. Even in the difficult situation of Angolan communities, this seems
affordable. The FAS will mainly rehabilitate existing infrastructure. Since these are
staffed already, incremental costs for the social Ministries will be minimal.
21.   Strengthening of the INE and the GMCVP is intended to promote the
sustainability of both institutions. During the Project period, recurrent costs of GMCVP
will be provided on a declining basis to encourage GMCVP to produce high quality work.
By the end of the project, it is expected that the GMCVP will have proved to be a capable
unit producing policy-relevant outputs. This will enable the GMCVP to gradually
generate demands from institutions inside and outside Govemment (for example, joint
ventures with donors as well as public and private institutions) for data collection and
analysis as well as for the undertaking of specific studies. In the medium term GMCVP
could become a financially autonomous institution.
22.   Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. IDA has supported more than 30
social funds, including several in Africa. The funds have worked well when they have had
autonomous management, rigorous but simple procedures, flexibility in procurement and
disbursement, and have emphasized supervision, monitoring and community participation.
These lessons are built into this project proposal. In addition, the pilot phase has proved
extremely valuable in testing management systems; establishing relations with sub-project
sponsors (for example, NGOs and churches); and establishing routines for sub-project
identification, approval and supervision.
23.   Rationale for IDA Involvement and Relationship to Country Strategy. IDA's
country assistance strategy for Angola was last discussed with the Board in January 1992.
This is the first new IDA project in Angola since mid- 1993. The current country situation,
following two years of severe fighting, is so changed from that time that the earlier
strategy is clearly no longer valid. The Department is in the process of preparing a
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which is targeted for discussion with the Board in
March 1996. It was decided to defer preparation of the CAS until that time as the
information on country conditions required to underpin a meaningful strategy is only
slowly becoming available. Nevertheless, the key prongs of the Association's short-term
strategy are being formulated and there is little question that the proposed Project
activities, which vill facilitate resettlement of displaced persons in their communities, are
appropriate within the context of that strategy.
24.   IDA's near term strategy in Angola will be to support the transition to a peace-
time economy and improvements in the dire living conditions of much of the Angolan
people. This can only be accomplished by activities that quickly generate results on the
ground. While policy changes required for successful implementation of these activities
and for the ongoing transition to a market-based economy would also be supported, the
strategy will recognize that the need for tangible improvements may require less ambition
in the beginning on the pace of reforms. IDA currently has eight ongoing operations in
Angola covering infrastructure, health and education, financial sector development and



-7-
economic capacity building. A first goal of the Association's strategy is to revisit the
goals and content of all ongoing projects to ascertain that plans and actions for
restructuring respond to cilanged circumstances. Some projects have already accordingly
been restructured.
25.   A second priority will be to support macroeconomic stabilization and provide the
balance of payments support required to underpin the stabilization and spur private sector
development. This will be accomplished in close coordination with the IMF, which has
approved a staff-monitored program for Angola. Analytical work will include an update
on the overall economic situation. IDA is in the process of preparing an emergency
operation which would provide financing for a positive list of imports. Provided that there
is progress on the macroeconomic front, the Association would initiate preparation of a
structural adjustment credit, which would have the additional goal of further deregulating
economic activities as a spur for private sector growth.
26.   A third priority would be the reconstruction of essential infrastructure and
expansion needed to compensate for many years of little investment. Rehabilitation of
essential infrastructure in key provincial cities damaged by the war would be supported in
the operation or independently. An urban water project would support priority urban
water works and introduce private management to the water sector. Other infrastructure
projects are likely to cover roads and other transport investments. Analytical work to
underpin operations in some of these areas has already been completed; other work would
be initiated as needed.
27.   A fourth priority will be to support further improvements in living conditions,
particularly in the rural and peri-urban areas. The proposed Project would be a
cornerstone of this effort. The emergency project or a separate operation would support
activities to assist those most affected by the war: the children, the displaced and the
disabled. An agricultural rehabilitation project would provide support for renewed
agricultural activity which will help to mitigate hunger and provide income-generating
opportunities. Follow-on health and education projects would be likely upon completion
of the ongoing operations in these sectors, and analytical work on health would probably
be needed as backgroumd.
28.   Finally, the Association would aim to provide support for jump-starting the
economy. This would be accomplished through the provision of foreign exchange under
adjustment operations; support for deregulation of the private sector and privatization
under ongoing operations and a future adjustment operation; the agriculture rehabilitation
project; and, when the macro situation so permits, credit for pioductive investment.
29.   This strategy is likely to develop as conditions in Angola evolve and as further
information on the situation becomes available. The uncertainties are significant -- how
quickly soldiers will demobilize and mines can be cleared and how rapidly macroeconomic
balances can be brought under control are only some of the difficult issues. It is clear that
the international community will need to play an important role in facilitating the transition



-8-
to peace, and that IDA, in coordination with others, will need to play a central role. The
recent donor's Round Table conference suggests that donors are prepared to provide
support if the enabling conditions make that feasible.
30.   The Project design directly promotes this strategy by supporting independent
community initiatives, building NGO and private sector capacity, increasing public sector
accountability and increasing the capacity of Government to identify and monitor poverty.
31.   Agreed Actions. As a condition of effectiveness, the Government will sign a
Subsidiary Credit Agreement with the FAS for the use of the proceeds of the IDA Credit.
As conditions of disbursement for the Poverty Monitoring Component, (a) INE will adopt
a satisfactory manual of procedures for the GMCVP; (b) INE will appoint an
administrator with qualifications, skills and experience and on terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA; (c) the Government will deliver to IDA a satisfactory legal opinion
that the ministerial decree modifying LNE Statutes has been approved; and, (d) the
Government will establish an account in local currency with an initial deposit of US$5,000
equivalent in an acceptable commercial bank, for counterpart funding of the project
expenditures for the GMCVP. Agreements have already been reached on arrangements
for the implementation agency, Government counterpart contribution, and procurement,
audits, and reporting.
32.   Environmental Aspects. As the focus of the Project is to rehabilitate or expand
existing infrastructure, it has been placed in category C. Anthropologists and dryland
ecologists will support the FAS staff to develop sub-project approval criteria for water
projects in the arid and semi-arid areas of southern Angola. Waste management will be an
important part of the urban sub-projects. It is expected that the Project activities will have
a positive effect on the environment through its emphasis on water, sanitation and waste
nanagement.
33.   Poverty Category. The Project is part of the core poverty program for Angola
and is included in the program of targeted interventions. During the pilot phase the
beneficiaries of the FAS have been primarily children (43 percent) and women (33
percent), and poor communities that live in peri-urban and rural areas in which basic
social economic and productive infrastructure has been severely damaged by war and
neglect.
34.   Participatory Approach. During the pilot phase, the FAS extensively used
information-sharing mechanisms to mobilize community participation. During sub-project
implementation, field visits, interviews, and consultative meetings will ensure community
participation. The FAS will regularly use systematic client consultation to evaluate sub-
project performance and verify the appropriateness of the FAS responses to the perceived
needs of the community.
35.   Project Benefits. Estimating the exact benefits of this type of project is difficult
because activities (sub-projects) are demand-driven, thus making it difficult to anticipate



-9-
the project area, the total number of beneficiaries, and the number and mix of project
types. However, the pilot project experience has provided some perspective on what
might reasonably be expected fiom the FAS. It is estimated that the FAS will construct
approximately 230 new schools, rehabilitate over 680 existing schools, and provide the
initial investment in their equipment and supplies. This would result in increased access to
(mostly) primary education for approximately 450,000 children.
36.   Similarly, it is estimated that the FAS will rehabilitate or construct around 450
health posts. At an average of 800 patients per year, 350,000 people will benefit. Water
suipply will be improved by various means in 200 sub-projects, benefiting 50,000 people.
An additional 120 latrines will improve living conditions for 50,000 Angolans. Various
other projects, such as laundries, roads, bridges, irrigation works, markets and other
infiastructure works will improve economic access and living conditions for approximately
300,000 people. By enabling the rapid rehabilitation and construction of basic social
infrastructure, FAS will directly improve living conditions for at least 10 percent of the
Angolan population. The main beneficiaries of the projects are children (43 percent) and
women (33 percent).
37.   The mechanisms used to deliver sub-project support will stimulate increased
community ownership and improve capacity to create and manage participatory
development. This rekindled spirit of self-help and the increased sense of ownership and
accountability are of vital importance for a population which has suffered from warfare
over the last decades.
38.   The main benefit arising from the activities included in the Poverty Monitoring
comnponent will be an increased capacity for strategic planning and analysis in Angola
based on an improved knowledge of the Angolan living conditions. This will enable
Angolan policymakers to target programs and policies to the poor and vulnerable with
greater impact and efficiency. These surveys and studies will also establish important
benchmarks against which to assess changes in the living conditions of different social
groups. This will provide for the first time a capacity to evaluate programs and policies in
light of their poverty reduction effect.
39.   Project Risks. The FAS has been designed to assist in the change from war to
peace. Although explicitly developed to operate in this transition it is still vulnerable to
political and military instability. In order to operate effectively, the FAS has been set up as
a decentralized organization. This assumes that local management is dynamic enough to
implement the project as expected. Flexibility to respond to management weaknesses is
encouraged by maintaining staff on short-term contracts with ongoing performance
evaluation, incentives, and training. The risk of political interference is reduced through
the independent status of FAS and the participation of a wide spectrum of stakeholders
on its National Board of Overseers. Poor technical quality of works could undermine the
sustainability of the sub-projects and impair community participation. This risk is
addressed through close technical monitoring and supervision. Weak implementation
capacity of the communities and the FAS was identified as a possible risk. During the



-10-
pilot experience, both communities and the FAS have identified, appraised and completed
sub-projects at a satisfactory pace. This suggests that the design of the proposed Project
has recognized and minimized this potential pitfall.
40.   Administrative and managerial weakness of the GMCVP may delay planned
implementation of surveys and studies. This issue has been addressed by including as
conditions of disbursement for this component: (a) the appointment of an experienced
administrator; and, (b) the adoption of a satisfactory manual of procedures. There is the
risk that the local research community and the policymakers might not use the services of
GMCVP. This risk is minimized by GMCVP's integration into the permanent structure of
INE, by the high proffle enjoyed by the existing Poverty Monitoring Unit and by continued
advertising and dissemination of its outputs.
41.   The Government of Angola could fail to meet its financial commitments to the
Project. However, Government has declared its political commitment to the project;
furthermore, during project preparation, adequate counterpart funding has been punctually
allocated and disbursed. Quarterly disbursements are up-to-date covering expenditures in
1995. The Project has taken budget constraints and inflation into consideration by (a)
requiring a realistic level of counterpart funding (5 percent of the project total costs); and,
(b) allowing counterpart funds to be disbursed on a quarterly basis.
42.   In summary, although the Project will be operating in a risky environment, it has
been designed to anticipate such risks as can now be foreseen, with additional flexibility
built into the Project design. Other social funds have shown great agility: those
experiences have been adapted to Angolan circumstances through the year-long piloting
period. The annual and mid-term review will allow adjustments to emerging
developments in Angola.
43.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Overall risk: Small. The main risk is increased civil unrest. The FAS has been designed
to operate even in these circumstances. Weak institutional capacity of the GMCVP is the
main risk for the poverty monitoring  component.   The project includes substantial
technical support to address this issue. Furthermore, the existing poverty monitoring unit
has just completed a national survey of size and complexity similar to the ones proposed.
Beneficiaries: Primarily children (43%) and women (33%) living in peri-urban and rural
areas. The Project will provide or improve access to basic services for over 10% of the
Angolan population. By the end of the year 2000, at least 450,000 more children will
have access to (mostly) primary education.
Nature of Benefits: The main benefit will be increased accessibility to health facilities,
schools, and water in rural and peri-urban areas. Those areas have on average lower
incomes than the center of the towns, and much lower access to basic services. The main
beneficiaries of these services are women and children. During the pilot phase, sub-
* Ihese niumbers are early estimates are from the current Education Project. Implementation experience until
now indicates that the actual costs will probably be lower.

project incremental recurrent costs averaged US$0.28 per year per direct beneficiary.
That figure represents around 1/900 of the GNP per capita. These figures consider only
direct beneficiaries, not the whole community. Even in the difficult situation of Angolan
communities, this seems affordable. Other benefits include increased knowledge of the
living conditions of the poor in Angola, allowing improved targeting of poverty reduction
activities, and measurement of the impact of these interventions.
Key Performance Indicators: These will include: (i) number of provinces covered by the
FAS; (ii) number of sub-projects completed; (iii) number of people directly benefiting from
FAS activities; (iv) average investment cost per beneficiary; (v) average incremental costs
per beneficiary per year; (vi) percentage of sub-projects operational after each year; (vii)
implementation of surveys and studies according to schedule; (viii) client satisfaction with
the project.

Disbursement and Audit Issues and Problem Projects
1.    The Bank's portfolio in Angola consists of eight IDA Credits approved in FY91
through FY93. Total commitment amounts to US$245.05 million. Most Credits sbowed
initial implementation delays and slow disbursements, but overall disbursements have
increased fourfold between FY93 and FY95. Cumulative disbursements grew from
US$11.1 million in FY93 to US$ 62.2 million in FY95. In FY95 disbursements were
US$33.9 million, 1.9 times higher than in 1994; the disbursement rate was 14.4 percent,
about the same as the Sub-Saharan Africa average percent.
2.    Disbursement performance has benefited from a decentralized project
implementation environment, intensive training carried out by Bank staff, and IDA-
financed technical assistance and capacity building. The most significant achievement with
respect to disbursement has been the improvement in management and control of special
accounts. Activity on special accounts has increased and replenishments have become
more frequent. It is expected that increased familiarity with Bank procurement and
disbursement procedures will fiuther increase disbursements from special accounts and
prevent liquidity problems that could delay project implementation.
3.    The situation with respect to audits in the Angola portfolio is reasonably good.
Only one project has overdue reports dating back three years. This project has recently
been re-structured and auditing firm proposals are under review.
