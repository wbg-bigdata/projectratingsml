1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Niger is a very poor country struggling to get economic growth to keep pace with
population increase. At appraisal, 61 percent of Niger’s population of 14 million lived on less
than a dollar a day. GDP per capita was US$240 and the high population increase, at 3.4 percent
annually, presented particular challenges to economic development and improvement of living
conditions. The country ranked 174 out of 177 on the 2006 UNDP Human Development Index.

2.      At the time of project design, the urbanization ratio was about 23 percent, but with an
annual urban population increase of 6 percent, uneven urbanization pattern and widespread
poverty and social exclusion. Niamey had more inhabitants (880,000) than the 7 regional capitals
together. Available data suggested that poverty affected 52 percent of the urban population, of
which 26 percent was extremely poor. Slums were estimated to be growing at 5.9 percent per
year. Widespread income disparities contributed to weakening social cohesion in urban areas.
Especially the youth only survived on temporary jobs in the informal sector, creating potential
for increased insecurity. Many areas completely lacked access to basic services. Access rates to
water in urban areas was about 45 percent and 36 percent of urban households had access to
electricity.

3.      Cities generated approximately 45 percent of the country’s GDP and had strong potential
to drive economic growth. The development of a network of small and medium-sized urban
centers could provide local outlets for consumption and processing of agricultural products,
which could in turn slow down population influx to Niamey. This would further support the
development, in secondary cities, of a private sector, which would drive investment, local
development and employment. Secondary cities were missing out on investments needed to
create the enabling environment for increased economic growth, including for the rural
hinterlands.

4.      The first local government elections were held in 2004, but investments were biased
towards rural areas and no effective mechanism for fiscal transfers was in place. External
financing accounted for 70 to 90 percent of all public investments, and public investments in
rural areas were ten times higher than in urban areas, with less than 8 percent of the national
investment budget dedicated to urban infrastructure. Despite the decentralization policy, local
taxes collected by the General Directorate of Tax were not fully or timely transferred to local
governments. The World Bank had funded the Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program
(Projet de Réhabilitation des Infrastructures Urbaines - PRIU, closed March 2003, US$20
million IDA funding) and was by far the largest source of urban investments from 1999 to 2003.

5.     Municipalities’ own contribution to urban investment financing to keep up with high
demands was very limited, as was their technical capacity. Municipalities invested only 0.6
percent of the total national investment budget. A weak fiscal base and low tax collection
capabilities of urban municipalities (with the relative exception of Niamey), combined with low
levels of resources transferred from the central government, meant that urban municipalities’
average per capita spending (investment and maintenance combined) amounted to only US$1.78



                                               1
(US$2.94 in Niamey and US$0.65 in the regional capitals). The limited amount of financing also
had a direct impact on development of technical capacity though learning-by-doing.

Government and Donor Strategy
6.     Because of the magnitude of poverty in rural areas, the government and donors had not
placed much emphasis on reducing urban poverty, but emphasis was shifting. Recent data had
showed that a large proportion of city dwellers were poor and vulnerable and that localized
pockets of extreme poverty had developed in the larger cities. The government had recently
demonstrated its commitment to urban development through a ministerial reshuffling creating a
separate Ministry responsible for Urban Planning and Housing (MUPH, formerly part of the
Ministry of Infrastructure).

7.      The new priorities were captured in the 2004 national urban development strategy. The
major objectives were: (a) improvement of the overall framework for urban management, (b)
improvement of local urban governance, (c) local economic development, and (d) social and
urban integration. The Local Urban Infrastructure Development Project (Projet de
Développement des Infrastructures Locales - PDIL) would support operationalization of the
sector strategy and was in line with the strategic orientations of the country’s second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS, 2008-2012), focusing on: (a) increasing financial resources for
accelerating growth; (b) improving human resources and equity in access to basic services; and
(c) promoting a better development framework.

Rationale for World Bank Response
8.       The PDIL was a natural follow-up to ten years of continuous World Bank involvement in
the urban sector in Niger and in line with emerging priorities. The government requested a strong
focus of World Bank support on growth through infrastructure investment. The PDIL was fully
aligned with the main features of the World Bank’s FY08-11 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Niger, in particular with regard to: (a) improving access to services such as education, health,
water, and sanitation; (b) promoting income generating activities; and (c) strengthening local
development management capacity. The World Bank was well poised to help address limited
institutional and implementation capacity in urban management in combination with an
infrastructure program to improve living conditions in poor urban areas and enhance
sustainability through capacity building.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.      The project development objective was to increase and sustain access of urban residents
to basic infrastructure and services, particularly those living in deprived settlements. The key
indicators were:

    (i)   Additional population in targeted areas benefiting from:
           (a) all-year access to transportation;
           (b) protection against periodic flooding; and
           (c) access to water supply and sanitation services.

   (ii)   Additional financial resources collected from markets and truck terminals in the Urban
          Community of Maradi (CUM) and Dosso.


                                                 2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
     Reasons/Justification
10.     The PDO was not revised, but key indicators and targets were revised twice; first to align
the indicators with new definitions of core indicators and second to adjust targets for beneficiary
population following a restructuring and downscale of the project agreed at the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) and to make minor reallocations. During the MTR restructuring, the indicator on
resources collected from markets and truck terminals was replaced with an indicator on setting in
place effective management systems for these facilities, which was deemed achievable within the
remaining implementation timeframe for the project.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.     The project mainly targeted improved living conditions for low-income communities in
the cities of Niamey, Maradi, and Dosso, with key institutions also benefiting. Local
governments would benefit from capacity building to deliver better services to the inhabitants,
and central government administration (in particular the MUPH) would also be strengthened to
better serve local governments (LGs) through improved oversight and policy setting. Secondary
benefits would accrue to construction companies and works supervisors trained in project
management.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component A: Capacity Building
Appraisal / restructured / actual cost (US$ million): 1.96 / 1.40 / 1.20

12.   The objective of the component was to build and consolidate management capacities for
programming, implementing and managing urban infrastructure and basic services. This would
happen through support to:

 (i)    Local stakeholders in the targeted cities: The Urban Community of Niamey (CUN) and
        the five communes of the city, the Urban Community of Maradi (CUM) and the three
        communes of the city of Maradi, and Dosso (a single LG entity).
(ii)    Selected central governmental institutions active in the areas of urban management, to
        strengthen public stakeholders’ capacity in thematic areas covered by the project
        objectives.
(iii)   The private sector, mostly local contractors and consultant firms involved in project
        implementation and NIGETIP.

Component B: Municipal Investments for Niamey, Maradi and Dosso
Appraisal / restructured / actual cost (US$ million): 20.13 / 18.60 / 18.65

13.      The objective of the component was to increase access to basic services in the targeted
cities, primarily in low-income settlements and to finance infrastructure aimed at boosting local
economic development. The outputs concerned a program of investments for each city, with the
envelope determined based on population and LG revenue (see detailed programming developed
during project preparation in Annex 2):



                                                      3
 (i)    Niamey: (a) upgrading the East-West Road and secondary roads in densely populated
        areas, (b) constructing drainage, (c) constructing and upgrading socio-economic
        infrastructure, and (d) carrying out small infrastructure works to improve living
        conditions in low-income settlements.
(ii)    Maradi: (a) upgrading the central warehouses and infrastructure of the central market
        (Marché Central), (b) constructing a truck terminal, (c) upgrading roads in densely
        populated areas, (d) constructing drainage, and (e) carrying out small infrastructure works
        to improve living conditions in low-income settlements.
(iii)   Dosso: (a) upgrading the central market (Marché Central) and the small market (Petit
        Marché), (b) constructing a truck terminal, (c) constructing and rehabilitating drainage,
        and (d) carrying out small infrastructure works to improve living conditions in low-
        income settlements.

Component C: Support to implementation, monitoring and evaluation
Appraisal / restructured / actual cost (US$ million): 2.16 / 2.07 / 1.69

14.    This component was to finance equipment and operating costs of the National
Coordination Office (Bureau National de Coordination - BNC). The PDIL initially shared
coordinator and fiduciary staff with the World Bank-funded Road Sector Project, approved at
about the same time as the PDIL.
1.6 Revised Components
15.     Due to underperformance, the project was restructured and scaled down following the
MTR in June 2011. Minor adjustments to the investment program had been effected already
shortly after effectiveness to accommodate a Presidential request to reorient the project towards
major investments in roads and drainage (details in Section 2.2). Due to delayed implementation
and very low levels of disbursements, cost overrun, and underperformance of especially
NIGETIP (responsible for implementing 86 percent of the initial investment program), it was
agreed at the MTR to restructure the project and maintain only the investments that were certain
to be finalized within the original project timeframe and reduce the overall project envelope
accordingly. The main investments dropped were (Annex 2 provides details on outputs originally
planned, those dropped after the Presidential request for reorientation and after the restructuring,
and actual investments):

 (i)    Niamey: 8.4 kilometers of secondary roads, 0.6 kilometers of drainage, upgrading of two
        secondary markets, and minor socio-economic infrastructure.
(ii)    Maradi: Construction of a truck terminal, resurfacing of a small road and upgrading a
        municipal building.
(iii)   Dosso: No investments were dropped.


1.7 Other Significant Changes
16.    During implementation the BNC was administratively moved from the PM’s office to the
sector ministry and the CUN and CUM were amalgamated into single LG entities. These two
changes were handled without restructuring the project: (a) the BNC was originally attached to
the Office of the Prime Minister. Following the MTR, it was administratively moved to the
MUPH in February 2011; and (b) the Urban Communities of Niamey and Maradi with their city


                                                      4
mayors and total eight constitutive communes were transformed, by legislative means, into two
cities and the communes became subdivisions (arrondissements). This meant that key staff
previously in charge of the PDIL activities in the communes were reassigned, impacting
especially Niamey, but to a lesser extent Maradi, since the three communes of the CUM had
already delegated project implementation responsibility to the city level.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Preparation
17.     Preparation of the PDIL started in May 2006, in continuation of previous operations and
analytical work. The PRIU had closed in 2003. It was focused on rehabilitation, but had
succeeded in implementing instruments for a sector management policy and had positive impacts
on temporary job creation and local SME development in the construction sector. Economic and
Sector Work (ESW) followed in 2004 to lay the groundwork for a new operation with more
focus on institutional aspects.

18.    Institutional arrangements of the previous operation were carried over and the
beneficiaries were involved in setting investment priorities. The BNC had assured
implementation of the predecessor PRIU and was maintained for the preparation of the new
operation. The time to prepare the project (21 months), was quite long in spite of all the available
documentation. The lengthiness of preparation is principally ascribed to limited capacity of the
BNC to assure timely delivery of project preparatory studies and time taken for the BNC and
NIGETIP to reach common understanding on their roles in project implementation. The city
inhabitants, through local development committees, and local governments were actively
involved in diagnosing the situation and selecting the investment programs.

Design
19.     The overall design built on the recommendations of the 2004 ESW and detailed studies
available for each project city to combine infrastructure investments with capacity building and
improvements to sector governance and financing. The ESW recommended support for well-
balanced urban development through, in particular, the promotion of secondary cities and market
centers that would be likely to stimulate local economic development. The secondary cities of
Maradi and Dosso were selected for the project, as they are regional centers of trade and
commerce. Also, two city development strategies, funded by the Cities Alliance, could serve as
basis for selecting investments in these two cities. For Niamey, a household survey carried out in
2005 under a Norwegian Trust Fund and an Urban Reference Plan funded by the French
Development Agency (AFD) were used to target investments to the poorest neighborhoods.
These investments under Component B were focused on poverty alleviation and employment
generation. They were complemented by targeted capacity building to the cities under
Component A, based on detailed organizational and financial analysis of each city, and which the
cities would use to improve infrastructure maintenance and revenue mobilization. Component A
would also fund studies to improve the overall framework for the urban sector and
intergovernmental fiscal transfers and support the emergence of a market for delegated contract
management. Due to the magnitude of needs and the limited funds available, the project opted
for an incremental approach to service improvements, whereby the PDIL would finance only the


                                                 5
construction or rehabilitation of the essential parts of some major infrastructures, leaving the
option open for service improvements at a later stage, if and when funds became available. The
project would help setting in place efficient management systems for market infrastructure,
which were providing substantially less revenue for the LGs than the potential.

20.     The implementation arrangements were based on mutual and contractual engagements
and designed to support the overall objectives and reinforce capacity in the sector to implement
projects and provide services. The investments and capacity support measures to be provided by
the government and engagements of the cities to improve resource mobilization and maintenance
of infrastructure were formalized through signing of city contracts, already piloted under the
PRIU, and based on highly positive lessons learned in other countries in the Africa Region. A
Project Steering Committee (PSC) was set in place to guide implementation, with participation
of the various concerned ministries, representatives of the private sector and NIGETIP, and the
cities. The BNC was made responsible for overall coordination and directly implemented
Components A and C.

21.     Several implementation options were considered for Component B – LGs, the BNC or
NIGETIP, and the risks carefully weighted. Ideally, the LGs, as works owners, should be
responsible, but given their very limited capacity and experience, they were only made
responsible for investments up to a ceiling (US$250,000 for Niamey and Maradi, US$150,000
for Dosso). NIGETIP, the only delegated contract management agency in the country and
operating since 1991, was retained to implement Component B investments above this ceiling,
and delegated contract management arrangements were signed between each city and NIGETIP.
A study on NIGETIP capacity had presented criticism of the agency’s selection of some
contractors and resulting poor quality of works. However, given the low capacity of the local
government administrations, the only alternative to NIGETIP was to beef up the BNC as a
temporary Project Implementation Unit, which was rejected as it was considered more
productive to include capacity building for NIGETIP in the project, to the benefit of the sector in
the longer term. Targeted modifications were made in the NIGETIP manual of procedures to
take into account identified capacity weaknesses.

Quality at Entry
22.     The overall project concept was based on substantial analysis, including economic
aspects, but detailed technical studies for major investments had not been done by appraisal, and
some other minor flaws are noted. Feasibility studies for all planned investments were completed
during preparation, and included evaluation of expected economic rates of return. A substantial
amount of unallocated resources (16 percent of total funds) was included as physical and price
contingencies, to take into account the weak capacity environment and mixed performance of the
local construction industry. While a reasonable choice was made to have LGs manage detailed
technical design for works under their purview to allow them to benefit from training, the project
could likely have avoided some of the delays encountered if detailed design studies had been
done for all the main investments (roads, markets and truck terminals) before appraisal. It was
also initially foreseen to make use of labor-intensive construction techniques whenever feasible,
as was the case for the PRIU. However, this did not materialize in the actual project design. On
the basis of an overall sound design but considering these shortcomings, the quality at entry is
rated moderately satisfactory.


                                                6
2.2 Implementation
23.     The project encountered significant problems and difficulties due to the socio-political
environment, marked by a coup d’état, change of mayors, cost overruns, and because of the
limited capacity of NIGETIP to assure project implementation. A project restructuring following
the MTR assured that the majority of initially foreseen investments could be completed before
the originally planned project closing date. Details of main implementation events, their impact
on project performance, and resolution of problems follows below.

24.     Immediately following effectiveness, the President of Niger requested the project to focus
more on major structuring investments. In response, activities related to capacity building were
reduced and minor investments removed from the project in order to focus more on structuring
investments (especially roads and drainage), still in line with the overall project concept. These
were in reality minor adjustments, and did not entail a formal restructuring or changes to the
results framework. The funding for Component A was slightly reduced and investments in
neighborhood markets in Niamey, administration buildings and a health center were removed
from Component B. However a lot of energy was spent on reorganizing the project, which
resulted in signing of amendments to city contracts and the delegated contract management
contracts. The freed-up funds were not directly reallocated but kept in reserve to be reallocated
following the MTR.

25.    NIGETIP and local governments had difficulties to implement timely procurement,
which resulted in substantial delays. Shortly after effectiveness, NIGETIP saw the arrival of a
new General Manager and three new project managers, which were not familiar with the project
and with World Bank procedures. Further the Technical Director and Chief Financial Officer
were replaced within the first year of implementation. As a result, procurement processing times
were not acceptable, and the time taken between bid opening and contract award varied between
114 and 145 days. The LGs initially had problems to assure timely procurement, with between
42 and 160 days spent between bid opening and contract award. The World Bank also at times
took long time to provide no-objections, but this was essentially due to the poor quality of
documentation received. The time taken to finalize detailed technical studies and procure works
meant that the first work sites did not open until May 2010, two years after project approval. The
general price hikes brought about by the global 2008 financial crisis was reflected in price
increases for many infrastructures and cost overruns. The large number of small contracts (in
part due to works contracts being sized to allow LGs to manage funds) also did not help on
disbursement rates, with a total of 140 contracts signed under the project.

26.     Other difficulties resulted from the coup d’état in February 2010, following which the
project was implemented under a transitional military government until April 2011. The project
cities had already seen the suspension of mayors due to governance issues prior to the coup
d’état. With the military transition, non-elected administrators were nominated to head the LGs
and all but one LG secretary general were replaced. Municipal councils were renewed after the
return to constitutional order and local government elections in January 2011. Each project city
was under the authority of at least three executives during the project and often key staff would
change with the executive. In fact, in all three cities, only one key technical local government
staff saw the project through from start to end.



                                                7
27.     The MTR was planned in the PAD for June 2010, but could not be held during the
military transition. It was held on June 20-24, 2011, after return to constitutional order and to
allow the participation of the newly elected mayors (taking office in July), which was important
to assure participation and ownership of the restructured project. The combination of lack of
detailed studies, project reorganizing, capacity constraints, and coup d’état combined to limiting
disbursements to only 21 percent at the time of the MTR, after 62 percent of implementation
time. Prior to the MTR, it was considered to close the project, but substantial efforts were being
made to improve the situation, supported by four implementation support missions. By the MTR,
51 percent of project funds were committed and disbursement was realistically expected to
increase rapidly. Since LGs had relatively few activities to implement, investments under their
responsibility were well under way by the time of the MTR, and the average procurement time
was down to 50 days. As the situation was set to improve, it was decided to continue the project,
but require a restructuring and dropping all activities that could not be implemented by the
original project closing date and to require additional efforts by all parties to assure project
success.

28.     Following the MTR the project was scaled down, NIGETIP and the BNC were reinforced,
and support to the private sector was focused on works organization and implementation, the
most pressing issue, but contractors continued to show weaknesses. The dropping of investments
that could not be completed meant reducing the project envelope by US$6.3 million, which was
reserved for other projects in Niger. To improve project performance, the shared management
responsibilities for the World Bank-funded Road Sector Project and the PDIL were split, to
allow two separate coordinators to focus more on critical aspects of each project. Also, the
position of infrastructure specialist was split into three, with two full-time staff responsible
respectively for technical assistance to LGs and project M&E and a part-time staff dedicated to
safeguards. The two projects continued, however, to share fiduciary staff. Two engineers were
recruited by NIGETIP dedicated to supervise implementation of the works on the East-West
Road and Maradi Marché Central, the two most substantial contracts, which did not start until
after the MTR. The changes were formalized through the restructuring on December 28, 2011.

29.     The MTR and subsequent restructuring effectively provided momentum to the project,
with efforts made by all parties to adhere to the new implementation plan. However, as
construction activities picked up, additional challenges were posed by contractors, who had
presented adequate references in the bids, but in reality had very limited technical and financial
capacity to implement works, with absence of required technical staff and equipment, disrespect
of planning, and inability to supply sites timely. This meant that works execution delays were
often doubled compared to contractual dates. Works supervisors also lacked experience and
thoroughness in works supervision. As a result, the main infrastructures (East-West Road and
Maradi Marché Central) continued to experience implementation delays, but close supervision
and last-minute efforts assured that they were received before the project closed.

30.     Institutional changes to the organization of local governments meant further difficulties
to implement the project. Niamey and Maradi experienced institutional changes due to the
transformation, in June 2011, of the CUN and CUM into single local government entities with
administrative subdivisions (arrondissements). This resulted in reassignment of key personnel
that had already been trained, which could not be foreseen at the MTR. Due to budget constraints



                                                8
of the restructured project no new training could be programmed and the BNC stepped in and
scaled up their support to the city administrations.

31.     The project closed with the restructured program of works completed and strategic
recommendations for the future of the sector available. The only infrastructure which is not
operational is the Marché Central in Maradi, for which the PDIL funded, as foreseen, a
renovation of the central warehouses as well as improvement of the market infrastructure. The
government has allocated funds for the construction of the enclosing shops, which were not part
of the original PDIL design; this work is set to commence shortly. As problems related to works
took a lot of time and not least efforts to resolve, focus was on completing infrastructures.
Market and parking facilities were finalized only just before project closing, but the LGs have
taken steps to nominate managers (provisional management in Maradi, while construction is
completed) with a mandate to assure the expected management systems will become fully
operational.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design
32.     The PDO indicators in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) focused on the additional
population benefiting from infrastructure, coupled with an indicator on additional fees collected
from markets and truck terminals to measure the additional revenues raised to help sustain this
access. The intermediate indicators on budget ratios for maintenance further provided good
measures of the effort to allocate funds to maintain infrastructure, and the actual maintenance
was monitored. The M&E framework did not contain specific indicators designed to monitor the
part of the PDO related to targeting urban residents living in deprived settlements. This was not a
real shortcoming, however, as the process of selection of works had already focused on deprived
settlements, based on prior studies. The collection method was based on reporting by LGs, to be
aggregated by the infrastructure specialist, also in charge of the M&E function.

Implementation
33.     Initial M&E reporting was inadequate and it took until well into the project for the BNC
to establish an actual M&E methodology. The local governments were also not used to collect
and report regularly on M&E data, and took some time to fully develop this ability, which was
complicated by the several changes in local government executives. M&E data collection,
consolidation and evaluation by the BNC improved after the MTR, when a specialist dedicated
to the M&E function was recruited. However, data continued to be of mixed quality and
quarterly reports did not contain analytically based recommendations to improve project
performance. Also, the project M&E did not pick up on cost overruns. The results framework
was revised following the MTR, to suit it better to the restructured project and place more focus
on results that could realistically be achieved within the original project timeframe. Also, new
city contracts were signed with the new city authorities in December 2011, which resulted in
difficulties to adequately monitor the priority maintenance programs (since several budgets were
merged into one).




                                                9
Utilization
34.     The M&E framework was used to make minor adjustments to project implementation,
but could have been used more actively to flag cost overruns and analyze linkages between
budget ratios and implementation of maintenance activities.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards compliance
35.     Despite difficulties faced by the project during implementation to respect safeguards
instruments, all issues had been resolved by project closing. The project was rated category B as
no major environmental impacts were identified and triggered the safeguard policies on
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12). The project was
generally implemented in compliance with safeguards policies, but in several cases did works
start with sites still occupied by affected persons, or compensation of affected persons was not
assured before commencement of works. A safeguards focal point was nominated in each LG,
but did not contribute substantially to monitoring safeguards. Further, a convention had been
signed at the beginning of the project with the National Environmental Agency to monitor
environmental aspects, but this was only made effective after the MTR, with two rounds of site
visits carried out. The Bank Task Team worked actively with the BNC and LGs to resolve these
problems as soon as they transpired and following the MTR, the BNC recruited a part-time
consultant to supervise safeguards implementation. At the time of finalizing this ICR, all issues
raised during project implementation support missions and in technical audit reports have been
fully resolved and proof of adequate compensation of all project affected persons has been
provided to the World Bank. A total of 2,712 persons were affected by the project, the vast
majority being traders (2,586) affected by the temporary and voluntary relocation of the Marché
Central in Maradi.

Fiduciary compliance
36.     The Bank’s fiduciary safeguards have been complied with. In general, financial
management arrangements have been rated Satisfactory and post procurement reviews did not
reveal irregularities. Audited financial statements have been submitted timely, the external
auditors expressed unqualified audit opinions and management letters did not include significant
observations. There were no overdue external audit reports and IFRs at the time of the project
closing date. Two IFRs were submitted with delay due to the temporary vacancy of the FM
position in the BNC. Post procurement reviews did not reveal any cases of misprocurement or
non-compliance. A technical audit carried out in January 2013 confirmed that procurement
methods and thresholds in the delegated contract management agreements have been respected.
NIGETIP experienced serious problems to assure timely procurement; this is discussed in section
5.2 on Borrower Performance. Two technical audits were carried out: the first informed the
project restructuring and the second was undertaken some time before project closing. They
raised problems of organization of construction sites but did not reveal any problems of quality
of works.

37.     The award process of the paving blocks contract for road works in Niamey Commune V
led to a complaint before the national procurement regulatory body, which eventually concluded
on no evidence of mismanagement of the process. This was consolidated by a no objection
received from the General Directorate of Public Procurement Control as the process was Bank


                                               10
post-review. Despite these positive outcomes from the main bodies in charge of procurement
regulation and control in the country, a World Bank mission observed a persistent climate of
suspicion among the main administrative players and then eventually recommended the
undertaking of a technical review study to assess the quality of as well the documentation used as
the award processing. A technical review mission did not find evidence of fraud or corruption.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38.     All infrastructures are operational, with the exception of the Maradi Marché Central.
Some minor works (cabling, transformer stations, connecting fire hydrants to the water network)
for the market and parking facilities in Dosso and a health center in Niamey were assured by the
beneficiary LGs after the project closed, testifying to the ownership of the facilities. Further, the
city of Dosso has decided to construct lodging for the truck drivers at the truck terminal,
increasing the economic potential of the investment and providing better services for the users.

39.     The process to construct the remaining shops to serve as enclosing for the rehabilitated
Maradi Marché Central is ongoing. In the initial PDIL design, the project would finance the
central warehouses and improved infrastructure. However, after the military transition the new
government decided to finance the construction of the shops for about US$6 million. At the time
of finalizing the ICR, the contracts had been signed and construction was set to begin in July
2013.

40.    The government is implementing the recommendations from two key studies. (a) The
decrees on the setting in place of a framework for creating a competitive market for delegated
contract management are in the process of being adopted. However, the market is very limited
and since the experience of the LGs means they are likely unwilling to use the services of
NIGETIP in the going forward, the future of delegated contract management arrangements in
general and NIGETIP in particular is unclear in the absence of a strategy to develop the market.
(b) On a framework for the urban sector and fiscal transfer mechanism. The government has
nominated the Director of the agency charged with managing fiscal transfers and incorporated
implementation of the recommendations of the study (which include revision of the legal and
regulatory framework of the urban sector, operationalization of urban management tools, local
economic management) in its 2012-2015 PRS.

41.    Preparation of a follow-up operation (Disaster Risk Management and Urban
Development Project, US$100 million IDA funding) is ongoing and will build on the
achievements of the PDIL, drawing on the urban management tools developed under the project.
This operation will include activities to solidify the culture of maintenance instilled by the PDIL
and will make use of the drainage master plans financed by the PDIL.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

Objectives
42.    The objectives of the PDIL remain relevant, in spite of changes to context and
shortcomings in implementation, which ultimately led to the project being restructured to assure


                                                 11
continued relevance and adequacy of indicators. The urbanization ratio continues to increase – it
is estimated at about 28 percent in 2013 and projected to reach 43 percent in 2030, necessitating
the vulgarization of the urban management tools provided by the PDIL. An estimated 80 percent
of city populations live in slum; in spite of this, the cities continue to provide opportunities for
the rural population, and rural-urban migration remains high. The urban context continues to be
marked by numerous under-serviced neighborhoods, significant lack of infrastructure and the
need to develop capacity at the decentralized level to support economic growth and poverty
reduction. There is also still a need to develop the economic potential of secondary cities to
counterbalance the attractiveness of Niamey. Regarding the FY13-16 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), the World Bank will continue to be involved in the urban sector, with an
indicative allocation of US$100 million for an operation to be approved in FY14. The culture of
maintenance, which the PDIL has helped instill through a mix of infrastructure investments and
accompanying capacity building measures, supports the focus of the CPS on an integrated
approach to building resilience of communities by improving urban and land-use planning. One
of the longer term outcomes of the PDIL is more sustainable urban development as well as
competitive and productive cities, specifically recognized under Pillar One of the World Bank
Africa Strategy as a key driver of wealth and jobs going forward for Africa. The government’s
2012-2015 PRS foresees operationalization of outcomes of the strategic studies, specifically
implementation of the framework for the urban sector and the mechanism for fiscal transfers.

Design
43.     There were moderate design shortcomings, and the project was implemented under very
difficult circumstances. The changes made at the MTR contributed to assuring relevance against
the development priorities and prevailing circumstances. This was achieved by restructuring the
project and removing the activities which could not be implemented, thereby freeing up funds
and reducing the workload on implementing agencies to enable finalization of retained
investments in the best possible conditions. The choice made at appraisal to opt for gradual
improvements to the level of service offered by infrastructures financed by the project proved
correct, as testified by the construction of lodging for truck drivers at the Dosso truck terminal
and new shops for the Maradi Marché Central. The project has thus leveraged additional funds
for continued service improvements. The use of NIGETIP as implementing agency for
Component B was justified by the evaluation of alternatives. In spite of the implementation
difficulties encountered by NIGETIP, the actual performance of LGs and the BNC during
implementation shows that the alternatives would not necessarily have been better. Further,
NIGETIP is now strengthened and with the ongoing liberalization of delegated contract
management in Niger, is the first player in a new market.

44.     The restructuring provided the necessary adjustments and momentum to the project,
through refocusing the project on the most rewarding and realistic investments, requiring
provision of additional staff by NIGETIP and the BNC and assuring increased attention to the
project by the government. The timing of the restructuring contributed to assuring continued
ownership on the part of LG councils, following the LG elections in 2011. The PDO and
components were not changed and remained relevant throughout. The restructuring was further
adequate judged by the disbursement of 99 percent of the restructured project amount (in SDR
terms).



                                                12
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
45.      The project development objective was to increase and sustain access of urban residents
to basic infrastructure and services, particularly those living in deprived settlements. The PDO
did not change, but one PDO indicator was revised during the project restructuring and targets
for other PDO indicators were adjusted. For this reason a split evaluation of achievement of PDO
is carried out based on: (i) the results achieved against the PDO indicators and targets at the time
of restructuring and (ii) the results achieved against the PDO indicators and targets at the end of
the project. For both parts of the split evaluation, it is considered that investments targeted
deprived settlements, since the project was designed and investments selected based on studies
that had shown which settlements were the most deprived.

Original PDO Efficacy Rating: Low to Modest

46.     PDO indicators 1 to 4 in the datasheet measure access to services and infrastructure and
remained for the duration of the project, but targets were formally revised during the project
restructuring. Targets for access to roads and drainage were in fact revised upwards during the
restructuring, in spite of the reduction in scope of works. This was due to a change in
methodology to correspond to the definition of World Bank core project indicators. The targets
for access to water and sanitation were revised to correspond to the revised program of works.
The original PDO indicator 5 measured additional fees collected from market places and truck
terminals by municipalities. The achievement of these indicators, at the time of the restructuring
and against the original target values, is presented in the table below.

Table 1: Achievement of original key indicators

2. People with access to improved drainage 5,650           3,125 – 55%. (ISR#7 states 6,250, but this is for

47.      As can be seen from the above, the original target for access to water was almost met,
targets for access to drainage and sanitation were more than 50 percent met, collection of fees
from markets was not substantially progressing while access to roads was far behind target. The
latter were the main reasons for restructuring the project. The disbursement rate was 39 percent.
The PDO part on access to services was progressing unevenly, but the revenue collection,
destined to sustain access to basic infrastructure and services, was not progressing. Overall
progress towards achieving PDO was low to modest as measured against the original PDO
indicators and targets.

Revised PDO Efficacy Rating: Substantial to High

48.     The achievement of the PDO, evaluated against the revised PDO indicators and targets in
the datasheet, is rated Substantial to High. The PDO part on access to services was fully achieved
as measured by the restructured PDO indicators 1 to 4 in the datasheet. The setting in place of
effective management systems for markets and the truck terminal (PDO indicator 5), intended to
improve revenue generation, was only partially achieved, but progressing well at project closing
and is a minor shortcoming, given that LGs are actively setting in place these management
systems as foreseen, following completion of construction. According to the feasibility studies
the potential annual revenue to LGs from the rehabilitated markets and truck terminal, with
effective management systems, is over US$1 million.

49.     The positive evaluation of outcome is supported by the intermediate outcome indicators
in the datasheet, which show that the LGs learned to program investments and maintain
infrastructure during the project, contributing to sustaining access of urban residents to basic
infrastructure and services. Although the percentage of annual budget actual expenditure on
routine maintenance did not achieve the target (intermediate outcome indicator 2), the underlying
budget numbers improved, from total combined municipal revenue of US$4.2 million in 2006 to
US$29.5 million in 2012. This lead to substantially higher budget allocations and actual
expenditure for maintenance (up from US$235,503 in 2006 to US$1,612,225 in 2012) and more
maintenance being carried out compared to expectations. A combined total of 496.8 kilometers
of drainage and roads networks received maintenance during the last year of the project, against
a combined target value of 155 kilometers. While the improvements in underlying budget
numbers are not fully attributable to the PDIL 2 , the effort to improve programming and
implementation of maintenance is. The first exercise was very problematic, but by 2010, due to
the training and technical assistance provided by the project, the LGs had got a grip on the
process and there was a strong link between programming, budgeting and actual implementation.
Overall, in spite of an extremely challenging implementation environment, the project has
managed to set in place key building blocks for improved municipal management by LGs and
MUPH, laying the groundwork for continued improvements to the overall local government
system. At the end of the project the LGs are maintaining infrastructure much better than before
the project and better able to sustain access of urban residents to infrastructure and services.


2
  The PDIL financed training for all LGs and accounting software for Dosso, but a major factor behind the improved
LG revenues was support from the AFD to the city of Niamey in the form of a local tax manual and support to its
implementation.



                                                       14
50.     The upgrading of the East-West Road (11.56 kilometers) had significant benefits for the
52,737 beneficiaries. According to the project impact evaluation conducted by the BNC, it
reduced the distance to public transport for the beneficiary population in the densely populated
neighborhoods on the Northern fringe of the city from 1,000 to 400 meters and serves 13 schools,
a main livestock market and two neighborhood markets, and a main mosque. It further offers an
alternative to another main road (Mali Béro) which is particularly congested during peak hours.
The economic benefits to the population are also substantial. The impact evaluation estimates
that land value has doubled along the road, that 164 new shops have been created along the road
and that in the area of 500 to 900 additional full-time jobs have been created.

51.    Access to water and sanitation in poor neighborhoods increased, and infrastructures
generate revenues to LGs, further contributing to sustaining services. A total of 6,727 people
gained access to water and sanitation through the project through the construction of water
kiosks and public latrines (which also contain shower facilities). According to the impact
evaluation, this has reduced the price of water for beneficiaries. The project has also assured
additional revenue to Dosso and Maradi from latrines, since they receive a monthly fee from
operators of these facilities. Maradi has also introduced payment from water kiosks at a
manageable level for operators.

52.    Construction of health centers in poor neighborhoods benefited about 30,000 people,
according to the impact study. The construction of the Lossogoungou health center reduced
distance to the nearest health facility by at least 3 kilometers for the 11,000 inhabitants of the
Western part of Niamey I commune. The Dar Es Salam health center reduced distance to a health
services by at least 1 kilometer for the 19,000 inhabitants of the Northern part of Niamey II
commune.

53.     School infrastructures and schooling conditions were improved significantly through
construction of classroom, latrines, and school enclosures. The construction of 86 classrooms
benefits 3,440 pupils who previously received teaching in straw huts. 19,210 pupils benefited
from construction of latrines in the targeted schools. Enclosing was constructed around 13
schools, of which 2 along the East-West Road, which means that, according to headmasters,
pupils are safer, parents are more likely to send girls to school, and vegetable gardening has
started in several schools, without risk of destruction by stray animals, and has been integrated
into teaching.

54.     Other benefits include an increased number of improved market stands and improved
waste removal. The Marché Central in Maradi will increase the number of stands from 1,900 to
3,600 and the upgraded Petit Marché in Dosso will also increase the number of stands, so that a
total of 3,924 new or improved stands will be constructed by the project (including the 40
parking places in Dosso). Finally, the provision of 15 solid waste containers to Niamey has
increased the capacity to remove waste by 25 tons per month.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial




                                               15
55.     Ex-ante economic analysis suggested good economic rates of return on investments,
which is confirmed by analysis carried out for the ICR. The economic justification in the PAD
was based on the quantifiable benefits and ex-ante economic analysis was carried out on the
main investments (East-West Road in Niamey, a sample of secondary roads in all cities, markets
and truck terminals in Maradi and Dosso). The analysis covered US$8.66 million of investments,
which was found to have IRRs ranging from 17 to 42 percent and total NPV of US$31.64 million.
For the ICR, the economic analysis is updated for the investments initially analyzed and actually
implemented, based on actual figures. The updated economic analysis confirms the economic
justification of the initially analyzed program of investments, with IRRs of 10 to 57 percent and
NPV of US$27,512,227 for investments of US$11,375,767 (corresponding to 61 percent of all
investments). This is based on conservative estimates and without quantifying benefits from
increased economic activity in the markets and truck terminal. Disbursement of 99 percent of the
restructured project amount is also indicative of implementation efficiency. The full justification
of the efficiency rating can be found in Annex 3, including details on assumptions.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

56.     The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The outcome rating against the
original PDO indicators is moderately unsatisfactory, which is a result of the combined
evaluation of substantial relevance, low to modest efficacy and substantial efficiency. Against
the revised PDO indicators, the project outcome is rated satisfactory as a result of substantial
relevance, substantial to high efficacy, and substantial efficiency. The table below provides the
weighted average of outcome ratings against the proportion of funds disbursed before and after the
restructuring.

57.     The rating is further justified by the satisfactory achievement of the PDO at the end of
the project, to which the highly relevant restructuring contributed. The PDO was relevant at the

the ICR. The restructured project achieved most PDO indicator targets, and the indicators most
relevant to measure the ability to sustain improvements are either fully achieved or in the process
of being achieved (actual maintenance was greatly surpassed and efficient management systems
are in the process of being implemented), proving that a culture of maintenance is taking hold.
These results were achieved in spite of the project being implemented in extremely challenging
circumstances, due to the coup d’état, changes of ministers and mayors, reorganization of city
institutions, and reassignment of key staff at all levels. Timing and content of the restructuring
was opportune. The economic analysis demonstrates overall substantial economic benefits of the
project.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
58.    There was a communication deficit on the part of LGs, which resulted in limited
ownership of project investments by the beneficiaries. A lack of good quality M&E data also
made it difficult for the BNC to communicate adequately with the LGs, and the beneficiaries
were not sufficiently involved in implementation.

59.    The project targeted investments in the areas showed by the city development strategies
and household survey to be the poorest areas. However, the dropping of the road investments in
Niamey Commune V was unfortunate, as the local populations were expecting these investments
and had already voluntarily relocated temporarily, but also unavoidable given cost overruns and
long process to treat the complaints regarding the procurement of paving blocks.

60.      All market infrastructures rehabilitated by the project are now equipped with fire
hydrants, a substantial safety improvement as urban markets in Niger have previously been prone
to fires.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
61.     The project focused on improving management capacity in LGs, and learning by doing
allowed the project LGs to develop ability to implement investments.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
62.    There were no other unintended outcomes.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
63.   Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

64.     The risk that improvements to local governance and accountability achieved by the PDIL
will not be maintained is rated Significant. Overall, it is likely that project outputs will continue
to provide benefits in the project LGs, which have demonstrated clear ownership of investments
and improved capacity to plan and implement maintenance. Implementation of the
recommendations from the institutional study is only beginning, and will necessitate changes to
the overall LG system, which can create resistance. A follow-on operation is in the pipeline for
Bank financing, which can potentially lessen risks, but given the prevailing context with overall


                                                 17
weak capacity in the government apparatus and recent history of political instability, a
“significant? risk rating is justified.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     The Bank’s main contribution through the lending phase consisted in developing the
overall concept and focusing investments in line with sector priorities, making use of existing
studies and ESW, and also proposing implementation arrangements most likely to mitigate
identified capacity constraints. The Bank should have assured that detailed design studies had
been done for major investments prior to appraisal, but costs were estimated based on feasibility
studies. It could not be foreseen that the 2008 financial crisis would result in cost increase
throughout the region.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

66.    The Bank was actively supervising the project throughout, and was instrumental in
overcoming the main project difficulties relating to changes in central and local government.
Missions were regular. A total of 14 implementation support missions were carried out, of which
seven to support the continued advancement of project activities during the military transition
period from February 2010 to April 2011 and four alone to assist in preparing and participating
to the MTR. The Bank actively pushed the government to make all infrastructures operational
and continually followed up with the BNC to make sure management systems would be in place
for the market and parking facilities. The Bank also worked with the government to find
resources to commence construction of the Maradi market, following the decision to have the
shops financed by the government.

67.     The Bank could have downgraded project ratings earlier in ISRs to improve realism, but
in the end the restructuring was carried out as soon as possible following the end of military
transition and considering the timing of inauguration of newly elected mayors. The Bank
repeatedly drew the attention of the government to the need to assure adequate follow-up to the
two key studies on delegated contract management and sector framework and transfer
mechanism. In the extremely difficult implementation circumstances and with the
underperformance of especially NIGETIP, the Bank could not realistically have contributed
more to assuring project results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The shortcomings at appraisal notwithstanding, the Bank did consistently provide an
adequate level of implementation support and assisted the client to carry out a restructuring that
could realistically be implemented given the time allowed. The MS rating at appraisal and S
rating for implementation combine into an overall Bank performance rating of MS.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.     Rating government performance poses several difficulties due to the fact that the
constitution was suspended during the coup d’état. The project was therefore implemented
within a very difficult environment. The request from the President to reorient the project right
after effectiveness shows limited coordination between the executive and the government during
project preparation and limited government involvement in project design.

70.     The Project Steering Committee did not adequately fulfill its role to regularly follow up
on activities and take necessary steps to correct underperformance of the project. The PSC met
regularly, but participation of the key members was irregular. In the beginning the mayors of
Niamey were often absent, while throughout the project, the secretary general of the LG
oversight ministry did not participate.

71.     Following the transfer of the project oversight from the Prime Minister’s office to the
MUPH, the latter did not fully respect the Project Implementation Manual and interference in in
the management of investments in Niamey V was the reason for dropping these investments. The
oversight ministry did participate actively in all project missions following the MTR, but the
government was not able to make substantial progress on implementing recommendations from
key studies before the project closed, although this is happening post-completion. Overall, the
government performance was moderately unsatisfactory during preparation, unsatisfactory to
moderately unsatisfactory until the MTR and moderately satisfactory following the MTR,
justifying an overall MU rating.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

72.    The ICR rates the performance of BNC, NIGETIP, and LGs separately.

The BNC
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     The BNC had mixed performance during preparation and implementation. To start off
with, project preparatory studies were not delivered on time, which led to a lengthy preparation
period. During implementation, the activities implemented directly by the BNC (Components A
and C) were all completed and the BNC scaled up support to LGs when new, untrained staff
arrived. However, the BNC did not fully fulfill its role as coordinating entity and did not react
timely to cost overruns and had shortcomings on M&E and follow-up on safeguards issues,
including the involvement of the National Environment Agency. Another shortcoming relates to
timely follow-up on implementation of management systems for market and parking facilities.
The fact that the project actually ended up being implemented, in spite of the challenging
environment, is in large part due to the BNC, which improved performance following the MTR
and actively supervised the performance of NIGETIP. Although the performance is mixed, the



                                               19
improved performance of the BNC following the MTR, with a coordinator dedicated to the PDIL,
justifies a rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

NIGETIP
Rating: Unsatisfactory

74.     The performance of NIGETIP was unsatisfactory, as the agency was the primary reason
for implementation delays, leading to restructuring and downscaling of the project and did not
communicate well with its clients. During implementation, the BNC often had to provide
additional support to NIGETIP, although this agency was hired to fully handle procurement and
contract management for a large part of the investment program, and received payment to that
effect. NIGETIP was given the responsibility to conduct activities aimed at strengthening the
private sector. However, as the project evolved, focus was rather placed on strengthening
capacity of NIGETIP. The LGs expressed a high level of dissatisfaction with their collaboration
with NIGETIP, as they did not feel properly informed of project advancement, in spite of being
the client of NIGETIP, which further allowed revisions to contract amounts, exceeding the
available envelopes without consulting the client (the LGs). This is an essential reason for the
cost overruns and reduction in the activities implemented. NIGETIP was regularly requested to
improve communication with both the BNC and local governments, but communication only
improved towards the BNC. The operating cost of NIGETIP was 5 percent of investments, a
standard level of payment for delegated contract management. However, the service delivered
was substantially below what was to be expected, although improving towards the end of the
project.

Local Governments
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The LGs also had mixed performance during preparation and implementation, partially
explained by the context. The city authorities were actively involved in project preparation, but
had difficulties to implement the parts of Component B under their responsibility, with long
procurement delays. This is partly explained by the lack of prior knowledge of this type of
activity and the changes to context, which was out of the hands of the LG authorities. The cities
did make substantial efforts to live up to engagements in the city contracts, and did allocate a
substantial amount of resources for maintenance activities leading to the actual maintenance on
the ground surpassed what was foreseen. However, the LGs did not assure that focal points for
monitoring social safeguards were playing their prescribed role.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76.     Both the government and implementing agencies experienced challenges that impaired
their performance during preparation and implementation, placing the project at risk for extended
periods of time. The government has not yet implemented key recommendations, the BNC only
substantially improved performance following the MTR, NIGETIP substantially underperformed
throughout the project, which was the main reason for the restructuring, and the LGs had mixed
performance, justifying an overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

77.     Projects in Niger need a strategic, robust, and multifaceted approach to training and
capacity building. The project showed that in spite of identification of capacity gaps in the BNC,
LGs, NIGETIP, and the construction industry in general, and inclusion of substantial capacity
building activities, the starting point is very low and the project was vulnerable to institutional
and organizational changes. For this reason, training and capacity building should be provided
for all project stakeholders, designed to start during project preparation and continue throughout
the implementation period in anticipation of elections, institutional changes, and staff turnover.
Effectiveness could be further enhanced by developing demand through providing performance
incentives for the various stakeholders to make adequate use of the training provided.

78.     The link between the operation and the project context determines how far reforms can
be pushed; care should be taken not to lose momentum. Any support to reforms should be based
on a thorough analysis of the country’s political economy. Institutional changes take time, and
MUPH will need further support to be able to fully drive sector reforms – future projects need to
reflect on the use of national procedures and existing capacities in central and local government
to support this objective. Care should be taken to avoid that the time-gap between operations
necessary to analyze results and design the follow-on does not result in loss of momentum
gained, leaving the sector without support in the meantime.

79.     Delegated contract management has the potential to mitigate capacity shortcomings in
project implementation, but the approach needs to be institutionalized and scaled up to succeed.
In other countries in the region, central and local governments alike freely make use of delegated
contract management in areas where they do not have expertise. In Niger, the government is
poised to adopt the regulatory framework for delegated contract management, which will open
up the market to new service providers and free competition. However, the regulatory framework
alone will not do the job, since the reputation of delegated contract management is in tatters in
Niger, after the performance of NIGETIP, and the market will only materialize through a
coordinated approach between the government and donors to create the market, and which
should also in parallel consider developing a market for support to works owners.

80.     The contractual approach to results through city contracts is useful but its full potential
as a tool for public participation and accountability of local governments should be developed.
A recommendation was made already during the first project mission to implement real
consultative forums at the neighborhood or city level to facilitate more direct and ongoing
involvement of the population in setting investment priorities, participate in operation and
maintenance and monitor local government performance. This recommendation should have
been followed up, and could potentially have meant stronger pressure on LGs to assure timely
implementation of efficient management systems for markets and truck terminals and would
have facilitated involvement of beneficiary populations during the process of restructuring the
project. The links between the city contracts and the envisaged fiscal transfer mechanism need to
be explored and clarified.

81.     Attention needs to be paid up-front to M&E aspects and early warning systems. M&E
was a relatively new concept to most project participants, and no local expertise exists. Therefore
training, systems support and adequate human and financial resources need to be assured to link

monitoring of progress of works, safeguards implementation, disbursements, achievement of
indicators, implementation of recommendations and action plans, and sustainability of results.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
82.     The draft ICR, translated into French, was shared with the Borrower twice for comments.
Overall, the Borrower found the tone of the initial draft to be too negative. The comments were
incorporated. Borrower’s substantial comments on the advanced draft concerned details on the
process surrounding the reconstruction of the Maradi Marché Central, commissioning of
infrastructures, communication between the BNC and NIGETIP, and involvement of
beneficiaries. These comments have been incorporated in the final draft, as detailed in Annex 7.

(b) Cofinanciers/Donors
83.    There were no cofinanciers.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)
84.    There were no other partners or stakeholders.

            o Procurement: Recruitment of a consultant to develop a simplified procurement
                manual.
            o Solid waste management: Study on evaluation of existing practices and
                improvement plan for each city.
            o Management of income-generating facilities: Study on evaluation of existing
                practices and development of terms of reference for improved management
                system.
            o Infrastructure Maintenance programs: Consultant to help local governments
                identify PMPs for 2009 and 2010, linking programmed activities to the budgets
                for the first time.
            o Maradi Market: Support to help the LG find investors for the remaining and
                necessary construction, which was not included in the PDIL and setting in place a
                management agent.
        Training:
            o Project management: 5 modules dispensed in 2009 and 2010 for about 100 LG
                employees.
            o Financial management: 2 sessions in 2010 and 2011 on budget preparation and
                execution for 55 key LG staff.
            o Procurement: 1 session in 2010 for 20 directors of LG technical departments and
                procurement staff.
            o Procurement: 1 session for 10 NIGETIP staff in 2010.
            o Contract management: 1 session in 2011 for 13 directors of LG technical
                departments and NIGETIP staff.
            o IT: 1 session in 2012-2013 for 20 MUPH staff on use of technical software
                (AUTOCAD, ARCHICAD, ARCGIS).
            o Study tour in 2010 to Benin and Togo for 10 representatives of LGs, ministerial
                staff, and the BNC to learn about public participation in project implementation.
        Equipment:
            o Complete computer equipment to all project LG technical departments.
            o Internal network for Dosso.
            o Provision of 15 solid waste containers for Niamey for the East-West Road.


                                                24
  (ii)      Central and deconcentrated ministries:
         Drainage master plans for Maradi and Dosso.
         Finalization of urban reference plan for Dosso.
         Study on the legal framework for delegated project management: law and decrees of
          application. After submission to the parliament, it was found that a law was not needed
          and that the government could adopt the proposed measures through sector regulation.
          This adoption is pending.
         Study on a national framework for the urban sector and fiscal transfer mechanism. The
          framework is foreseen implemented as part of the 2012-2015 PRS.
         Urban management tools: development of a manual on urban, organizational, and
          financial audits, urban reference plans and city contracts, available in 500 examples. The
          vulgarization should have happened before project closing but the TORs were not
          prepared on time by the MUPH.
         IT and software:
              o Basic IT kit to the five ministerial departments involved in project
                 implementation.
              o MUPH: full IT kit (15 computes, 2 photocopiers, video projector, small
                 equipment and technical software), internal network and development of a
                 website to improve visibility of the ministry.

     (iii) Private sector:
        Recruitment in 2012 of two consultants to supervise the contractors and consultants
          executing works in Niamey and Maradi. The activity was originally planned to be
          broader support to the private sector (see below, for the planned but not implemented
          activity).

3.        Activities that were dropped at the MTR restructuring and were not implemented are:

         Follow-up missions to implement recommendations from the solid waste management
          study – not implemented due to funding constraints.
         Series of training on bidding practices (price calculation), works site organization, works
          supervision, and socio-environmental aspects – not implemented due to non-performance
          of the consultant recruited.

Component B: Municipal investments in Niamey, Maradi and Dosso

Appraisal cost: US$20.13 million. Percentage of appraisal cost: 67.1%.
Restructured cost: US$18.60 million. Percentage of restructured cost: 78.5%.
Actual cost: US$18.69 million. Percentage of actual total project cost: 82.7%.

4.   All infrastructures retained at the project restructuring were completed at project closing.
Component outputs are as follows:

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic analysis carried out for the ICR follows the methodology presented in the
PAD and used at appraisal to evaluate cost and benefit for part of the initially planned program
of investments.

Economic justification
2.     Most of the investments (road networks for access to poor districts, drainage works,
construction of classrooms, health facilities, etc.) in the project provide non-quantifiable
economic benefits, comprising social and environmental gains expected in the targeted cities.
Investments provided the following quantifiable and non-quantifiable socioeconomic gains:

       Strengthened capacity of local governments to provide services within their mandate.
       Job creation and promotion of private sector participation in service provision.
       Service to isolated poor districts.
       Increased revenues for the communities through increased revenue from market and
        parking facilities.
       Reduction in vehicle maintenance and transport costs, owing to improved road conditions
        and shorter distances to public transport services.
       Improved quality of life in the targeted areas, as a result of better living conditions.
       Development of activities in areas currently without service.
       Improvement in health and household incomes, owing to the reduction in waterborne
        diseases and health costs.
       Reduction in income spent on water due to construction of water kiosks.

3.     Given the disparity among the interventions for the three cities, reflecting the differences
in conditions related to access to services and their physical characteristics, the overall ERR and
the overall NPV was not calculated at appraisal and is not calculated for the ICR.

Roads

4.      The economic analysis of the urban road networks was conducted at appraisal and for the
ICR using the HDM-IV model. This model reflects road conditions, represented essentially by
deterioration indicators (the most important being road roughness) on vehicle consumption and
operating conditions (change in annual number of kilometers). This produces a calculation of the
vehicle operating cost on the section of the road studied, along with its condition indicators. The
International Roughness Index (IRI) values used at appraisal and for the ICR were 12 for a
“without project? scenario and 3 for a “with project? scenario. Both studies (ex-ante and ex-post)
use a 20 year lifespan of investments and a 12 percent discount rate. Maintenance costs are
estimated to be five percent of the actual investment costs, and assumed to be allocated every
five years.

5.     The estimate of economic benefits is the difference between the vehicle operating costs in
both cases (“without project? and “with project?). The analysis quantifies the combined gains in
vehicle operation, the volume of which (measured in terms of vehicle x kilometers) is reduced


                                                28
because of the project. Lower road maintenance costs for the community (costs lowered by a
reduction in vehicles x kilometers) as well as time savings (in relation to a “without project?
scenario) for project users are disregarded (for the appraisal calculations as well as for the ICR)
to provide a conservative estimate. Benefits accruing to the community and attributable to the
East-West Road were taken into account and estimated at US$6 per unit and per year. This
assumption is deemed to be still relevant and accurate based on the impact evaluation and field
visits to the East-West Road, which showed that economic activity has picked up along the road,
construction of at least 30 buildings was ongoing and shared transport services (taxis) were
available (which was not the case before the project).

6.      For the ICR, the analysis was repeated for the main investments, the East-West Road and
Avenue Manga, which were constructed together, and which account for 36 percent of
Component B. Average traffic flows was based on updated traffic counting for the ICR and
generated and diverted traffic estimated to be zero (against 50 and 30 percent respectively for the
appraisal analysis). While the ex-ante economic analysis had estimated a total of 5,133 average
annual daily traffic units in the first year after operation, the ex-post economic analysis is based
on the actual of 5,903 average annual daily units.

7.      The benefits are monetized and linked to investment and operating costs, which results in
the calculation of indicators that measure the project's socio-economic impact from various
perspectives, including: The current net benefit or Net Present Value (NPV), which is the
difference between current benefits and current investments over a twenty-year period, at a rate
of return of 12 percent. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), which is the value of the theoretical
discount rate calculated so as to equalize the present value of cost with that of benefit.

8.       The calculations give the results in the table below. We note that in spite of higher than
expected investment cost, IRR is also higher than at appraisal, due to higher than estimated
traffic volumes. The East-West Road and Avenue Manga are analyzed as one for the ICR, since
they intersect and were carried out as one investment.

Facilities
9.      As for the roads, the economic analysis of facilities uses the cost-benefits method. In this
case, an effort is made to assess the impact of market facilities on the economy, for the
community in the broadest sense. The benefits are defined as all new revenue allocated to the
domestic agents, to which the increase in domestic consumption may possibly be added. Wages,
for example, which are categorized as costs in the financial analysis, become benefits (income
distribution).



                                                  29
10.     Thus, within the context of the assessment of the benefits to be taken into account for
these market and parking facilities, a distinction is made between direct benefits, which include
revenue, and all the effects brought about by the construction of these facilities on the economy.
Since the estimates of revenues and other benefits have not changed from appraisal (none of the
infrastructures were in operation at the time of finalizing the ICR), the economic analysis was
updated using unchanged assumptions but actual cost. For each facility, the investment lifespan
was set to 25 years, 12 percent discount rate, and income accruing to the local government from
market fees was set to increase by 3.5 percent every three years.

Markets
11.     Rehabilitation works on the Marché Central in Maradi and Petit Marché in Dosso will
help to increase capacity and improve the levels of service. Feasibility studies estimated that
direct revenue following rehabilitation works will be US$120,000 annually. This revenue, which
was calculated based on financial analysis, included only revenue from rent, storage, and various
services.

12.     The Marché Central in Maradi was run-down and no longer met safety requirements at
appraisal. Internal networks (roads, drainage, electricity, water) and facilities (parking,
sanitation) were nonexistent or inadequate, thereby creating hygiene, health, and safety problems.
Despite this situation, the market's tax potential (without any development) stood at US$170,000
annually, demonstrating the importance of commercial activities conducted there, but this
potential was not being realized. The financial analysis of the development variables conducted
as part of the feasibility studies estimated direct revenue (after development of the internal
networks and the rehabilitation of central warehouses) at approximately US$277,000 annually.

Truck Terminals
13.     In addition to providing parking facilities, the proposed works will, once operational,
contribute to the development of related commercial activities and make the facilities more
attractive to users and merchants, thus providing an additional source of revenue for the
commune. In this case, direct revenue, which is also assessed in the feasibility studies, is on the
order of US$85,000 annually, for a parking volume of 30 to 40 vehicles each day. There is
however some uncertainty as to the level of revenues, since the LG and transport operators had
not finally agreed on a fee at the time of updating the economic analysis.

14.    Beyond the revenue generated by the construction of facilities, it bears noting that the
urban community of Maradi and the urban commune of Dosso will have a pleasant living
environment. Hygiene, sanitation, and safety, key components for city management, will be
improved through the rehabilitation of the markets and construction of truck terminals.

15.     The benefits taken into account in the economic evaluation of markets and the truck
terminal include only the revenue generated by the improvements, as well as taxes, based on the
feasibility studies. These benefits alone, albeit partial, account for the viability of investments
made, as presented in the table below. The increased economic activity generated is not
quantified in the analysis, providing for a very conservative estimate of NPV.

16.    The poorer than expected result for the Maradi Market is explained by the higher than
expected investment cost, combined with the fact that no income will be generated for the local
government for at least two years more while the enclosing shops are being constructed. The
market and parking facilities together account for 25 percent of Component B investments.

Conclusion
17.    The economic justification in the PAD was based on the quantifiable benefits and ex ante
economic analysis was carried out on the main investments (East-West Road in Niamey, a
sample of secondary roads in all cities, markets and truck terminals in Maradi and Dosso). The
analysis was based on “without project? and “with project? scenarios and using a 12 percent
discount rate. The analysis covered US$8.66 million of investments, which was found to have
ERRs ranging from 17 to 42 percent and total NPV of US$31.64 million.

18.     The updated economic analysis confirms the economic justification of the initially
analyzed program of investments, with IRRs of 10 to 57 percent and total NPV of
US$27,512,227 for investments of US$ 11,375,767 analyzed. The cost-benefit analysis was
carried out on 61 percent of Component B investments.

19.     Since this is a conservative comparison, which only incorporates quantifiable benefits
and does not include non-quantifiable benefits, the cost-benefit analysis is found to be
satisfactory.

Start summary

1. INTRODUCTION
This report provides an evaluation of the project while evoking the performance of the various
stakeholders in the implementation of the project, its impact and the lessons learned.

2. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
2.1. Objectives and the overall description of the project
The development objective of PDIL is to increase and sustain access of urban residents to basic
infrastructure and services, particularly those living in deprived settlements. The project has
three components: (a) Capacity Building (b) Municipal Investments for Niamey, Maradi and
Dosso, and (c) Support to implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

The project is funded entirely by IDA, including taxes. For municipal investments, the envelopes
for each of the project cities are based on the relative weight of population and municipal
revenues collected. The allocation of funding for municipal investments was recorded in city
contracts signed between the beneficiary cities and the BNC on behalf of the government. These
city contracts include three programs:
- The Priority Investment Program (PIP) for municipal investments, fully funded by PDIL.
- The Institutional Support Program (ISP) containing capacity building activities, also fully
funded by the PDIL.
- The Priority Maintenance Program (PMP) fully funded from the budget of the recipient
municipality and devoted to the maintenance municipal of infrastructure and equipment.

In addition to the responsibility for the overall implementation of PDIL, the BNC is directly
responsible for the execution of Components A and C. The cities of Niamey, Maradi and Dosso
are responsible for the implementation of Component B, with use of delegated contract
management through NIGETIP for investments over a ceiling (US$150,000 for Dosso and
US$250,000 for Niamey and Maradi).

2.2 Project Performance
2.2.1 PDO achievement
The achievement of PDO is measured through the outcome indicators. The situation is:
- With regard to the indicator No. 1, 60,862 inhabitants were provided with access to all-season
roads within a 500 meter range under the project in 2012, meeting the target.
- As for indicator No. 2 on drainage, 11,254 inhabitants have gained improved their access to
drainage in the cities of Niamey, Maradi and Dosso in 2012.
- The indicator on the number of people provided with access to improved water sources under
the project was met, with 3,477 beneficiaries in 2012.




                                              36
- Regarding the number of people provided with access to improved sanitation under the project,
the result is 3,250.
- Finally, with regard to the establishment of an effective management system for commercial
facilities, a temporary administrator was appointed for the Maradi Central Market and the
managers of the small market and truck terminal were appointed in Dosso. The establishment of
a delegated management arrangement cannot intervene for the central Maradi market before the
construction of shops initiated by the government. In Dosso, also there is a management in-house
for a period of 12 months to get a clear idea of the revenue generated by the equipment before
proceeding to delegated management.

This means that overall the project has been effective because it has achieved its PDO as
measured through the performance indicators.

2.2.2 Component A
For indicator 1 (programming of maintenance cost), for the most part, municipalities have met
this criterion on the first three years of operation. But in 2012, some shortcomings were noted in
the programming of maintenance costs, which can be explained by the fact that the amounts
considered in 2012 (after the MTR) are only related to the maintenance of roads and drainage
unlike other years when these amounts also incorporated expenditure on maintenance of other
infrastructure. Also in 2012, the programs considered are those contained in the budgets of cities
(case of Niamey and Maradi), as opposed to the previous communes.

For Indicator 2 (annual amount of actual expenditure for the maintenance of roads and drainage),
the situation is satisfactory until 2011. For 2012, the partial4 data seem to indicate that the target
will not be achieved for the same reasons mentioned above. Regarding maintenance of roads and
drainage systems, the three cities showed good performance. For the target of 41 km in 2012,
107.8 km of drainage received maintenance. Likewise the target of 114 km of roads to maintain
was surpassed with a result of 194 km, an outstanding performance.

2.2.3 Component B
In terms of roads 13.82 km of roads were upgraded in accordance with the intended targets. As
for drainage, 3.46 km have been constructed to a target of the same order. Regarding the creation
of water points, 14 units were produced for the same target. In addition, the construction markets
in Dosso and Maradi is completed, with an estimated 3,924 market stands and parking places
created: 2,084 in Dosso and 1,840 in Maradi.

2.3. Outputs by component and sub-component
2.3.1 Component A
The component objective is to establish and strengthen management capacity in terms of
programming, implementation and management of urban infrastructure and services.

Component A1. Support to LGs

Technical assistance to:

- Procurement. To mitigate the weak capacity of municipal services in the field of procurement
(raised during the preparation of the project), a consultant was hired to develop a simplified
procurement guide and provide training for municipal staff.
- Municipal solid waste management. This assistance was provided to assess current practices
and capacities of beneficiary cities for household waste management and propose improvements.
- Management of income generating infrastructure. The TA analyzed the various possible forms
of management and developed draft contract specifications for delegated management.
- Development and implementation of maintenance programs for infrastructure. A consultant
was hired to help municipalities identify their PMP for 2009 and 2010 and ensure that budgeted
amounts corresponded to actual pre-identified activities as opposed to the previous practice
consisting in only determining the amounts and then implement maintenance based on the
available budget.
- Management of Maradi Central Market. This mission helped the city of Maradi in contacts with
potential partners for financing market shops which was not initially provided by the PDIL and
secondly for the establishment of a market management structure.

Training
Training provided to LGs focused on:
- Project cycle management, provided in 2009 and 2010 in five modules with twenty participants.
- Financial management. Two sessions in 2010 and 2011 for 55 people total.
- Procurement training for approximately twenty people, completed in April 2010.
- Procurement training for NIGETIP staff, completed in May 2010 for ten people.
- Contract management training for the directors of municipal technical services and NIGETIP
staff in June 2011 (13 people).
- Training in the use of technical software (Autocad, Archicad and Arcgis) for twenty officials of
MUPH in December 2012 - January 2013.

In addition, a team composed of representatives of municipalities, the BNC and ministries made
study trips to Togo and Benin in July 2010 to learn from their experience in community
involvement in project implementation.

Provision of municipal management tools
- Development in 2010 of a municipal anti-corruption action plan.
- Implementation of the Dosso financial management software.

Supply of equipment
- The eleven communes of the three project cities each received a complete computer kit for the
technical services.
- Acquisition of fifteen garbage containers of 5.5 m3 for Niamey for the East-West Road, which
allowed the monthly removal of about 25 tons of garbage.

Sub-component A.2 Support to central and decentralized entities
Sector studies on the development of drainage master plans for Maradi and Dosso and
finalization of the urban reference plan for Dosso. These documents include, inter alia, priority
projects whose implementation will protect the cities against floods.

Strategic studies on: (i) development of a law on delegated contract management with
implementation decrees, and (ii) development of a national framework policy for the urban
sector and a fiscal transfer mechanism. The first study resulted in the proposal of a law and its
implementing decree, which are pending adoption, and leading to liberalization and better
regulation of delegated contract management in Niger. The second study proposed a national
framework for intervention in the urban sector and a mechanism to transfer resources to the local
level. The operationalization of this policy framework will happen through the Economic and
Social Development Plan.5

The establishment of urban management tools resulted in a guide for the implementation of
urban, organizational and financial audits, urban reference plans and city contracts.

Provision of equipment and computer software for five central government entities involved in
the implementation of the project. Also, the MUPH benefited from the implementation of an
intranet and a website, which has improved the flow of information between departments and
provided outside visibility to Department activities.

Component A3: Private Sector Support
Recruitment of two consultants (one in Niamey and Maradi) to provide implementation guidance
to contractors and consultants directly on the ground. While this activity has been an undeniable
contribution to the implementation of the works during the execution phase, it is however
regrettable that the recruitment of these consultants did not happen upstream of the
commencement of work which would allowed them to better assist in development and
monitoring of works schedules, for which lack of control has been a major cause of delays.

Thus, Component A has resulted in substantial capacity building. Indeed, beyond the material
and training support provided, Niger now disposes of two strategic studies that will help
modernize its urban policy going forward.

2.3.2 Component B
All investments retained after the MTR restructuring have been made, with construction of:
- Over 13 km of tarred roads in Niamey and Maradi: 11.5 km in Niamey (East-West Road and
Manga Avenue) and 1.7 km in Maradi.
- 559 meters of paved roads in Dosso.
- 3.5 km of drains in Dosso, Maradi and Niamey.
- 14 water fountains in Niamey, Maradi and Dosso.

    ICR author’s note: This is the Poverty Reduction Strategy, PRS 2012-2015.



                                                39
- 5 toilet blocks in Dosso and Maradi.
- 86 classrooms fully equipped with furniture in Niamey and Maradi.
- 46 blocks of school latrines in Niamey and Maradi.
- 2 fully equipped integrated health centers in Niamey.
- 6,855 meters of school enclosures in Niamey (more than 10 schools).

In addition, the project has enabled the development of:
- The small market in Dosso specialized in butchery and sale of vegetables and condiments.
- The large market in Dosso (redevelopment of the former butchery, construction of two
warehouses and two additional buildings).
- Truck terminal in Dosso, about 4 ha.
- Maradi Central Market on 7.5 ha (with the installation of four 630 KVA transformers, eight
sanitary blocks, eight fountains, four areas for prayer, eleven warehouses, 1,590 meters of
internal paved road, 12,000 square meters of parking and external circulation, street lighting and
fire safety and the rehabilitation of two existing storehouses, including one into a slaughterhouse).

Thus both structuring project activities namely the development of the East-West Road and
Avenue Manga (about 3 billion FCFA) and the development of the Maradi Central Market
(about 1.6 billion FCFA ) were carried out. The East-West Road and Avenue Manga are used by
on average more than 6,500 vehicles per day. Furthermore, their development increased the
value of the surrounding land, and has led to development of economic activities.
In the Maradi Central Market, the state has budgeted the funds for the construction of shops,
which will at the same time serve as enclosure for the market. Contracts for the construction of
these shops are pending signature for a total of about 2.9 billion FCFA and the start of work is
expected from the opening of corresponding appropriations. The start of commercial operations
at the market will ensue upon the completion of the works, expected to last 18 months.

2.3.3 Component C
In addition to the operating costs of the project, Component C has allowed the following
activities:
- Four annual audits of project accounts.
- Two technical audits of work at MTR and end of project.
- Two assessments of the economic and social impacts of the project at MTR and end of project.
- IEC activities based on a project communication strategy developed in 2010.

2.4 Financing and Management of Project Funds
After only a little over 20% disbursement during the first 30 months of the project (more than
60% of the project period), the disbursement rate gradually improved after the MTR to reach
79.31% on January 15, 2013.6 This performance is due to appropriate decisions taken during the
MTR and the implication of all project stakeholders in implementation of all retained activities in
a timely manner, since an extension of the project was not considered.



6
  ICR authors’ note: this number does not include disbursements during the grace period, which
is the number retained in the main text.



                                                40
The project has established a financial management system that produces timely financial
statements with the required reliability. It should be noted, however, that reports of the third and
fourth quarters of 2012 showed a slight delay due to the departure of the financial manager and
the late arrival of his replacement. Obligations for audits have been met during the project. The
audit reports were regularly provided to the Bank in a timely manner. No abnormalities were
recorded in these annual audits. The recommendations focused on general elements of the
internal control and implementation was verified during the following audits.

3. Background and Performance of Actors
3.1. Background
The implementation of the project was dependent on the prevailing political, institutional and
technical environment.

The political and institutional environment
The project implementation period (December 15, 2008 - January 15, 2013) was characterized
by significant political events that brought Niger from the 5th to the 7th Republic, through a
military transition period of about 15 month (February 18, 2010 to April 6, 2011). In each project
city, there were at least three mayors or administrators to manage the project. These changes in
the leadership of cities sometimes affected the entire municipal administration involved in
project activities. This instability both in cities and the state has certainly negatively influenced
the implementation of the project, without being the main factor for the delays in the first phase.

In addition, the erection of urban communities in Niamey and Maradi into communes with
special status has resulted, in Niamey, in the divestiture of the former mayors of communes that
were signatories of city contracts for the benefit of the City. This was accompanied by a mobility
of most staff of the former communes initially trained by the project to city of Niamey without,
however, assigning them to PDIL activities. For the city of Maradi, the impact was less due to
the fact that the communes at the time already had delegated the management of the project to
the urban community.

Technical
Project implementation was affected by the following:
-Renewal of part of key NIGETIP staff early in the project had an impact on the work started
under delegated contract management, leading to the low disbursement during the first phase of
the project. In addition, the lack of understanding of actors’ roles also caused a delay in the start
of activities under delegated contract management, particularly with regard to procurement.
- The large number of small contracts (in accordance with the approach) generated a large
volume of procurement activities.
- The majority of contractors, although providing acceptable references in bids, showed technical
and financial weaknesses.
- The consulting engineers and works supervisors have also shown some weaknesses that result
in deficiencies in technical studies and a lack of rigor in supervising the work.

3.2. Performance of the government authorities
3.2.1. The Steering Committee



                                                 41
Its role was to provide overall strategic direction, to supervise the implementation of the project
by the BNC, strengthen inter-sectoral cooperation between the various actors, approve work
programs and annual budgets and to examine the progress and audit reports.
Although the steering committee has improved its performance, it is nevertheless clear that the
participation of members with the required level of responsibility has not always been assured,
leading to some important decisions not being taken on time. The steering committee met
regularly, often in Niamey but once in Dosso and once in Maradi. Meetings in the target cities
were utilized to visit the achievements and give the necessary guidance.

3.2.2 Line Ministry
The supervision of PDIL was initially under the Prime Minister before being transferred to the
MUPH following the MTR. This decision stems from the need to link the project to the
government department in charge of urban development. This change in oversight a new
dynamic, in particular through the mobilization of the MUPH for the East-West Road and the
Maradi Central Market, the two main activities of the restructured PDIL. Thus, the change of
oversight allowed the project to be conducted under optimal conditions, effectively tending to all
project issues that needed to be brought to the Government for decision making. However,
despite the strong commitment of the oversight ministry, the fact remains that the
operationalization of strategic studies including the urban sector framework and the mechanism
of transfer of resources to the local level remains to be implemented. Moreover, the process of
adopting the law on delegated contract management is still not complete, the text is still with the
General Secretariat of the Government.

3.3. Performance of implementing agencies (BNC, NIGETIP, cities)
3.3.1 The BNC
The implementation of the project was carried out under the overall coordination of the BNC,
which was also responsible for the management and fiduciary aspects of the implementation of
Components A and C. During the first phase, the BNC faced many difficulties in project
implementation. Weaknesses were noted regarding follow-up on technical, environmental and
social issues as well as communication on the project. The MTR restructuring had an aimed to
address identified deficiencies and ensure better implementation. Thus, the project was provided
with its own coordinator (instead of coordinator shared between projects) and the position of
infrastructure specialist was split into three positions: technical support, monitoring and
evaluation, and monitoring of environmental and social aspects (the latter part-time). These
changes have helped to implement project activities within the prescribed time. Specifically, the
coordination performance succeeded in bringing together different actors and creating a new
dynamic that allowed the project to achieve significant results. Similarly, there has been a greater
consideration of environmental and social aspects. However, despite the implementation of some
activities (posters and documentary films on the project) the BNC could not fundamentally
change the situation in terms of communication, as expected by the MTR. Moreover, some
shortcomings persisted in the area of monitoring and evaluation.

3.3.2 NIGETIP
The choice was guided in part by weak technical capacity of municipal services and secondly by
the fact that NIGETIP was the only Nigerian institution at the time of the evaluation of the
project with experience in project management support, having practiced in this area since 1991.



                                                42
Before the MTR NIGETIP was the subject of numerous complaints from other partners,
including non-compliance with delegated contract management agreements, weak monitoring of
construction sites and of environmental and social aspects, weaknesses of communication with
municipalities, difficulties in ensuring procurement in a timely manner and recurring cost
overruns of projects even though the amounts were not variable. In short, the agency was
criticized for capacity weaknesses, which influenced negatively on the performance of the
project, even though the project was based on the assumption of a certain capability, on the part
of NIGETIP, to conduct the project in acceptable conditions.

Today, the situation has improved with NIGETIP taking action to improve its operational
effectiveness. These include the recruitment of two engineers assigned to the East-West Road
and Manga Avenue and to the Maradi Central Market, in accordance with the decisions of the
MTR. In addition, delegated project management is experienced as problematic by cities, which
find they are insufficiently informed by NIGETIP to the point of giving them the impression that
they are not the actual contracting authority.

3.3.3 Cities
LGs have fully participated in regular meetings to monitor the implementation of project
activities organized by the BNC and the meetings of the Steering Committee. The cities
budgeted adequate resources for their PMPs, as well as those necessary for the implementation
of the resettlement action plans, as compensation for project affected persons was the
responsibility of cities. The LGs were involved in project communication with their populations,
especially those affected. Contacts were regular, especially with organized civil society groups.
Before the MTR the LGs showed low capacity in procurement, in preparation of TORs, approval
of engineering studies and monitoring projects, which led to significant omissions, often the
causes of delays. However, most of the work under city oversight was completed before the
MTR. The second phase was marked by institutional changes with a consequent loss of the
expertise gained in the old communes of Niamey, which resulted in long delays in procurement
and inadequate project monitoring, especially since the city technical services were weak in
monitoring these projects.

3.4. SMEs, Consultants and other partners
Several shortcomings were noted in technical studies and works supervision for the engineering
consultants, coupled with difficulties to perform the work within acceptable time limits for the
contractors. In fact, besides the lack of financial capacity, companies had problems of
organization and human resources. The workshop, funded under the PDIL, on the issue of the
roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the implementation of works provided valuable
avenues to explore.

3.5 Performance of the Bank
The World Bank has assured its participation in the implementation of PDIL by:
- The provision of funds to finance activities.
- Conducting periodic missions to support the implementation of the project, including provision
of consultants on specific issues.




                                               43
- Ongoing exchanges with the BNC for the smooth running of the project through e-mail or
video or audio conferences whenever necessary besides the contributions of staff of the resident
mission in Niamey.

4. Impacts of the project
4.1. Impacts on the lives of people
The project has resulted in a significant improvement in the lives of the target populations,
including those living in poor neighborhoods, through improved access to urban transport, proper
sanitation and drainage system and drinking water. These positive impacts are reflected in the
achievement of performance indicators, already addressed above. Moreover, although the impact
was not measured in the results framework of the project, the construction of infrastructure such
as classrooms, fencing of schools and health centers also had impacts. Thus the construction of
classrooms allowed the replacement of classes in straw huts, contributing to the improvement of
working conditions of more than 3,440 students and their teachers, while fencing of schools has
contributed to securing children as it has enabled them to perform certain activities such as
vegetable gardening or raising poultry as an integral part of the school curriculum. The
construction of health centers has contributed to improving the health of populations in the
affected areas.

4.2. Institutional Impact
4.2.1 Impacts on LGs
Local governments have a new culture of priority maintenance programs, which are prepared
annually in targeted cities. The city contracts and delegated contract management agreements
became normal working documents, receiving rigorous monitoring by municipalities. Local
institutions were reinforced through provision of equipment, budget management software, and
training, and confirm having improved their financial management. Through actual experiences
in procurement and contract management, despite initial difficulties, they have gradually build
capacity in the field, to be further capitalized in the future.

4.2.2. Central government
The central directorates of the MUPH and the General Directorate of Territorial Administration
and Local Communities were the main beneficiaries. The project has provided tools for urban
planning and programming and two strategic studies. Through the development of a national
framework for the urban sector and a mechanism for transferring resources to the local level,
plus the law on delegated contract management, elaborated by PDIL, Niger disposes of a basis
for the implementation of its future urban policy. The Intermediary Framework Program for
Government Action7 and Economic and Social Development Plan are the vessels to implement
the proposals of the two studies. Thus the “urban development improvement program? includes
provision of urban planning and management tools to urban centers, establishing a synergy
between stakeholders (through the implementing a framework for intervention in urban areas)
and the establishment of a funding mechanism for urban areas.




7
    ICR author’s note: This framework was presented to the donors in February 2012.



                                                44
4.2.3. Private Sector
Through the activities and experience gained in the implementation of activities of the project,
SMEs were assisted to master procedures to better organize and monitor their projects and take
into account environmental issues, the importance of which has been enhanced in the context of
this project. Thus, companies have learned to develop and implement the ESMP under the
supervision of the BNC and control of the National Environmental Agency.

4.3. Economic Activity
The roads and commercial facilities were substantial factors of development. Indeed, the
construction of two roads in the city of Niamey for example, has led to the creation of 164 new
economic activities (mobile phone centers, hair salons, repair and sale of laptops, reprographic
centers, sewing workshops, garages, service stations, food shops, fish stores and motorcycle
shops). The various commercial facilities created or upgraded led to development of economic
and commercial activities.

4.4. Employment
The project has been a source of job creation, for example on the East-West Road and Manga
Avenue, shops installed after the road works have created an estimated 477 to 954 additional
jobs. In addition, garages, major providers of jobs alone have generated an estimated 75 to 179
jobs.

4.5. Municipal finances
The project has had a positive impact on municipal finances. Indeed, commercial facilities and
roads, for example, will allow authorities to collect taxes, tariffs, and various service fees. In
addition, for the sanitary facilities in Dosso and Maradi, a fee of 20,000 FCFA is paid monthly
per facility and in Maradi, each water kiosks will contribute 5,000 FCFA per month.
According to the feasibility studies, the Maradi Central Market will generate an annual income
of at least FCFA 136 million for the municipality. In Dosso, annual revenues from the
commercial facilities are estimated as respectively FCFA 60 million for the small and large
market and more than FCFA 40 million FCFA for the truck terminal.

4.6. Economic potential of the sub-projects
In addition to the direct revenue to people from economic activities, the land along the East-West
Road has more than doubled in value, wholly attributable to the road works. Moreover, the
traffic counts conducted on the East-West Road and Avenue Manga revealed that on average,
around 6,544 vehicles use road per day, which is an exceptional level of traffic and enough to
make the investment economically viable.

5. CONCLUSION
After a relatively difficult initial phase characterized by a low disbursement rate, project
implementation was steadier after the MTR, due to the decisions taken at that time. The
important physical and institutional achievements resulting from the project should now be
sustained.




                                               45
5.1. Sustainability
In order to ensure long-term sustainability of works and institutional outcomes of the project, the
following should be done:
- Completing auxiliary works for some infrastructures as well as the constructing the enclosing
shops for the Maradi Central Market, building accommodation for the truck drivers at the truck
terminal in Dosso.
- Support the maintenance culture through the institutionalization of PMPs and generalization of
city contracts. This should involve the adoption of legislation on the minimum amount to be
included in municipal budgets for infrastructure maintenance and the establishment of a
mechanism for monitoring the implementation of commitments.
- The pursuit of public awareness by the authorities for a rational use of infrastructure to prevent
deterioration.
- The swift operationalization of infrastructure including the establishment of management
bodies wherever required.
- Appropriation and implementation of strategic studies and the generalization of the use of
urban management tools.

5.2. Lessons for the future
Following the implementation of the project the following key lessons can be drawn:
- Institutionalize the public procurement function in LGs in order to have a minimum of
experience to use for further action.
- Develop tender documents for sub-projects as well as TORs for complex engineering studies
during project preparation, to facilitate disbursements immediately following project
effectiveness.
- Create the institutional conditions for the liberalization of delegated contract management.
- Avoid cancellation, during the project, of structuring sub-projects such as paved roads in
Niamey, which were canceled for an amount of about 2 billion FCFA.
- Leave the contracting authority the flexibility to choose the delegated contract management
agency.
- Ensure that certain activities to strengthen the capacity of stakeholders (SMEs, engineering
consultants, municipal technical services) with a view to improve achievements are effectively
dispensed upstream before launching these activities.
- Consider the specific issues of water and electricity connections through better estimates of cost
of connections and integration into works costs in the form of provisional amounts.
- Formally involve regional directorates of urbanism, closest to cities, to assist in project
management. These services can provide assistance to LGs or even delegated contract
management.
- Implement support for urban and municipal development over a long period with successive
stages in order to avoid discontinuity after project closing.
- Continue to place emphasis on major structuring infrastructure and facilities (roads, drainage,
commercial facilities) without abandoning the improvement of access to basic services.

(b) Comments received from the government on draft Bank ICR

Two rounds of comments were received from the government. An initial draft ICR was
translated into French and shared with the government for comments. The government found the
tone of the initial draft to be too negative in spite of the demonstrated results of the project. To
support this claim, it provided additional information notably on readiness to have diverse
infrastructure shortly put in operation for delivering the services expected through the project.
The ICR team incorporated the government’s comments and provided an updated draft, in
French, for review.
