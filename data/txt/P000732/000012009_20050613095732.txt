3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The main theme in this ICR will be the rapid pace of expansion alongside a lag in the delivery of
quality-related inputs. Historically, and cross-nationally, this is a common experience. Internal political
and economic pressures place emphasis on system expansion; external donors stress the importance of
reaching international enrollment targets. Salary pressures on the recurrent budget and limitations on the
availability of and capacity to utilize capital budgets to delayed and often inadequate investments in
antecedents of quality, despite the best intentions of government and insistence by donors. Ethiopia is no
exception to this cross-national pattern. Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world with
desperate needs in all sectors, its government's commitment to achieving universal primary school
completion and to offering expanded services at the post-primary level are clearly manifest in its track
record over the period of this credit.

For a country emerging from decades, if not centuries, of centralized government administration, the inertia
of past practices and top-down directives have proven hard to escape. Yet the country has implemented
instruction in local languages; and a pragmatic learning-by-doing is increasingly evident, thus broadening
the scope for adapting policies to local conditions. Toward the end of the period of this credit, when the
tradeoffs in favor of expansion at the expense of input-related indicators of quality (e.g. student-teacher
ratios and class sizes) were becoming more and more untenable, the central government began to consider
changes to its framework for sector development (e.g. by diversifying the menu of models for classroom
construction) and to acquiesce to the regions' de facto efforts to cope by adapting federal standards for
teacher recruitment and by experimenting with non-formal approaches to service delivery, use of
multi-grade teaching and other innovative arrangements, and reliance on distance courses as well as private
teacher training institutions to help increase the supply of teachers.

In the face of unprecedented demand for primary schooling, government might have achieved a more
balanced approach to expansion, one that placed equal stress on the quality of services being delivered by
reallocating budget savings from lowering construction costs, moving to multi-grade classrooms where
student:teacher ratios were very low, and by relying on less costly less educated, but equally qualified
teachers to alleviate the pressure on over-populated classrooms. By shifting resources freed up by reducing
construction costs for example and increasing investments in textbooks, learning materials, and teacher
support, the quality of classroom learning might have improved at little cost to continued growth of the
system. These changes are now underway, albeit several years after they might have been implemented.
Government's commitment to expansion and their success in accomplishing it is commendable. However,
more prudent use of resources, with a larger share of the budget dedicated to improving or even
maintaining quality as measured by section size, availability of learning materials, etc. may have resulted in
not only more students in school, but better learning results and greater internal efficiency as well.

Following credit effectiveness in 1998, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended twice, first
on March 28, 2001 in order to increase the authorized allocation of the special account from US$ 10
million to US$ 15 million and again on November 8, 2002, to extend the original closing date of the credit
from December 31, 2002 to June 7, 2004 due to delays caused by the war with Eritrea and other factors.

This credit therefore coincided with the government's first five-year Education Sector Development
Program (ESDP I, which ran from 1997/8 to 2001/02) and the follow-up three-year program, ESDPII
which ran from 2001/02 to 2003/04. Under ESDP1, the main objective was to improve the overall
educational attainment of the population, while achieving greater social equity. The specific targets were
the following:




                                                      - 2 -

l Expand access to education with special emphasis on primary education in rural areas, raising
     enrollment from 3.1 million to 7.0 million, and increasing the gross primary enrollment ratio from 35%
     to 50%;
l Reduce inequity by improving enrollment ratios for disadvantaged groups: increase girls' enrollment
     from 36 % to 45 %, and increase rural relative to urban enrollment;
l Improve efficiency of the educational system by reducing dropout and repetition rates;
l Improve quality and relevance by providing books, reducing the student to book ratio from 5:1 to 1:1 in
     core subjects, and by curriculum improvements and teacher training; and
l Improve financing for education by increasing education's share of the total recurrent budget from 14%
     to 19% and primary education's share of the total education budget from 46% to 65%.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The overall objectives of the program were not revised through the two amendments of the DCA and the
IDA credit continued to support the sector development plan without interruption. Encouraged by the
significant accomplishments under ESDP I, the government did, however, set more ambitious targets for
enrollments under ESDP II. (Note: throughout this text "ESDP" followed by a numeral denotes
government's sector program/s; ESDP without a numeral refers to the IDA credit.)

The key finding of the Mid-Term Review in 2001 was that although significant achievements were evident
in access/expansion objectives, progress on quality and equity was more limited. It was also found that
tertiary enrollment was growing at a faster rate than anticipated in the design of ESDP. The Ministry
argued that this change did not reflect a decrease in the importance given to primary education but that the
increase in the higher education budget allocations were needed to raise university enrollment which
hovered at only 0.5 percent of the age cohort. The share going to higher education continued to increase,
especially during the last two years of the ESDP II, as discussed in the financing section below.

3.3 Original Components:

Eligible programs covered all education sector levels, from basic education to tertiary education, both
formal and non-formal education, as well as adult education, special needs education, distance education
and teacher training. Planned expenditure shares reflected government's emphasis on basic education
expansion and the construction of facilities to accommodate the goal of rapidly increasing enrollments,
especially in rural areas. Brief descriptions of the component, and the expected outcomes as they were
defined at the outset of the project, are given below.

l Basic Education Activities. Over the ESDP I period, 2,423 new primary schools were to be built,
     1,814 upgraded, and 1,220 renovated in order to accommodate 3.0 million additional students for this
     eight year cycle. Curriculum reform was to be completed, teachers upgraded, and book provision
     substantially increased. Access to schools was to substantially improve especially in rural areas where
     all new primary school construction financed by the credit was to be located. Increased enrollment over
     the next five-years was to be realized (from an average GER of 35% to 50%), both from increased
     in-take and improved student retention. Quality of teaching/learning was to be improved and the closer
     proximity of schools to homesteads would enable more children to remain in school and complete the
     primary cycle. Non-formal education was to provide a second chance to school dropouts and those
     youths and adults who never had the opportunity to attend school. Educational radio programs were to
     be expanded and new ones developed to supplement classroom teaching, and to help offset the shortage
     of qualified teachers.
l Secondary Education Activities. ESDP was to selectively expand secondary school facilities to
     reduce over-crowding and to meet demand. Curricula were to be revised to improve their quality and
     relevance. Teachers were to be upgraded and the availability of instructional materials and equipment



                                                      - 3 -

    greatly increased. Expected outputs included (i) a reduction in class size to improve the learning
    environment; (ii) improved quality of teachers; and (iii) greater availability of books to help improve
    teaching/learning.
l Technical and Vocational Educationand Training Activities (TVET). Employer and market
    surveys were to be carried out to improve the relevance of TVET programs before expanding facilities.
    Closer partnership was to be sought with the private sector in the design of TVET programs and in the
    provision of training. Expected outputs included: (i) training provided would have greater relevance to
    the demands of the job market; (ii) higher rates of employment were expected for TVET graduates; and
    (iii) the economy would benefit from increased productivity from trained and skilled labor.
l Teacher Training Institutes and Colleges Activities. Facilities would be upgraded and expanded to
    provide in-service training for primary teachers in order to certify them as instructors in the upper two
    grades of the second primary cycle. Teacher training curricula would be revised to reflect curricula
    reforms at the primary and secondary levels. Greater emphasis would be placed on teaching skills in
    the teacher preparation programs. Teacher training through distance education was to facilitate more
    cost effective teacher upgrading and to give teachers in remote schools opportunities for professional
    growth. Head teachers were to be trained in school management. National standards for teacher
    training were to be established. Expected outputs included: (i) schools would be better managed and
    have greater community involvement; (ii) the quality of teachers and their effectiveness in the
    classroom would improve; and (iii) opportunities for professional growth and the implementation of a
    new career structure would boost teacher morale.
l Tertiary Education Activities. Expansion of the tertiary sector was to be limited to meeting the
    immediate needs of the country for educators, engineers, health workers, and public administrators.
    Expansion of each physical plant was to be contingent on the tertiary institution having carried out a
    satisfactory diagnosis of the cost effectiveness of its operation and on the development of proposals for
    improvement. Cost sharing schemes were to be designed and implemented for Grades 11-12 and
    tertiary institutions. Expected outputs included: (i) more trained personnel available for the four
    critical areas mentioned above; (ii) greater private resources flowing to tertiary education, thereby
    reducing the burden on the public sector; and (iii) tertiary institutions would become more efficient.
l Institutional Development Activities. Planning, financial management, implementation and
    monitoring and evaluation capacities of the MoE and the Regions were to be improved. The National
    Organization for Examinations (NOE) was to be staffed and equipped to carry out its mandate as the
    chief body responsible for designing and administering national examinations and national surveys of
    student learning. The Education Media Agency's (EMA) capacity to develop secondary school
    programs, distance learning programs for teacher upgrading and non-formal and adult education, and
    to assist the Regional Education Media Units (EMU) was to be improved. Regional EMUs, with the
    assistance of EMA, were to develop capacity to design educational programs and transmit them.
    Expected outputs included: (i) an analysis of student performance and feedback to schools would help
    examination results become an integral part of the teaching/learning process; (ii) national surveys of
    student achievement would enable ministry officials to assess whether quality related goals for
    education were being met; (iii) non-formal education would become a cost-effective tool for reaching
    the students who could not be reached through the formal education system; and (iv) local language
    programs for primary school would be increased, especially in remote areas.
3.4 Revised Components:
The program components to be financed under this project were not revised during the life of the project
and attest to the efficacy of the initial design. However, as will be noted below, unexpected changes in the
political-economic context of the country (primarily resulting from the conflict with Eritrea) resulted in
reduced support of ESDP I by many donors. Less than 50% of the amounts they committed and pledged for
the initial years of the ESDP I period (1998/99-2000/01) were actually disbursed. This was partially due
to the non-fulfillment of their pledges and partly due to the limited capacity of implementing bodies to use


                                                      - 4 -

resources available to them. IDA became the principal external funding source for government's program,
although the utilization rate was below the planned level, particularly for the initial years. Despite the
economic problems faced by the country during this period, government was able to allocate the full
envelope of its own financial resources pledged at the beginning of ESDP.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The third QAG assessment carried out in 1998 rated the Quality at Entry of this program satisfactory. The
basis of the satisfactory rating included the program's consistency with the CAS and with the Government's
priorities, the substantial sector knowledge which served as background to the preparation and the Bank
team's skill working with a complex government strategy. The strength of government ownership was also
noted. The ministry had given considerable thought to the design of the Education Sector Development
Program even prior to the commitment of technical and financial assistance by donors.

The preparation of this lending operation was supported by a PHRD grant which funded a number of
studies and household surveys. (Highlights of the findings of the studies are available in the report:
"Education Sector Review: Synthesis and Summary", PHRD Project, Sponsored by GoE and the World
Bank, Project Office, November 1996, Addis Ababa.) These studies helped government and the Bank
design team to understand better the household demand for educational services, the efficiency, volume and
management issues facing the ministry, and the financing required to provide the educational services. The
PHRD task office in the ministry, which coordinated the recruitment and supervision of local consultants
for the studies, also prepared a synthesis report. Initial findings of the studies were discussed in a technical
review workshop attended by local, regional, and international participants and donors, in June 1996.

Project preparation was carried out with considerable consultation between government and various
donors, who reviewed the results of the studies and Government's draft Education Sector Development
Program (ESDP I). The Bank coordinated three joint donor missions in which a large number of donors
participated. (UNESCO, UK DFID, EU, UNICEF, UNDP, JICA, GTZ, ADB the Governments of Finland
and Italy).

The PAD was candid in identifying the high risk areas of implementation: (i) the delays in implementation
that might be caused by possible problems in harmonizing multiple donors' procedures; (ii) wide variation
in implementation capacity across regions and in their readiness for implementation; and (iii) the possible
shortage of script and textbook writers and teachers with local language mastery.

The QAG review panel noted that the Program was fully consistent with the CAS and with its progress
towards benchmarks specified in the policy/strategy matrix. The program design had followed
Government's priorities within the education sector which clearly had identified expanding access to
primary education, with emphasis on the rural areas, as its first priority. A more modest focus on
secondary education is contained in both ESDP I and II, although in ESDP II there was a new and major
emphasis on expansion of tertiary education and TVET resulting in a proportional shift of resources away
from basic education.

The institutional capacity analysis and readiness for implementation were rated "marginal" by the QAG
review panel. This rating was given because the incentives for many of the key players- - teachers,
bureaucrats at the central and regional levels-- were not clear. Implementation readiness was rated marginal
also because the first year procurement documents were not ready by the time of project launch. In
retrospect, the QAG findings were very accurate, especially concerning the significance of regional
variation in implementation capacity, as will be illustrated later in the discussion of the utilization of
finances.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
                                   Rating: Marginally Satisfactory.

Assigning ratings in a project as complex as this is difficult because of inevitable variations in rates of
progress among the components, each of which is at different levels of importance and emphasis in the
ESDP I and II. On balance, although achievements fell short of ambition on some fronts, performance was
sufficiently positive when judged against the central objective of improving the overall educational
attainment of the population, while achieving greater social equity, to merit a satisfactory rating.

Nearly two-thirds of IDA funds was devoted to primary education and was deployed successfully to
increase enrollment through the provision of additional classroom space and instructional materials
(see details below). The enrollment target for this level of education was exceeded while more limited
progress was made in reducing gender and urban/rural inequities. The availability of textbooks, teachers
and classrooms grew more slowly than the increase in enrollments, leading to a steady deterioration over
the course of ESDP in the corresponding input-related indicators of quality (i.e. ratios of students to
textbooks, teachers and classrooms). This pattern in the input indicators reflects the government's
commitment to expansion as a top priority and is consistent with its objective of transforming the country's
historically elite education system into one that would become more oriented toward the masses. Despite
the implicit tradeoff in favor of quantity at the expense of input-related indicators of quality, survival rates
in primary education (i.e. the proportion of grade 1 entrants who reach subsequent grades) remained
relatively stable over the course of ESDP. To have maintained survival rates, albeit at the admittedly
modest rates of 60 percent to Grade 4 and 38 percent to Grade 8, in the face of the system's massive
expansion is indeed a remarkable achievement, On student learning, the available data from national
assessments suggest that performance has also not deteriorated over the course of ESDP although it
remains mediocre at best, with students supplying correct answers on an average of only 48 percent of the
test items in Grade 4 and 41 percent in Grade 8.

Overview.

Over the last decade including the seven year period of the project, basic education in Ethiopia underwent a
major expansion and shift in emphasis. Significant political reforms following the civil war including
development of a new constitution and social order in 1994 created the way for significant social progress.
This was especially evident in the education sector where emphasis on expansion of the basic education
system became the cornerstone of development. Under the new government, aggregate enrollments in
grades 1-12 rose at a steady pace of about 9 percent a year between 1992/93 and 2001/02. In the grade
1-4 cycle enrollments grew at an astounding rate of 15 percent per year over the project period (see Figure
1). Overall the growth in the primary gross enrollment rate more than tripled over the project period, from
20 percent to over 60 percent. This rapid increase reflecting significant pent up demand and government
commitment to equitable service delivery would place a severe strain on systems even in the most developed
of countries, but as one of the poorest countries in the world with income per capita averaging only slightly
over $100, the financial burden to the Ethiopian government has been significant.

Over the period of the project government has responded to the demand for schooling but has also helped to
create demand by its emphasis on mass education. Growth has been faster in urban than in rural areas in
part because of the greater ease in establishing infrastructure, but also in response to political pressure to
provide services. The fast rate of expansion has resulted in overcrowding of schools and insufficient
number of teachers-- manifestations of growth that are found in most developing countries. Government
has begun to shift its emphasis and some of its resources to quality, but it will take time for quality
investments to catch up with growth in the system in recent years.

There are few pure indicators of student learning in the Ethiopian system. The results of the recently
reported Second Learning Assessment (see Table 1) indicated little improvement in learning outcomes in
the previous four years and a slight decline in several subjects, despite a target of 50% correct answers for
curriculum based questions. The pattern is remarkable despite the fact that almost all the input-related
indicators of quality have moved in the wrong direction. These include textbook availability, teacher: pupil
ratio, section size, and per capita recurrent expenditure on non-salary budget items. Although learning
levels have remained relatively constant over the period, an average of less than 50% of curricula based
questions answered correctly does not speak well for quality of instruction in the schools.

An examination of the relative growth rates in several categories reveals the imbalance between the
expansion of the system and the resources invested to sustain the system with some modicum of quality.
(See Table 2) Since these numbers are expressed as percents they are normed against standards in place at
the beginning of the project period. Although primary enrollments increased by 12.7% per annum, the
recurrent budget for primary increased only by 6.7% per annum. Given the size of the system, this
represents a substantial investment, but one that is not in keeping with the rate of growth. The number of
teachers increased by 3.7%, but is far behind the increased rate of enrollment, thus contributing to
exceptionally large section sizes and high student: teacher ratios. The increase in the recurrent budget has
not led to a faster increase in the number of teachers. This is because part of the increase was used to pay
higher salaries for first cycle teachers who became TTI-certified (from less than 85% in 1996/97 to 96% in
2001/02) and to pay for the second-cycle teachers who upgraded their qualification to diploma levels. In
2001 there was also an increase in the overall salary scale. Non-salary spending increased by only 2.6%
and is manifest in the low levels of in-service training available to teachers, insufficient supervision and
inspection, few instructional materials, and little monitoring and evaluation. On an annual percentage basis
the growth in the recurrent budget for higher education was nearly double that for primary.

In summary, the project has achieved most of its main access objectives and some of the quality-related
objectives. The significant advances made in access under the project are impressive, but are at risk unless
immediate and dramatic attention is given to ensuring that each newly enrolled child is also provided with a
quality learning environment, a reasonably sized teacher: pupil ratio and sufficient learning materials to
provide the basis for mastery of the curriculum. While these risks are known to the government, it made a
political choice to spread the available resources over more students instead of concentrating them on fewer
students. In the process the education system became less elitist without obvious deterioration in survival
rates and learning outcomes. For this reason, the overall rating assigned to development outcomes is
satisfactor.

Government's heavy emphasis on system expansion over the project period represents a clear break with
the efforts of previous governments. The move from an elite to a mass system is a significant
accomplishment and one in which the current government has been learning by doing and moving towards a
greater understanding of and appreciation for the inter relationship between system quality and
sustainability. As the quality constraints have become increasingly apparent, government has taken steps
to begin to redress these shortcomings, the results of which should become apparent over the period of
ESDP 3.

Each of the main objectives and outcomes of the program are discussed below.

Project Objectives.

Policy Dialogue. As part of the first sector-wide education program in Ethiopia, the project contributed
comprehensive analysis and insight into sectoral policies and implementation issues through joint
donor-government consultation processes, joint donor review missions, formal and informal project
supervision missions and annual review meetings. The project has also helped to harmonize donor
procedures around the program's implementation manual, which is mainly based on government
procedures.

Expanding Access. Primary school enrollment (grades 1-8) increased from 4.0 million to 8.1 million at
the end of ESDP I (2001/02), exceeding the 7 million target set for the final year of ESDP I. The primary
enrollment ratio rose from 35% to 62%, compared to the 50% target for that period. Enrollment further
expanded during the first two years of ESDP II reaching 9.5 million. The GER increased to 68.4%,
exceeding the target set for 2002/03 by 2.4 percentage points. These accomplishments were realized in the
context of a 2.7 percent average population growth rate. By the end of the project, aggregate enrollment in
secondary schools had increased from 453,985 to 684,630. Enrollment in regular TVET programs reached
80,699 (including the 26,673 enrolled in agricultural technical and vocational training). Enrollment in the
eight public universities and in the growing number of private higher education institutions, including
evening and summer classes, increased from 45,554 to 172,522 between the years 1997/98 and 2003/04.

Throughout the project period demand has risen very fast, much faster than supply. Research studies in
Ethiopia and elsewhere in the Africa region show that demand for schooling depends a lot on distance to
schools in rural areas, and on quality of education in urban areas. With still relatively low enrollment rates
in rural areas, demand is likely to continue to increase and hence the provision of new services will follow.
However, in urban areas where enrollments rates are approaching a universal asymptote, quality of services
is likely to figure more prominently in decisions to stay in school, and to select schools that have a tack
record of producing good learning results. Increased investments in quality related investments will be
necessary to sustain gains in enrollment and to improve on the outcomes of the schooling process as

indicated by the results of the Learning Assessments.. Increasing the supply side of the equation will
require an adjustment of resources, either through savings resulting from greater efficiency (e.g., lower
construction costs, lower repetition), increased budgetary allocation (shifts form other sub-sectors and
increases in donor financing) or from reducing the wage bill, especially in the first four grades of primary
school by hiring fewer certified teachers (civil servants) but ones who are still qualified by nature of their
own education and training. Recent statistics from several large regions indicate that the production of
teachers in private teacher training institutions is enough to meet the current and anticipated demand in
those regions. If they are willing to work as non civil-servants, and indications are that they are, the
pressure on the recurrent budget and on section sizes may be lessened over the short run. However, unless
a bridging mechanism is put in place to ensure movement into the civil service system, and to reduce pay
inequities over time, the attractiveness of joining the ranks of non-civil service teachers may be short-lived.

Improving Equity. The percentage share of girls in primary schools increased from 36% in 1996/97 to
42.6% in 2003/04, compared to the revised target of 43.3% set for the end of ESDP II (2004/05). Gender
disparity remains larger in rural areas than in urban areas; cultural contexts and distances that must be
traveled to school have a negative influence on school attendance. Other factors include: early age of
marriage, overage school entry, fear of abduction and high household demand for girls' labor. During
ESDP II a number of studies were conducted and different strategies were employed to promote girls'
education by government in an integrated multi-sectoral approach involving a variety of investment
initiatives. Government has recently completed a study titled "Taking Stock of Girl's Education in

Ethiopia: Preparing for ESDP III" (Oct. 2004) which is aimed at identifying strategies that have shown
evidence of being effective and should have a higher profile in ESDP III.

In light of the program's rural focus, and of the higher participation in schooling in urban areas at the start
of the program, it is not surprising that rural enrollment increased at a faster rate than urban enrollment
(19.8% compared to 8.8%). Equity of access has been improving in all regions and nationally. However,
the gross enrollment rates in the two most under-served and sparsely populated regions, Afar and Somali,
are only about 15%, compared to the ESDP I target of 25% and to the national average of 68.4%. The
main contextual factors responsible for continuing low access in these regions include: pastoralism
necessitated by the arid and semi- arid climate of these regions which have insufficient water and grazing
resources for livestock; low demand for schooling; lack of teachers who speak the local language; lack of
basic infrastructure; and weak management capacity in local offices.

The educational problems of these regions have been an agenda item for most Joint Review missions and
the Annual Review Meetings and the subject of on-going dialogue between donors (including the Bank) and
government. A number of studies have been conducted and recommendations made to address the special
problems of these regions. Over the past two years a multi-sectoral development strategy and a fast track
three-year education action plan have been under implementation. This plan employs an "alternative basic
education" program as the primary service delivery vehicle and uses localized curricula and local languages
to foster enrollments and lower dropout.

Improving Efficiency. Over the course of ESDP survival rates have not declined (or conversely, dropout
rates have not increased), but repetition has increased, clearly a sign that the system is becoming somewhat
less efficient in throughput, although not excessively so compared with performance in other countries.

The survival rate in grade 1 of primary school increased over the first half of the project period but
stagnated at 75% beginning in the year 2000. The early increases are partially attributable to the fast
increase in the grade 1 intake rate and in the aggregate enrollment expansion in primary schools. With
grade 1 entrants growing at the average rate of four percent each year, primary enrollment expanded much
faster than planned resulting in an insufficient number of textbooks and low quality service, which in turn
may have led to a plateauing of the grade to grade transition rate. Although the survival rate from grade to
grade ranges from 75% to 83% for Grades 1-8, the composite cohort survival rate from Grade 1 to Grade 8
is only 36%. With only slightly more than one-third of each cohort completing the full primary cycle,
inefficiency is very high. Failure to complete the full cycle is likely attributable to one or more of the
following causes: unacceptable distances young children have to travel to school, especially in rural areas,
increases in the number of orphan children, war, poverty, and health and nutrition related factors. There is
an underlying measurement problem in calculating repetition and dropout rates. Data are not uniformly
collected and definitional issues may disguise true levels. Nevertheless, it is clear that the system has costly
inefficiencies which are at unacceptably high levels and which are unnecessarily increasing the costs per
school graduate.

As noted in Table 4, high rates of repetition also contribute to high rates of inefficiency. Repeaters as a
proportion of enrollment for each grade increased in almost every grade in almost each year of the project
period, with the highest rates in the earliest grades. In order to reduce repetion in the early grades,
government has introduced a policy of automatic promotion through grade four. The low survival rates in
Grades 11 and 12 are a product of government's policy to limit transition to post-secondary education.
There is concern however, that if increasingly adverse learning conditions are not corrected shortly, the
quality of schooling will decrease and enrollments may stagnate, if not decline.

Improving Quality and Relevance. The average pupil: section ratio at the primary level increased from
57 in 1996/97 to 74 in 2003/04 compared to the ESDP I target of 50. The revised target for ESDP II is 60
for the year 2004/05. This negative trend is a function of the very rapid expansion of enrolment which has
outpaced both the rate of school construction and the production of teachers, and the timely development of
strategies to deal with the expansion. During the ESDP I (war impeded) period, 83% of the planned



                                                      - 13 -

number of primary schools were built while the overall enrolment target was exceeded by 12%. The
primary school student-textbook ratio for core subjects was, on average, 2.5:1 in 2000/01.
Although estimates of the current ratio exist, they are not reliable. Site visits and observations indicate that
the ratio has not improved, and perhaps worsened. The ratio also appears to differ widely among regions. A
study is planned to survey the availability of textbooks and to establish baseline data.

Despite efforts to increase the number of certified teachers, due to the rapid expansion of primary education
enrolment, the supply has not keep up with the rate required to achieve targets and maintain quality. The
pupil: teacher ratio increased from 42 in 1997/98 to 65 in 2003/04 and is now higher than in all but three
other African countries (Cameroon, Chad and the C.A.R.). Under ESDP II, government has been taking
steps to increase the number of non-certified teachers at the lower grade levels to reduce the ratio of
teachers to students, has expanded and revised teacher training programs, and is encouraging the use of
multi-grade classrooms and community based schools. Implementation of a national learning assessment
program is another indicator of government's concern over quality. The first results of this initiative were
available in early 2005. In addition, a relatively new initiative in several of the regions to do away with the
shift system has the same objective.

Financial Sustainablity.

Currently, the recruitment standards for Grade 1-4 teachers require that candidates should have graduated
from a teacher training institute (and have had ten years of general schooling plus one year of teacher
training); teachers for Grades 5-8 should have graduated from a teacher training college (and have had ten
years of general schooling plus three years of training); and teachers for Grades 9-12 should have received
a university degree. In Grades 1-4, almost all the teachers in government schools have the required
certification, but in Grades 5-8, only 26 percent do and in Grades 9-12, the share is less than 18 percent.
The remuneration of teachers averages about 6.8 times the per capita GDP for those teaching in Grades
1-4; and 8.0 times for those in Grades 5-8 and 11.8 times for those in Grades 9-12.

Common standards are obviously important: they help create a network of schools with similar
characteristics and are intended to enable schools to function well. But if they are set beyond what the
country can afford (or mobilize through donor assistance), schools may meet the requirements, but only by
cutting back in other areas that eventually undermine the ability to provide a good education. The result is
a tradeoff by default. That a poor tradeoff has occurred is reflected in the continuous deterioration in
schooling conditions since 1993-94 (shown below in Figure 3). Other telling signs are a high number of
large and over-crowded schools (more than 20 percent of the government primary schools enroll more than
900 pupils; and about 25 percent of government secondary schools enroll more than 2,500 students), and
the shortage of certified teachers beyond the first cycle.

More broadly, one implication of overly ambitious standards for teacher certification and for construction
(per classroom unit costs run as high as $19,000 in some regions, with a national mean approximating
$12,000) is that fewer schools can be built and staffed for a given budget than would otherwise be the case.
This means that many villages in Ethiopia do without a government primary school and many children must
travel long distances to get to a school. In some villages the solution is offered by alternative basic
education centers (which provide a simplified and shorter instructional program) that are set up with the
help of non-governmental organizations using locally recruited teachers (who lack the formal certification
and are paid much less than certified teachers) and facilities that cost substantially less than government
schools to build. The use of para-professional teachers in government schools and the emergence of
alternative basic education centers are creative solutions to very difficult circumstances and they make an

obvious, if localized, contribution. Importantly, however, they cannot substitute for the reform of national
recruitment and construction standards that are needed to benefit the entire system of government schools.

Although government spending overall has increased dramatically in the past decade and has promoted
rapid growth of the system, a welcome shift from the past, the mix of investments has only of late been
refocused somewhat on the decline in non-salary spending
(see Figure 3 below).

Addressing the quality problem adequately in light of the size of the population still to be enrolled in
schools, the low GDP level, and still weak planning and management capacities at all levels of the system,
is a daunting challenge, but one that government is attempting to remedy by an increasingly flexible
strategic approach. Could and should government have responded to the warning signs earlier? Perhaps.
The need for quality investments has been a constant topic of dialogue between government and donors
since the mid-term review of ESDP. In light of government's commitment to achieve universal primary
(grade 1-8) enrollment within the next five years and the infrastructure and salary costs required to achieve
that target, there is concern about continuing under-investment in non-salary budget items, in particular
those related to quality indicators. Declines in quality would undermine the sustainability and proposed
increases in enrollment. Hence the sustainability rating for ESDP, given the proposed five year budget, is
"Unlikely".

Improving Financing for Education. Education's share of the total public expenditure rose from 13.8%
in 2000/01 to 17.2% in 2002/03. Since 2000 aggregate public recurrent spending on education has risen to
3% of GDP. The share for primary education (50% of the total in 2001/02 --Grades 1-8), remains less
than the developing country average of about 67% for an eight year primary cycle. With significant
increases per year in donor funding pledged to the sector per annum beginning in 2003/04, some of this
budget relief may help to improve the quality conditions in Ethiopian schools. However, continued
expansion of the tertiary level will require an increasing share of the recurrent budget (even with a new
student cost-sharing scheme in place) and may place greater pressure on government's ability to meet needs
at the primary and secondary level (see Annex 2).


4.2 Outputs by components:

                 Rating: Marginally Satisfactory

4.2.1 Basic Education Activities. Achievements in this component are rated satisfactory. Between
1996/97 and 2003/04 a total of 2,398 new primary schools were built. In line with the focus of the
program, 86% of the new schools were built in rural areas. New schools were built at a rate of about 400
schools per annum as compared to the 485 schools planned for the ESDP I period. This shortfall is
partially explained by limited implementation capacities of the regions, and delays during the period of
armed strife. In light of the concerns expressed at the outset of the project about implementation capacity,
these numbers represent a significant accomplishment. Failure to meet the construction targets, however,
together with overachievement of enrolment targets, has led to large class sizes and use of a double shift



                                                     - 16 -

system in many places.

While overall access to primary schooling has expanded over the last seven years, distance to schools is
still among the major causes of low rural enrollment (2005 Poverty Assessment). According to the Country
Status Report findings (CSR, 2004), some 33 % of rural primary children schools are estimated to live
more than 5 kilometers away from their designated school.

In order to improve the quality and relevance of basic education, several actions were taken. Primary
school teachers increased from 109,237 in 1997/98 to 126,825 in 2001/02 and to 143,321 in 2003/04;
school textbooks increased from 2.3 million in 1995/96 to 20.2 million in 200/01 and the primary school
curriculum was reformed and implemented. However, as noted above, the rates of increase in teachers and
textbooks, while impressive, did not match enrollment increases. Thus, progress towards reaching the
desired targets for pupil: teacher and pupil : textbook ratios has not been achieved despite significant
improvement in absolute terms. This problem is due in part to a weak distribution system and an
inefficient reporting and replenishment system. Some classrooms have an adequate supply of texts for
some subjects, while for other subjects there are few if any books. Books often arrive well after the start of
the school year, and in some cases do not arrive at all. Books are cheaply produced and have a short life.
Thus, although the demand for increased production has been partly met, the mechanisms for ensuring that
all schools have an adequate number of textbooks for each student and subject need much improvement.
Government has recognized this problem and a review of the textbook production and distribution system
will be carried out in 2005

The creation of teacher preparation facilities and the production of qualified graduates is a multi-year
process and is, in part, a function of the system's ability to produce secondary school graduates. The
results of government's efforts to increase the supply of teachers will be felt in several years. In the
interim, the ministry is trying to recruit individuals who are qualified to teach the lower levels of primary
school by nature of their general education and experience but who are formally uncertified as teachers.
This should provide some interim personnel and budget relief. It also represents a departure from previous
practice and is a manifestation of government's recognition that achieving enrollment targets will require
flexibility and the participation of non-governmental delivery agencies and personnel.

Non-formal education as a means of increasing access has received inadequate attention under ESDP I and
II. Very recently alternative basic education programs have started to be recognized as a viable education
strategy to reach children in remote and sparsely populated areas, and efforts are under way to increase
their use and community involvement in service delivery.

4.2.2 Secondary Education Activities. Implementation of activities under this component has been
marginally satisfactory. Over the last six years, 214 secondary schools were built (increasing the total by
61%) and enrollments increased by 83% from 426,495 to 780,636. Gross enrollment for Grades 9 and 10
reached 15.9% for girls and 28.2% for boys. However, due to the rapid increase in enrollment the
objective of reducing class size has not been realized. The pupil: class ratio in 2003/04 was 79, compared
to the target of 50 for ESDP I and 60 for ESDP II, (for the year 2004/05). Similarly, the number of
teachers increased at a lower rate than enrollments ­ from 12,106 in 1996/7 to 15,068 in 2003/04, a 25%
increase. The share of qualified teachers showed a very modest increase over the program period, reaching
48% in 2003/04, far from the target of 73.2% set for 2004/05.

4.2.3 Technical and Vocational Education and Training Activities. Implementation of activities under
this component is rated unsatisfactory. Little of the IDA credit was used for TVET activities, however
and hence with expansion of a weak program as the primary outcome for the period, this component is



                                                       - 17 -

given a weak rating. Although the number of TVET institutions increased from 17 to 158 during the ESDP
I and II period and enrolments rose from 2,924 to 87,158, the changes were largely supply driven and
standards for credentialing were introduced only recently. After a prolonged period of discussion and
reevaluation, the sub-sector is now moving in a more demand-oriented direction. Indications are that the
rapid increases in enrollment witnessed in the past few years will, in the near future, be more disciplined
and focused on critical skill areas. New programs are being developed with certifications standards
associated with them. These efforts to overhaul the TVET system will reshape training to meet actual needs
of the economy, improve training quality, and link it more closely to on-the-job skill needs by upgrading the
skills of TVET teachers and by strengthening the management of TVET. ESDP's role in this process has
been thus far limited principally to policy dialogue. The new shift in direction will be carried forward in
part by support to be provided by a new IDA credit ­ the Post Secondary Education Project.

4.2.4 Teacher Training Institutes and College Activities. The overall achievement of activities under
this component is rated marginally satisfactory. With the addition of two Teacher Training Institutes
(TTIs) under ESDP I, the capacity for training first cycle primary school teachers was increased by 1200
trainees per year, a total of 8,400 additional to date. Combined with increased enrollments at pre-existing
TTI and TTCs, a 35.5% increase in certified primary level teaching staff has been achieved. Of the lower
primary staff 98% are now certified and 54% of the upper primary staff. Secondary teachers increased
from 12,106 at the beginning of ESDP I to 15,068, a 25% increase. Approximately half of secondary
school teachers are fully certified.

Private teacher training institutes are now also being established to make up the deficit in supply. To
supplement the output of the five teacher training colleges (TTCs) which are training teachers for the
second cycle of primary school, 21,400 TTI graduates are enrolled in distance education programs to earn
their diplomas. Cluster Resource Centers are also being used for in-service teacher training. Head teachers
are being trained in school management.

Despite these gains, more emphasis could have been placed on teacher production at an earlier date to
reduce the gap produced by enrollments that exceeded projections. Unfortunately the lag time between the
decision to expand teacher training enrollments and the ability to do so has contributed to a dramatic
increase in section sizes and pupil: teacher ratios. In light of continued and even accelerating enrolment
growth, it is unlikely that pupil: teacher ratios will decline to acceptable levels in the near future.

To help offset this shortage and to address problems of instructional quality, government has started a
number of programs to enhance and improve teacher education and to prepare them better for the
difficulties of instructing in large classroom settings. Among these programs is a multi-donor funded
"teacher development program". The major interventions in this program are: (i) Teacher Education
System Overhaul which includes professional development, a review of pre-service teacher education,
curricula and selection procedures and continuous professional development of working teachers; (ii)
Leadership and Management Program which includes training for school principals, directors, deputies and
supervisors; and (iii) English language Improvement Program which is aimed at improving the English
language competence of all teachers who are using English as the medium of instruction.

4.2.5 Higher Education Activities. Achievements in this component are rated marginally satisfactory.
Program funds have been used to build classrooms, construct and equip laboratories, and purchase books
and other educational equipment to expand capacities to train more teachers, engineers, health workers, and
public administrators. According to the project appraisal document, the share of tertiary education in the
total program cost was expected to be 12 %. However, due to increased higher education activities and the
relatively better implementation rate in this sub-sector, the actual share (estimated at 20%) was


                                                       - 18 -

considerably higher than planned.

Total enrollment in higher education institutions increased from 42,132 to 172,111 over the ESDP I and II
period, or slightly over 300%. Nine public universities (4 of which were recently upgraded) together with
34 degree granting private universities and 71 diploma granting institutions provide access to
approximately 1.5% of the age cohort, still substantially less than the SSA average of 3 percent. Private
sector institutions combined provide training for 23% of the nation's higher education students.

In the Higher Education Proclamation of June 2003, the basic legal and policy framework governing the
development of higher education has been spelled out. In the last few years' private higher education
institutions have grown dramatically: in 2002/03, 35,402 students were enrolled in private higher education
institutions. Cost sharing was introduced in public institutions as of 2003. Female enrollments increased
by 5 % to 25.1% of total enrollment in 2002/03.

Although the Bank team endorsed controlled expansion of the tertiary sector, it has also expressed concern
that growth is occurring faster than management and instructional capacity at many of those public
institutions. Nearly 500 foreign staff members are currently employed as instructors. Domestic production
of MA and PhD graduates is far short of requirements to upgrade the quality of faculty let alone to reduce
the dependency on expatriates. A new Higher Education Proclamation which establishes a Quality and
Relevancy Assurance Agency, a Strategy Planning Center, and a Pedagogical Resource Center should help
to improve planning and strengthen the movement towards full autonomy for public institutions. The
sustainability of these system support units and their support of quality improvements will be enhanced by
IDA support through the Post Secondary Education Project which has just begun.

4.2.6 Institutional Development. Achievements under this component have been satisfactory for the
regions and unsatisfactory for the federal level. During the initial two years of program implementation a
considerable amount of on the job training was provided to federal and regional staff on program
implementation by Bank staff and consultants. Several formal and informal training programs were
conducted to enhance procurement, financial management, planning, implementation and monitoring and
evaluation capacities of the MOE and the Region Bureau staff.

At the federal level lead responsibilities for implementation rested in the hands of only a few individuals
charged with responsibility for multiple sector and donor programs. International procurement activities
were entrusted to EMPD, a consulting agency. Their performance lacked the quality and efficiency
necessary to keep procurement on track and error free. Considerable support from and intervention by
Bank staff was required to ensure compliance with standards and procedures. Because of the need to
contract out this work due to lack of capacity within the ministry, government's capacity at the federal level
did not improve significantly over the project period.

A series of regional and in-country technical training workshops were offered on learning assessment to
members of the National Organization for Examination (NOE). A national learning assessment program
designed to measure student achievement at grades 4 and 8 has been implemented; the first round of testing
was conducted in 2000 and the results from the second in 2004. The results from the most recent
administration test will be published and assessed for policy implications in early 2005.

The Bank also fostered the participation of Ethiopian MoE staff in a variety of international seminars and
conferences including: higher education planning, national achievement testing, multi-grade classroom
teaching, secondary education development, and the Bank's flagship education course. Informally, training
and technical assistance was also provided to staff of each Regional Bureau during the process of Bank


                                                     - 19 -

review and approval of Annual Work Plans- a project requirement. A substantial investment of time and
effort was made by Bank staff to improve the financial management and procurement capacities of both
federal and Regional Bureau staff; all requests for assistance and additional training were honored.

Some regional broadcasting studios were built and equipped to help the Education Media Agency's
(EMA)efforts to develop secondary school instruction programs, distance learning programs for teacher
upgrading and non-formal and adult education, and to assist the Regional Education Media Units (EMU).

The economic analysis undertaken during the preparation of the credit attempted to measure the potential
returns from the larger number of more educated labor force entrants, through 1995 household survey data.
The expected earnings gains were large with each additional year of schooling adding an estimated 23
percent. However, due to the nature of the sample - individuals in waged employment living in households
with a single wage earner - the results were seriously biased. A more recent analysis has been undertaken
with data from 1999/2000. The average gain for each year of education was estimated at 16 percent but the
sample drawn had many of the same characteristics as in the previous study.

Two other attempts have been used recently to assess the impact of education on productivity and income.
The first indicated that farmers with four to six years of primary schooling are significantly more
productive than those with fewer years of schooling, implying returns of 5-7 percent a year. In addition,
there was evidence of important externalities resulting from increased fertilizer use on farms adjacent to one
owned by a relatively well schooled farmer. The recent poverty analysis undertaken by the Bank provides
more information. In Ethiopia in 1999/2000, 38 percent of the population was below the poverty line. The
incidence varied by level of education of household head; the rates were 32, 21 and 9 percent for those with
some primary, completed secondary and completed post secondary respectively.

That earnings gains accrue from additional years of education was again corroborated though the gains
were below those previously estimated, apart from post secondary education. Simulations suggest that
poverty incidence would be reduced by 23 percent if all male and female adults had at least the equivalent
of 4th grade schooling.


4.4 Financial rate of return:

As a social sector investment project, ESDP was not expected to provide a direct financial rate of return for
the investments made. The anticipated social rate of return, based on dated and rather skimpy data is
discussed in the previous section. Government expects that the newly implemented "cost recovery" scheme
in higher education will put approximately 30 percent of the recurrent costs of university education back
into the system through collection of a "graduate tax". The scheme will produce the first returns in 2009.
It is too early to assess likelihood of real economic recovery produced by this plan, but the Bank education
team feels that when administrative costs and other forms of "wastage" are taken into account, the actual
return will be less than government anticipates.


4.5 Institutional development impact:

During the course of supervision missions and in between them, recommendations were made to ministry
staff on procedures for improving record keeping and monitoring and improving implementation
performance. Collectively, this technical assistance was invaluable in building capacity, especially at the
regional level. Supervision reports indicate a marked improvement and generally satisfactory performance



                                                     - 20 -

level in record keeping and procurement in most regions by the end of the project.

As part of the annual program review and approval process, each Regional Bureau was required to submit
a sub-program (Operational / Procurement Plan) for its proposed use of IDA funds for the subsequent
fiscal year. This process of submission by the regions, review and comment by the Bank and
revision/implementation by the regions resulted in a growing familiarity in the regions of principles of
planning and budgeting, and in improved financial reporting. Unfortunately, the central ministry's own
financial management and reporting requirements did not encourage the use of rolling budgets and timely
reporting of below-the-threshold procurements. At the end of the project this resulted in uncertainty about
the balance between contractual commitments made at the sub-regional level and availability of IDA credit.
Consequently a "freeze" was placed on new activities in the last year of the project to prevent an over run
of the credit. This informational disjuncture resulted in overly conservative use of the credit in the last year
and subsequently in un-utilized funds. This is one manifestation of the need to institutionalize a better
management system and improved capacity to operate it.

The procurement capacity of the central ministry improved marginally during the course of the project. The
Ministry's reliance on EMPDE for developing specifications and for conducting international procurement
resulted in frequent delays, late payments and problematic bid competitions. Despite receiving guidance
from Bank specialists and periodic interventions by Bank project staff to resolve bottlenecks, there was
little improvement in performance over the life of the project. The Ministry acknowledges this deficiency
but there is little evidence that steps have been taken to replace EMPDE or to strengthen their capacity.
With government's move to decentralize the management of primary and secondary schools, and with much
greater autonomy now given to universities to manage their own finances, this may only be a short-term
problem.

A significant threat to the viability of the investment made through ESDP is the high HIV infection rate
among teachers. Although no firm estimates are available, it is estimated that as much as 20 percent of
overall attrition in the teaching ranks may be due to AIDS. Given this prevalence rate and resulting
attrition, the recruitment of teachers needs to increase by an additional 16% annually above purely
enrollment driven growth if Ethiopia is to achieve EFA/MDG goals. As in other countries, absenteeism is
likely to have a bigger impact on education supply than mortality, with the in classroom loss equivalent of
nearly 1,000 teachers in 2002 as a result of HIV/AIDS. This problem, compounded by the interaction of
health and nutrition as contributors to high dropouts at the primary level, indicates that much more
attention needs to be given to the interaction of health and education issues in ESDP III.

Recognizing the potential impact of the HIV/AIDS problem, the Bank's lead health specialist in HDNED
was invited to join a project supervision mission to assess and advise government and the Bank's education
team on strategies for improving the response to the epidemic. The result was a recommendation to
organize a national workshop on HIV/AIDS for education officials from all the Regional Bureaus. The
workshop held in 2004 resulted in the development of region-specific response plans. Those plans are now
the cornerstone of government's intervention programs.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

The conflict with Eritrea and the recurrent drought in the country had a direct, negative impact on the
implementation and outcome of the project. The conflict led some donors to postpone or curtail their
assistance for the sector. The initial period of the conflict unfortunately coincided with the first year of the
program. The drought also had a negative effect on enrollment as it reduced the effective demand for



                                                      - 21 -

schooling. Children in the most severely affected drought areas either did not attend school at all or dropped
out of school in higher numbers than elsewhere in the country. Government also experienced difficulties in
attracting civil works contractors to work in remote areas, especially on contracts for relatively small
amounts of money. This exacerbated low implementation rates in the emerging and remote parts of the
country, where capacity limitations further inhibited growth.


5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

When this program was launched the regional decentralization policy was four years old and most regional
offices were inadequately staffed. The staff of the Federal Ministries was downsized and their direct
responsibilities for implementation were significantly reduced. Thus, the decentralization policy, although it
had longer-term potential advantages, also brought some short­term problems in the implementation of
ESDP, particularly for the emerging regions. These problems persisted well into the second year of
program implementation when most of the regions developed sufficient familiarization with the modalities
of the program and strengthened their capacities appropriately.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

High turnover and frequent changes in project staff, particularly at the regional level, affected project
implementation. The central ministry of education was responsible for international procurements. Their
capacity was inadequate, even with assistance from the Bank. The ability to handle national level
procurement was initially even more severe at the regional level. Following the mid-term review of ESDP,
the Ministry of Education contracted out its responsibilities to EMPDE, which also had very limited
capacity, as noted earlier. An assessment conducted by a special task force between November 2000 and
March 2001 identified low procurement capacity and unfamiliarity with accepted procedures as major
problem areas of program implementation. The Bank provided additional workshops and training in
procurement and frequent feedback on draft procurement plans. These efforts, together with supervision
inputs and informal counseling by Bank staff helped to improve financial management and sub-program
preparation.

The Ministry was also hampered by a weak monitoring and evaluation system, especially in terms of
financial reporting. The Ministry is working with the UNESCO to overhaul the M&E system, especially to
improve the timeliness and accuracy of data so that it can be better employed in policy analysis and
strategic planning.

5.4 Costs and financing:
At Credit closing, US$ 95.6 million was disbursed from the IDA Credit out of US$ 100 million and about
US$15 million for capital expenses from Government's counterpart funds. The largest share of the
disbursement was on primary education, although slightly less than the level anticipated at appraisal: about
60% of the program cost. This was mainly due to the under-spending on primary education in the weaker
regions and the faster rate of enrollment expansion than was expected in higher education and TVET,
especially in the last two years of ESDP. As noted earlier, a more responsive financial reporting scheme
would have permitted full utilization of the credit.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The overall rating given the project is (marginally) "Unlikely". The investments made under ESDP I and
II are fairly firmly entrenched, and quality in existing institutions can increase if resources are
appropriately harnessed to that end. However, the sustainability of future growth, on the scale witnessed



                                                      - 22 -

over the past seven years, is unlikely unless substantially more resources are invested in the system and
only if the cost effectiveness and quality measures just now being implemented are protected and further
nurtured. Government's next five year education strategy (ESDP III) places very heavy emphasis on
further expansion of university level and TVET education while maintaining investments in quality related
underpinning of a strong education system at past, insufficient levels.

The principal objective of substantially increasing student enrollment at the primary level was met. In the
face of significant obstacles including war, drought, donor withdrawals, low capacity particularly at
decentralized levels, difficult and sparsely populated terrain, significant health and nutrition problems, and
severe capacity constraints, implementation of ESDP generally succeeded when it could easily have failed.

The tremendous growth in student enrollment has brought with it the problem of under-investment in
quality-related interventions. As noted earlier, textbooks are still in short supply (although over twenty
million were produced during the project period), class sizes often exceed 100, and dropout rates remain
unacceptably high. Yet, supervision missions revealed a refreshing sense of optimism among teachers and
administrators, even under dire learning circumstances.

It is evident that learning is taking place despite difficult conditions. Reviews with donors and on-going
dialogue with government indicate that steps are being taken, in so far as budget and capacity permit, to
address the quality issues, especially at the primary school level. In the past two years, government has put
in place a number of low-cost schemes to help offset the shortage of funds that can be allocated to
interventions to address the weakening indicators of quality. Their impact is just beginning to be felt. As
technical and management capacities increase, the recurrent budget, especially for non-salary items, will be
the biggest obstacle to realizing the MDG targets for education.

Secondary, TVET and university enrollments have increased and recent parliament-approved reform
proclamations for university education and TVET give new mandates to these sub-sectors that will make
them both more accountable and more independent. There is a strong recognition by government that
management and administration of the system, at all levels, needs to be improved and steps are being taken
to achieve those ends. Fiscal management and reporting, especially in the Regional Bureau offices (most,
but not all) have improved significantly in the past four years. These skills need to be transferred now to the
woreda level under the new decentralized structure - a task that will not be easily or quickly accomplished.

There is a danger that quality could further deteriorate without proper guidance over the short-term from
regional offices. However, ESDP helped to develop a cadre of experienced administrators and education
officials at the regional level and they are in a position now to inculcate those skills to the next level of the
bureaucracy. That transition will be uneven and steps need to be taken to ensure that the weakest regions /
woredas are not left further behind.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

Government's ESDP-II program is supported by multiple bilateral and several multilateral donors,
including the World Bank. Very strong synergy exists among the donors who have united to support
government's sector development strategy, largely through sector budget support. The majority of donors,
including the World Bank, are providing resources for basic and secondary education through budget
support for the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

However, overall foreign assistance for the education sector is surprisingly low, comprising just 7% to 10%
of total development aid over the past five years (World Bank, 2003). It is expected that donor assistance
to education will approach 580 million Birr in 2004/05, or about 11% of the education budget. In light of



                                                       - 23 -

the still pressing developing needs of Ethiopia as a whole, and the education sector in particular, it may be
imperative that donors increase their level of assistance to the country (currently $12 per capita- about
one-half the average for other SSA countries) if medium-term objectives are to be met.

Even with more resources available to it, unless greater efficiency measures are put in place by
government, it will be difficult to meet MDG and other development targets. Plans to further expand higher
education and the political need to meet the expected demand for more secondary school places will put
further strain on the fiscal capacity to meet sector needs.

The challenges facing education growth and improvement in Ethiopia remain significant. As one of the
poorest nations in the world, its education statistics are among the lowest. Although it has made significant
progress, government will continue to need major sector inputs of external technical and financial
assistance for at least another decade. These resource requirements will be paramount for the next five
years but, as capacity grows, so will the ability to use resources in more innovative and effective ways.
With the move to budget support, there is an even stronger need to enhance some of the capacity
development activities (formal and informal, structured and unstructured) that were such an important part
of ESDP. It is imperative for donors and government to maintain those capacity development linkages even
as the funding mechanisms become less "transaction intensive".

Consultative meetings between donors and government that grew and matured under ESDP I and II (Joint
Review Missions, Annual Review missions, Monthly Ministry-Donor meetings, etc) should continue to
serve as the basis for formal policy level dialogue and strategic planning. However, informal channels such
as those that existed under ESDP need to be nurtured and sustained as well.


7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Rating: Satisfactory.

The Bank's performance during preparation and appraisal of the program was satisfactory. The Bank's
active engagement and its leading role in coordinating the consultations between various donors and
Government and the technical assistance it provided during the implementation of the PHRD project, was
highly satisfactory. The Bank team provided critical expert advice during the design and preparation of this
complex program, to be implemented in a country which at the time was undergoing rapid transformation.
The chief criticism is that the Bank and government teams did not adequately reflect the shortcomings in
implementation capacities in the design of implementation arrangements, particularly for the weaker
regions.

Supervision missions were conducted twice annually and were supplemented by site visits and technical
assistance provided by FO staff. The Bank provided leadership in calling attention to the need to address
problems of education quality and efficiency. In hindsight, perhaps the Bank might have offered more
flexibility in support of the recurrent budget and explored other means of support to the general budget at
an earlier stage: more resources could have been directed to textbooks, hiring of instructional aides to
reduce the pupil: teacher ratio, etc. However, even with budget shortages, government embarked upon
new, expensive large scale projects, such as distance education for secondary schools and rapid expansion
of tertiary enrollments. From the time of the Mid Term Review, the Bank team emphasized the importance
of bringing balance to the program to achieve both expansion and quality.




                                                      - 24 -

7.2 Supervision:

Rating: Satisfactory.

The Bank's supervision performance is rated satisfactory. This project was among the projects selected for
excellent performance in supervision in 1999. The task team was praised for its proactivity and frank
assessment. Bank supervisions were not only conducted twice a year but implementation support advice
was given from the field more frequently during the interim period and often in one-to one and group
sessions.

The Bank team was successful in bringing to the attention of the Government and Bank top management
the need to address the serious implementation issues facing the project in October 2000. This led to the
formation of a special Joint Task Force which identified the major implementation constraints and
recommend actions to address them. One of the major areas of weakness identified by the Task Force was
the inadequate procurement capacity of the implementing agencies. Following the recommendation of this
Task Force, ten days of procurement training were provided to some 400 regional and federal procurement
staff by the MoE with the support of the Bank in April 2001.

Another major implementation problem identified by the Task Force was the delay in the preparation,
submission and approval of draft annual (sub-program) Work Plans, leaving less than a full fiscal year to
implement each annual program. The task force recommended that Government shift from an annual to a
three year rolling budgeting system.

Bank supervision missions were not only used to review chronic implementation issues but also to flag
specific contract management issues. For example, in one of its supervision missions, the Bank team noted
significant implementation delays in ten very large civil works contracts. The total value of these ten
contracts was about US$10 million and, according to the completion date agreed in the contract agreement,
nine of these contracts should have been completed with payments amounting to US$ 9.24 million paid at
the time of the review. However, only US$ 3.18 million had been disbursed. The mission pointed out that at
this rate of progress not more than 60% of the works would be completed prior to the project closing date.
The mission used such reviews to suggest that government take appropriate actions to speed up the pace of
construction to ensure that these and other similar contracts were completed in time.

Following the mid-term review, supervision missions were modified to ensure that (i) all sub programs and
components were reviewed on each mission and that (ii) each mission would bring a focus to one special
policy or implementation issue. A technical specialist appropriate to the topic was brought on each of these
missions to ensure that the necessary technical competency was present as part of the team's collective
skills. Special topics, as reflected in the Aide Memoires included: quality issues in higher education, review
of HIV/AIDS programs, review of school construction guidelines and costs, the use of ICT, examination of
TVET programs, and financial management. These observations subsequently led to, among other
products, a major piece of sector work on higher education and resulting project (PSEP), a national
planning conference on strategies for addressing HIV/AIDS in schools, several further consultancies to
draft lower cost construction guidelines for ministry consideration. Aide Memoires and studies produced by
the Bank team under ESDP were highly valued by government and other donors as sources of information
and analysis.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.




                                                    - 25 -

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory because of (i) the quality of support it provided during
program preparation and appraisal; (ii) the quality of its supervision, and the continuous technical support
it provided for enhancing implementation; (iii) advice offered to government on policies, quality
enhancement and efficiency improvement strategies; (iv) the positive activities and actions that emerged
from supervision missions and their special thematic approaches; (v) ability to resolve management
roadblocks and to reduce review and approval processes to less than one week on average over the last two
years of the program; and (vi) the lead, but informal, role it played in donor coordination and
harmonization.


Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Rating: Satisfactory.

Project preparation was very good since it was based on the results of a number of key studies and wide
consultations with clients and other donors. This was a borrower­owned program although it was prepared
with considerable technical advice and input from many donors, including the World Bank.


7.5 Government implementation performance:
Rating: Satisfactory (marginally). Although Government's performance was unsatisfactory during the
initial two years of the program, the overall project performance has been satisfactory. Most of the
program's access objectives have been met or exceeded. Even though quality related advances did not keep
pace with the explosion in enrollment, increases in textbook production, numbers of teachers trained or
types of skills upgraded, and new initiatives were substantial. Government resource contributions
increased significantly and fully met expectations despite a period of war and severe drought.

In the first eighteen months of the project, the average monthly disbursement rate was very low, but
increased to $1.8 million in the subsequent 36 months. Generally, government counterpart funding was not
a problem, except that inadequate resources were allocated for recurrent expenditures, particularly for
non-salary inputs. The emphasis on access/ expansion versus quality improvement is a tension in the
project, but not unexpected given the rapid rate of expansion.

Under government's proportion-based allocation system, there was little flexibility to shift funds from one
region to another even when it was evident that some would not be used during a specific FY. This is a real
constraint to more rapid development, despite the appearance of inequity that results. Under-developed
regions need to be given additional support so that their ability to use funds is equal to that of the more
advanced regions.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Rating: Overall Marginally Satisfactory, with significant variations by level and region. The low
implementation rate during the initial years was due primarily to the unfamiliarity of Regional Education
Bureau staff with the operational modalities of the Bank (and government) and interruptions caused by the
war with Eritrea. The implementation rate improved as the number of regions strengthened their
implementation capacities and gained experience in and familiarity with program management.

Procurement performance was adversely affected by capacity limitations, both at the central and regional
levels. The following problems were noted with regularity during supervision missions: (i) poor quality of
procurement documents; (ii) delays in procurement processing; (iii) use of inappropriate procedures; and
(iv) inadequate capacity for monitoring of procurement plans and physical reports on progress of




                                                     - 26 -

procurement activities.

The Independent Procurement Review also identified the following key weaknesses in the procurement
system: (i) missing files and information; (ii) delays in contract processing; (iii) performance securities or
contracts missing in files; and (iv) advertised announcements not in accordance with Bank guidelines.

Despite these problems, Aide Memoires from supervision missions in the latter years of the project noted
that significant improvements in procurement and financial management had taken place, especially in the
major regions of the country. Delayed audits were a problem through the project however.


7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Rating: Marginally Satisfactory. The overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory (marginally). Its
inputs to the preparation and implementation of the program were satisfactory and their drive to ensure the
achievement of most of the key educational objectives of the country was evident throughout the project. A
number of initiatives have been introduced to begin to address the quality problems affecting the primary
education system in particular. When fully implemented and their results felt, these shifts should produce a
larger, more efficient system characterized by better student learning, decentralized decision making and
improved accountability through the use of standardized testing and improved curricula.

Despite concerns about government's under-investment in quality related components, the marginally
satisfactory rating accorded to overall government performance reflects the commitment made to the sector
both in terms of government's own investments and the high priority given to the sector in Ethiopia's
development policy framework. Recognition of the importance of keeping quality investments parallel to
expansion gains has come to government, albeit belatedly and despite early warnings by the World Bank
and other donors. The recent steps taken by government to raise levels of quality, if rigorously
implemented, should bear fruit in the next few years even though the pressure to allocate resources for
continued expansion of the system, especially at the upper levels, is significant.

8. Lessons Learned

A seven year project as complex as ESDP renders many lessons to be applied to future investments in
Ethiopia and elsewhere. The following is a list of the principal lessons which are not meant to be presented
in an order of hierarchical importance.

a)       Expect the unexpected and build sufficient flexibility into the program so that the efficacy of
investments are not contingent upon the involvement of other donor partners. Natural (drought) and
unnatural (war) events require programmatic and administrative tolerance and patience.
b)       Donor harmonization is difficult to achieve, has high transaction costs, but is essential to the
success of complex, interwoven programs such as ESDP. The time and effort are worth the investment.
c)       Procurement and financial management training, especially in the context of low overall capacity,
are essential to disbursement and implementation success. Expect rapid turn over of staff and the need to
make training a repetitive and iterative process.
d)       Early intervention is critical to eliminating bottlenecks that could lead to lengthy delays in
procurement and or approval of plans. Guidance needs to be specific and solution-oriented, not in the form
of additional questions and critique. Clients must be encouraged to be quickly forthcoming when they
encounter difficulties and be rewarded with advice that moves the project forward, not by criticism and
threats.
e)       Supervision should be seen as an on-going, not just a semi-annual process. Frequent visits to the
field reduce the" threat" factor to clients and should be viewed as a support activity, not one during which


                                                       - 27 -

criticism is paramount.
f)       In situations with high levels of localized procurement and with funds flowing from the central
ministry, it is critical to have in place a funds management system that will enable tracking of expenditures
in a timely and effective manner. Failure to do so may result in significant over run of the credit with
problematic implications for government's own fiscal commitments, or under-utilization of much needed
funds such as was the case with ESDP.
g)       Sub-sector programs need to be developed as part of systemic whole- both in terms of the financial
envelope available to the sector, and in terms of push and pull forces generated by production of graduates
within the system and the demand for them outside the system.
h)       Positioning local staff as co-TTLs, when possible, provides a high level of local contact especially
in between formal missions, provides for immediate removal of administrative obstacles/delays, and affords
contextual perspective in project management.
i)       The use of "special issue" themes in supervision missions, in addition to the normal review of
progress for all components, worked well and produced valuable spin-off products unanticipated prior to
the missions.
j)       The balance between expansion and quality is a difficult one to achieve. Midway through ESDP it
became apparent that an imbalance was in the making. Government has taken steps to begin to redress the
problem, but donors need to be cognizant that over-emphasis on achieving enrollment targets at all costs
may well be counter productive. Establishing targets that are ambitious but meaningful helps to preserve
the validity of sector development plans.
k)       Sector plans are meant to be living documents, iterative in implementation. However, under ESDP
II, significant new initiatives emerged, some of which were not costed in the ESDP II plan or which
represented significant departures from anticipated budget trajectories (higher education and TVET under
ESDP II). Innovation is welcome but opportunity costs and trade-offs need to be very carefully evaluated
and costed for their implications both in the medium and long term.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

Contribution of the Bank Support in Achieving the ESDP Objectives

The World Bank has been one of the major sources of funds in implementing the Education Sector
Development Program (ESDPI and II). The completed credit, (Number 3077 ET) financed activities in
ESDP I and the first two years of ESDP II. The range of activities financed by the Bank involves primary
to tertiary education including teacher training institutes and colleges and TVET centers. The specific areas
of activities cover providing facilities i.e. civil works (new construction, upgrading, renovation, additional
classrooms), furniture and equipment, vehicles etc. The substantive number of both the primary and
secondary schools mentioned above were financed by the Bank.

The other important quality input is the provision of various instructional materials and textbooks,
supporting pre-service and in-service trainings of teachers. The Bank has also been involved in the
institutional capacity building supporting the capacity building of the educational administrators.

Managing the Special Account

The special account opened at the National Bank of Ethiopia for this project is administered by the Counter
Part Fund Unit in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. The fund flows through Channel 1.
That is the system where funds flow from the Federal MOFED down the line in the Government finance
structure where the implementing agencies (MOE, REB, Zones and Woredas) obtain the funds from the
corresponding finance organs at the different tiers. Channel 1 was the modality preferred by the
Government when ESDP1 was launched. In conformity to this, the World Bank and the African
Development Bank took the lead to use this Channel (Channel 1b earmarked). The advantage of this
channel is that although donor requirements are involved the channel enables resources to flow to the sector
directly from the budget and it enables integrated planning, budgeting and accounting.

The duties performed by the Unit in managing the special account through this channel include:
l Transfer of funds from special accounts to regions. Bureaus of Finance and Economic Development
    (BOFED) at the regional level are responsible for managing the transferred funds, consolidation of
    Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).
l Receive the SOEs from the Regions and Federal Ministry of Education, which justifies the use of
    funds;
l Prepare consolidated statements and send an application for withdrawal to the World Bank for the
    replenishment of the special account.

The main problems encountered in the implementation of the system in terms of special account
management are the following:

l Special Account fund shortage. Towards the end of loan disbursements, the Bank initiates a recovery
    procedure to obtain full documentation for the amount of outstanding advance. When the recovery
    process begins, the Bank applies part of the amount documented in each replenishment application to
    reduction of the outstanding advances. This decreases the amount of money to be deposited in the
    special account, which leads to a shortage of funds in the special account. Consequently, there will not
    be enough money to be transferred to the implementing bodies. This means, funds are not reaching the
    implementing bodies on time and in the amounts needed to pay contractors and suppliers. The special
    accounts are thus not revolving fast enough to provide the resources needed by the implementing
    agencies.
l Delays in SOE reports from regional states. The SOEs reaching MOFED most of the time contain
    many errors, and correcting them requires several correspondences with regions, which in turn
    lengthens the replenishment time by the Bank. The major errors committed in preparing SOEs are:

         - Submission of SOEs without supporting documents such as contractual agreement for contracts
         above the threshold, lacking Bank's prior approval, and Bank guarantee for advances, payment
         certificate, invoices;
         - Percentage of expenditure to be financed under the credit are not indicated on the SOEs and
         checked properly (100% for training, operating costs, consultants' services, and 90% for civil
         works and goods);
         - Each category of expenditures i.e. civil works, goods and operating costs is not listed separately
         on SOE;
         - Issue one invoice for different contracts done by one contractor.

l Lack of adequate familiarity with the Bank's procedures by regional states.
l Lack of coordination among different concerned departments of MOFED, Federal MOE, and World

    Bank country office. As a result of poor coordination, it was observed during implementation that most
    regions over committed funds.
l Delay of monthly financial reports from the regional finance bureaus for consolidation and audit. As a
    result, there is always a delay in audited financial reports. MOFED is responsible for closing the
    accounts and getting the audit reports. The experience-to-date with this program suggests that periodic
    delays in the submission of audit reports were caused primarily by account backlogs with Regions.

The main causes of the problems in the area of special account management are:

l Shortage of skilled manpower to process SOEs in regions;
l Insufficient number of seminars on the Bank's procedures, especially in light of high staff turnover.


The transfers of funds from the special account are based on the sub-programs prepared by the respective
implementing agencies. However, every year the submission of the sub program by the implementing
bodies is late. As a result, the available time left in the FY is insufficient for full implementation and most
of the budget expires without being used. The cumulative effect of this is to cause delays in the
implementation of the credit on the one hand, and, on the other, the weaker regions get less from the credit
since the better performing regions are getting more every year. As of 19 August 2004 about 92% of the
loan was disbursed. Out of this, Afar, Somali, Benishangul Gumuz, Gambella and D/Dawa received 2.6%,
1.4%, 3.4%, 2.2% and 0.9% respectively. This is mainly because of their lower absorptive capacity
compared to the others. The disbursement profile for these regions shows no disbursement at all in some of
the years. On the other hand, the first year disbursement was too low. This is because during the start-up
period the implementing bodies were trying to familiarize themselves with the procurement procedures of
the Bank. The situation is seen improving as the implementers built their capacity.

actual expenditure by category is available only for procurements with a prior review requirement. For
those which are below this threshold the data are not organized.

Managing the Procurement

The government decentralized procurement activities to the regions for the primary & secondary schools,
TVET centers, and teacher training institutes. This made procurement a bit demanding in view of the
capacity of the regions to handle the task. Consequently, the Bank undertook several training programs.

Nonetheless, because of the turnover problem, a capacity gap was created which affected smooth
implementation. In addition to providing training, the Bank tried to help the regions by introducing
simplified tender documents for NCB procurement items below the prior review threshold. The Bank also
took the initiative to harmonize its procurement procedures with the government for NCB. The prior
review requirement remained for procurement above the threshold where the approval process is consuming
the actual implementation time. Moreover, to facilitate implementation, the Bank encouraged the regions to
use the simple option regarding the primary school design. Regions also benefited from technical assistance
provided by the members of the Resident Mission through frequent visits to the respective regions.

The procurement related to tertiary education was handled by the ESDP and Planning Department (except
for the procurement of goods through ICB for which the Ministry used the service of EMPDE Education
Materials Production and Distribution Agency / Government Enterprise). The planning Department played
a coordinating role for this project. This involved providing technical assistance to the regions such as
reviewing the documents before they were forwarded to the Bank. In this regard, since there was lack of
capacity, documents were often returned back for further improvement. "

10. Additional Information

Lack of access by both the government and the Bank to regional and sub-regional level data on
expenditures and below-threshold contract commitments proved to be a frustrating exercise in financial
management for all parties. Without accurate and timely data, an accurate expenditure total could not be
estimated or a burn-rate projected for the final months of the project. To err on the conservative side,
expenditures for new and important undertakings involving the IDA credit were not approved by the central
ministry. This occurred despite several written requests to regional offices by the Ministry and even
MoFED. While the failure to use some $4 million of the credit is frustrating, especially because it was
unnecessary, the underlying problem of weak fiscal management is critical and needs to be addressed by
government.

With decentralization of basic education services, and a move to budget support, appropriate fiscal
monitoring will be essential to ensure equitable and appropriate patterns of expenditure, especially for the
non-salary budget which underscores so much of instructional quality. The solution to the problem lies in
both strengthening capacity development and improving mechanisms and procedures of information flow.

As with most of the other issues raised in this report, government is cognizant of these problems and is
struggling to put better practice into place. Constrained by both fiscal limitations and shortages in human
resource capacity, it is a difficult journey, but one in which they are determined to succeed.

The first two Tables above--Project Cost by Component and Project by Procurement Arrangements
(Appraisal Estimate) cannot be completed as they are not available in the PAD. Annex 1 of the PAD,
provides only the Total ESDP cost by Program Component and not disaggregated by financing
source ( see Annex 3, 5 of the PAD). Since IDA was expected to be a financier of last resort after other
donors were to have picked components they wanted to finance, the PAD does not contain a breakdown of
cost by expenditure components as normally would have been estimated at appraisal. (See Table A6.2 in
the PAD).

At the Overall Program level the share of each of major component were estimated as follows:

 2.1: Education Sector Development Program Cost by Components (Appraisal Estimate)
                Program Component                            Share of the Total Program Cost
Basic Education                                                            63 %

Actual Project Cost by Component and Project Financing by component.

The breakdowns of actual project costs and financing have not been consolidated either at the
Ministries of Education or Finance and Economic Development. The Bank team requested
MoFED and MoE to develop consolidated expenditure data on all contracts approximately two
years prior to the closing of the project when they were reminded that without these data there
was a possible danger of over commitment of IDA funds.The inability of either Ministry to obtain
a full set of data from the regions pinpoints a major administrative flaw in the reporting system
which resulted in an underutilization of the IDA credit funds. Based on available data to the Bank
for contracts above the prior review threshold and on the list of SOE submissions, the actual
procurement procudures utilized are shown in the table above and disbursement by the major
components are provided below (as a percentage of $92.1 million expended):

   Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits


The World Bank credit of US$100 million was made effective in December 1998 and formed part of the
overall donor support for the Government's ESDP (I and II) which has been implemented at a total government
expenditure of approximately USD 146 million (ESDP I) and USD 572 million (ESDP II). Essentially, the
credit has helped to support a program covering all sub sectors of education. While the credit proceeds have
been utilized according to annually agreed plans and mainly for capital expenditures, the economic impact of
the credit needs to be evaluated in the context of the whole program.

Four major sets of potential benefits from the program were identified in the Program Appraisal Document:

a) an increase in the average level of labor productivity resulting from a greater number of better educated
entrants to the labor force;
b) increases in social equity (a central justification for public expenditures) as opportunities increased greatest
for poor rural children, particularly girls;
c) an improvement in the efficiency of the system through reducing repetition and dropout rates;
d) an increase in the overall financial resource base for education through an expansion of the private sector
and more cost sharing, an increased share of GDP
   for public education expenditure from 3.8 to 4.6 percent, and an increased share of total public education
expenditures for the primary sub sector which was
   seen as the source of the greatest social returns.

The rates of enrolment expansion throughout the system over the period of the credit have been very high.
Between 1998/99 and 2002/03, they increased in the first phase of primary schooling by 35.6 percent, in the
second phase by 98.4 percent and in general secondary by 58.7 percent and, according to the analyses
described above, ultimately can be expected to increase the average level of labor productivity and decrease the
incidence of poverty. Of some concern, however, are the deteriorating conditions in the classrooms. Across
primary schools between 1997 and 2001, pupils per teacher increased from 51 to 64, and pupils per section
from 64 to 74. In rural schools, both ratios are over 70. Across secondary schools, the increases were from 40
to 50 and from 72 to 83 respectively. Real non-salary spending per student in 2001 was again back to the level
in 1997 having fallen in the intervening years.

Social equity

The changes in male/female, urban rural, regional enrolments and/or enrolment rates have been described
earlier in the document. Inequities, although falling, are persistent.

Internal efficiency

Repetition and dropout both reduce the efficiency of the school system. They remain high in the primary cycle.
The survival rate to grade 4 has been consistently only around 60 percent over the past few years while in both
1999/00 and 2001/02 the survival rate to grade 8 was 36 percent. The overall indicator of efficiency in
2001/02 had virtually the same value as in 1997/98. There are some signs of recent improvement. The average
repetition rate fell from 12 percent in 1998/99 to 6.7 percent in 2002/03 though it still averages over 10
percent between grades 4 and 8. The primary dropout rate averaged 17.1 percent in 2001/02 compared to 12.1
percent in 1997/98 and 19.0 percent in 1998/99. The declining trends in pupil: teacher and pupil: section ratios
described above are likely to be responsible for the lack of improvement in the internal efficiency of the
primary cycle.

Expenditures on education

Data from the Household Income and Consumption Expenditure Survey for 1999/2000 suggest that
households contribute almost 20 percent of the total financial cost of primary education and just over one
quarter of the cost of post primary education. It is not clear how these shares have changed over the life of the
ESDP. In 2003, the government announced its intention of introducing a graduate tax to cover the full costs of
meals, accommodation and health services plus 15 percent of estimated tuition costs- at the university level. In
the short run this will have a relatively small impact on government finances. However, by 2020, Bank
calculations suggest the income from the scheme as currently designed could represent around 20 percent of
the total cost of running the higher education system.

Around one quarter of education expenditures have been for capital expenditure. Overall, expenditures on
education have been increasing faster than GDP but, at least to 2001/02, have not increased faster than overall
expenditures. The initial estimates for 2002/03 imply a small acceleration.

While education sector expenditures as a share of GDP have certainly risen, the allocation of recurrent
expenditures across the sub sectors is not following the anticipated trend. The PAD projections implied that
the share for primary schooling would increase slightly over the program period from 60.1 percent in 1997/98
to 60.9 percent in 2001/02 and that there would be a slight decrease in the share for secondary from 11.6
percent to 11.4 percent. A detailed analysis of expenditures recently completed shows a rather different
picture. The share for primary schooling in 1997/98 is estimated to have been 64.8 percent but to have fallen
to 54.4 percent by 2001/02. The share for secondary has been roughly constant as projected but at a level of
around 8.5 percent. Conversely, the share for TVET has increased from around 1.4 percent to 5.1 percent and
for tertiary education from 11.9 percent to 17.3 percent. The share for primary schooling is well below that
commonly found. Considering the length of this cycle in Ethiopia, a share of around 66 percent could be
expected.

These differences in projected shares of recurrent expenditures might be countered by the argument that in
those sub sectors where the share has fallen (particularly primary schooling), the real levels of resources have
still increased significantly. For instance, expenditures on primary schooling increased by 40 percent between
1997/98 and 2001/02. However, the information provided above on rising numbers of pupils per teacher does
suggest that the below-projected share is indeed having a deleterious effect on the sub sector. Detailed analysis
of the 2001/02 budget indicates that for grades 1-4, non-salary costs are below 4 percent of total recurrent
expenditures and for the whole primary cycle, the share is below 6 percent . Again, this suggests that the
declining share for the sub sector is having an adverse effect on the required level of inputs and hence, most
probably, on the quality of teaching and the achievement of the pupils.

Overall, capital expenditures in the education sector increased from 11.00 percent of total capital expenditures
in 1997/98 to an estimated 12.6 percent in 2002/03. The program anticipated a share of 59.9 percent for the
primary cycle, 10.4 percent for general secondary education, and 13.1 percent for tertiary education and the
remaining 16.6 percent for the other sub sectors. The outturn, at least to 2000/01, appears to have been rather
different. Between 1998/99 and 2000/01, the shares for primary and higher education averaged around 37
percent and 34 percent respectively.

Fiscal sustainability.
Educational expenditure as a share of total government domestic revenues has increased only slightly over the
period of the credit and compared to several other African countries, it remains relatively modest. Donor
support has been funding a growing share of the total government program and planned increases in budget

support in coming years will provide for a further anticipated expansion of the system. Government forecasts
show Education's share of total recurrent expenditure increasing from 16.8 percent in 2002/03 to 23.9 percent
in 2006/07. If this occurred, it would mean that Ethiopia would be among those developing countries
contributing the highest shares of total expenditures to the education sector.
