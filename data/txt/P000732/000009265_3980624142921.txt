Ethiopia                                                              Education Sector Development Program
A. Program Development Objetie
1. Sector Background
Ethiopia's education sector is characterized by low enrollment at all levels. Only about one out of three
primary school age children attend primary school. The gross enrollment ratio (GER) in 1995/96 was 30% for
Grades 1 to 8. Only one in ten school age youth attend secondary school and tertiary education is open to a
smaller fraction of those completing secondary education. Regional disparities are also prevalent with urban areas
having higher gross enrollment ratios (GER) than less developed regions such as Afar and Somali. Except for
Addis Ababa, gender disparities also exist with girls having significantly lower GERs than boys.
Low and declining quality is a problem contributing to high dropouts and repetition rates, especially for
girls. About a third of the students enrolled in Grade One drop out and close to one-fifth of the remaining students
repeat. Poor performance is linked with inadequate facilities (due to long standing neglect and civil strife, a
number of schools in the country are in need of major repair), lack of teaching materials (textbook to student ratio
is 1:5), inadequate teacher training (only about 85% in primary, 30% in junior secondary and 40% in senior
secondary are qualified for their post), and a curriculum that fails to take into account regional, cultural and
linguistic differences. Science, language and culture components seem too theoretical, lacking enough practical
material to prepare students to lead productive lives in their communities.
In spite of some recent gains in enrollment and numbers of schools and teachers, the educational system,
particularly at the primary level, is still suffering from acute problems of accessibility, quality, equity and
relevance at all levels.
In order to address the above issues, the Government embarked on a set of political, economic, and social
reforms, and formulated a new Education and Training Policy and Strategy (1994). The policy's main goal is to
restructure and expand the education system in ways that are directly relevant to the present and future
requirements of the economy. The policy's scope encompasses formal education from kindergarten to tertiary
education, special needs education, and non-formal education. Its objectives are the following:
=> To make education more relevant and to link schools closer to the community by use of local languages as
a medium of instruction at the primary level.
= To increase students' access to textbooks by reducing the textbook/pupil ratio from 1:5 to 1:1 in core
subjects (language, math and science).
> To enable increasing numbers of students to complete 8 years of basic education by changing the existing
structure of 6-2-4 to 8-2-2.
=> To provide a good quality primary education with an ultimate aim of achieving universal primary
enrollment over a period of 20 years.
> To make education relevant by providing problem solving skills and well rounded education catering to
the needs of the individual and the society.
=' To provide vocational education and training at different levels attuned to the manpower requirements of
the economy.
> To provide a secondary education of appropriate quality in an equitable way.
> To promote a higher education of good quality, relevance, and focusing on research and development
=> To make available special and non-formal education in line with the needs and capability of the country.
= To improve the quality of training, professional competence and career structure of teachers and other
professionals.

Ethiopia                                                             Education Sector Development Program
=> To streamline the management and organization of the education system so as to make it decentralized,
coordinated, participatory, professional and efficient.
= To increase education financing by encouraging community participation, introducing cost sharing
mechanisms, and involving the private sector in the provision of education.
=> to improve the collaboration and coordination of the education sector with other relevant sectors.
The Education and Training Strategy focuses on four major areas: First, the restructuring of the education
system: a kindergarten system for children aged 4-6 years; primary education from Grades 1-8 divided into the
first cycle (Grades 1-4) for basic education and the second cycle (Grades 5-8) for general education; general
secondary education from Grades 9-10; senior secondary education of 2 years (Grades 11-12) to prepare for higher
education; a vocational and technical education system that runs parallel with formal education; higher education
of 1-2 years for diploma and 3-5 years for undergraduate degree and an additional 1-3 years of post-graduate
degree; non-fornal, adult and distance education, as well as special needs education that are coordinated with the
rest of the educational system. Second, a curriculum change in line with the new education objectives and to
increase the relevance of education in order to meet the needs of communities. Third, an improvement in the
quality of education throughout the system. Fourth, the expansion of primary and vocational education to meet
the demands of the country and economy and to attain some equity and sustainability.
2. Program Objectives
The Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) is an expenditure program that translates the
Government's far-reaching policy and strategy into action. The program covers the first five years of a 20-year
sector development program and was launched by the Government in 1997/98. Activities of the first year of the
program are supported by Government and donors through on-going projects. The framework for the ESDP,
developed by the Government, was presented to the Consultative Group meeting of donors in December 1996.
This resulted in a partnership between the Government and the donors to jointly prepare the program for external
financing.
ESDP Objectives. The objective of the first five-year phase of ESDP is to improve the overall educational
attainment of the population, while achieving greater social equity. Its longer-term objective is to achieve
universal basic education by 2015. For the first five-year phase of ESDP the Government has set the following
targets:
=> expand access to education with special emphasis on primary education in rural areas, raising enrollment
from 3.1 million to 7 million, and increasing the primary enrollment ratio from 30% to 50%;
> improve equity by improving enrollment ratios for disadvantaged groups: increase girls' enrollment from
38% to 45%, and increase rural relative to urban enrollment;
=> improve efficiency of the education system by reducing dropout and repetition rates;
=> improve quality and relevance by providing books, reducing the student to book ratio from 5:1 to 1:1 in
core subjects, and by curriculum improvements and teacher training; and
=> improve financing for education by increasing public spending on education from 3.8% to 4.6% of GDP
and facilitating private sector and community financing of education within the target of 5% of ESDP
spending.

Ethiopia                                                                Education Sector Development Program
B. Strategic Context;      i 
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the program (see Annex 1)
CAS document number: 17009-ET - Date of latest CAS discussion: August 19, 1997
The latest Country Assistance Strategy (August 1997) for Ethiopia sets as a goal the improvement in
human capital and the provision of direct and immediate benefits to the poor as a foundation for sustained long-
term development. This is justified on the basis of extremely low educational attainment in the country. The
existing gender and urban bias, which are manifested in school enrollments, are identified for immediate
attention. The CAS calls for an increase in the overall gross primary enrollment rate to 50% by 2002 and at least
25% in disadvantaged areas.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy
Key sectoral issues are: (a) high direct and indirect cost of schooling; (b) regional, urban/rural and gender
disparity in schooling; (c) poor quality of education; (d) inadequate resources; (e) inefficient use of resources;
and (f) weak management capacity throughout the system. In identifying the issues and developing strategies to
address them, the Government has benefited greatly from a dozen diagnostic studies of the education sector that
were undertaken over two years (1996-98) with funding from  a Japanese Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) grant.
Issue (a) - high direct and indirect cost of schooling. High opportunity cost of children's schooling,
particularly during agricultural peak seasons (PHRD grant studies: Household Demand for Education,
1996), and cash cost of schooling (PHRD grant studies: Cost and Financing of Education, 1996).
Government strategy is to reduce opportunity cost to parents with flexible school calendar that avoids
overlap with agricultural peak periods, shortened school days that allow children time for chores at
home, and reduced financial burden on families by abolishing school fees up to Grade 10.
Issue (b) - regional, urban/rural and gender disparity. Primary GER achieved in two nomadic Regions of
Somali and Afar are 11% and 7%, respectively. Girls' participation rates are lower. Primary GER for
nomadic girls is below 1%. The gender disparity is also conspicuous at the tertiary level, in the teaching
profession and in school management. According to the Strategic Resource Planning for Girls Education
Country Case Study for Ethiopia (1997), concern for security, early marriage, family's dependence on
their labor, and lack of privacy in school toilets keep girls from school. Government strategy is to
increase access to schools in rural areas by locating the majority of new schools and additional resources
in disadvantaged areas. Some nomadic areas will pilot nomadic schools that move with the population so
that children can attend school without interruption. An inter-sectoral approach is taken to promote girls'
education. Communities are sensitized to the inter-generational benefits to be gained from girls'
education, and are discouraged from early marriage of girls. Much emphasis is given to infrastructure
within school, such as separate toilet facilities for girls. And in the community, emphasis is placed on
water supply and grain mills which would diminish household chores for children, especially girls.

Ethiopia                                                                Education Sector Development Program
Issue (c) -poor quality of education. Physical facilities in disrepair, lack of educational materials, equipment,
and furniture create a poor learning environment for children (PHRD grant studies: Institution Surveys,
1996). Teachers are inadequately trained, particularly for secondary grades (only 40% are trained).
Schools operate without professional guidance. A third of the students drop out of school before
completing the first grade. Repetition rates are high, and only half of the age group completes primary
education. Examinations serve to select students for advancement rather than to provide feedback to
improve classroom teaching. Government strategy is to totally overhaul the learning environment to
achieve better results. Schools are to be fully rehabilitated and refurbished and teachers professionally
trained and motivated. Professional support is to be given to schools for increased effectiveness, both
through feedback on examination performance as well as pedagogic support to teachers on a continuing
basis. More books will be made available to facilitate learning.
Issue (d) - inadequate resources. Ethiopia's per capita income of US$110 places it among the lowest in the
world. The share of education has been substantially increased from about 2.6% of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 1990/91-1992/93 to 3.8% in 1995/96. Despite the increased share of resource
allocation, financing falls short of the level required to expand and improve education because of the
country's low income base and near total dependence of the sector on public finance (PHRD grant study:
Cost and Financing of Education, 1996 and World Bank Public Expenditure Review, 1997).
Government strategy is to diversify sources of financing for education including cost sharing (for Grades X
11 and above), student loans, income generating activities such as consultancies for tertiary institutions,
and active participation by the private sector in financing education.
Issue (e) - inefficient utilization of resources. Primary and secondary schools are run inefficiently. Wastage
arising from dropouts and repetition is high. It takes, on average, 8.8 years for a child to complete a 6-
year primary cycle. Repetition rates are high at upper grades of the primary and secondary schools
(average 21%). The state monopoly of textbook supply and distribution has perpetuated inefficiencies
that Ethiopia can ill-afford. (PHRD I studies: Cost Effectiveness of Key Educational Inputs, 1996).
While lack of access to schools is a deterrent to education in rural areas, it is equally true that many
schools are underutilized. Government strategy is to combine improved quality of education (see issue
c, above) with automatic promotion up to Grade 3, and extend the primary education system to Grade 8
so that pupils will have increased years of schooling before leaving the system. A local language policy
was adopted to facilitate children's adjustment to school, increase their cognitive growth, increase
relevance of learning to their home environment, and thereby increase children's motivation in school.
Teachers will be more intensively employed by raising the average student teacher ratio from 33:1 to
50:1.  Facilities will be better utilized through double-shift practices.  For tertiary institutions,
Government would make further expansion of facilities conditional on the institutions' developing and
implementing their strategies for improving efficiency. State subsidy to textbook provision will shift
from producer to consumer subsidies. The Education Materials Production and Distribution Agency
(EMPDA), a public enterprise, will be commercialized and competition from the private sector
encouraged to improve efficiency in the textbook sector.
Issue (f) - weak education planning and implementation/management capacity. At all four levels of
Government (center, regional, zonal and woreda), there is a shortage of qualified staff. Procedures and
guidelines for implementation and reporting under the decentralized Government structure have not been
developed. Decision-makers at all levels of Government are hampered by lack of easy access to urgently
needed data. At the school level, there has been little or no training of managers. Government strategy
is to provide training in education management to officials at all levels and to head teachers, develop
guidelines and establish a reporting and monitoring system to assure accountability.

Ethiopia                                                                Education Sector Development Program
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the program and strategic choices
ESDP is a sector-wide operation. It will address all the above issues. Strategic choices which the program
has made in addressing these social issues were:
(a) School site location in rural and under-served areas. ESDP will locate the majority of new schools in under-
serviced rural areas. The alternative would have been demand-driven site selection. This would have located
most new schools in urban areas where the demand for education is high, schools are congested, and there is a
clear need for expanded facilities. However, this would further widen the urban-rural gap in education
opportunities. It was therefore decided that social equity should be considered in deciding where to locate
schools and that schools should be placed where demand for schooling is depressed by distance to schools. In
addition, numerous interventions will be introduced to increase that demand. This is also consistent with the
Government's overall development strategy that emphasizes raising productivity in rural areas.
(b) Construction of more schools. With primary GER of about 30% for Grades 1 to 8, Ethiopia has one of the
lowest school enrollment rates in the world. Household surveys carried out under PHRD grants reveal that
lack of access to schools and, even where they are available, long distances to schools have been major
constraints to school attendance. Under these circumstances, it was thought justified to construct more schools
to increase access and shorten distance to schools.
(c) Shorter school days. Due to the poor quality of learning, longer school days with increased instructional hours
would have been desirable. However, shorter schools days have two advantages: (i) it reduces the opportunity
cost of schooling, thereby encourages more parents to send their children to school; and (ii) where demand for
education is constrained by inadequate facilities, enables double-shifting for schools to accommodate more
children. Given the extremely low primary enrollment rate, this trade-off appears justified, particularly as
additional interventions are in place to enhance the quality of education with teacher upgrading and availability
of books.
(d) Higher student-teacher ratio. More than 90 percent of the primary recurrent budget has been spent on teacher
salaries. Leaving little for other inputs that are necessary for quality education, especially books and desks.
Under the program, the average student-teacher ratio will be allowed to increase from 33:1 to 50:1. More
funds will be allocated to books, desks and other complementary inputs that are severely under-funded.
(e) Elimination of schoolfees for Grades 1-10. It was mentioned in Section A that the education sector suffers
from serious under-funding. Yet under this program school fees for these grades have been eliminated to
reduce the financial burden of children's schooling on parents. For subsistence farmers, cash required to pay
school fees carries an additional burden.

Ethiopia                                                              Education Sector Development Program
C. Program Description Summary
1. Program components
(seeAnnex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost breakdown)
The program covers all education activities of the Central and Regional Governments, from basic
education to tertiary education, both formal and non-formal education, as well as adult education, special needs
education, distance education and teacher training. A brief description of the program activities by component and
the expected outcome of these activities is described below. This is a "generic" presentation; there will be
considerable variation among Regions and different emphasis and prioritization depending on the Regions'
particular needs.
Basic Education. Activities - Over the five-year ESDP period, 2,423 new primary schools will be built,
1,814 upgraded, and 1,220 renovated, in order to accommodate 3.9 million additional students. Curriculum reform
will be completed, teachers upgraded, and book provision will be substantially increased. Expected outputs -
access to schools will be substantially increased, specially in rural areas where all new school construction is to be
located. Increased enrollment (from an average GER of 30% to 50%) over the next five-years will be realized
both from increased in-take and improved student retention. Quality of teaching/learning will be improved and
proximity of schools to homesteads should enable more children to remain in school and complete the primary
cycle. Non-formal education will provide a second chance to school dropouts and those youths and adults who
have never had the opportunity to attend schools. Educational radio programs will also supplement classroom
teaching.
Secondary Education. Activities - ESDP will selectively expand secondary school facilities to reduce
congestion. Curriculum will be revised to improve quality and relevance. Teachers will be upgraded and the
availability of instructional materials and equipment will be greatly increased. Expected outputs - reduced class
size will improve the learning environment. Improved quality of teachers and greater availability of books will
help improve teaching/learning.
Technical and Vocational Education and TrainingActivities (TVET) - employer and market surveys will
be carried out to assure relevance of TVET programs before facilities expansion is considered. Close partnership
will be sought with the private sector in the design of TVET programs and in the provision of training. Until the
private sector becomes more active throughout the economy, the Government would continue, in the short-run, to
play an active role. Expected outputs - training provided will have greater relevance to the demands of the job
market, hence higher rates of employment may be expected for TVET graduates than in the past. The economy
will stand to benefit from increased productivity from trained and skilled labor.
Teacher Training Institutes and Colleges. Activities - facilities will be upgraded and expanded to handle
in-service upgrading for primary teachers to qualify to teach in the upper two grades of the second primary cycle.
Teacher training curricula will be revised to reflect curriculum reforms at primary and secondary levels. Greater
emphasis will be placed on teaching skills. For cost effective teacher upgrading and to give teachers in remote
schools opportunities for professional growth, teacher training through distance education will be introduced.
Head teachers will be trained on school management and national standards for teacher training will be
established. Expected outputs - schools will be better managed and have greater community involvement. The
quality of teachers and their effectiveness in the classroom should improve. Opportunities for professional growth
and a new career structure should boost teacher morale.

Ethiopia                                                                Education Sector Development Program
Tertiary Education. Activities - expansion of the tertiary sector will be limited to meeting the immediate
needs of the country for educators, engineers, health workers, and public administrators. The Government
encourages investments in higher education by the private sector from home and abroad. Each facility's expansion
will be contingent on the tertiary institution having carried out a satisfactory diagnosis of the cost effectiveness of
its operation and proposals for improvement. Cost sharing schemes will be designed and implemented for Grades
11-12 and tertiary institutions. Expected outputs - more trained personnel will be available for the four critical
areas mentioned above, greater private resources will flow to tertiary education, thereby reducing the burden on
the public sector, and tertiary institutions will become more efficient.
Institutional Development. Activities - planning, finance management, implementation and monitoring
and evaluation capacities of the MOE and the Regions will be improved. The National Organization for
Examination (NOE) will be staffed and equipped to carry out its mandate as the chief body responsible for
designing and administering national examinations and national surveys of learning assessment. The Education
Media Agency's (EMA) capacity to develop secondary school programs, distance learning programs for teacher
upgrading and non-formal and adult education, and to assist the Regional Education Media Units (EMU) will be
improved. Regional EMUs will, with the assistance of EMA, develop capacity to design educational programs and
transmit them. This is particularly important to local language programs for primary school. Expected outputs -
analysis of student performance and feedback to schools will make examinations an integral part of the
teaching/learning process. National surveys for student achievement will enable ESDP to assess whether it is
attaining quality goals for education. Non-formal education will become a cost-effective tool for reaching the
greater majority who cannot be reached through the formal education system.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the program
Policy reforms outlined in the Government's new Education and Training Sector Policy of 1994 lays out the
following key policies which ESDP is supporting (not included in B.3)
(a) Change of education structure, increasing primary education from 6 years to 8 years in all schools, in order
to increase the number of years of schooling received by the majority who do not go beyond the primary
level.
(b) Automatic promotion in primary grades through Grade 3 to reduce repetition and dropouts and to enable the
late bloomers to catch up without having to drop out.
(c) Local languages used as medium of instruction in primary grades to facilitate children's adjustment to
school, increase the relevance of what is taught in the classroom to their home environment, and to facilitate
cognitive growth.
(d) A new teaching career structure that is based on professional growth, performance, and experience so that
teachers are motivated.
(e) Elimination offees for Grades 1-10 to reduce the "cash" burden on parents. School fees have been identified
as one of the major reasons for children being kept out of school.
(f) Cost sharing_for Grades 11-12 and tertiary education has been adopted as a Government policy. ESDP
supports the policy and is assisting the Government with modalities for implementing the policy.
Additional policy changes recommended and to be confirmed under ESDP are:
(a) A separate budget line for facilities maintenance so that costly and wasteful rehabilitation of facilities will
not be necessary in the future. A separate budget line reduces the fungibility, earmarking the funds for
maintenance purposes rather than have it lumped together with other operating costs.
(b) Contracting out civil works supervision to private firms and consultants whenever and wherever there are
bottlenecks in government's capacity to supervise.
(c) Primary school teaching experience as a requirement for teacher training tutors. Currently tutors are
frequently recruited from academia or from secondary schools. Therefore tutors are not able to prepare the
teachers well for primary school classroom instructions. The Government will consider: (a) requiring new
primary teacher trainers to obtain practical experience in primary school teaching for a minimum acceptable
period; and (b) apply primary teaching experience as a requirement for tutor recruitment.
(d) Reduce the emphasis on academic requirements for admission to TVET. Current admission practice limits
access to only those students who rank among the top ten in their class and have outstanding grades in
English, mathematics, and the natural sciences.
(e) Practical experience in trade should be made a requirement for the new TVET trainers. In upgrading the
quality of trainers, emphasis needs to be placed on practical experience of the trainers.

Ethiopia                                                             Education Sector Development Program
(f) A partnership between the private and public sectors in the provision of TVET.  Some Regional
Governments are reassessing the situation and contemplating partnerships between NGOs and the private
sector for provision of training. Each partner's respective roles and responsibilities, financial contributions
and accountability need to be developed.
(g) Establishing Grade 4 national survey of student achievement. The new education policy, which introduced
8-year primary schooling, has eliminated Grade 6 examinations. It is feared that Grade 8 will be too late to
capture deficiencies existing in the system, take corrective measures, and have a beneficial impact on the
students as the majority leave the education system before Grade 8. Therefore, the Government will
undertake a national baseline survey of student achievements at Grade 4. This is consistent with NOE's
wish to reduce the emphasis on examinations as a selection tool, and to use the survey's results for assessing
learning achievement.
(h) Education data collation, processing, analysis to be carried out as close to the source as possible. While
woreda and zonal offices are involved in gathering data, the processing and analysis have, in the past, been
carried out at the center. More recently, Regions have taken on greater responsibility and have developed
some capacity for analyzing the data. For a thorough understanding of the local situation and ownership of
the education process, this is an important development. The Government will encourage decentralization
further down the local government chain to the woreda level with support from ESDP.
Institutional reforms adopted prior to ESDP which will be supported by the program are:
(a) Establishment of a National Organization for Examination. The ESDP work program focuses on assisting
NOE staff with assistance necessary for the newly established organization to carry out its mandate to
administer national examinations, and to provide pedagogic feedback to the education system on student
performance. The organization will phase in improvements to the examination system and additional
activities as its capacity expands.
(b) Decentralization of government administration. ESDP implementation is designed to work through the
existing decentralized system. Some activities, particularly those that have not yet been taken up by the
Regions such as procurement through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), may initially start at the
center and then gradually decentralize as the Regions develop their own capacity under ESDP.
(c) Commercialization of EMPDA and textbook sector liberalization. This has been planned for more than a
year. ESDP will assist the Government to establish a time-bound action plan for EMPDA for transition from
being an arm of MOE into an independent commercial entity. At the same time, ESDP will include training
for Regional education staff so that they have the basic know-how for procuring books.
(d) Donor coordination. In anticipation of ESDP, the Government has set up a Steering Committee at the center
and in each of the Regions to coordinate and monitor program implementation. The committees are to be
supported by secretariats located at respective education bureaus and the Ministry of Education. ESDP
supports establishing such a network of coordinating bodies and will assist in developing reporting,
monitoring and evaluation procedures within this framework.

Additional institional reforms neededfor ESDP implementation
(a) Harmonization of donor procedures. To lighten the administrative burden on the limited capacity of the
Government at all levels, it was agreed that donor procedures for supervision, monitoring and evaluation,
reporting, financial accounts and auditing, procurement procedures should be harmonized. As part of
preparatory work and subsequently under ESDP program implementation, harmonization will be pursued
which will require flexibility on the part of all donors and could require some institutional reforms governing
those activities in Ethiopia.
(b) Internal audit for donor-funded activities. Accounting and audits have been weak in Ethiopia. Donor
confidence for accountability of funds provided under ESDP will be critical for continued support to the
program in the longer term. Currently, only Government-funded activities are subjected to internal audit.
Experience with the on-going Education VII project suggests that problems encountered in external audit
could have been prevented had the project been subject to such internal audit. An important step for
credibility building will be for the Government to bring under internal audit all ESDP activities, whether
Government or donor funded, so that problems may be dealt with as they arise.
(c) Increased role of Women's Affairs Offices. Gender sensitivity will be mainstreamed in all ESDP activities
and the Women's Affairs Offices will be activated to achieve this.

3. Benefis and target population
Anticipated benefits from achieving the development objectives of the program are:
(a) Greater number of better educated youth with relevant knowledge and skills joining the labor force is
expected to raise the productivity of the economy. In addition, the system will have the capacity to turn
out large numbers of engineers, health workers, educators, and administrators to meet the demands of rapid
expansion in roads, health and education sectors.
(b) Social equity will be enhanced. Children from rural, poor, families will have a better chance of attending
school because schools will be made accessible. Financial burden to the poor families should be reduced
by the yet to be fully implemented policy to eliminate school fees for Grades 1-10, and children can attend
school without having to forgo their responsibilities at home. More girls will be encouraged to go to school
and to continue for a longer period. Disadvantaged Regions and disadvantaged pockets within better-off
Regions will be given additional resources and assistance to improve their education attainment.
(c) Resource base for education will be broadened and efficiency in resource use improved. Sources of
financing education will be expanded to include the private sector, NGOs, cost sharing by parents (from
Grades 11 and up), private sponsors and student loans for tertiary education. Better quality education will
be provided for the same amount of money, as ESDP continuously explores cost-effective alternatives.
Target populations include:
(a) Rural poor, who will benefit from having the opportunity to send their children to school.
(b) Girls, who will benefit from gender-sensitive curricula and books, school facilities that are more gender-
friendly, mills and water sources located close to schools to reduce time spent on chores, increased number
of female teachers to serve as role models, and community support for their education.
(c) Children in school, who will benefit from increased proximity of schools, improved school environment
and improved quality of learning.
(d) Children out-of-school, who will benefit from an opportunity to become literate through non-formal
education.
(e) School dropouts, who will have a second opportunity to continue their learning through non-formal
education.
(f) Teachers, who will benefit from improved teaching environments, improved professional support, and a
career structure that rewards performance and experience.
(g) Civil servants, who will be better able to carry out their responsibilities in planning, budgeting,
implementing, reporting, supervising and monitoring.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Implementation period:   Five years (1997/98-2001/02); four and a half years with IDA funding
Executing agency:      Ministry of Education
Implementing bodies:    Central Educational Agencies, MOE, Regional Education Bureaus
Program oversight and coordination: Implementation arrangements for the ESDP are designed to
accommodate all donors jointly, not just IDA. ESDP implementation will be carried out through existing
institutions, largely following existing Government procedures. Monitoring, coordination and oversight of ESDP
will be carried out through bodies created for ESDP (see Annex 6, Chart 6.1 and 6.2: Organizational Charts). The
ESDP bodies are the Central Joint Steering Committee, the Central Secretariat and their corresponding bodies in
the Regions: the Regional Joint Steering Committees and the Regional Secretariats. About 87% of the program
will be implemented by the Regions; the remaining 13% will be implemented at the Center.
Organizational set-up at the Center. Implementation at the Center will be carried out by various
departments of the Ministry of Education, Central Educational Agencies affiliated with the Ministry, and tertiary
institutions that report to the Ministry. The Central Joint Steering Committee (CJSC) will be responsible for
coordination, oversight, resource mobilization, approval of work plans and for monitoring the overall progress of
the program. Its membership will consist of Ministers of Finance, Economic Development and Cooperation, and
Education, and will be chaired by the Minister of Social Affairs in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The
Minister of Education will serve as the Secretary to the Committee and the Ministry's Planning and Projects
Department (PPD) will function as the Central Secretariat (CS). The Committee will meet at least once each
quarter, but additional meetings may be called at the initiative of the Chairman.  Two to three donor
representatives (from bilateral and multi-lateral agencies) will be non-voting participants of the Committee in an
advisory capacity. The Central Secretariat will liaise with the Regional Secretariats on an on-going basis. The
Secretariats at the Central and Regional levels are responsible for managing ESDP information flows and will be
the main channels through which system reporting is achieved.
Organizational set-up in the Regions. The Regional Education Bureaus (REB) will have implementation
responsibility. The degree to which this responsibility is devolved to the zones and woredas will vary from Region
to Region, depending on the respective strengths of these offices. A Regional Joint Steering Committee (RJSC)
will be responsible for coordination, oversight, resource mobilization, approval of work plans and for monitoring
progress. The Committee will meet at least quarterly and at any other time as determined by the Chairman.
Membership of the Committee will consist of heads of Regional Bureaus of Finance, Planning, Works and Urban
Development and Education and will be chaired by the Head of the Regional Social Affairs Committee. The
Regional Education Bureau Head will also serve as Secretary of the RJSC and the Management Committee
(consisting of Heads of Departments). The Regional Education Bureau will serve as the Regional Secretariat
(RS). The Regional Secretariat will be primarily responsible for reporting to the Regional Joint Steering
Committee.
Program supervision, annual review and reporting requirements. ESDP is a sector-wide program that
encompasses all education-related undertakings of the Government. Therefore the nature of donor support and
supervision will be different from project support which requires that details of the operation be spelled out and
costed. For program support, the key is agreement on program objectives and targets, and the process by which
these objectives and targets will be reached.

Ethiopia                                                              Education Sector Development Program
The Central Secretariat (PPD/MOE) and the Regional Secretariats (RS) have the primary responsibility for
on-going supervision of program implementation. Supervision of the program will occur at many different levels
with different stakeholders. Supervision, at a more formal level, will be carried out jointly by the Government and
the donors. The focus will be on program strategies, interventions and expenditures. Each joint Government-
donor supervision mission will conclude with an agreement on a time-bound action plans that will move ESDP
implementation forward.
> Implementation tracking will be carried out by implementing bodies and records maintained on an
on-going basis.
=> Special studies and validation. At the school level, teachers may be engaged to carry out small
studies to investigate their own school/community specific problems so that they can become part
of the solution. At the Regional and national level, short-term consultants will be engaged as needed
to research implementation and pedagogic issues. Annual independent, objective validation of
ESDP performance will be a task for the joint supervision missions.
=> Internal reporting and consultations will carried out on a regular basis between the executing
agencies (MOE at the Center and REBs in the Regions) and implementing bodies that report to
them. MOE will take a proactive role to assist the weaker Regions in all aspects of ESDP -
implementation, supervision, monitoring, planning and budget preparation.
=> Formalized periodic reporting. Formal implementation progress reports will be required of
executing agencies. These will be submitted to the CJSC (see the Reporting Requirements and
Chart 3.5, below) and the donors twice a year, in July and January. Much of the data required for
the report will involve education officers at the woreda and zonal level, particularly for monitorable
indicators.
=> Formalized supervision. Donor-Government joint supervision missions will take place twice a
year, in September and in February, to conduct an independent review of ESDP implementation
progress. All donors will have an opportunity to influence the terms of reference for these missions,
but need not necessarily participate in this expert assessment. The report of the joint supervision
missions would be an important item on the agenda of the Annual Review Meeting.
(a) Annual Review. The purpose of the Annual Review is to take stock of how far the strategies and
interventions have taken the country toward the ESDP goals and to re-examine the objectives, priorities and target
in light of greater information on education generated by the system, especially on its capacity for implementation.
Against this background, the proposed annual work programs and budgets for the following year will be reviewed.
The Annual Review is a joint donor-Government exercise. All donors active in the education sector in Ethiopia
are expected to participate in the Annual Review along with the Government implementation bodies: the Ministry,
central education agencies, REBs and, to the extent possible, zonal and woreda education offices.
Important inputs required for this process are the Regional and national monitorable indicators, annual
work programs and budgets presented in the revised Plans, implementation performance as reported in Progress
Reports and validated by independent reviewers, and the findings of special studies at all levels.
The outcome of the review mission will be: (a) an agreed work program and budget for the following
fiscal year; and (b) reconfirmation or agreed adjustments to ESDP priorities, strategies and nature of interventions.

(b) Reporting Requirements. Implementation Progress Reports will be prepared by implementing agencies
(the Regions and MOE with input from their constituencies) semi-annually. The Reports will contain:
=. Expenditure data for the previous 6 months. The expenditure data will be based on figures from the
tracking of Regional and Central education budgets, and will, as far as possible, be provided in the
same format and level of aggregation as used in the Regions' and the Center's ESDP Plans. This will
facilitate comparison between projected and actual expenditures.
> Data on physical targets achieved in comparison to the targets set for the period, and plausible reasons
for over- or under-achieving the targets.
> Procurement status report and revised procurement plans for the next 24 months.
=> Performance coefficients (actual targets achieved divided by projected physical targets for the period)
will be calculated.
=> Issues and problems encountered in the course of program implementation will be discussed.
=> Time-bound action plan to redress these problems will be proposed by implementing agencies.
=> Issues and problems that cannot be resolved by the implementors, such as policy or donor
coordination related issues that require higher level of intervention will be brought to the attention of
the respective Steering Committees.
The Central Secretariat will provide guidance and technical assistance to the Regions and Central
Education Agencies in preparing their Progress Reports. Based on the submissions of these reports, the Central
Secretariat will prepare semi-annually a Consolidated Progress Report for the Central Joint Steering Committee.
The content of the Consolidated Progress Report will summarize all the elements listed above. In addition, it will:
> Identify issues that are generic and can be redressed more effectively through concerted efforts by all;
> Identify goodpractices for dissemination;
> Monitor relative strengths and weaknesses of the Regions and identify how the weaker areas might be
strengthened;
= Identify key policy and coordination related issues that require higher levels of intervention; and
= Propose appropriate interventions by the Central Joint Steering Committee.
The Consolidated Progress Report submitted to the CJSC in December will cover implementation
progress from previous January to June, and the Progress Report submitted in June will cover the previous July to
December period. Annual Review Reports submitted to CJSC in December of each year will cover the activities
of the preceding fiscal year (July to June).

(c) Annual Review Package. The Annual Review Package should contain, in addition to the Progress
Reports, Revised Regional and Central Plans. These revised plans will provide the following additional
data/information:
> Monitorable indicators for the past year and a discussion of their implications for the following year's
work program.
=' Review of priorities and strategies in light of past year's performance, as revealed by performance
coefficients for physical targets and expenditures, and monitorable indicators.
=> Reports on special studies, including those at the school and community level, that provide insight to
problems encountered in implementation.
=> Updated work programs consisting of revised physical targets and procurement plans, detailed
expenditure projections for the following year and an indicative budget for the following two years.
A Consolidated Plan will be prepared by the Central Secretariat, based on the submissions by the Regions,
MOE and the Central Education Agencies. The Consolidated Plan should incorporate all the elements listed
above. In addition, it should also provide:
=> Aggregate monitorable indicators for the country as a whole.
=> Independent validation of ESDP outcomes in the Regions and at the Center.
> Findings of special studies at the national level, undertaken to assess ESDP impact on education and to
investigate problem areas.
=> Results of a national survey on student achievement at the earliest reporting opportunity after the
completion of the survey, following about 6 months of the processing period.
The ESDP planning and budgeting exercise needs to precede the budget call in January to allow sufficient
time for deliberations, review, consolidation at the center, and consultation with the donors. Budget preparation,
review, and consolidation will span over two months from October and December, whereas the budget call is
made in January, setting the regional subsidy and Ministry ceilings. Therefore, the Regions and the Center will be
prepared with contingency plans for physical targets, work programs and budgets. The ESDP annual review is
timed to allow Govemment-donor consultations before the Govemment's budget preparation is completed. All
REB offices will be encouraged to equip and train their staff and computerize their planning and budgeting
processes in the second year of ESDP, so that last minute changes can be incorporated with minimal time loss.
The ESDP provides a framework for multi-year planning and programming. Work programs and donor
commitments should extend beyond the imminent budget years, and the most important adjustments during each
annual planning/programming exercise should be the work plans and financing plans for the later years of the
planning period.
Procurement Arrangements (Annex 6): Procurement and implementation will be largely decentralized to
the Regions, where about 87% of the expenditures will occur. The PPD of the MOE will facilitate and coordinate
intemational procurement for the Regions. At the regional level, REBs will implement and manage procurement
and supervision. Regions may opt to pass on to zones and woredas some procurement responsibilities, based on
implementation capabilities at these lower levels of Govemment. A minimum of two senior officers with
procurement responsibilities will need to be based at the Center. Similar staffing is recommended for each of the
REBs. The Regions will have the option to: (i) carry out procurement through their own RS; (ii) strengthen their
capability through technical assistance; or (iii) contract out management and supervision responsibilities to
procurement consultants. Procurement arrangements will evolve as capacity increases. Regional proposals for
building up their procurement capability and for changes in procurement arrangements will be regularly reviewed
and assessed by CS, and semi-annually by IDA and donors.

Ethiopia                                                              Education Sector Development Program
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement will be used for equipment and goods not
available in Ethiopia and for works in metropolitan areas where a "package and slice" approach will be used to
attract international competition. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used for furniture, locally available
goods, most printing jobs and construction works of less than US$1 million. Other procurement methods to be
used under ESDP and thresholds of authority and local regulations are described in Annex 6. Prior review will be
used for all ICB procurement. For NCB, if prior review of the first three contracts of an implementing agency is
satisfactory and procurement management is found to be adequate, NCB will thereafter be subjected to post
review only. Post-review of procurement and supervision under ESDP will be agreed with other donors and
carried out on a yearly basis.
Fund flow management, accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The
Government's new Financial Administration Proclamation (57/1996 dated December 19, 1996) establishes the
principle of consolidated funds. The long-term goal of ESDP is for all donors to use Government's channels for
the flow of program funds and reporting. This will entail substantial strengthening of institutions at the Center
and Regional levels. The donor community plans to move gradually toward the pooling of funds with the
Government and in the interim to gain experience with the system and test its feasibility. Donors will work
together to harmonize the monitoring and reporting systems, while the feasibility and reliability of the
Government funding channel is being tested by a few donors.
To accommodate ongoing donor projects and some restrictive donor regulations, parallel channels for the
flow of ESDP funds and information will remain open (see Annex 6, Charts 6.4 and 6.5). However, a common
reporting system and set of formats will be used. The Central Secretariat will prepare and compile expenditure
and progress reports, while the Ministry of Finance will assume responsibility for periodic consolidation and
reporting on the flow of funds and fund balances.  The program as a whole will be subject to an annual
independent audit, with a single audit report issued for the Government and donors. No new implementation unit
will be created for the program. All efforts will be focused on strengthening existing implementation bodies of
the Ministry of Education and Regional Education Bureaus.
(a) Oversight. The Central Joint Steering Committee, assisted by its Secretariat, will be responsible for
the monitoring and evaluation of the program nationwide. It will also coordinate with other stakeholders and
donors. Each Regional Joint Steering Committee will be assisted by a Regional Secretariat and will have the
oversight responsibility for the regionally implemented parts of the program and, through the Central Joint
Steering Committee, will be accountable to the central Government.
The responsibility for day-to-day operations and implementation of centrally executed components will
rest with different departments of the Ministry of Education. The Regional Education Bureaus will have similar
responsibilities with regard to the regional programs. Relationships and levels of responsibility of each agency
will be clearly spelled out in the Program Implementation Manual.
(b) Flow of Funds. Approximately 73% of ESDP's funding is provided by the Government and the
balance, 27%, by participating donors. The Government channel for its own funds are the Ministry of Finance at
the center and the Regional Finance Bureaus in each Region. Several donors, including IDA, will use this channel
to flow funds for the program's new activities. This is not the same as pooling, however, since IDA's funds will
be separately tracked through the use of a special account.



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 20
Ethiopia                                                             Education Sector Development Program
Other funding channels currently used by donors fall under the following classification: (i) sector ministry
channel, through Special Accounts under the control of the latter; (ii) regional institution channel, through
accounts opened under regional responsibility; and (iii) donors' own channel for procurement and delivery of
goods and services. These ongoing channels for the flow of funds will be kept open subject to donors willingness
to use the Government's channel.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will have full responsibility for donor funds that flow through its channel.
This is consistent with the new finance proclamation that establishes the principle of consolidated funds. Donors
who are required to track their funds to specific expenditures can do so through this channel using special
accounts.
(c) Disbursement of IDA Funds. Disbursements from IDA will be made on the basis of incurred eligible
expenditures. IDA will make advance disbursement from the proceeds of the Credit by depositing into a
Borrower-operated Special Account to expedite program implementation. The advance to a Special Account is
to be used by the Borrower to finance IDA's share of program expenditures under the Credit. Another acceptable
method of withdrawing funds from the Credit is the direct payment method, involving direct payments from the
Credit to a third party for works, goods, and services upon the Borrower's request. Payments may also be made
to a commercial bank for expenditures against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter of
Credit. IDA's Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and special
commitment procedures.
ESDP will use a simplified Special Account disbursement procedure which allows decentralized program
implementation. The Government will open a Special Account in its National Bank. The Special Account will be
operated by the designated officials of the Counterpart Funds Unit (CFU) of the MOF. Upon Credit effectiveness,
the CFU will submit a withdrawal application for an initial deposit to the Special Account, drawn from the IDA
Credit, in the amount agreed to in the DCA. Replenishment of funds from IDA to the Special Account will be
made upon evidence of satisfactory utilization of the advance, reflected in the SOEs and/or on full documentation
for payments above the SOE thresholds. Replenishment applications should be submitted regularly - ideally
every month but not exceeding three month intervals. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made
from the Special Account, the Borrower will be obligated to refund the same. If the Special Account remains
inactive for more than six months, the Borrower may be requested to refund to IDA amounts advanced to the SA.
In each of the Regions and in the MOE a Project Account will be opened. The CFU will make an initial
advance into each account to cover four months of expected expenditures, based on the approved annual work
program and budget. These Project Accounts will be replenished by the CFU by drawing funds from the SA at the
request of the respective Bureaus and the MOE. Replenishment requests from the Regions and MOE will be on
SOE or full documentation basis. The Project Accounts must be used only for advances and replenishments of
funds coming from the Credit and for effecting payments against IDA's share of the financing.
The Regional Bureaus and the MOE are responsible for following all procedures specified in the DCA
related to prior and post review of bidding and contract documents. The CFU is responsible for making
appropriate arrangements for the opening of the Project Accounts in the Regions and at MOE, and for monitoring
the proper use of the advances. The Unit will also assist the regional Bureaus to establish proper systems for
accounting the usage of the advances and for submitting regular replenishment applications for the Project
Accounts.

(d) Accounting and Reporting. Regional Education Bureaus will assume responsibility for financial
management, accounting and reporting for regionally executed parts of the program. They will collect the
necessary information and report to the Central Joint Steering Committee through the Regional Joint Steering
Committee on a quarterly basis. Their reports will contain information and analysis of both expenditure data and
physical progress for the reporting period and cumulative data. Similarly, the Ministry of Education will report to
the Central Joint Steering Committee for centrally implemented parts of the program. Reporting on the treasury
transactions will be the responsibility of the Regional Finance Bureaus through the Ministry of Finance. The
Regional Finance Bureaus will have front line responsibility for ensuring that funds are spent in line with budgets.
The Central Secretariat will compile the program reports (both reports from the Ministry of Finance and
implementing agencies) and produce final reports in an agreed format.
Each Regional Joint Steering Committee will have responsibility through its Secretariat to provide the
annual Regional budget, broken down into quarterly budgets. These quarterly budgets, together with periodic (at
least quarterly) financial and physical implementation progress reports (budget execution report formats will be
included in the Program Implementation Manual). It will form the basis for replenishment of Special Accounts.
The Central Joint Steering Committee will have the consolidated reports available for the periodic review
meetings and for donor consultation. ESDP-wide auditing arrangements will require the agreement of the
Regions to delegate some of their audit responsibilities.
(e) Audit of Accounts. As a sector program, all funds related to the ESDP will be annually audited by an
independent auditor. Following current Government practice, the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) will be
the independent auditor. Although the designated auditor may sub-contract part or parts of the audits to other
qualified auditors, it will retain the overall responsibility in order to prevent fragmentation of the program audits.
A single annual audit report for the ESDP will be issued by the designated auditor and submitted to IDA no later
than six months after the end of each financial year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The Central and Regional Secretariats will monitor the
progress of program implementation against (a) physical targets established, (b) a set of educational indicators
(Annex 7), (c) national survey of Grade 4 student achievement (to be initiated under ESDP), and (d) evaluation
studies commissioned by the Central Secretariat. This will be an iterative and continuous process. Physical
targets are to be adjusted based on implementation results.
Each Region will prepare bi-annual progress reports and action plans with issues for review by the
Regional Joint Steering Committee. The Central Secretariat will review and advise on the progress reports and
action plans prepared by the Regions and submit consolidated reports for the Central Joint Steering Committee's
consideration. The progress report by implementors will be supplemented by special studies to capture the
qualitative changes in education and with periodic independent validations of the monitoring results. Additional
staff training and equipment, as well as short-term consultancies, will be provided to strengthen Regions' and
Ministry's capacity in monitoring and evaluation. Emphasis will be placed on the dissemination of information
through effective management of information flow through the system.

Ethiopia                                                                Education Sector Development Program
Woredas and zones are already actively involved in gathering data for the Education Management
Information System (EMIS). Currently, the data are aggregated at the zonal and Regional levels and forwarded to
the Ministry for processing. The entire process from data collection to the publication of the EMIS report takes
about two years, too long for the data to be useful for the purpose of monitoring ESDP's progress. Collection,
processing and analysis of educational data should be carried out as close to the source as possible. Therefore,
Regions will be encouraged and assisted to create capacity at the lower levels of Government so that data
processing and analysis can be handled at zonal and woreda levels, whereby the findings would become
immediately useful.
ESDP proposes that the data required to derive monitorable indicators (see section 4 below) be extracted
from the data already being collected annually for EMIS and processed at the Regional level to provide timely
input to decision-makers at the Regional level. As the capacity is developed further down the local Government
chain, processing and analysis of the data can be devolved to the zonal and woreda levels. A study is being
undertaken to harmonize reporting requirements and procedures on monitoring, reporting and evaluation of
donors.
Key Indicators. Indicators to gauge resource allocation to education, the program's impact on access,
quality of education, rural/urban and gender equity, and efficiency are proposed (Annex 7). Wherever possible,
base year (1996/97) data are provided and ESDP targets for year 2001/02. From these data, annual milestones for
the Region and for the country as a whole will be derived.

D. Program Rationale
Program alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The main scope and design options considered were:
Methods and materials of school construction. Schools built with chikka, traditional mud and wattle, are
cheaper to construct, as materials are more readily available and building requires no skills beyond what the
communities already have. However, chikka requires frequent, costly maintenance which communities find
difficult to do. Due to lack of maintenance, these buildings typically last only 3-5 years rather than 10. Chikka was
compared to four other building materials: concrete element, stone, brick and hollow concrete block and was found
to be less cost-effective in the long run. Although the cost of construction and transportation of other materials to
site was 50% higher than chikka, the longer service life (30 compared to 3-5 years), and lower maintenance cost
(about one-fifth of that of chikka) made them a better choice. However, the rate of return to hollow concrete block
was shown to be much higher. This was true of other building materials, although their advantage over chikka was
somewhat lower. Other building materials considered also require lower wood usage, an important environmental
consideration for Ethiopia which has scarce forest cover. Therefore, the Bank supports the Government's decision
to discontinue chikka school building, excepting in cases where other options are not feasible.
Size of schools. Studies have shown that, in addition to distance, lack of access to higher grades is another
deterrent to school attendance in rural areas. The rural/urban gaps in school enrollment rate and education
achievement are wide. For equity reasons, this widening gap needs to be checked. The Government has decided
that all existing schools to be upgraded should offer a full 8 years of primary education. The likely risk that many
of the upgraded schools in rural areas may go under-utilized, at least for the time being, was weighed against the
positive effect access to higher grades would have on meeting the needs of the rural students. The Government has
considered smaller schools with multi-grade teaching, but feels that they compromise on quality. Ethiopia will be
exposed to the more positive experiences of Escuela Nueva in Colombia and Guatemala and will continue the
dialogue.
Language of instruction. For the Government of Ethiopia, using local languages as mediums of
instruction in primary schools was primarily an academic decision, but it was also a political decision. Of some 80
local languages spoken in the country, 19 are now used in classrooms. The overriding political nature of the
decision blocked the ability to objectively weigh enormous cost implications of the policy for textbook provision,
teacher training and deployment, and labor mobility. By focusing on technical, financial and implementation
aspects, the Bank was able to establish a dialogue on the issue. The Regions' new awareness of the financial and
managerial implications of the policy are leading some to seek alternatives such as research to identify a few
linguistically linked languages that could serve many.
Modalitiesfor expansion of educational materials and textbooks. The Government has recognized that
for cost effective and sustainable provision of textbooks the sector needs to be liberalized. It has decided that
EMPDA will be commercialized, but progress has been slow. The Ministry has been dependent on EMPDA for its
textbook related decisions; now it needs to acquire an in-house capacity to develop and implement a new textbook
policy. The Bank's dialogue with the Government will focus on development of the new textbook policy,
EMPDA's commercialization and appropriate staffing needed to implement the new policy.

Ethiopia                                                              Education Sector Development Program
Balancing improved access and quality of education. Ethiopia's primary GER at 30% for Grades I to 8
is less than half the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. There is no denying that an urgent need exists for Ethiopia to
raise the GER substantially to catch up with the rest of the continent and to reach universal primary enrollment.
However, Ethiopia opted not to open the floodgates, as have few African countries, but to take a graduated
approach in reaching UPE. It has chosen to balance improved access with quality of education by investing
heavily in increasing textbook provision, improving school facilities, and teacher upgrading.
Delivery system for vocational skills training. Following a year-long dialogue with the ESDP technical
assistance missions, Government is recognizing the potential that private sector holds in TVET provision. We are
supporting the decision of some Regions to defer expansion of public TVETs until market studies and employer
surveys have been carried out.
Balance of education sub-sector investment.  Despite Government's stated intentions, primary
education's share of the total Government expenditure on education has been declining from 59.0% in 1993/94 to
53.7% in 1996/97. This results from uncoordinated investment decisions by numerous actors. ESDP, on the other
hand, brings all education activities under one umbrella. The impact of decisions on one or another sub-sector is
thereby made transparent. Prioritization across sub-sectors is made easier. Consequently, under ESDP the share
of primary education is increased from 53.7% to 59.8%. At the same time, primary education's important linkages
to upper levels of education as a source for supplying qualified teachers and trained personnel for development is
recognized and a modest degree of investments are proposed for those levels.
Modalities for reaching nomadic populations. Two Regions that are predominantly nomadic, Afar and
Somali, have the lowest Regional enrollment rates. The Government has proposed 17 new boarding schools for
nomadic children. Oromia Region has had positive experience with 11 pilot nomadic schools and intends to
expand the nomadic school system widely in the Region. However, its success story has not been disseminated
widely. Afar Region intends to pilot nomadic schools in a similar fashion. Overall, the Government plans to build
17 new boarding schools for nomadic children. Further dialogue on the costs and benefits of these options shall be
carried out with the Government.
Use of media technology for education. Ethiopia has an extensive transmission network and one of the
most experienced educational broadcast systems in Africa. The Government intends to mobilize this capacity and
reach those children who are deprived of the formal education system by educating them through the radio. The
Government will also broadcast training courses for teachers on the radio, targeting specifically female teachers
and those teachers who are assigned to remote areas and are unable to benefit from training for upgrading.

3. Lessons learnt and reflected in the program design
Main lessons culled from past IDA supported education projects in Ethiopia are:
(a) Balancing expansion with quality improvements. In the past, all IDA projects have attempted to balance
quantity with quality: Education I in technical and teacher education; Education II in secondary, teacher, and
agricultural education; Education III in rural education, teaching of science, and provision of textbooks and
instructional materials; Education IV in non-formal education; Education V in basic and secondary education;
Education VI in primary and secondary levels and teacher training; and Education VII on basic and tertiary
education. Experience has been that quantity targets tend to be met or exceeded. Shortfalls occurred with
quality targets.
(b) ESDP puts emphasis on quality. Enrollment expansion is being complemented with quality improvements --
from improved quality of teachers, more relevant curriculum, increased availability of books, improved school
environment, improved internal efficiency, examinations which will provide feedback to schools to help
improve classroom teaching. Moreover, monitoring indicators also cover the targets for quality enhancing
activities.
(c) Flexibility in the details of implementation. Education VI was being implemented during a period of civil
unrest in the country, this posed serious communication and security problems in implementing the project.
The Bank did not act in a timely manner in tackling problems during project implementation. As a result,
several project locations had to be re-sited. ESDP is flexible across Regions and across time. While an overall
framework for the Program has been set by the Center, interventions at the Regional level are custom-tailored
to the Regions' own priorities. While each Region has an overall framework and targets for ESDP, a detailed
work program is to be reviewed on an annual basis, therefore providing an avenue to adjust the contents and
the speed of implementation to accommodate unforeseen circumstances.
(d) Careful survey and selection of school sites to assure accessibility and equity. Both Education VI and VII
school rehabilitation and construction experienced delays in implementation due to inadequate preliminary
survey and failure to take into consideration the type of terrain, road accessibility for building materials and
supervision crew, and the Government's inability to supervise works under implementation in hundreds of
scattered sites. Long delays between surveys of facilities to be rehabilitated and the start-up of works
contributed to cost overruns, in the meantime facilities deteriorated further. In preparation for ESDP, school
mapping is being carried out to locate schools. Site selection will be finalized only after the chosen sites have
been assessedfor appropriateness through site visits. ESDP addresses equity by locating most new schools in
rural areas and in urban areas expanding classrooms only where congestion poses a serious problem.
(e) Attention to macro-economic environment and the Government's financial capacity. There was a lack of
attention to the weakening financial capacity of the Government in a declining economy in the design of
Education VI and Education VII. An unrealistically high share of project costs was expected to be borne by
Government. Lack of counterpart funds frequently slowed implementation. This problem was addressed by a
revision of the DCA to reduce the local funding share for Education VII from 35% to 15%. The Government
of Ethiopia puts a high priority on education and plans to finance as much as 73% of ESDP costs. Although
this is considered within Government's capacity, given its rapid economic growth in recent years, sound
macroeconomics management and projected growth in the medium term, the Central Ministry and the Regions
are nevertheless drawing up contingency plans in case of a possible shortfall in financing.

(f) Coordination of responsibilities. Education VI faced difficulties in implementation and supervision of multi-
faceted projects requiring the cooperation of several implementing agencies (e.g., PMO, EICMA, EMPDA,
ICDR). Better coordination might have been achieved had there been a clarification of and agreement on each
agency's responsibility and continuous monitoring of their compliance. As ESDP is a sector-wide operation,
its implementation will be even more complex and its coordination needs greater. In addition, ESDP is
designed for implementation under a decentralized system. At the center, a Steering Committee, with
representations from PMO, MOE, MOF, Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation (MEDAC) and
donors and chaired by the PMO, will be responsible for overall coordination and monitoring and evaluation.
Each Region will establish Regional Joint Steering Committees with similar representations to coordinate,
monitor and evaluate implementation at the regional level.
(g) Continuous management oversight of education. Education VI implementation was delayed due to under-
staffing of the Project Management Office, particularly accountants. ESDP's problems in management are
potentially more grave. Regions that have very weak capacity will be the major players in implementation.
ESDP stresses the need for capacity building to be as up-front as possible, especially in procurement, finance
management, and monitoring and evaluation. Procedures and guidelines need to be laid down and staff
trained. As a safeguard, those Regions considered especially ill-prepared will focus on capacity building in the
initial period of ESDP, and swing into implementation of the program once they have acquired the minimum
capacity.
(h) Realistic disbursement schedule. Disbursement schedule for Education VI was overly optimistic compared to
the Ethiopia's past performance in this sector. The originally proposed ESDP implementation schedule also
appears to be overly optimistic. The schedule is heavily front-loaded, making no allowances for capacity
building, procedures that need to be established and disseminated, and learning that will need to take place.
The donors have strongly advised the Govermment to make their implementation projections more realistic so
that targets set are within reach, rather than setting up for disappointment from the start.
(i) Involvement of stakeholders. ESDP has been developed by MOE in collaboration with central educational
agencies and the Regions. Therefore, there is strong ownership of the program and its objectives and targets
by all key implementing agencies. However, involvement of other stakeholders, e.g., zones and woredas,
teachers and the communities, has been spotty. The success of ESDP and the sustainability of its development
objectives hinges on the extent to which these stakeholders identify with and support the objectives of the
program. Therefore, the Government is encouraged to take ESDP to the grassroots and to solicit their
participation in numerous decisions on the details that are yet to be made.
(j) Role of the private sector. In Education VI, GOE insisted on civil works construction by force account. The
performance was poor. In Education VII, basic education facilities construction was stalled for a while
because of a controversy over GOE's wish to continue with force-account, and also because of inappropriate
packaging when open bidding was attempted. Once the packaging was made to vary according to the
construction industry's capacity in each Region, the school construction component has moved rapidly and
neared completion within 2 years. The Government is no longer reluctant to use private contractors. ESDP
school construction and rehabilitation will be mostly through private contractors.
(k) Need for adequate monitoring and supervision. Security problems, shortage of staff, lack of local funds and
transportation hampered close monitoring of implementation. Problems arose due to MOE's limited
knowledge of the sites and the status of implementation. The Bank's supervision missions were also
insufficient, only one annual supervision was fielded from 1985-88. ESDP's supervision of implementation
will be made easier by involving the Regional government. Implementation progress reports, based on
periodic monitoring of implementation, will be required for the work program and budget for the following

year to be approved. In addition, it is suggested that evaluation be carried out by independent bodies, reporting
directly to CJSC Secretariat. This will provide a safeguard on the validity of the reports. These measures,
notwithstanding adequate staffing and funding, remain an issue.
4. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership
As part of its long-term development strategy, the Government has declared education, health and roads to
be priority sectors for investment. ESDP is an expenditure program which will implement the Government's new
sector policy and strategy of 1994. The sector policy, strategy and the framework of ESDP have all been
developed by the Government and it has its full ownership. The Government plans to finance 73 percent of the
cost of ESDP and has already embarked on the program as of July 1997. It has demonstrated its commitment and
ownership by adopting time-bound performance indicators for measuring ESDP success.
5. Value added of Bank support in this program
The ESDP was first presented to donors at the Consultative Group Meeting in December 1996. Following
the presentation, the Bank was invited by the Government and donors to facilitate a dialogue on the program. As
presented, it provided an excellent framework for a sector program, but lacked the refinements needed to make it
immediately financeable. There were opportunities for considering international experience and alternative, more
cost-effective ways to achieve the Government's objectives in the ESDP to reach universal primary enrollment.
The Bank helped form a partnership of donors to begin this dialogue.
The dialogue began in an exchange of views on the program by donors and the Government at Debre Zeit
in March 1997. The Bank subsequently led three joint donor technical assistance missions to continue the
technical dialogue. Initially, 11 development agencies participated with the number growing to 14 by the third
mission which appraised the program in February 1998. The Bank helped structure the missions and develop the
terms of reference for consultants selected by donors. The outcome, by the estimation of all parties, was a much
stronger ESDP. The missions proved to be an excellent capacity building opportunity for the Ministry of
Education and the Regional Education Bureaus.
The Bank agreed to take on the role of residual financier for the program, allowing other donors first
opportunity to select components to finance. This approach helped create a more collegial, less-competitive
environment for working in a partnership. The Bank's role will allow it to bridge gaps where donors may be
delayed in meeting their financing commitments. The international experience of the Bank helped enrich the
dialogue and its economic analysis was important in assuring other donors of the program's economic justification
and fiscal sustainability. The Bank often played a go-between role in communicating donor and Government
views on the process and policy issues, keeping the process moving.
The value added is seen in a comparison of the quality of initial Regional plans with those at the
conclusion, but also in the policy content. The role of the private sector in technical and vocational education and
training was strengthened. Non-formal education was introduced to the program to reach out-of-school children.
Greater awareness of the cost and benefits of implementing a local language policy was achieved. A text book
policy promoting the development of private publishing grew out of the experience. By facilitating the process
and adding its own technical experience, the Bank helped Government move ESDP quickly to a financeable stage
and improve the quality of the program. The Bank expects to be helpful in mobilizing support for the ESDP.

E. Summary Program Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the program file, see Annex 4)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4)
[]Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=NA;  ERR= NA [ ]  Cost Effectiveness Analysis: NA [  Other (Specify)
The Education Sector Development Program is consistent with Country Assistance Strategy priorities and
follows on the recommendations of recent sector work. The sector development program concept is justified for
Ethiopia, as shown in the recent Public Expenditure Review, which deemed the sector expenditure program to be
sound and financially sustainable. Based on the results of the sector work and public expenditure review, as well
as analysis of alternative data sources, a thorough economic analysis was conducted. The complete results are
presented in Annex 4.
The Government has carried out an alternative financing scenario simulation exercise. It contains a risk
assessment and contingency plan for each component. The analysis takes ESDP goals and objectives and
compares them to the base case, which is the situation projected to take place without ESDP. The financing
situation and enrollments without ESDP (base case) were projected. The analysis shows the effect of the increase
in expenditures and enrollment targets with ESDP (goal). The results of the exercise demonstrate that ESDP
makes primary education the priority sub-sector. Fully implemented and fully financed, ESDP results in long term
savings, higher enrollments and higher quality of schooling. ESDP contributes to a reallocation of resources from
higher levels to primary education. Thus, there is more than adequate justification for public intervention.
Choice of technology was analyzed in terms of building materials for the massive civil works component
that is required to raise enrollments to 50 percent. Cost-benefit analysis was used and cross-over discount rates
were estimated. It is demonstrated that when fully maintained, hollow concrete block is a much better alternative
than the traditional mud and thatch schools. However, since maintenance is a problem in Ethiopia, sensitivity
analysis shows that all alternative technologies are preferable to chikka construction.  Further analysis
demonstrates that when costs escalate because remote areas cannot afford hollow concrete block, then traditional
chikka construction is feasible.
Overall, another year of schooling would increase earnings by about 23 percent. For males earnings
increase by 23 percent for every year of schooling, slightly more than the estimate for females, at 21.5 percent. In
rural areas schooling increases earnings by 21 percent, while in urban areas where the average level of schooling is
highest, schooling increases earnings by 15 percent. Estimating the earnings function with dummy variables
representing the three levels of schooling shows that similar increases in earnings result. Earnings increase by 25,
24 and 27 percent with the completion of primary, secondary and university education. Overall, these estimates
conform to the pattern usually found in low-income countries. They show that education is a profitable investment
in Ethiopia.

2. Financial (see Annex S)
NPV=NA; FRR=NA
Fiscal impact. An assessment of the fiscal sustainability of the education, health, and roads sector
programs was undertaken in the World Bank's Public Expenditure Review. The assessment used a medium-term
macroeconomic framework with alternative assumptions about GDP growth rates, government revenue efforts (tax
and non-tax), and balance of payments. Detailed analysis can be found in Annex 4. The main findings are:
=> The incremental annual impact of the three sector programs is relatively small during the first two years of
implementation at approximately Birr 900 million. However, from 1998 onwards, the sector program-
related incremental costs are projected to increase annually to more than Birr 4 billion. The substantial
increase in expenditures may result in a decline in funding for other sectors, if additional revenues and/or
grants are insufficient and funds have to be reallocated from other sectors to cover this expenditure. In this
situation, as much as Birr 14 billion may have to be reallocated.
> While the incremental annual expenditure implications for the recurrent budget are small, they are
significant for intersectoral capital expenditures. Combined capital spending for the three sector programs
will rise from 35 percent to 86 percent. This implies a reduction in the proportion of other sector capital
expenditures to just 14 percent of total capital spending for 1997-2002.
=> At 8.5 percent, the projected rate of increase in recurrent expenditures in the education sector poses the
least problem. Because this is below growth rates for recurrent spending in education for the past five
years. While recurrent expenditures envisaged under ESDP are below historic levels, there is a need to
monitor actual expenditures over time and ensure that the level of spending is adequate to obtain the
necessary level of quality.
ESDP sets ambitious targets for annual increases in capital spending. Capital spending in education under
ESDP will increase by 38% per year. Relative to the observed under-spending in the sector, this target is high. Up
to one-third of budgeted capital expenditures in education are unspent. Implementation of the education sector
program in five years will require vigorous efforts on the part of all stakeholders to improve implementation
capacity, especially at the regional and woreda levels. Program supervision will also have to be improved.
To ensure timely implementation of ESDP, efforts to increase private sector involvement in education are
needed immediately. Also efforts to implement cost-recovery at the upper secondary and tertiary levels need to be
stepped up. Community participation will also be needed. Government's Alternative Financing Scenarios
Simulation exercise underscores the importance of contingency plans and risk-mitigating efforts.

3. Technical assessment
Local languages development. Of the nineteen local languages that are currently used in schools, only a
handful have written scripts; the majority do not and need to develop scripts. The process of transcribing, refining,
and achieving broad consensus on transcription is a long-term undertaking. In the meantime, there will be
difficulties in assuring quality of textbook manuscripts and teaching how to write in these languages in classrooms.
School construction. Building materials to be used for school construction are readily available locally or
in the market; designs proposed for schools are variations on what has been traditionally practiced and proven.
Therefore technical problems are not expected to arise. Problems are more likely to occur in areas of community
mobilization, supervision of construction, and timely payment of contractors. The Government has not developed
the modalities for community involvement in-depth, but useful lessons could be drawn from the ESRDF
experience. Two possibilities are being considered for improved supervision: to contract out school construction
to large contractors who then sub-contract and supervise the work of their sub-contractors, or to engage
independent consultants to provide site-supervision services. For timely payment, details of efficient management
of flow of funds are being worked out.
Distance education. Expansion of radio coverage and strengthening of existing transmission network will
require modernized equipment. However, the Government is advised to be cautious in selecting technology,
keeping in mind the existing skills of technicians who will operate and service the equipment with only minimum
updating of skills. The greater challenge comes from expanding the use of distance education to more
"formalized" courses for basic education, functional literacy, continuing education and teacher in-service training.
The courses that lead to "certification" require supplementary printed course materials and face-to-face tutoring.
The success of these new ventures will depend on EMA and EMU's ability to collaborate closely with other actors
in teacher training and course materials development.

4. Social assessment
Major social issues faced by ESDP are:
=:> wide rural-urban gaps, especially more severe in disadvantaged Regions where rural primary GER is 2%;
=> wide gender gaps in school enrollment and education achievement, particularly in rural areas and in upper
grades; and
=> children the formal system cannot reach -- twice as many children are out of school as those attending
school.
MOE's guidance to the Regions to build new schools in under-served rural areas has been well taken. This
is supplemented with efforts to increase demand for schooling in rural areas by reducing the opportunity cost of
children's schooling (see Section F.2). Targeting of the rural population could be strengthened with monitoring
indicators which specifically measure reduction in the urban-rural gap.
The ESDP aims to raise the primary GER for the Afar and Somali Regions to 25%, but the capacity of
both Regions is weak. They face an additional problem as the majority of their population is nomadic. In the case
of the Somali Region, political will and commitment seems weak. The MOE is providing additional technical
assistance to these Regions. Pilot boarding and nomadic schools are to be set up.
On gender, the MOE and the Regions are committed to improving girls education. Many imaginative
interventions have been proposed (see Section B.2b), however, MOE and the Regions lack the capacity or
mechanism to effectively follow through with the proposals. Women's Affairs Offices need to be closely
integrated into the mainstream of the Ministry and the Regional governments, and should be adequately funded in
order for them to carry out their responsibilities. The staff may not be fully conversant with gender issues. The
MOE and the Regions will need to make concrete proposals on how and by whom the gender issues will be
addressed.
Out-of-school children will be especially targeted by non-formal components, using both media and non-
media methods to spread literacy and to provide a second chance for school dropouts to maintain their literacy and
acquire new skills. The Regions have limited capacity, and therefore will need to collaborate closely with NGOs
who are active in this area.
5. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category   [] A   [ ]B   [X] C
*  Construction of a large number of schools (2,423 new primary schools) consisting primarily of hollow
concrete blocks. Chikka (mud and wattle) is not advisable for long-run cost effectiveness, and also
because its use of wood raises environmental issues.
*  Construction of pit latrines in all new schools. Siting of the latrines will need to be done keeping in
mind that sources of drinking water supply for the school and community are not contaminated in the
process.
*  To prevent the spread of diseases due to unclean latrines and unwashed hands, water will be supplied to
schools, wherever possible.

F. SU    abit and Risks
1. Sustainabgity
ESDP is the first 5-year segment of a 20-year plan for Ethiopia to achieve universal primary enrollment.
Sustainability of the development objectives is extremely important so that each phase builds on the other for an
expanding and improving system. Viewing the sustainability in that light, ESDP will require the following factors:
*  Continued Government budget support over the longer term. Education also needs to feature highly in the
Regional governments' priority. The work program presented by the REB staff to their respective
Regional Councils must be of quality worthy of their support. The capacity building component will
emphasize building of Regional planning and budgeting capacity.
*  Cost effective measures must be sought continuously to reduce unit cost of education provision. Use of
distance education rather than residential training for teacher upgrading, double-shifting to increase the
rate of utilization of facilities, nomadic schools as an alternative to more costly boarding schools,
increasing student to teacher ratio at all levels, including tertiary institutions, are such measures. ESDP
will need to be constantly mindful of further cost cutting measures such as multi-grade teaching for remote
and scarcely populated areas. With reduced unit costs and constant vigilance for cost saving measures,
ESDP could become resilient even with shortfalls in budget support.
*  Preventive maintenance must be carried out for all school facilities so that subsequent investments will
increase the assets by adding to the existing stock rather than merely replacing (rehabilitating) them at
enormous costs. Under the ESDP, preventive maintenance will be made a separate budget item and
devolved to the school level.
*  Teacher motivation must be sustained through effective implementation of a new career structure for
teachers that rewards experience and performance.
Stakeholder participation at all levels. ESDP is owned by the Regions and individual educational agencies.
Participation by other stakeholders such as teachers, parents and the community as well as non-
government providers of education services and materials has been spotty, non-systematic, and varied
across Regions. For sustainability, their participation and ownership of ESDP is critical.

3. Possible ControversialAspects
*  The Government has eliminated fees for Grades I through 10.  There appears to be conflicting
interpretation of the Governments policy: some believe that all cash contributions from parents to schools
are no longer permitted for fear of misuse of funds by school managers, However, these contributions play
an important role in community involvement and ownership of the school. It makes the teachers feel
accountable to the community and is one effective way of stimulating improved school performance.
* Implementation of cost sharing for Grades 11 and above could meet resistance from university students
who can be more visible and vocal. ESDP will explore alternative means for cushioning the financial
burden, such as student loans, private sector sponsorship, scholarship schemes, gradual increasing of
privately sponsored students, etc.
*  Implementation of local languages policy. Household Surveys found that some parents do not favor the use
of local languages for fear that the policy would put their children at a disadvantage in the job market. This
initial reservation by the parents about the use of local languages appears to be changing in favor of the
policy.
* Harmonization of donor procedures on procurement, finance management, and reporting may not be as
comprehensive, therefore placing considerable burden on the GOE's limited capacity at all levels.

Education Sector Development Program
Objectives and Proposed Interventions
Objectives
The overall objective of the first five-year phase of ESDP is to improve the overall
educational attainment of the population while achieving greater social equity. Its longer-term
objective is to achieve universal basic education by 2015.
During the first five-year phase of ESDP, its particular objectives are:
*  achieve expanded access to education with special emphasis on primary education in
rural areas raising enrollment from 3.1 million to 7 million;
*  improve equity by improving enrollment ratios for disadvantaged groups: girls relative
to boys, rural relative to urban populations;
*  improve efficiency of the education system by institutional development and capacity
building;
*  improve quality and relevance by providing books, materials, curriculum improvements
and teacher training; and
*  improve financing for education by increasing public spending on education and
facilitating private sector financing of education.
The Government proposes to undertake reforms and actions below to achieve the above
objectives.
Basic Education
Access. In order to raise enrollments, a massive expansion of the primary education
system will take place. Distance to schools will be reduced through the construction of 2,423
schools in rural and disadvantaged areas. Shortened distance to schools will reduce the
opportunity costs of schooling, as will shortened school days through double-shifting, and
flexible school calendars that take into account agricultural peak periods when children's labor is
in high demand.
The elimination of school fees for grades I to 10 will also help reduce the financial
burden for households who send their children to school.
Equitv. School construction will target rural areas where more than 85 percent of the
population reside. School calendars will also try to accommodate the agricultural peak periods
when the demand for children's labor is likely to be high. In order to increase the enrollment of
girls, grain mills and sources of potable water will be sited close to schools so that girls will be
able to attend school and at the same time have grain milled and water fetched for home.
Separate toilet facilities for girls and boys will also be built in newly constructed schools. Other
kinds of special assistance, such as free notebooks and school uniforms, and special tutorial
sessions will be given to girls on a pilot basis to test ways to expand girls' participation in
school. Community sensitization on the value of education and on the benefits of girls'
education will be undertaken. The training and employment of female teachers will also be an



Annex 2
Page 2 of 8
education will be undertaken. The training and employment of female teachers will also be an
important factor in attracting girls to attend school. The Government intends to increase the
proportion of teachers who are women from 25% in the base year to 35% by the fifth year of
ESDP.
Quality. Quality of schooling will be improved by: (1) raising the qualifications and
motivation of teachers, together with on-going support to teachers to enhance the quality of
teacher-learning; (2) improving the management of schools by training head teachers on school
management and administration; (3) providing feedback on student performance in national
examinations; (4) increasing the availability and use of textbooks from a student-textbook ratio
of 5:1 to 1:1 for core subjects; and (5) upgrading and refurbishing schools to improve learning
environment. Further quality improvements will be brought into the classrooms through
educational radio programs. Relevance of education will be enhanced through the use of local
languages, adaptation of curriculum and books to the socio-cultural environment of students.
Community involvement in enriching the curriculum will be encouraged. Automatic promotion
for grades 1 to 3 will help reduce dropouts in these early grades and allow late bloomers to catch
up with class as they mature.
Out of school children and adults will be reached through non-formal education.
Courses could be developed for: (1) basic education to reach those who have never been to
school; (2) functional literacy and numeracy for youth and adults; and (3) post-literacy for new
literates and school dropouts, utilizing distance education as the main medium for reaching this
segment of the population.
Secondary Education
Access. Major expansion of secondary education is deferred to beyond the first five-
years ESDP until the outflow from primary education begins generating demand for secondary
education. Interventions will focus on reducing overcrowding by building 357 classrooms and
constructing 83 new secondary schools. A greater proportion of the new construction will be
done in urban areas.
Quality. Just over 40% of teachers have the prerequisite teacher training, while 39% are
degree holders. Upgrading through in-service training, particularly through distance education
will be supported and the share of degree holder teachers will be introduced. Recently teacher
salaries have increased, and a new career structure that provides a path for professional growth
and advancement has been introduced. As in primary education, more funds will be provided to
increase the provision of school books.
Continuinz education for out-of school youth and adults. EMA and EMU will develop
distance education programs to reach the greater majority of youths who do not continue in the
formal education system.
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
The capital investment earmarked for TVET is meant to strengthen existing institutions,
while options are examined during the first and second years of the ESDP in order to develop a
more substantial plan that will improve TVET's relevance and quality. Major expansion will be
deferred pending preparation of these plans in some of the larger Regions.



Annex 2
Page 3 of 8
Interventions to improve relevance consist of market demand surveys, employer surveys
and curriculum reform based on the findings and with participation of the business sector. The
Government proposes to invite greater private sector involvement not only through survey
participation but also in provision of training. Modalities of private sector involvement will be
developed and presented.
Ouality Interventions consist of raising the quality of teachers and improving the
facilities and equipment at training centers. Practical experience in trades will be a requirement
for new TVET trainers. Similarly, less emphasis would be given to academic qualifications of
students provided they meet the minimum education standards. These interventions are likely to
increase the practical content of skills training.
Teacher Training
Interventions aimed at increasing the share of gualified teachers focus on the system's
capacity to produce or upgrade teachers. This will be achieved through expanded throughput
capacities of teacher training institutes, colleges, and faculties of education. At the same time,
distance education will be used for teacher upgrading that is cost effective and more accessible
to female teachers than residential training for upgrading.
Interventions to retain gualified teachers. As the economy continues to grow rapidly, the
school system is likely to face increased competition for its capable teachers, particularly
science, math and English teachers. Teacher salaries have been raised recently; periodic review
of teacher salaries will become necessary to retain competitiveness of the teaching profession.
For assignment to remote schools, an incentive package that consists of a hardship allowance,
accelerated professional advancement, preferential access to in-service training is being
considered. The ESDP will improve school environment by rehabilitating/renovating existing
schools and by providing more instructional materials and books.
Interventions to improve gualitv of teacher training. Quality of trainers is an important
factor determining quality of teacher training. Greater classroom orientation will be given in
teacher training; classroom teaching experience will be made a requisite qualification for newly
hired tutors for TTIs and TTCs, and a strategy will have to be developed for having currently
employed tutors without primary or secondary school experience acquire classroom experience.
National standards for certification will be set by a central body (to be determined) to assure that
minimum standards are met for all teachers certified. Books, teacher-guides, and other
instructional materials will be provided to the teacher training institutions. Teacher training
curriculum is being revised by the Institute for Curriculum Development and Research (ICDR)
and plans developed for the implementation of the new curriculum.
Tertiary Education
Im2roved efficiency. The average student teacher ratio of 7:1 ranges from 2:1 (School
of Pharmacy, Addis Ababa University) to 13:1 (Business College, Mekele in Tigray). This ratio
is low by international standards and indicates inefficiencies in the system. Gains in efficiency
could be achieved in use of staff resources, use of physical facilities, and resulting unit cost of
providing tertiary education. An internal review has been carried out by all tertiary institutions.



Annex 2

Increased number of engineers. educators. health workers and public administrators.
The Government puts high priority on roads, education and the health sector. An extensive
roads construction program is already underway; similarly ambitious expansion programs are
planned for the near future in health and education, substantially increasing demand for health
workers and educators beyond what the system has to offer. There is also unmet demand for
engineers. Therefore, the Government has proposed selective expansion of tertiary education.
Four engineering colleges, three medical schools and two education faculties will be upgraded
and two new health faculties and three education faculties will be established during the five
year ESDP. Additional staffing required for the expansion will be met initially by expatriate
teachers while local teaching staff receive training overseas.
A strategv for diversifving the resource base for tertiary education will be prepared and
implemented by the Ministry of Education by the third budget year of the ESDP. The strategy
will consider varied cost sharing mechanisms such as fees, privately sponsored students, student
loan schemes, and private provision of tertiary education.
Education Materials
The share of recurrent expenditures for non-salary items, such as textbooks, will be
increased to raise the quality of education while also encouraging community and household
financing for this purpose. Options will be explored for assuring a dependable supply of
affordable textbooks and instructional materials. By the third budget year of the ESDP, it is
planned to place the Education Materials Production and Distribution Agency (EMPDA) fully on
a commercial footing. During the second year of ESDP, a textbook policy will be developed to
support development of private publishing capacity and build capacity within the Ministry of
Education to implement and administer the textbook policy.
Institutional Development
(a) Ministry of Education
The shift to a federal structure of administration, following the change of Govemment in
1993, has resulted in a devolution of administration of public education at the primary and
secondary levels, as well as teacher training to the newly-established 11 Regional Education
Bureaus. Only the responsibility for the specialized agencies and universities and colleges were
retained within the Ministry. Consequently, the Ministry has been restructured and downsized to
carry out its responsibilities which are redefined to include: (a) setting national educational
policies and strategies and monitoring their implementation; (b) setting standards country-wide
and issuing criteria for teacher recruitment; (c) providing training opportunities and support for
training programs; (d) promoting private investment for education; (e) providing technical
support for regional offices; and (f) mobilizing external assistance.
Interventions proposed to strengthen the Ministry's capacity are: Strengthening the capacity
of the MOE to carry out research and Rolicv development which will lead to improvements in
the effectiveness of the education system and the efficiency of its operation. ESDP will
strengthen staffing for research, provide equipment, staff training and short-term technical
assistance as necessary to help build up the research capacity within the Ministry. Standards and
criteria to be reviewed or set by MOE for ESDP are:



Annex 2
Page 5 of 8
(i)    Teacher Training Institutes (TTIs) and Teacher Training Colleges
(TTCs) tutor qualifications (to emphasize classroom experience);
(ii)   teacher qualifications for TVET (emphasizing experience in the trade);
(iii)  student admissions requirements for TVET (to reduce emphasis on
academics); and
(iv)   teacher certification for in-service upgrading through distance education.
Planning and budgeting capacity. A financial management system with a computerized
accounts management system, capable of handling all donor-funded expenditures will be set
up, staff trained, and equipment provided. All ESDP expenditures, inclusive of donor
funded expenditures, will be subject to internal audits.
Monitoring and evaluation capacity. As the Secretariat to the Central Steering
Committee (CSC), the Planning and Projects Department of MOE will review and advise on
the progress reports and action plans submitted by the Regions, engage an independent body
to evaluate ESDP implementation progress, and submit consolidated reports for CSC
consideration. The Secretariat will prepare consolidated annual budget from Regional
submissions, coordinate preparations for an annual assessment of ESDP performance, and
facilitate twice-yearly joint-donor supervision mission. Additional staff, training and
equipment, as well as short-term consultancies will be provided to strengthen the capacity of
the MOE. Particularly important for monitoring and evaluation is the management of
information flows through the education system. Collation, processing and analysis of
education data should be carried out as close to the source as possible.
(b) Regional Education Bureaus
The decentralization of administration and management for primary and secondary
education is based on the rationale that educational services are best managed by agencies
located closer to communities. The major tasks of the Regional Education Bureaus (REBs)
include: (i) adapting national educational policies and programs to meet regional needs; (ii)
expanding basic education with the goal of achieving universal primary education; (iii)
organizing and administering the regional education system; (iv) promoting private investment
in education; (v) ensuring an adequate supply of educational facilities; and (vi) maintaining
national education standards and criteria.
Capacity to Adapt National Policies and Programs. The Regions' capacity to adapt
national policies and programs to meet their regional needs has grown impressively in the short
period they have interacted with intemational experts in preparing ESDP plans. However, the
capacity of the Regions varies; cross-Regional support as well as assistance from the MOE are
helping to improve the capacity of disadvantaged Regions. This experience has shown that
capacity building is most effective when tied to work at hand. Further training for Regional staff
in the future might be made to coincide with the development of the annual work program.
Funding for periodic training will be provided under the ESDP.



Annex 2
Page 6 of 8
Improved Implementation capacity. Financial management and procurement on the
scale of the ESDP with donor involvement will be new to most Regions. Additional staffing
may be needed by the Regions, and their staff will need to be trained in the procedures and
guidelines to be followed. Initial intensive training needs to be followed by periodic
reinforcement to consolidate and deepen the knowledge staff have acquired and also as a means
of obtaining feedback to improve the procedures and guidelines. The Govemment will also
consider contracting out some tasks such as supervision of civil works, textbook supply, etc., to
achieve speedy implementation.
Monitoring and Evaluation Capacity. The quality of information obtained from woreda
and zones will need to be improved. Information management capacity at the Regional level
will also need to be improved. The Regions are encouraged to create capacity in the lower levels
of Government so that data processing and analysis can be handled at the zonal and woreda
levels where the findings become immediately useful. Staffing, training, equipment and
logistical support required for efficient monitoring and evaluation are being developed.
(c) Central Education Agencies
There is a significant role for the Educational Media Agency (EMA), Institute of
Curriculum Development (ICDR), and the National Organization for Examinations (NOE) to
play for quality assurance, technical assistance in highly specialized expertise, and for assuring
consistency across Regions.
Education Media Agency (EMA). Ethiopia has a strong broadcasting infrastructure for
education and decades of experience and commitment to using distance education to strengthen
education. Distance education has been mostly a centralized operation with EMA at the helm.
Following decentralization, Educational Media Units (EMU) have been set up in each of the
Regions. EMA and EMU jointly have the capacity to produce and broadcast educational radio
programs in 13 languages. The full educational potential for distance education has not been
realized because of limited capacity for program development, lack of transmission facilities in
some Regions, weak transmission signals in remote areas, inadequate provision of receivers.
EMA's five year development plan, prepared two years earlier, is being updated to make it
consistent with ESDP goals and the progress in regionalization, especially how the center (EMA)
and EMUs in the Regions will collaborate in the design, production and implementation of the
programs.
Distance education under ESDP will strengthen EMA's multimedia approach, utilizing
print materials, face-to-face meetings when appropriate in addition to broadcast media. It will
supplement classroom instructions in primary and secondary schools, support non-formal and
continuing education for out-of-sch6ol children and adults, and provide alternative means to
teacher in-service training. EMA and EMU will (a) build capacity in program development, (b)
build capacity for research and evaluation (c) update facilities and equipment, and (d) explore
further technological advancements in distance education such as interactive ratio instruction
(IRI).
Institute of Curriculum Development and Research (ICDR). Curriculum
development has been the responsibility of the Institute of Curriculum Development and
Research (ICDR) at the center. With recent initiatives for decentralization, each Region has the



Annex 2
Page 7 of 8
freedom to adapt the curriculum developed by the ICDR to suit regional conditions. Regions are
exercising that right mostly for primary education, for the time being, to adapt to local
languages. Following the new education policy's introduction of a change in the education
structure, extending the primary level from the 6th to the 8th grade, ICDR has, over a period of
four years, revised the primary curriculum.
The objectives of further curriculum reforms are to: (a) improve quality; (b) enhance the
relevance of education; (c) increase gender sensitivity; and (d) improve curriculum
implementation in the classroom.
*  To improve quality - ICDR provides curriculum guidelines to the Regions from which
the Regions evolve locally relevant curricula, using appropriate national languages. The
prototype curriculum developed by ICDR puts emphasis on the development of basic
skills in literacy, numeracy, communications and problem solving, and reduced
emphasis on rote learning. An integrated curriculum is promoted (for environmental
science, language, arts, and aesthetic subjects), particularly for early years of schooling,
to provide an integrated educational experience.
*  To increase the relevance of education, the use of mother tongue is promoted as a
medium of instruction in the lower primary grades (and in some Regions even in upper
grades). Considerable work has been done in the use of national languages. For most,
materials have been created from scratch, translated or adapted to cover all subject areas.
Nineteen local languages are now in use in classrooms throughout the country; glossaries
and dictionaries are being developed for these languages. In addition to classroom
instruction, successful development of local languages depends on a favorable literacy
environment beyond the confines of the school. Production and distribution of creative
literature, newspapers and booklets in local languages will be encouraged. ESDP will
support tapping community resources for developing materials in the mother tongue,
non-text materials such as artifacts, songs, oral poetry or other forms of oration.
Traditional ceremonies and festivals can be brought into the school and classrooms
through a variety of means. This will involve the community members directly in
curriculum development work and help break down the artificial barriers between school
and society and strengthen community involvement.
*  To increase gender sensitivity, the new curriculum guidelines have taken up the
challenge and have attempted to remove all manifestations of gender bias from
curriculum materials. However, unconscious gender biases still remain in books (girls
and women depicted in subsidiary social roles) and poor representation of women on
curriculum panels. More guidance will be provided by ICDR to school heads and
teachers on what to watch out for, what to prevent, what to work towards in promoting
gender equity as envisaged in the new curriculum.
*  To improve curriculum implementation in the classroom, intensive training in
curriculum development is proposed for the Regional staff to create a critical mass of
qualified curriculum specialists; short-term training and study visits are proposed for
ICDR staff. It has also been suggested that pedagogical centers, which are an important
feature of the educational landscape in Ethiopia and found in nearly every school, could
be used for training teachers in the spirit of the new curriculum but also for involving
teachers in curriculum development work. A study is being undertaken by ICDR to



Annex 2
Page 8 of 8
identify training needs.
National Organization for Examinations. Design, production and administration of
national examinations for grades 6, 8, and 12 have in the past been spread between MOE and
Addis Ababa University. The new education policy mandated these functions be brought
under one roof. The National Organization for Examinations (NOE) was created in 1996.
With the change in the education structure from the 6- to 8-year primary cycle and automatic
promotion in grades 1 through 3, children will now sit for only one national examination in
grade 8, in lieu of a grade 6 exam. The Government will carry out a baseline study of grade
4 student achievement.
Major constraints to the system, as identified by the NOE, are inadequate administrative
and technical capacity, particularly lack of expertise in educational measurement, poor
quality examination items and lack of research, perception of public examinations solely as a
selection tool, regional variation in grading capacities, problems that may arise in the future
from exam administration in different local languages.
The NOE's objectives are to: (a) establish an organization that is capable of effectively
managing public examinations; (b) integrate examinations with the teaching-learning process
through feedback; and (c) develop research capacity.
*  Establishing an efficient organization - the main responsibility of the NOE is to provide
efficient service in managing public examination. Skill composition of the staff required
has been identified and recruitment is underway. The NOE premises will be fitted with
security features to protect the confidentiality of examination papers. Equipment and
furnishing necessary for NOE operation will also be provided. Respective roles of the
Regions, NOE, and tertiary institutions will be clarified. Short-term technical assistance
will be provided on supplementary areas of expertise that are needed to build-up NOE's
capacity such as item banking. NOE staff will be trained through short-term specialized
training and study tours. Regional staff will receive training and guidelines on grading
procedures to redress anomalies in examination results reported.
*  Integrating examinations with the teaching-learning process - public examinations have
been largely viewed as a selection mechanism for the next level of the education ladder.
With ESDP support, NOE will make assessment an integral part of the teaching-learning
process. Examination results will be analyzed and detailed feedback provided to schools
on student performance. Training and guidance will be provided to teachers on own
classroom assessment.
*  Developing research capacity - there is a need for quality information about student
achievement levels that would be of value to policy makers, education planners,
management, curriculum experts, and teachers. A national learning achievement sample
baseline survey for grade 4 will be carried out in the third year of ESDP to establish the
baseline.

EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Economic Assessment
Links to CAS
The latest Country Assistance Strategy for Ethiopia sets as a goal the improvement in human
capital and the provision of direct and immediate benefits to the poor as foundation for sustained long-
term development. This is justified on the basis of extremely low educational attainment. The existing
gender bias, which manifests itself in very low girls' school enrollment, is singled out for immediate
attention. 'rhus, there is a need for increased emphasis on education and improvement in women's
status. The CAS calls for an increase in the primary enrollment ratio to 50 percent by 2002 (25 percent
in backward areas).
Links to Sector Work
The Ethiopia: Social Sector Strategy Note (February 1997, white cover) recommends that efforts
be made to increase coverage so that at least half of all primary school aged children receive basic
education in the next five years (from 30 percent). The strategy recommended includes a school
rebuilding program and a reduction in the high opportunity cost of schooling in rural areas. With school
enrollment rates among the lowest in the world, low quality schooling, high opportunity costs,
prevalence of overaged children in classrooms, and high repetition and dropout rates, make education a
priority public sector investment. In addition to a rebuilding program, the Social Sector Strategy Note
recommends that more schools be built closer to communities in order to ensure the demand for schools
so that enrollment targets can be met. Local strategies to reduce the opportunity cost of schooling are
suggested, for example, making changes to the school calendar so that classes are not scheduled during
the important harvest season. This would free children for school attendance.
Rationale for Public Intervention
Along with extremely low enrollments and the need to improve the human capital base of the
country, Ethiopia's Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) is a sector investment program that:
*  Support the sector policy framework
*  Is sector-wide in approach
*  Places local stakeholders in the driver's seat
*  Assures that all the main donors sign on
*  Proposes to put in place common implementation arrangements
*  Minimizes long-term technical assistance
The ESDP translates the sector policy framework into a program of expenditures over time for
the sector. By bringing together all expenditures within the sector-recurrent and capital, local and
donor-the problem of fungibility is reduced, given that a high quality expenditure program is in place.
Without the program, progress towards universal primary education will be slow and expensive.



Annex 4
Page 2 of 26
The need to use local building materials will prove costly, as replacement costs will rise. The
government program will be jeopardized without donor assistance and coordination. The value-added of
donor assistance and concentrated effort is documented by the simulation exercise carried out by
Government.
Alternative Financing Scenario Simulation. A thorough risk assessment and contingency plans
for each component were developed for use in the planning and implementation stages of ESDP.
Specific actions include modeling the effects of not achieving key targets and drawing up contingency
plans. The Planning and Project Department of the Ministry of Education carried out the 41ternative
Financing Scenarios of the Education Sector Development Program (November 1997). The analysis
takes ESDP goals and objectives and compares these to the base case, which is the situation projected to
take place without the ESDP. The financing situation and enrollments without ESDP (base case) were
projected. The analysis shows the effect of the increase in expenditures and enrollment targets with
ESDP (goal).
Key project components and critical assumptions are analyzed in terms of risk assessment
(likelihood that assumption is correct) and effect on financing if assumption does not work out. For
example, in civil works it is assumed that an adequate number of contractors are available, that no delay
in the completion of works will take place, and that the financing is available on time.
Alternative scenarios are spelt out and contingency plans are drawn up:
*  In the first scenario, it is assumed that sources of finances are inadequate. The shortfall in funds
is assumed not to affect quantitative targets (for example, enrollment targets are kept constant).
Also, the same number of schools will be built, the same number of teachers will be trained and
the same number of books will be printed. However, the unit cost of building a school, training a
teacher and printing a book and procuring materials and equipment is reduced. A reduction in
the cost of construction is assumed to be realized by the use of somewhat inferior building
material. The duration of teacher training will be reduced and class size in teacher training
institutes will be increased. As the analysis points out, the problems with this approach are that
the demand for education may be reduced, the quality of education will not increase, and further
community participation is required. In the long term, costs will increase because of the lack of
maintenance of school buildings (see below) and replacement of books.
*  In the second scenario, implementation risks are the problem. It is assumed that civil works are
delayed, resulting in fewer schools being built. In addition, fewer desks, materials and books are
supplied, and fewer teachers are trained. In the analysis, unit costs are kept constant. In order to
maintain the enrollment targets, class size is increased significantly. Therefore, the implication
is that the quality of education is reduced since there are fewer trained teachers, overcrowded
classrooms and fewer teaching bours.
*  In the third scenario, both financial and implementation risks take their toll. Both unit costs and
quantities are reduced, and as a result the total cost is reduced. In this case both access to
education and quality will be affected negatively. The reduction in the number of schools and
classrooms to be built and the quantity of equipment and furniture supplied will result in low
access to education. Similarly, the reduction in the supply of books and teachers will result in
high pupil:book and pupil:teacher ratios.



Annex 4
Page 3 of 26
* In the fourth scenario, unit costs are increased because of an assumed increase in the price of
educational inputs. Quantities and quality remain the same, but it is assumed that teachers'
salaries and administrative costs are increased by 10 percent, that operating costs are increased
by 25 percent, and that other costs rise by 6 percent. Outcomes will be the same, but unit and
total costs will rise significantly.
Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 will involve a smaller outlay of cash than would ESDP in the short term, but
costs will rise over time. In addition, access to education and the quality of schooling will be lower in
the long run. Scenario 4 increases the financial burden in the short term without increasing access or
quality. Nevertheless, the cost escalation implied in scenario 4 would increase total costs by less than 6
percent. Therefore, ESDP is the best alternative to increase access and improve the quality of education.
This exercise contributes to a useful risk assessment and consideration of alternatives.
Contingency plans are described and fully costed. It forces a useful prioritization for ESDP. It is indeed
rewarding to see that primary education remains a priority. With ESDP, primary education gets 60
percent of the capital expenditures, thus more than doubling its share in the base case.
The exercise also helps highlight once again key risks. The implications of not adequately
dealing with these risks upfront are made clear. Thus, efforts to minimize known risks early on, for
example, through review of contractor capacity at the regional level, are given high priority.
The exercise also highlights the long-term benefits of a fully implemented and fully financed
ESDP. Not only in terms of enrollments (equity, access, rural, poor, girls), but also quality (books,
teachers, curriculum, better schools). There are long term savings involved. For example, better schools
and less maintenance results in more schools, higher enrollments and greater community interest in the
long run.
The exercise also contributes to the justification of ESDP. Fully implemented and fully
financed, and supported by donors, ESDP will result in higher enrollments and higher quality of
schooling. Without the program, primary education would not receive the priority it is accorded under
ESDP, and the efficiency of the system will be lower. Thus, there is more than adequate justification for
public intervention.
Fungibilitv. Development assistance is fungible, not only within the sector, but also among
sectors. ESDP avoids the problem of fungibility. There is, therefore, a higher probability of success in
terms of development impact. First, however, the overall expenditure program needs to be examined.
This has been done in the case of Ethiopia in the recently completed Public Expenditure Review, which
focused on all three sector investment programs (education, health and roads). The public expenditure
review exercise certified the ESDP as satisfactory, implying therefore that the Bank's financing will have
a positive development impact even if it ends up financing expenditures other than those actually
appraised by the Bank.
The alternative financing scenario simulations demonstrate the value-added of the Bank's
finance (as well as that of other donors). Bank financing expands the public expenditure envelope. This
provides an assessment of the marginal project that is being financed because of the availability of Bank
finance.

Market Failure. Years of neglect, civil strife, low quality schooling, and a lack of tradition make
it extremely difficult to increase the pace of school enrollments. As the economy is in transition and
adjustments take place, households and individuals will increase investment in human capital. In the
meantime, primary school (grades 1-6) enrollments in Sub-saharan Africa average 70 percent. Primary
school enrollments are only 35 percent in Ethiopia. But in order to increase enrollments in the interim,
public investment is needed, especially at lower levels, to increase attainment and retention, to produce a
literate population, and to increase household and labor market productivity.
Identifvin2 the Appropriate Form of Public Intervention
It is established that public intervention is required. However, the form of intervention could
vary. The main objective is to increase enrollments from a very low base. The program provides a good
plan for solving the problem of insufficient public classrooms, which is a constraint. But it would be
wrong to ignore issues of parental choice, which is another constraint to achieving objectives. Even in a
very poor country, it is true that poor, rural parents exercise choice. In terms of the demand for
education, they may choose not to send their children to school. Issues of importance include distance,
opportunity cost, language of instruction, direct monetary cost associated with schooling, gender issues,
cultural issues and lack of tradition.
Most regions in Ethiopia have implemented the national policy of abolishing school fees at the
primary level. This has resulted in a considerable increase in the demand for schooling in just a few
years. The gross enrollment ratio (grades 1-6) increased from 19.7 percent in 1992/93 to 34.6 percent in
1995/96. To the extent that language of instruction is an issue, all Regions have plans to introduce local
language learning into the curriculum. Some regions have already implemented this plan. Given the
perceived low returns to schooling, and low parental interest in education, simply increasing the supply
of schooling will not be enough to raise enrollments from such a low base. Thus, demand-side
interventions are necessary. To solve the problem of distance, the plan is to build new schools as close
as possible to students, especially in remote, rural areas. Specific demand-side measures have been
implemented. To attract girls, communities in some regions are being equipped with grinding mills,
sensitization,campaigns are under way, counseling is employed, separate toilets are being built, drinking
water is provided, and female teachers are being recruited.
Analysis of Alternatives
Geographic Targeting. The program will use geographic targeting as the first stage screening
device to reach the poor. Underserved areas will be chosen as sites for new construction of primary
schools. In fact, under ESDP there will be 2,423 new first cycle primary schools built within walking
distance of communities.
Targeting of Schools. Schools that are incomplete, in that they do not offer the complete set of
grades I to 8, will be targeted to ensure that they are made complete in that the schools offer the
complete primary school cycle. This strategy is designed to improve access to a complete school for the
households in these Regions. In fact, under ESDP, there will be 1,814 existing primary schools that will
be upgraded to provide room for two full cycles of primary education.
Choice of Technology. When there are technological alternatives by which one can realize the
same result when designing a project, then one has an instance of mutually exclusive alternatives because



Annex 4
Page 5 of 26
the choice of one technology precludes the use of another for the same purpose. The alternative one
chooses will be the one with the lower present value-but, if the total undiscounted cost of using the
different alternatives is different and they have differing time profiles, the alternative one chooses may
depend on the opportunity cost of capital.
The massive civil works campaign requires the coordinated effort of planners, educators,
communities and contractors. New primary school construction alone is a costly exercise (912 million
Birr), representing 25 percent of the capital expenditure of ESDP. These schools will need to
accommodate the students required to enroll in order for the project to attain the enrollment targets set in
the ESDP. To make it a good investment, the schools will have to last beyond the period of the ESDP, so
that Ethiopia can attain the goal of universal primary education by the year 2015, as set in the
Government plan. In order for schools to last, maintenance becomes an issue.
Historically, schools in Ethiopia have been built with a variety of materials, depending on local
conditions, donor involvement and community participation. During the previous regime, enrollment
drives necessitated the construction of chika-mud and thatch-schools, which are quick and cheap to
construct, but require heavy maintenance and in any case do not last many years. In more recent years a
variety of cheap techniques have been used in order to increase enrollments, including open-air schools.
Parents and communities do not appreciate the chika schools, which do not resist termites and wash away
in the rain. The building of chika schools also contributes to the depletion of forests.
Routine maintenance of school buildings is not a tradition in Ethiopia. Very little maintenance
and repair activities have been performed over the years. But it is demonstrated that the community is
more interested in maintaining the element schools because they value them more than the chika schools.
Still, school committees are not interested in maintaining schools, regardless of government
proclamation. It is necessary therefore that the government makes routine maintenance a priority and
take appropriate policy decisions.
According to the SIDA report on the construction of schools in Ethiopia (Participatory
Evaluation of EICMA (Educational Institutes Construction and Maintenance Agency), A Report to
Ministry of Education and SIDA, 1992) there are different kinds of chika schools. It is also true that any
kind of chika structure requires more maintenance than schools built by element (hollow concrete block,
stone, concrete element). It is also very true that Ethiopians do very little maintenance of school
buildings. For these and other reasons (see Table 1), under ESDP, schools will be built by something
other than chika, unless there are no local alternatives. From the SIDA report: "...chika schools are
uneconomical and should be abandoned...in the future all school buildings be constructed in solid
building materials (stone, concrete hollow blocks or concrete elements)..."

Chika schools certainly are a cheap initial investment (see Table 2). However, the maintenance
requirements are heavy and even a fully maintained chika school will not last much longer than ten
years. Hollow concrete block, stone and concrete element buildings appear to be more cost-effective.

* With full maintenance
The question of which technology to adopt for school buildings depends on crossover discount
rates. The lower the discount rate the more attractive are materials other than chika. Using the
information provided in the SIDA report, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out to determine which
building material would be the best choice for ESDP. The results of the analysis are summarized in
Table 3.

Note: Since the estimates of the life span of school buildings is arbitrary, then it is assumed that concrete, stone,
brick and concrete block buildings last for 40 years. Since stone is not transported, but only the concrete necessary,
the transportation cost increases are reduced to 5, 10 and 15 percent.
* Intemnal rate of return calculations based on savings due to selection of material versus chika
Fully maintained, hollow concrete block is a much better alternative. Assuming a discount rate
of 12 percent, then the preferred investment option is hollow concrete block.
However, maintenance is an issue in Ethiopia. Experience shows that school buildings are not
well maintained in Ethiopia. Chika requires heavy maintenance. There is no indication that this will
take place. Therefore, the assumption of full maintenance is not realistic. For this reason, the sensitivity
analysis considers the more realistic case that maintenance will be less than adequate. For simplicity
sake, half of the required maintenance is assumed to take place. Effectively, this makes all alternative
technologies preferable to chika construction. Given the fact that parents and communities are more
likely to get involved in the maintenance of element schools, then the returns to switching to an
alternative technology are likely underestimated here. With the more realistic assumption of half
maintenance, brick and stone, and possibly concrete element, are good investments.
The choice of technology of course depends also on the availability of local materials. It may
simply not be possible to transport certain materials to remote areas. The lack of roads in some cases is
real. The Roads SIP may help in some cases, but for many rural areas there will be impossible
transportation problems. In such cases there is no alternative other than building with chika. In less
severe cases there may be roads, but the cost of transporting materials may be prohibitive. To examine
this problem, sensitivity analysis was carried assuming scenarios of cost escalation due to transportation
difficulties of the order of magnitude of 10 to 30 percent. The results show that even in the case of
hollow concrete block there are instances when it is not a good investment.
All of the alternatives to chika have a lower present value. However, the total undiscounted cost
of using the different alternatives is different and they have differing time profiles. Therefore, the
altemative one chooses may depend on the opportunity cost of capital. In the cases examined here, the
higher the opportunity cost of capital assumed the greater the likelihood of choosing chika over the
altemative. This is because with the chika model one is postponing investment. In other words, there is
a discount rate at which chika becomes the preferred option, despite higher undiscounted total cost or
lower present value of the alternatives. To illustrate this example, the case of chika versus hollow



Annex 4

concrete block (HCB) is used. The present value of the two methods is plotted along with the associated
discount rate. As is shown in the graph, there is a discount rate at which building chika schools is
preferred to HCB. This is known as the crossover discount rate, which is 23 percent in the case
highlighted. This is the same as the internal rate of return calculated for the benefits (cost-savings)
stream presented above for the case of half-maintenance, which is (hopefully) the realistic scenario.

Benefits and Costs
The 1995/96 Household Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey and Welfare Monitoring
Surveys contain detailed information at the household level. These surveys were conducted by
Ethiopia's Central Statistical Authority. The surveys are national, covering all households, except in
non-sedentary populations in Afar and Somali. Earnings from wages were collected. However, the
earnings information cannot be matched with an individual, which is necessary for estimating returns to
investments in schooling. The survey does contain information on household head's personal
characteristics. As a second best solution, the monetary benefits of schooling are estimated using a
sample of household heads with a wage income.



Annex 4
Page 9 of 26
Very little information on the wage benefits of schooling exists for Ethiopia. Previous estimates
produced mixed results. For example, in P. Krishnan, "Returns to Schooling in Urban Ethiopia" (PHRD
Study), very low returns to primary schooling are estimated, but the sample dates back to 1990, the last
year of the Marxist regime and covers only urban youth between the ages of 15 to 29 years. D. Hoerr
("Educational Returns and Educational Reform in Ethiopia," Eastern Africa Economic Review,
December 1977) reports private returns to primary schooling of 20 percent, but the data are from 1972.
The present analysis uses the 1996 household survey, taking a sub-sample of household heads
with positive labor market earnings, in single wage earner households, aged between 15 and 65. Table 4
presents summary statistics of the main variables used in the analysis. Half the wage sample resides in
urban areas, and most are male. The average age is 38 years, and average schooling is less than four
years. Most wage earners have no education.

Mean earnings by educational level and sex and area of residence are presented in Table 5. Earn-
ings rise with schooling level, more or less doubling with each level. A considerable increase in earnings is
apparent from no education to primary. For females, earnings more than double from primary to
to secondary. In rural areas, there is not much of an increase in earnings from no education to primary, but
earnings triple for primary to secondary. In urban areas, the increase in earnings from primary to secondary
is not as large as the jump from no education to primary, or the increase from secondary to university.

Mincerian earnings functions fitted to the sample as a whole, by sex and by area of residence, are
presented in Table 6. Despite the fact that the sample consists of household heads from single-wage
earner households, the earnings functions are well behaved. The signs of the coefficients are correct.
The coefficient on the years of schooling variable (S) represents the increment in earnings associated
with completing another year of schooling. The increases in earnings estimates are summarized in Table
7. Overall, another year of schooling would increase earnings by about 23 percent. For males, earnings
increase by 23 percent for every year of schooling, slightly more than the estimate for females, at 21.5
percent. In rural areas, schooling increases earnings by 21 percent, while in urban areas, where the
average level of schooling is highest, schooling increases earnings by only 15 percent. Estimating the
earnings function with dummy variables representing the three levels of schooling shows that similar
increases in earnings result. Earnings increase by 25, 24 and 27 percent with the completion of primary,
secondary and university education.

This analysis shows that the returns to schooling in Ethiopia may be high. Of course, so far only
private benefits and costs have been considered. Brining in public resource costs of education allows one
to estimate social, or total, rates of return to educational investment. Unit costs in Ethiopia are high,
given extremely low enrollments at all levels. Adding recurrent unit costs and the resulting estimates of
social returns to education are much lower (Table 8). The largest differential between private and social
returns occurs at the tertiary level. Still, social returns to schooling are high enough to justify public
intervention. The highest returns occur at the level, where the bulk of investment is planned.

Primary education in particular has large effects on desired family size, on the perceived ideal age for
having a first child, and on the use of contraception. Primary education increases the probability of using
contraception by 32 percent, raises the perceived ideal age of having a first child by 10 months, and
reduces the desired number of children by 6 percent. The effect of education on fertility operates on the



Annex 4
Page 12 of 26
behavior and attitudes of the children. For example, a mother who has completed primary education
reduces the desired number of children, for her offspring, by 10 percent, and a father with the same
education lowers his offspring's desired number by 6 percent. Education also has an effect on health
outcomes. In rural areas, a mother with completed primary education is 60 percent more likely to make
sure that her child will get treatment if ill. Female education lowers stunting, wasting and child
mortality.
Fiscal ImRact
Overall fiscal trends. Ethiopia's economic indicators have improved significantly over the past
decade. In particular, as shown in Table 9, the average fiscal deficit has declined from 10.1 percent of
GDP in the late 1980s/early 1990s to about 7.7 percent of GDP in 1996/97. This decline is mainly due to
two factors: increasing revenues (from 11 percent in 1991/92 to about 17 percent in 1996/97) and a tight
expenditure policy.
Tax revenues as a share of GDP have increased from an average of 10.2 percent in 1991/92-
1994/95 to 12.8 percent in 1995/96. Tax revenues are mainly comprised of taxes on business profits,
indirect taxes and import duties. Non-tax revenues share of GDP increased slightly from 4 percent in
1991/92-1994/95 to 4.6 percent in 1995/96.
Fiscal trends during the past two years have been positive, reflecting increasing fiscal
consolidation and increasing allocations to social sectors and infrastructure (see Tables 10 and 11 for
recurrent and capital expenditures by sector). The latter is expected to significantly increase with the
Sector Investment Programs in education, health and roads. A detailed assessment of the fiscal impact of
the education ESDP, as well as its combined impact with health and road SIPs, was undertaken by the
World Bank through its Public Expenditure Review. A summary of the analysis and conclusions is given
below.

Expenditure Trends and Fiscal Implications of the ESDP. As shown in Table 12, although
education's share of GDP increased from 2.7 percent in 1992-93 to 4.1 percent in 1993-94, its budgeted
share for 1996/97 has declined to 3.8 percent. In spite of an increase in education's share of the total
government budget from 11.5 percent in 1992/93 to 14.5 percent in 199,6/97, declines have been
observed since 1993/94 in expenditures on primary education (from 59.7 percent to current 53.7 percent),
as well as recurrent expenditures (from 9 percent to current 8 percent), especially in terms of operations
and maintenance. The non-wage component of recurrent costs has declined in 1993/94, contributing to a
continuous shortage of textbooks and teaching materials. All these underscore the need to address the
issue of whether recurrent expenditures are adequately accounted for in the ESDP's budget, especially
given that one of its main objectives is to increase the quality of schooling.

annual real growth rate of 6 percent. Fiscal revenues are expected to increase to 19 percent of GDP
while expenditures are expected to decrease to 24 percent of GDP. These projections, however, do not
take into account the combined impact of the three SIPs.
Intersectoral Cost Comparisons. As can be seen from Table 13, recurrent spending in education
is expected to increase by approximately 8.5 percent annually. This is the lowest among the recurrent
growth estimates for the three sectors but this rate is still below the observed growth rates for recurrent
spending on education in the past five years. On the other hand, the projected 15 percent annual increase
in recurrent spending on health seems feasible and in line with observed increases in sectoral
expenditures. The roads SIP has the largest estimated impact on total govemment recurrent expenditures.
Sectoral spending on roads is expected to grow at a nominal annual rate of 40 percent for the next five
years.

Capital expenditures for both education and health SIPs would have to increase annually by 38
percent and 30 percent. These targets are significantly higher than the observed spending in the social
sectors shown in Table 14.

As can be seen from Table 15 and Figures l.a and l.b, the incremental annual impact of the three
SIPs is relatively small during the first two years of implementation at approximately Birr 900 million.
However, from 1998 onwards, SIP-related incremental costs are projected to increase annually to more
than Birr 4 billion.

The substantial increase in SIP-related expenditures could result in a decline in funding for non-
SIP sectors, if additional revenues and/or grants generated are insufficient. The Public Expenditure
Review estimates a Birr 14 billion reallocation from other sectors to finance incremental SIP-related
expenditures assuming that Ethiopia's government expenditure path conforms with the overall 1996/97
expenditure envelope agreed to in the PFP. In terms of intersectoral recurrent expenditure effects (Figure
2.a), the combined recurrent spending increase from 22 percent to 29 percent for the three SIPs will only
lead to a minimal reallocation from non-SIP sectors (about 1.5 percent annually). However, the
intersectoral capital expenditure effects (Figure 2.b) are substantial because the increase in combined
capital spending for the three SIPs will rise from 35 percent to 86 percent. This implies a drop in the
proportion of non-SIP capital expenditures to only 14 percent of total capital spending for 1997-2002.

Over-all Fiscal Impact. Assessment of the fiscal sustainability of the SIPs was undertaken in the
Public Expenditure Review within the context of a medium-term macroeconomic framework with
alternative assumptions about GDP growth rates, government revenue efforts (tax and non-tax) and
balance of payments.
One way of assessing fiscal sustainability is to assess the consistency of higher SIP-related
expenditure levels with the fiscal and debt parameters defined in the Government's medium term PFP



Annex 4
Page 21 of 26
1996/97-1998/99 under alternative macroeconomic conditions. The situation is considered sustainable if
there is a continued reduction in the total debt to GDP ratio over time. Fiscal sustainability was
evaluated given three medium term growth paths with government revenues modified in line with the
underlying revenue elasticity of the PFP for each scenario. Alternative financing scenarios were also
evaluated for each of the GDP growth assumptions. Moreover due to the observed underspending on the
capital budget that was observed during the past years and the perceived existing implementation
capacity constraints, especially at the regional and woreda levels, the possibility of extending the
implementation period for each of the three SIPs beyond the 5 year period was examined.
Under the Public Expenditure Review baseline scenario which reflects the projected growth path
of the economy under the assumptions outlined in the PFP without the fiscal impact of the SIPs, the
overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) must be maintained within the range of 5 to 7 percent of GDP to
help boost the very low domestic savings rate. The overall fiscal balance after grants is estimated to be -
0.3 percent of GDP on average for 1997-2002. As can be seen from Table 16, under unfavorable
macroeconomic conditions (low GDP growth and no additional grant financing beyond what is assumed
in the PFP), the full implementation of all three SIPs as planned would result in an overall average fiscal
deficit after grants of 7 percent of GDP. Under favorable macroeconomic conditions (high growth and
with additional grant financing of 50 percent of SIP-related incremental capital expenditures) the average
fiscal deficit after grants will be 2.2 percent of GDP for 1997-2002.

Recommendations. A comparison of the various scenarios suggests that Ethiopia will only
achieve a continued reduction in debt-to-GDP ratio if additional grant financing is mobilized from
abroad to finance the SIPs and the real GDP growth rate is at least that which is assumed in the PFP. It
might be possible to reexamine the macroeconomic framework in consultation with the World Bank and
the IME to see if there is more fiscal space under the current high growth rates. The implementation
period of the SIPs could also be extended. The government could also try to reduce the public sector part



Annex 4
Page 22 of 26
of the SIP- related expenditures through increasing private sector involvement and via the cost recovery
mechanism.
Ethiopia faces high risks through external shocks such as a drought or a slower than anticipated
private sector supply response. Either or both these factors could be detrimental to GDP growth over the
medium term and lead to a shortfall in Government's revenues. In such a case, even with additional
grant financing of 50 percent of capital costs of the three SIPs, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase
towards a fiscally unsustainable level by the late 1990s. If faced with such a contingency, the
government may have to slow down the implementation of some components of the SIPs, actively
engage the private sector and NGOs, mobilize community participation, and escalate efforts to improve
fiscal revenues
Thus, in order to mitigate the tremendous fiscal impact of SIPs and maintain financial
sustainability of increased public expenditures, the government is encouraged to re-assess its plans and
ensure that the planning and implementation rate of the SIPs take into account:
*  Realistic macroeconomic growth projections taking into account possible macroeconomic shocks
*  Existing implementation capacity, especially in the zones and woredas
*  Adequate funding for recurrent, non-wage expenditures to make sure those quality objectives
will be achieved
*  A medium term public expenditure framework
All the SIPs do not have to be implemented in five years. The SIP-implementation extension
scenario confirms that extending the implementation period is a promising option that would allow the
Government to further approach macroeconomic stabilization and a declining debt-to-GDP ratio.
The impact of SIPs on sectoral expenditures in education and health are much less dramatic than
in the roads sector. Fewer problems should be expected with regard to recurrent expenditures in the
education sector. With the SIPs recurrent spending on education would need to grow at a rate of about
8.5 percent per year. This rate is below the growth rates for recurrent spending on education in the past
five years.
However, the ESDP implies ambitious targets with regard to annual increases in capital
spending. Capital spending under the ESDP will increase by 38 percent per year. This target is high
relative to the observed underspending in the sector. Up to one-third of budgeted capital expenditures in
education are not spent. For the envisaged ESDP to be implemented by the Government within the
proposed five-year period, vigorous efforts on the part of all stakeholders will be necessary in order to
substantially improve implementation capacity, especially at the regional and woreda levels.
Specifically for education, although recurrent expenditures envisaged under ESDP are below
historic levels, there is a need to monitor actual expenditures over time and ensure that the level of
spending is adequate to obtain the necessary level of quality. In terms of capital expenditures, given the
tendency to underspend, it is necessary that steps be taken early on to improve implementation capacity,
especially at the lower levels. In addition, supervision of projects should be improved, with increased
resources budgeted by donors.
To ensure that the ESDP can be implemented on time, efforts to increase private sector
involvement should be taken immediately. Efforts to implement cost-recovery mechanism at the upper



Annex 4
Page 23 of 26
secondary and tertiary levels could be stepped up. Community participation should also be maintained.
The Alternative Financing Scenarios Simulation exercise undertaken by the Government underscores the
importance of contingency plans and risk-mitigating efforts.
Implementation of the ESDP will require close monitoring. Implementation capacity-from
budgets, to decentralized decision-making, civil works, project supervision, teacher training-will need
to be monitored closely and steps taken to improve the situation early on. External finance and donor
supervision will need to be stepped up.
Policy changes that may need to occur in order to make ESDP possible include implementing
cost-recovery plans at the tertiary and upper secondary levels. Once the results of the PHRD II study on
the role of the private sector in education is completed, it may be necessary for the government to take
positive steps to increase private sector participation in education. Private education may be necessary in
order to make ESDP affordable. Increased private sector activity, especially at the secondary and tertiary
levels, will free up government resources to target at the lower levels of schooling, especially in the
disadvantaged regions of the country.
Povert Analysis
In urban areas most primary school-aged children are enrolled (Table 17). Junior secondary
school enrollment rates are higher in urban areas. Enrollment rates are particularly low in rural areas,
and for higher levels of schooling. One of the reasons for low enrollment rates in rural areas is the high
opportunity cost of schooling. An indicator of the high opportunity cost of primary schooling is distance.
In rural areas, the distance to primary school is often great. For example, in Dire Dawa, the distance
between two rural schools is 12 kilometers on average, while in urban areas it is only 0.7 kilometers.
ESDP addresses this barrier to schooling in rural areas by allocating funds for the construction of 1,951
primary schools within walking distance of rural communities.

Enrollment rates for the wealthiest families are two times greater than enrollment rates for the lowest

Consistent with having one of the lowest enrollment rates in the world, very few Ethiopian
families send their children to school (Table 19). Overall, only 7 percent of all families send their
children to school. Less than 6 percent of the poorest families send their children to school. Reducing
the direct cost of schooling would contribute to an increase in enrollment by the poor. The Government
has implemented a policy of no fees at the primary level.

Overall, females are under-represented at school (Table 20). Furthermore, there has been very
little if any progress over the last few years. This is despite the fact that enrollments in general have
been increasing. Only in Addis Ababa do girls have a higher share of the enrollments. Specific
interventions aimed at increasing female enrollments will be implemented under ESDP. Some regions
are implementing schemes to reduce the opportunity cost of schooling for girls, including the location of
grinding mills close to schools. One of the objectives of ESDP is to increase the share of qualified

teachers. The presence of female teachers in the classroom increases the likelihood that girls will enroll.
Table 21 shows that there is much to be done at the primary level grades 7-8 and at secondary level.

Females suffer in all key education indicators. They are less likely to enroll, complete, pass and
they are more likely to repeat grades (Table 22).

Recurrent expenditure trends by region are highlighted in Table 23. Overall, expenditures on
education have increased over the years. However, given the increase in enrollments, per student
expenditures have remained fairly constant.

EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
1. Implementing Agencies
Central Level. MOE's Planning and Project Department (PPD) will be responsible for the
ESDP components handled by the Center. PPD is staffed by experienced technical staff, including a
procurement specialist, with previous experience in IDA financed projects. The PPD will coordinate
program implementation at the national level, will provide the Regions with standardized
specifications and designs for civil works, and will carry out international procurement on its own or
through agents such as its Central Procurement Cell (CPC) on behalf of the Regions requesting its
assistance. A new position of procurement specialist has been created at the MOE in order to build up
capacity for the Program.
Regional LeveL The 11 Regions and administrations of Ethiopia will be fully responsible
for the implementation and supervision of about 90% of the procurement activities under ESDP. The
Management Committee in each REB represents the regional Executing Agency (EA) with
implementation and supervision responsibilities passed on to zonal and woreda educational offices.
Since the Regions are still inexperienced in handling international procurement, the Center will handle
large procurement packages under international competitive bidding (ICB). The capacity of each
Region to execute and supervise procurement will be assessed and agreed with the Bank before
implementation. Regions will also have the option to contract out procurement and supervision tasks
to the private sector. The organization and staffing proposed by the Regions will be reviewed and
agreed by the Bank. Training of at least two senior staff through regional courses conducted by the
Eastern & Southern African Management Institute/International Labor Organization
(ESAMI/ILO) will be required.
2.     Procurement of Works
Civil works under ESDP include construction of new schools, upgrading of facilities, and
rehabilitation. The majority of the new construction will be in rural areas, not serviced by roads, and
ICB may be viable only for urban areas, such as Addis Ababa where suitable contract packaging may
attract foreign contractors. A "package and slice" approach will be used to encourage competition
among qualified contractors. For contracts to be awarded on the basis of ICB, domestic contractors
may be awarded a margin of preference of 7.5%. ICB procurement will be subject to prior review.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used for most of the small constructions and
rehabilitation works, less than US$1 million per individual contract. National standard bidding
documents, previously reviewed by the Bank, and specifications drafted by the MOPW (Ministry of
Public Works) will be used throughout the program. Procurement actions under NCB will be subject
to post-review with the exception of the first three contracts for each Region (see Table A6. 1).
The Bank's Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) expected to be carried out in March,
1998 will likely contribute to the establishment of a new procurement code for Ethiopia based on the
UNCITRAL model code.



Annex 6
Page 2 of II
Small Works (SW) method of procurement, may be used in the most remote areas of
Ethiopia when the NCB method is not practical. Contracts under SW should be equal to or less than
US$75,000 per contract and not exceed $4,500,000 in the aggregate. Simplified construction methods
and procedures such as lump sum fixed budget contracts will be used, as described in a manual of
procedures to be reviewed by IDA.
Direct Contracting will be used subject to prior approval of IDA when specified in the DCA
and in exceptional cases such as an extension of an existing contract previously awarded through
competitive bidding.
3.     Procurement of Goods
Procurement of vehicles, motorcycles and locally unavailable equipment will be procured to
the extent possible in large packages through ICB. Packaging will be based on geographical
considerations, calendar of completion of construction works, school calendar, and seasonal changes.
ICB will be staged to assure maximum competition by international contractors and to avoid stock of
undelivered equipment. Under ICB, domestically manufactured goods (as defined in donors
agreements) may be granted a margin of preference of 15% of the CIF (cost in freight) or CIP (cost,
insurance, and place of destination ). Equipment will be preferably delivered to destination sites by the
suppliers and their local agents. Regions may also contract-out inland transportation of goods to the
private sector.
Furniture and other goods that are available locally and difficult to package, with individual
contracts of less than $200,000, will be procured under NCB from local suppliers under national
regulations acceptable to IDA. Contracts of goods for different Regions will be packaged whenever
possible. Local Shopping, with bids from three or more qualified suppliers may be used for contracts
less than US$30,000. Direct Contracting will be used for purchasing small quantities of spare parts
for existing equipment.
Procurement of textbooks and educational materials, presently solely furnished by
Educational Materials Production and Distribution Agency (EMPDA) will be subject to competitive
bidding. ICB will be used for items such as library books and printing jobs sufficiently large to
attract international competition. For special printing and publishing packages of individual contract
value of less than US$200,000, Limited International Bidding or International may have to be used as
an alternative to ICB. Most of the contracts, however, will be very small due to the number of
languages in which textbooks will be published and will be procured through NCB. Contracts will be
generally below US$100,000. Foreign bidders will be allowed to make offers.
Procurement from EMPDA (which will be commercialized during ESDP) or other suppliers
on a sole source basis may still be necessary for Regions and zones where demand cannot be satisfied
by any competitive means. A number of printing and duplicating work will also be carried out "in-
house" in Regions such as Amhara that have their own printing or copying facilities.



Annex 6
Page 3 of 11
4.     Consulting Services
Consulting services by either local or international consultants will be required particularly
during Program preparation and early stages of ESDP. Various selection methods will be used
depending on the type and size of contracts, and whether individual consultants or consulting firms
will be used. For both individual consultants and consulting firms, clear Terms of Reference (TORs),
well defined transfer of skills or capacity building components, and performance indicators will be
drafted and subject to IDA prior review. Use of individual consultants by MOE and Regions is
expected in market research, editing, distribution and procurement of textbooks. Most individual
consultants will be recruited based on their qualifications, as per Bank consultant guidelines.
Recruitment of consultingfirms may be required for supervision of works, auditing, and other tasks.
Assignments will be advertised in Development Business and, if necessary, in specialized magazines.
Requests for Proposals (RFPs) will also be sent to shortlisted firms. Evaluation of firms will be based
mostly on technical factors with adequate weight given to the price offer. Other methods of selection
may be chosen and stated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The selection process for
assignments beyond the threshold of US$ 100,000 equivalent for individual consultants and
US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms will be subject to prior review (see table A6. 1).
In areas where competition for special expertise does not exist, small assignments linked with
individual consultants may be assigned on the basis of the "Consultants Qualifications" method of
selection. The value of these contracts will not be higher than US$50,000. Training contracts will
follow the same selection procedures used for consulting assignments, though in special cases such
as specialized courses, a particular institution may be designated.
Contracting out of activities for which MOE does not possess the technical expertise such as
supervision of works, maintenance and transport, may also represent a viable alternative to
expensive, long term, capacity building of technical staff.
5.     Implementation Manuals
Implementation manuals for Regional use, including acceptable procedures for procurement
and disbursement will be prepared and agreed with the Bank prior to effectiveness.
6.     Prior and Post-Review of Procurement
Works contracts above a threshold of US$400,000 and the first three contracts of any value of
each Region under NCB will be subject to IDA prior review procedures. The review process would
cover advertising of the General Procurement Notice (GPN) in Development Business, Standard
Bidding Documents (SBDs), and specifications, tendering procedures and evaluation, and contract
signature. Prior review will also be required for ICB procurement of goods and packages of textbooks
and equipment above a US$200,000 tjhreshold. The first NCB standard bid documents for goods and
works and the Manuals of procedures will be subject to Bank review before their initial use in the
Program.
All other procurement will be subject to post-review of a representative sample of contracts
on a yearly basis. Aside from the documentation concerning procurement and awards, information to
be recorded for post-review will include: quarterly reports with revised cost estimates and allowances
for physical and price contingencies; revised timing of procurement actions and schedule of
implementation and compliance with limits on specified procurement methods.



Annex 6
Page 4 of II
7.     Procurement Schedules
The physical targets to be achieved entail preparatory procurement activities. The indicative
procurement cycle in charts A6.3 and A6.4 have been provided to the implementing agencies as an
indication of when the preparatory activities need to be initiated to realize the physical targets. This
should assist each implementing Bureau/agency to plan ahead in a coordinated fashion to assure that
when new schools are completed they will be furnished and equipped, and books and teachers will be
available with a minimum time lag. Detailed procurement schedules by Region and the Center based
on this guideline are provided in the ESDP plan of each Region and the Center.
8.     Harmonization of Donors Procurement Procedures
ESDP has attracted the interest of a large number of donors, a number of which are actively
supporting the education sector in Ethiopia. Other donors may join the ESDP as they approach a new
bilateral assistance cycle. It is expected that some of the donors would agree to having common
thresholds for procurement and limits for prior or post review of the process. Donors may also agree
to the use of common standard documents and procedures for advertising, evaluating, and awarding
contracts. A study on harmonization of donors procedures for monitoring and evaluation is under way.
9.     Priority Actions for ESDP Procurement
The following actions will be taken by the EA at center and regional levels prior to Program
implementation:
a.     Each Region should have a complete set of standard NCB bid documents, specifications and
draft contracts. For ICB, use of Bank SBDs for the procurement of works, goods and consultants will
be mandatory (See table A6.2, below).
