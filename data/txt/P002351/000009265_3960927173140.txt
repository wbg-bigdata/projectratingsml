EM$ORANDUM AND RECOMMNEUDTION OF TEB PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO SENEGAL
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL ?SEARCN PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Senegal for SDR 14 million (US$ 18.5 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a second
agricultural research project. The project represents 562 of the total
research program in the next five years, to which France, USAID and Canada
will also be-major contributors.
2.        BackRround.  Agriculture in Senegal accounts for only 20X of GDP
and 20S of exports but is still the main or only source of livelihood for
70? of the people. Agriculture grew at only 1? per year between 1960 and
1988, but with considerable inter-annual fluctuations due to rainfall
variability. While improved performance in agriculture will not be
critical for future growth, it will be crucial for employment and income
for a majority of the population for a long time to come. Starting in
1985, under SALs II and III, real farm prices were brought up to or even
above border parities, most input subsidies were eliminated and input
distribution has been largely privatized. The priority needs for further
policy reform are to seek economies in crop collection, preccssing and
marketing, and greater flexibility in setting producer prices for
groundnuts, cotton and rice; actions in there directions will constitute
the key features of the Agricultural Sector Loan that is under preparation.
Heantime, public investment planning is being improved, and annual reviews
have led to improved design and a significant switch from irrigation to
rainfed farming. Area development projects are being phased out in favor
of national programs in support services and environmental management. The
proposed project has been prepared by ISRA and is a part of ISRA's Five
Year Research Program.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral
part of IDA's sector development strategy and is in full agreement with the
Government's priorities for sectoral development. The first agricultural
research project (Cr. 1176-SE) considerably expanded the regional coverage
of the research service, comprehensively re-equipped the research stations
and their laboratories, quadrupled the number of Senegalese research
scientietq (from 30 to 110) in six years, and initiated farming systems
research work. The second project would build on the strong
infrastructural and human resources base now in place, with emphasis on
research programs expected to yield results in the short term.
4.        Proiect Objectives.  The broad objec:ive of the project is to
generate adequate lower risk technology for improving farmers' and herders'
incomes in a sustainable manner. The specific objectives are to undertake



priority research programs in the Research Institute's (ISRA) Five-year
Research Program, to continue to improve ISRA's programming and budgeting,
and personnel and financial management, and to get the researchers out of
their stations and into farmers' fields.
5.        Proiect Description.  The project, to be implemented over five
years, would focus on: (a) adaptive research involving the testing, within
the farming environment, of the technologies developed during the first
project; (b) applied research targeted at major technical problems in the
priority agricultural zones; (c) development of an applied research program
of natural resources management; (d) strengthening of the linkages between
research, extension, development agencies and the farming community; (e)
strengthening of administrative and financial management of ISRA; (f)
providing of financial support for ISRA's research support services and for
establishment of a commercial production company to manage revenue-earnirg
activities; and (g) establishing an unallocated Research Reserve Fund to
enable :irgent research work identified at the yearly research reviews to be
financed without delay. The project provides funds for civil works
including central headquarters of ISRA in Dakar, vehicles, equipment, local
training, Technical Assistance to ISRA's administration and financial
management (two years residence plus short term missions) and incremental
operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 38.9
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$ 10.5 million
(27Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Senegal are
given in Schedule C and D respectively.  A map (IBRD 21318) and the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7675-SE dated February 1, 1990 is attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (a) as conditions of effectiveness: (i) signature and promulgation
of ISRA's Organizational Decree; (ii) employment by ISRA of a Secretary
General acceptable to the Association; and (iii) employment by ISRA of a
Management Controller and a financial analyst/accountant for an initial
period of two years; (b) as dated covenants: (i) ISRA would prepare for
review and approval by IDA a proposal and action plan for the establishment
of an independent company to manage its revenue earning activities by
January 1, 1991; (ii) National and regional research Technical Committees
would be set up by April 30, 1990; and (c) as yearly disbursement
conditions: ISRA would submit to the Association for comment and approval
by end of October 31 each year a detailed work plan, budget and financing
plan for the next fiscal year.
7.        Benefits.  The closer integration of research on crops,
livestock and forestry will contribute to the development of sustainable
farming systems that will assist with the restoration and conservation of
soil fertility and so with crop productivity. An increased emphasis on
adaptive research, with the extension service and the farming community
participating in the research process, will assist with the adaption of
technical advances made during the first project to the needs of the
farming community. This will be further strengthened through the close
coordination of this project with that proposed for agricultur&a extension.



Both the long-term needs of the environment and the most immediate
technical problems of farmers will thus receive high priority and
compartmentalized scientific research will be diminished.
8.        Risks.  Possible risks include a program segmentation because of
a multiplicity of cofinanciers of research, slowness of ISRA's management
in achieving the shift in emphasis from the thematic research to multi-
disciplinary problem oriented research, and ineffective feed-back from the
production systems research teams and from the extension services.  The
major general risk is, as was the case for the first project, that the need
to solve immediate specific problems will prevent management from
concentrating sufficient supervision and resources to the more conceptual
necessity of a reorientation of the research program. The annual reviews
of the on-going and planned research would address these risks.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
