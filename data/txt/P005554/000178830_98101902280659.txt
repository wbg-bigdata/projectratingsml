INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Bank
loan of $20.0 million equivalent to the Syrian Arab Republic to help finance
an education project. The loan would have a term of 20 1/ years including
3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 2/
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects for
Syria" (no. 806-SYR, dated October 31, 1975) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on November 12, 1975. This section is based on the findings of an
economic mission which visited Syria in November 1976 in preparation for a
Basic Economic Mission. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since attaining independence in 1946, Syria has had several changes
in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of landowners,
traders, and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians, and
civil servants, as well as a shift of the economy from an essentially laissez-
faire system to a largely publicly-owned and centrally regulated one. The
Ba'ath Socialist Party, the ruling party since 1963, provided substantial
continuity of emphasis on economic and social development policies which have,
by and large, prevailed in spite of internal Government changes and tensions
within the Middle East. During the 1960s an agrarian reform was carried out,
with redistribution of land to a large number of formerly landless peasants;
also large segments of the industrial, finance and trade sectors were national-
ized. In November 1970 General Assad became President of the Republic; his
regime has been characterized by a balance of firmness and conciliation in
domestic policies, economic pragmatism, a concerted search for a better
defined role for the private sector in a centrally regulated economy, as well
as diversification of foreign economic relations. These aims have been
pursued gradually and, in spite of continued political uncertainty in the
Middle East, substantial reorientation of economic policies and diversifica-
tion of production have been achieved.
1/   The loan was extended by 3 years over the Bank guidelines on grace periods
and final maturities on project grounds. This would be compensated by a
reduction in the amortization and/or grace period of one or more loans to
Syria during FY78.
2/   This part is identical to paragraphs 2-12 of the President's Report No.
P-2024 on a Loan to the Syrian Arab Republic for the Aleppo Water Supply
Project, dated June 1, 1977.

4.        The Government's attention to economic and financial matters has led
to a sustained on-going effort in conceptualizing objectives, identifying con-
straints, and formulating alternative strategies. As a result, an increasingly
pragmatic assessment of economic policies is taking place within the Government
(and the ruling Ba'ath Party). A new cabinet was formed in August 1976. One
of its key tasks is to implement new economic policy directives, to strengthen
economic management, and to tighten controls over investment decisions in the
public sector. The new Prime Minister, General Khleifawi, a former head of
the Economic Committee of the Ba'ath Party, and Prime Minister in the first
cabinet formed after President Assad's accession to power, defined shortly
after the change in cabinet the new principles which henceforth are to guide
Syrian economic policies. The Prime Minister's program, while re-affirming
the Ba'ath Party's commitment to general socialist principles and the dominant
role to be played by the public sector, called for improvements in management
of the public sector and attempted to define a role for the private sector
(including the specification of activities open to private investment, exclu-
sively or jointly with the public sector, and the provision of the necessary
safeguards and incentives to stimulate private investment). The program also
calls for the formulation of a wages and price policy, review of the economic
planning system, transformation of the existing Industrial Bank into a genuine
industrial development finance institution, and changes in interest rate
policies to promote greater consistency with interest rates charged in neigh-
bouring countries and to stimulate domestic savings.
5.        The 1973 petroleum price increase, which boosted Syria's own petro-
leum export earnings, and the sharp rise in Arab grants following the October
1974 Rabat agreement, augmented financial resource availability in the short
run, leading to revisions of the Third Plan (1971-75) and sharp increases in
public investments. However, adverse financial developments, rooted in the
high investment rates of 1974-75 and external developments, including the
discontinuation of oil transit by Iraq, a decline in Arab aid and the impact
of the Lebanese civil war, put unexpected financial constraints on investment
and growth, and delayed the finalization of the Fourth (1976-80) Plan to early
1977. For 1976-80, the Plan calls for: real growth of 12 percent yearly in
GDP, a target specified by the Ba'ath Party; increases in real terms of 7 per-
cent per annum in exports; and a domestic savings/GDP ratio of about 23 per-
cent. With the constraints on resource availability that have emerged, the
Government has limited its investment program mainly to ongoing projects, and
a further revision of the Plan is underway with a view to scaling it down
substantially.
6.        The strategy underlying the Fourth Plan places particular emphasis
on industrialization, with investment in agriculture remaining substantial.
The industrial development strategy stresses import-substitution in consumer
goods, and a substantial expansion of resource-based industries, such as
cotton textiles, cement and fertilizers. Significant exports of manufactured
goods by 1980 -- particularly textiles and fertilizers -- is a primary objec-
tive of the Government's investment program in the manufacturing sector. In
agriculture, the Government's overall objectives are the same as those in the
previous Plan: self-sufficiency in major domestic food needs, meeting the raw
material requirements of industry, and provision of a production surplus for



- 3 -
export. Rational land and water use, the stabilization of annual fluctuations
in output and the improvement in consumer diets through an increase in protein
supply are further objectives. The strategy to achieve these objectives
includes expansion of irrigated agriculture, intensification of crop produc-
tion and achievement of a better balance and complementarity between crop and
livestock production.
7.        Economic growth during 1971-75 is estimated at close to the 8 per-
cent target level, and growth in 1976 was also around 8 percent. Public
investment during 1971-75 reached about 70 percent of the original Plan
target, with about 55 percent of the total outlays being made in the last
two years of the Plan period, largely as a result of greater availability of
financial resources. The elasticity of savings with respect to GDP fell to
1.0, compared to a target of 1.8, reflecting a shortfall in the public savings
effort, particularly in recent years. A substantial number of manufacturing
projects, including those in fertilizers and steel rolling, came on stream
during the Plan period, thus diversifying the structure of industrial output.
Particularly heavy expenditures were made in industry, energy and fuel in
1974 and 1975, as a large number of projects were commenced. Investments
in irrigation and-agriculture appear to have remained stagnant in real terms
during the Plan period and fell substantially short of the target and the
Plan's overall achievement rate. Nonetheless, the Euphrates basin investments
were substantial and are expected to lead to higher growth and stability in
the production of the agricultural sector in the future. Progress in the
fields of transport and communications kept pace with the overall implementa-
tion rate of the Plan. Investments in social services reached a high propor-
tion of planned allocations, although substantial needs remain in education,
health and urban services.
8.        Increasingly aware of the needs to improve the economy's performance,
the Government has begun to take measures to relieve constraints on the coun-
try's development. Following the years of financial ease (up to early 1976),
fiscal performance needs to be improved, if development is to proceed without
interruption and without entailing potentially serious inflationary and public
debt management problems. This will require greater resource mobilization and
tighter control of expenditures. Efforts are underway in the Ministry of
Finance to reform the tax system and to improve the Ministry's budgetary and
control functions. In addition, consideration needs to be given to increasing
the efficiency of the economic enterprises and their contribution to the bud-
get through improved management, including introduction of sound accounting
practices (for which a law was passed in 1974) and control, as well as im-
proved efficiency in production. The State Planning Commission is presently
studying capacity utilization in agriculture, industry and transport with
a view towards finding means of increasing growth through improved utilization
of existing capacity rather than new investments. With a large number of
projects (particularly in industry), expected to come on-stream over the next
few years, the scope of raising output to optimum use of capacity appear quite
substantial. The Government has also sought UNDP assistance in planning.
While these efforts are expected to have only a small impact during the Fourth
Five Year Plan, they are likely to yield considerable fruits in the long run.



- 4 -
9.        The shortage of skilled manpower may cause bottlenecks in project
implementation. The uneven spatial distribution of employment is also likely
to pose problems as a large proportion of public investment in agriculture and
industry is to take place in the Northeast, where the population density is
much lower than in the Western Coastal belt. Measures will be required to
attract population and to provide sufficient skilled manpower to the Northeast
region. The overall manpower situation and the difficulties currently en-
countered in fostering an efficient public administration and public economic
sector are exacerbated by emigration of trained technicians and skilled
labour abroad and the outflow of trained manpower from the public sector to
the private sector as a result of wide wage differentials. To alleviate
the shortages the Government will provide extensive training facilities for
augmenting the supply of skilled manpower. It may however have to revamp
the structure of incentives so as to enable the public sector to attract and
retain an efficient cadre of administrators, technicians and other skilled
workers. While the Government is fully committed to increasing productive
employment opportunities, there is an urgent need to formulate a coherent
employment strategy consistent with the Fourth Plan investment strategy.
10.       Syria's economic prospects depend heavily on the availability of
financial resources and also on absorptive capacity in the various sectors.
Tentative Bank projections indicate that considering these constraints, an
investment program totalling around SL 35 billion in constant 1975 prices is
likely to be achieved during the 1976-80 period. At this level, investment
would be consonant with the Government's concern for improving the quality of
investments. It would generate real GDP growth around 7 percent yearly during
the period, which is somewhat below the recent growth record (8 percent). The
sources of growth in the late 1970's are likely to be the manufacturing and
construction sectors, with agricultural production stabilized at higher levels,
rather than mining and commerce which were the leading growth sectors during
the Third Plan.
11.       On Bank assumptions, the requirements of a growing aggregate demand
would entail an increase in the current account deficit from $580 million in
1976 to $1,220 million in 1980. The Government is expected to implement
strong measures to improve domestic resource mobilization, following the
studies currently underway, so as to close the savings-investment gap, and
thereby the resource gap; and a turnaround in the increasing deficit position
may be expected in the late 1980's. Assuming current transfers to increase
in 1977-78 and decrease thereafter, gross external borrowing requirements over
the Fourth Plan period are estimated to be $4.0 billion. Syria can probably
mobilize most of this from official sources and obtain the remainder from
commercial sources.
12.       At the end of 1976, external public debt outstanding and disbursed,
excluding military debt, was estimated to be around $970 million (14 percent
of GDP) of which 80 percent was held by Governments (28 percent, OPEC; and 47
percent, centrally planned economies), and 4 percent by multilateral organi-
zations (exclusively the World Bank Group). Debt service payments in 1976
amounted to only 10.6 percent of exports (including NFS). With assumed new



- 5 -
borrowing, debt and debt service would rise significantly. By 1980, Bank
projections indicate that debt could reach 30 percent of GDP while debt serv-
ice would be around 16 percent of exports. Beyond 1980, the effect of poli-
cies emphasizing exports (para. 6) would stabilize the relative burden of
debt service at a manageable level of around 20 percent of exports. Syria is
therefore creditworthy for continued Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA 1/
13.       Syria has to date received four IDA credits totalling US$47.3
million and eight loans totalling US$249.1 million (including one loan of
US$12.5 million on Third Window terms), net of cancellations. In addition,
the Executive Directors in June 1977 approved a US$50.0 million loan to Syria
for the Aleppo Water Supply Project. Although Syria is a member of the
Corporation, IFC has made no investments. At the end of 1976 the Bank Group
accounted for 4 percent of Syria's total outstanding public debt; by 1980 it
is expected to account for 10 percent of total outstanding public debt and 7
percent of public debt service obligations. Annex II contains a summary
statement of IDA credits and Bank loans as of April 30, 1977.
14.       Project implementation has generally suffered substantial delays
due largely to circumstances beyond Syria's control. The 1973 hostilities
brought works to a standstill and diverted the country's resources first
to military, then to reconstruction tasks; the unsettled conditions in the
region and weaknesses in the administrative system caused project implementa-
tion to be slow. The above developments were compounded by the high rate of
world inflation and generated considerable cost overruns in most projects.
As a result the composition of the Damascus Water Supply and Mehardeh Power
Projects had to be revised and additional financing secured. In the case
of the Balikh Project, the Government obtained a $50 million loan from the
Government of Iran and has undertaken to provide the Bank with a new finan-
cing plan for the project. In the case of the Second Highway Project, the
Government obtained a $45.9 million loan from USAID to finance one of the
components originally included in the project and has decided to upgrade the
project roads to four lane standards. Recent progress in project implemen-
tation has been encouraging; contracting and construction is well underway for
most projects although the Damascus Water Supply Projects will require close
coordination of the works financed by different donors.
15.       Lending for infrastructure accounted for over two-thirds of Bank
Group lending to Syria thus far. It aimed at fostering well designed sector
policies and strengthening various public institutions in charge of power,
water supply, highways and telecommunications. The objective of lending for
1/   This is part is substantially the same as paragraphs 13-18 of the
President's Report No. P-2024 on a Loan to the Syrian Arab Republic
for the Aleppo Water Supply Project, dated June 1, 1977.



- 6 -
irrigation development (Balikh Project) was to help increase and stabilize
agricultural production and farmers' incomes which are subject to wide fluc-
tuations under rainfed conditions. The livestock development project for
which a loan was approved earlier in FY77 provides for fundamental improve-
ments in feed and flock management policy as well as credit to sheep farmers,
most of whom are among Syria's poor nomadic population, with an aim to in-
creasing and stabilizing incomes in the sheep subsector throughout Syria.
Due to delays in selecting and appointing consultants, this loan has not yet
become effective.
16.       A diversification of lending operations in Syria is envisaged
through a gradual shift of emphasis away from long gestation infrastructure
projects, except where they are of utmost social priority (e.g., education and
the provision of basic urban services, such as water supply), toward quicker
yielding projects in the directly productive (agricultural and industrial)
sectors. This would be in support of the Government's Fourth Five-Year Plan
(1976-80) strategy of developing the country's productive capacity and im-
proving its social and physical infrastructure. However, project preparation
according to Bank standards remains a serious constraint in these sectors.
17.       The Aleppo Water Supply Project (see para. 13 above) provides for an
expansion of Aleppo's water supply system as well as sewerage studies for the
cities of Aleppo and Lattakia, and technical assistance for Syria's construc-
tion industry. A tourism project, providing for hotel training and technical
assistance to the sector, and a rural electrification project, which would be
part of the Government's rural electrification program covering all of Syria,
have been appraised. Preparation has also begun for a third highway project,
which would include the construction and/or upgrading of high priority road
sections; for an irrigation/drainage project, providing for the rehabilitation
of salt-affected lands in the lower Euphrates area; and for agro-industry
(cotton seed processing), industry (rehabilitation of textile plants), rainfed
agriculture (integrated development in the northeastern region), and sewerage
facilities (for Damascus, Hama, Homs).
18.       The lending activities described above would help to improve project
preparation and implementation, especially in those sectors in which the Bank
has not been previously involved, and strengthen sector policies and institu-
tions. The proposed operations will include significant technical assistance
and training components to achieve the above objectives.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
19.       The formal education system in Syria comprises six years of com-
pulsory primary education (grades 1-6), three years of lower secondary educa-
tion (grades 7-9), three years of upper secondary education (grades 10-12),
divided into general secondary which prepares students for higher education,
and technical secondary leading to direct employment or technician training;
and two to six years of post-secondary and higher education. Teacher train-
ing colleges offer four and two year programs (grades 10-13 and 13-14 respec-
tively). Technicians are trained at the post-secondary level in two year



- 7 -
technical institutes. Degree courses are offered in a higher technical in-
stitute with a four-year program, and universities with four to six-year pro-
grams. The Ministries of Education and Higher Education are primarily respon-
sible for education in Syria, although a number of other ministries are in-
volved with technical and vocational training. While the central authorities
define policy guidelines and major programs, the administration of primary and
general secondary education devolves upon the regional authorities. Education
in public schools is free at all levels; in 1974/75 the public sector accounted
for 94 percent of total enrollments at the primary and secondary level; of the
balance, 2 percent was in UNRWA schools serving Palestinian refugees, and 4
percent in private schools.
20.       Enrollments at all levels have grown significantly over the past
decade mainly as a result of social demand as well as in response to the
country's need for a better educated workforce. Since 1969/70, gross enroll-
ments have increased by 43 percent, 52 percent and 65 percent respectively
at the primary, lower secondary and upper secondary levels, and they now
represent 89.4 percent, 55 percent and 32 percent of the respective age-
groups. Enrollments in universities had been relatively static in the five
years to 1969/70 but increased by 66 percent in the next five years following
a decree opening the universities to all general secondary baccalaureate
holders. Enrollment at the higher education level now represents 12 percent
of the age-group involved.
21.       This expansion has been achieved with relative modest expenditure
for education averaging about 4 percent of GDP annually over the past five
years. While the quantitative improvement of education has been impressive,
serious deficiencies in the quality of education as well as problems of equity
remain. The rapid expansion of enrollments has not been matched by the dev-
elopment of adequate physical infrastructure. The majority of school build-
ings are unsuitable for modern teaching purposes -- over 40 percent were
not built as schools and nearly 30 percent are rented -- and in many cases,
are overcrowded. Laboratories, workshops and libraries are almost non-
existent. Mainly as a result of inadequate teacher training facilities and
the lack of equipment for modern teaching purposes, standards of teaching are
generally low, and teachers are forced to resort to passive teaching methods
which do not provide for sufficient practical and experimental activities.
In 1974/75, about 28 percent of the primary teaching force were unqualified
temporary replacements (as much as 47 percent in the poorest regions) and only
17 percent of the permanent secondary teachers had pedagogical training.
22.       Finally, while curricula at the primary and secondary levels include
provisions for practical activities, teaching tends to be theoretical. Most
upper secondary schools are exclusively oriented towards university entrance,
which is open to all graduates from general secondary schools. Undue pressures
are thereby created on the universities which are seriously constrained by a
shortage of teachers, facilities and equipment. Moreover, the rapid expansion
of university enrollment has taken place with insufficient regard for the
country's high-level manpower needs.

23.       The Government is aware of these problems and its strategy for
educational development, as reflected in the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1976-80),
aims at redressing the existing deficiencies and imbalances. Specifically,
the Government's objectives include:
(i) Generalizing basic education. An immediate target is to
enroll all 6 year old boys by 1980 and all 6 year old girls
by 1990, and the ultimate target to provide a basic nine year
education for all. The Government also intends to intensify
and expand the adult literacy campaign with a view to eliminat-
ing adult illiteracy, which is about 47 percent at present, at
the earliest possible time;
(ii) improving the quality of education, through provision of more
school facilities; improvements to teacher training, includ-
ing the establishment of additional teacher training colleges,
and strengthening of inservice and pedagogical training; expan-
sion of educational TV to all regions of the country; and the
establishment of an educational materials production center;
(iii) reorientating education, through strengthening and extending
practical subjects at the primary and lower secondary levels
and a redirection towards technical education and training at
the upper secondary level;
(iv) meeting manpower training needs, by expanding and improving
skilled and semi-skilled worker training in the secondary
technical schools and the Ministry of Industry's vocational
training centers, and by expanding and improving technician
training in Intermediate Technical Institutes under the
Ministry of Education.
24.       The Government's strategy for the expansion of education and train-
ing facilities is sound; the proposals for this expansion generally respond to
economic development needs and it is expected that the educational objectives
can be largely fulfilled. Under the assumptions of a growth in GDP of about
7 to 8 percent per annum and constant real salaries for teachers, expenditures
for education would account for a reasonable 13 percent of the national budget
and 5 percent of GDP by 1985. Technical education, which hitherto received
insufficient attention, would receive an increased share of total budget allo-
cation at the expense of general education. However, while the necessary
priority will be given to technician and skilled worker training, there is
an urgent need to coordinate and rationalize the activities of the various
Ministries involved in order to avoid a fragmentation and wasteful duplica-
tion of training provisions and to ensure a standardization of qualifications.
At the higher education level there is a need to stabilize undergraduate
enrollments in faculties that have small promise for employment of their
graduates (e.g. arts). Measures to be taken for this purpose would help to
avoid the allocation of an undue proportion of the educational budget to
higher education.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
25.       A Bank mission visited Syria in October/November 1975 to investigate
the needs of the education and training system and to identify project com-
ponents suitable for Bank financing. Following a discussion with the Govern-
ment in June 1976 of the recommendations made in a reconnaissance-in-depth
mission report, a Bank mission in June/July 1976 assisted the Government in
project preparation. The project was appraised by a Bank mission in November
1976. Negotiations were held on May 2-5, 1977 in Washington, D.C.; H.E. Dr.
Sabah Kabbani, Ambassador of the Syrian Arab Republic in the US, led the Gov-
ernment delegation.
Objectives and Description
26.       The proposed project would have the following main objectives:
(i) to improve the quality and relevance of education through
support of curricula reforms and the provision of new teacher
training facilities;
(ii) to help meet manpower needs through training of semi-skilled
and skilled workers and technicians; and
(iii) to strengthen sector institutions through support for the
establishment of a national entity for the planning, coordi-
nation and rationalization of vocational and technical train-
ing activities.
27.       The project would comprise:   (a) the construction, equipping and
furnishing of the following institutions, which would be carried out by the
Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Industry (MOI); and (b)
related technical assistance:

28.       The project includes a total of about 6 man-years of specialist
services for the preparation of curricula, craft programs and equipment
lists, as well as to assist in setting up a national coordinating entity
for vocational training and technical education; the project also provides
for about 33 man-years of fellowships for syllabi preparation and teacher
training.
Project Institutions
General Education
29.       Primary Teacher Training Colleges (MOE).   The proposed five col-
leges, to be located in Al-Rakka, Al-Hasakeh, Dara'a, Lattakia and Tartous,
would replace existing substandard places and add new places to provide an
annual output of 1,000 teachers, or about 25 percent of the country's esti-
mated total annual requirements. Not less than half of the trainees at each
location would be women. The colleges would have two-year post-secondary or
four years post-lower secondary programs, depending on the available output
of secondary graduates in the various regions. Trainees would generally be
enrolled from within each region, with the objective of having teachers take
up teaching posts in their own regions and thus assist in resolving current
problems in assignment of qualified teachers to the country's poorer regions.
Since these regions are mainly rural with low population densities, boarding
places would be provided as required. Curricula have been revised to take
account of the more practical orientation proposed for primary schools and to
provide for greater emphasis on pedagogical training. Two craft experts (6
man/months) would develop detailed craft programs and finalize the correspond-
ing equipment lists for the primary teacher training colleges and the inter-
mediate teacher training institute (see paragraph 30 below). Teachers for the
handcraft subjects will be recruited from those who have been trained abroad
or who have graduated from the Intermediate Teacher Training Institute.



- 11 -
30.       Intermediate Teacher Training Institute (MOE).   Apart from an In-
stitute of Physical Education, only one Intermediate Institute exists for the
training of lower secondary teachers; this institute currently trains teachers
of handcraft and music in inadequate facilities,which are also used for other
purposes. The proposed new institute in Damascus would provide 120 places for
teachers of handcraft, 200 places for teachers of industrial crafts, related
to the introduction of this subject into lower secondary schools, and 120
places for teachers of music. The annual output of 90 industrial craft
teachers would meet about 45% of anticipated needs. Training would extend
over two years post-secondary; entry to handcraft and industrial craft train-
ing would be confined to secondary technical graduates. Instructors for the
institute will be trained in the Intermediate Technical Institutes of the
Ministry of Education.
31.       In addition to expanding and improving teacher training, the Govern-
ment's plans to improve the quality of general education include, inter alia,
the establishment of an educational materials production center for the purpose
of designing, testing and producing simple science and hand craft equipment and
materials for use in primary and secondary schools. A pre-investment study for
the establishment of such center would be completed no later than December 31,
1978, (Section 4.04 of Loan Agreement). Also, with a view to improving school
location planning and maximizing investment benefits from its school building
program, the Government plans to develop procedures for school mapping and to
carry out not later than December 31, 1978, school mapping on a selected basis
for primary and secondary schools (Section 4.04 of Loan Agreement).
Vocational and Technical Education
32.       Intermediate Technical Institutes (MOE).   The proposed three new
intermediate technical institutes would expand and reinforce the system of
instructor and technician training. They would provide two-year post-secondary
training and have a combined annual output of 220 instructors, of which about
200 would be required for the technical secondary schools and vocational train-
ing centers and the balance for other skill training areas, and 440 engineering
technicians. Five specialists (15 man/months) would finalize equipment lists
and curricula for new specializations of the institutes. Fellowships would be
provided in syllabi preparation (18 man/months) and teacher training for the
new specializations (32 man-years). The proposed locations of the institutes
at Deir-ez-Zor, Lattakia and Homs would improve regional distribution of oppor-
tunities for post-secondary education for graduates of technical secondary
schools and serve the development needs of these three regions. Arrangements
for liaison with potential employers and a tracer system to monitor the place-
ment and performance of the graduates of the institutes would be implemented
as soon as the institutes are available for use (Section 3.07 of Loan Agree-
ment). These arrangements, which would include the establishment of local
advisory committees to ensure adequate liaison with potential users in a con-
tinuous review of training programs, would be determined by the proposed
coordinating entity for vocational training and technical education (see para.
34 below). This entity would also be responsible for the establishment of the
tracer system.



- 12 -
33.       Vocational Training Centers (MOI).   The proposed vocational training
centers at Deir-ez-Zor and Homs would help provide opportunities for vocational
training in regions so far not serviced by such facilities, help meet the
needs for skilled workers in these regions, and initiate integrated training
for both the industrial and construction trades. Enrollment capacity at Homs
would be 1,070 and at Deir-ez-Zor would be 630, with an output of 1,000 and
600 trained personnel respectively. The training program would include 6-9
months accelerated training of semi-skilled workers and two-year apprentice-
ship, of which one year at the center and another year of practical training.
The need for instructors will be met initially through short in-service
courses for skilled craftsmen recruited as instructors and also from the
graduate instructors of the two existing Intermediate Technical Institutes
of the Ministry of Education. As the vocational training centers begin to
expand to full enrollment, the supply of instructors will be met from the
early output of the project Intermediate Technical Institutes. Adequate
arrangements exist to reflect user requirements in training programs since
the enterprises for which training is being provided, as well as the centers,
are administered by the MOI.
34.       Coordination of Vocational Training and Technical Education.    To
ensure the required coordination and rationalization of training activities
in the field of technician and skilled worker training, the Government would
establish a national coordinating entity, which would include representatives
of the employers and the main ministries and agencies concerned with training
activities, and would be responsible through a well-staffed Directorate for:
(i) formulating a comprehensive plan for vocational training and
technical education;
(ii) coordinating the establishment of training facilities and all
skilled workers and technician programs;
(iii) forecasting skill requirements in the context of national
development programs;
(iv) establishing skill training standards, trade testing and
certification; and
(v) establishing a follow-up system to trace placement and per-
formance of the graduates of all skill training institutions.
The Government would establish such entity, with a Directorate as its execu-
tive branch, by July 1, 1978 (Section 3.06 of Loan Agreement); until then the
overall coordination of training would be undertaken by the State Planning
Commission (SPC) in cooperation with a working group, composed of representa-
tives of SPC and representatives of the Ministries and agencies concerned with
technical and vocational training. SPC and the working group would also be
responsible for preparing the establishment of the entity. Four specialists
(54 man/months) would assist in setting up the entity and train counterparts
in the Directorate.

Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
35.       Total project cost would be $40.3 million, of which $20.5 million or
51 percent, would be in foreign exchange. Physical contingencies (9.6 percent
of base cost estimates) and price contingencies (26 percent of base cost esti-
mates plus physical contingencies) would amount to $11.2 million, or 28 per-
cent of total project costs. The Bank loan of $20.0 million would finance the
foreign exchange component (except for technical assistance and fellowships)
or 50 percent of the total cost of the project, net of duties and taxes. The
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has agreed to
finance the specialists for the Intermediate Technical Institutes (para 32
above). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the British Govern-
ment and the French Government are expected to finance the other technical
assistance component and fellowships. The balance of total project costs,
consisting of local costs, would be financed by the Government.
Project Implementation
36.       Except for the two vocational training centers to be administered
by the Ministry of Industry, all project items would be under the administra-
tion of the Ministry of Education. Implementation teams have been established
in both Ministries. The project is expected to be completed before the middle
of 1982.
37.       Schematic designs for the Ministries of Education's and Industry's
project institutions have been reviewed during appraisal and are satisfactory.
Sites for all project institutions have been selected and are adequate. These
sites would be legally acquired prior to commencement of construction (Section
3.05 of Loan Agreement).
Procurement
38.       Contracts for civil works (amounting to US$22.8 million including
contingencies) would be awarded, in accordance with Bank Guidelines, on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). Syria has a competitive
construction industry capable of implementing the project and it is expected
that all contracts would be awarded to Syrian firms. Detailed lists and
specifications of furniture and equipment would be presented to the Bank for
review and approval prior to procurement. Equipment and furniture items for
procurement would be grouped, to the extent possible, in large packages to
permit bulk procurement. Contracts for furniture and equipment (amounting to
US$16.2 million including contingencies) would be awarded in accordance with
Bank Guidelines on-the basis of international competitive bidding, except for
items which can only be grouped in small packages (under US$50,000), items
which must be compatible with other equipment procured under ICB and items of
such specialized nature that ICB would not be practical. These items, which
would not exceed an aggregate total of 20 percent of the total cost of each
Ministry's furniture and equipment items (or US$3.3 million for the total
project), would be procured under normal government procurement procedures,
which are satisfactory to the Bank, and would include to the extent feasible
quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers. In bid comparison,



- 14 -
local manufacturers of equipment and furniture, to be procured under ICB,
would be allowed a margin of preference equal to 15% of the C.I.F. price or
the existing rate of customs duties applicable to competing imports, whichever
is lower.
Disbursements
39.       The proposed loan of US$20.0 million would be disbursed on the basis
of the following percentages, which represent the estimated foreign exchange
content of each category of expenditure:
(i) 30 percent of total expenditure for civil works;
(ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported
furniture and equipment;
(iii) 25 percent of total expenditures for locally procured
furniture; and
(iv) 80 percent of total expenditures for locally procured
equipment.
The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in the Loan and Project Summary.
Disbursement is expected to be completed by the middle of 1982.
Benefits and Risks
40.       The proposed project would assist the Government in redressing
several of the existing deficiencies and imbalances in the educational system.
It would improve the quality and relevance of education and strengthen sector
institutions to respond better to the country's development needs. In addi-
tion to providing about 25 percent of the annual primary teachers requirements
and about half of the annual requirements for practical subject teachers and
technical/vocational instructors, the project would also help alleviate the
existing shortage of trained manpower, which hampers the country's development
efforts, by providing an annual output of some 2,000 technicians and skilled
workers, with special emphasis on new specializations required for the devel-
opment of Syrian industry. The project would reduce regional inequalities and
support the Government's regional development policies through the dissemina-
tion of training opportunities in rural areas, especially in the poorer regions.
41.       The risks of not fully attaining the overall objectives of the proj-
ect are limited since the loan conditions as well as the agreed arrangements
for project implementation are in line with the Government's intentions in
pursuing its goals in the educational sector. A continuing Government commit-
ment to and support for the integrated development of curricula, teacher
training and facilities for the proposed practical activities are essential
if the reorientation of curricula is to prove effective, and can be assumed
in view of the Government's educational strategy. Finally, the rationaliza-
tion of the training sector is largely dependent on the establishment of the
proposed national coordinating entity, which will require priority Government
attention.

Credit 298 - Second Highway Project; US$13.8 million Credit of April 17, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: February 2, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Project implementation started in 1975 after an initial delay due to
the unfavorable political situation in the region. In July 1975, after several
contracts had been awarded, the Government decided to upgrade the project
roads to four-lane standards, undertaking to cover the extra costs involved.
Economic studies, based on preliminary cost estimates, indicate the upgrading
to be economically justified. The Association will determine its position on
the upgraded roads after final cost estimates, based on detailed engineering,
become available. Government has called bids for the additional works on the
Homs-Tartous road and is presently negotiating addenda to the contracts with
the contractors for the construction of the Damascus-Lebanese border road.
Agreement for financing of construction of the Damascus-Jordanian border road
has been reached between the Government and USAID. This section will, there-
fore, be deleted from the project. The Government has requested that the
construction of the Damascus-Lebanese border road and Tall Kalakh section of
Homs Tartous road remain components of the project even if IDA participation
in financing would become low due to the higher standards and increased
costs.
Credit 401 - Damascus Water Supply Project; US$15 million Credit of June 22,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: February 20, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
Initial delays in project implementation of about two years were
caused by the unfavorable political situation in the region. A revision of
the project description was required as a result of considerable cost overruns
and was approved by the Board on May 28, 1975. This permitted work to proceed
on an urgent phase of distribution. Work is now proceeding in accordance with
the contract schedule with about 50 percent of the works completed to date. No
further delays are anticipated. Consultants have begun the pollution control
studies for Damascus, Homs and Hama.
Credit 469/Loan 975 - Balikh Irrigation Project; US$10 million Credit and
US$63 million Loan of April 10, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 12,
1974; Closing Date:   June 30, 1982
Following initial procurement difficulties, works by Syrian Govern-
ment organizations for the development of the first 10,000 ha are progressing
satisfactorily and construction of the Lower Main Canal headreach (18 km) is
underway. Bids for the second part of the project (11,000 ha) have been evalu-
ated but recommendations for award have not yet been received, pending a
review by the Higher Inter-ministerial Council. The Syrian Government has
obtained a loan from the Government of Iran to cover part of the considerable
cost overruns and has undertaken to provide a financing plan for the project
by the middle of 1977. The Government is presently reconsidering the scope
of the project. The question of settlement in the Balikh Project is also
being considered by Government. Feasibility studies for a drainage/irrigation
project for rehabilitation of salt-affected lands in the lower Euphrates area
are expected to be completed around the middle of 1977.

Loan 986 - Mehardeh Power Project; US$25 million Loan of May 23, 1974 and
Supplementary Loan of US$8.6 million of June 4, 1975; Dates of Effectivenes ;:
January 30, 1975 and January 19, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project consists of the first 150-MW unit of new steam-electric
power station at Mehardeh; eight 230-kV substations, consultant services and
training. The project is co-financed by a US$33 million loan from Kuwait
Fund, including a second portion of US$15 million to cover the considerable
cost overruns. Although main contracts were awarded about five months late and
a further delay of about two months was caused due to a temporary lack of
cement, physical progress is satisfactory and the final delay is expected to
be minimal. Institutional progress is expected to remain slow due to lack of
experienced personnel and the time required to train intermediate executive
staff.
Loan 1144 - Second Mehardeh Power Project; US$72 million Loan of July 18, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: January 19, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project comprises a second 150-MW steam generating unit at
Mehardeh, construction of six and extension of two 230-kV substations, a new
office building, organization and accounting studies and training. Construc-
tion of the power plant is progressing satisfactorily although a delay of
about two months occurred due to a temporary lack of cement; the final delay
is expected to be minimal. Construction of the new head office building has
been delayed by about one year because the Government is reconsidering its
size. Institutional progress is expected to remain slow due to lack of exper-
ienced personnel and the time required to train intermediate executive staff.
Loan 1241 - Second Damascus Water Supply Project; US$35 million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: January 31, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
This loan became effective on January 31, 1977. The project, which
is co-financed by the Arab Fund and USAID, provides for the supply components
of Damascus' water system and for training. Work is proceeding on schedule
on the contract for the tunnel, underground cutoff and supply reservoir, which
are financed by the Bank. A close coordination of the works financed by the
various donors under this project and of the works financed under the first
project will be required to permit the timely link-up of the various compo-
ents of the supply and distribution system and to minimize expected delays in
implementation of the project components financed by other donors.
Loan 1261 - Telecommunications Project, US$28 million Loan of June 9, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: March 15, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This loan became effective on March 15, 1977. The project consists
of the most urgent works of the telecommunications investment program for the
period 1976-78, including the installation of telephone connections, trunk

exchanges and teleprinters; and expansion of long distance and international
facilities; and a training center. Procurement is well underway on a number
of contracts.
Loans 1311/1312T - First Livestock Development Project; US$5 million Loan
and US$12.5 million Third Window Loan of July 22, 1976; Date of Effectiveness:
; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This loan has not yet become effective due to delays in the selec-
tion and appointment of consultants. The project provides for a strengthening
of the organizational framework for feed policies and animal health services
as well as credit to sheep farmers and cooperatives.
