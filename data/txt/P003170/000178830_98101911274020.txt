APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Sector and its Problems
1.        At Independence in 1964, Zambia had a very limited pool of trained
manpower and relied almost entirely on expatriates for the design and execu-
tion of development programs. The expansion of the education system was
therefore given top priority in Zambia's national development plans. From
1964 to 1974 primary school enrollments doubled and at the secondary and
higher levels they more than quadrupled. Although the supply of educated
manpower increased quantitatively, expatriates still predominate in certain
areas, e.g., nearly 70% of the managers of business concerns and 60% of person-
nel in specialized technical and professional occupations are expatriates.
2.        The general education system consists of seven years of primary
education (aged 7-13), five years of secondary education (aged 14-18) and
four to six years of university education. About 88% of the relevant age
group are enrolled in primary schools and 13% in secondary schools. Courses
in a variety of vocational subjects are offered to junior secondary school
leavers and a number of diploma courses to upper secondary school leavers.
The University of Zambia, established in 1966 has now a total enrollment of
over 2,500.
3.        The principal issues in education development can be summarized
as follows:
(a) Administration and Management. In general, in spite
of successful efforts to link technical and vocational
education with industry, the administration of education
is not well coordinated with that of other government
services either at the national or provincial levels.
In addition, the supporting educational services (e.g.,
curriculum development, education research and guidance,
etc.) suffer from poor integration and lack of unified
direction;
(b) Curricula and Teaching Methods. Although balanced
curricula have been developed for primary and secondary
education, their application is not wholly satisfactory
because of low teacher quality, high staff turnover and
inadequate supervision. The problem is particularly
acute in secondary education where about 68% of the
teachers are expatriates who have comparatively short
contracts.



- ii -
(c) External Productivity. The emphasize on capital-intensive
sectors in Zambia's development and relatively high wages
in the modern sector have constrained job creation. The
situation is further aggravated by a lack of preparedness
of school leavers for their subsequent careers.  As a
result, the tendency of employers t-o choose capital-inten-
sive technologies and to hire expatriates instead of
nationals is strengthened. While the expansion of junior
seconda,ry education has outgrown the absorptive capacity of
the modlern sector, the output at the higher levels is still
insufficient to meet the demand particularly in commer-
cial and agricultural occupations. More attention must,
therefore, be given to both the quantitative and qualita-
tive aspects of education at these levels, in order to
achieve closer integration between the manpower needs of
the economy, on the one hand, and the education/training
system, on the other.
4.        In order to develop solutions for these and other problems, the
Government undertook an overall review of the sector. The main conclusions
of the review are expected to be developed in early l977 and used for the
formulation of educational objectives and targets of the Third National
Development Plan (1977-1981). The review is being conducted within the
framework of the United National Independence Party's (UNIP) guidelines for
national education policies for the decade 1974-1984 whose main points are:
a) to restructure the system of education and provide for ten years of compul-
sory education; (lb) to improve and expand the programs of adult education; (c)
to develop a locally based examination system; and (d) to merge the functions
of the local and regional education councils with those of the local and
regional developmeant committees in order to develop an improved administration.
The review is also guided by President Kaunda's directive that every student
should develop positive attitudes towards productive work and should ren-
der national serv:ice before entering higher education. The results of the
review would be the basis of educational reforms, guided by the principle
that students must not be seen only as consumers of social services but
also as productive forces contributing to the economy.
5.        In accordance with the broad educational objectives outlined in
UNIP policy guidelines, the task of the review is to: (a) determine how
best to achieve these objectives within reasonable time limits and exist-
ing and projected resources and constraints; (b) develop a comprehensive
long-term educational development plan with quantitative and qualitative
specifications; and (c) prepare a phased program for its implementation.
Upon completion of the review, comprehensive projects are expected to be
developed with Bank assistance. Meanwhile, the Government has developed an
interim investment program to meet urgent and immediate priorities which will
not be affected by the findings of the review. This project is a major part
of the interim program.

6.        The Bank has had a major role in assisting education in Zambia.
Three Bank projects are providing improved facilities for some 70,000 stu-
dent places including 40,000 new places, mostly in secondary schools and
at the University of Zambia. The First Education Project (Loan 592-ZA),
after numerous initial delays and more recently delays attributed to civil
strife in adjacent countries, is now proceeding satisfactorily and is expected
to be completed in 1978. The Second Education Project (Loan 645-ZA) has
been satisfactorily completed as originally appraised. As a result of contri-
butions of equipment by bilateral sources, a saving of $1.0 million from the
loan proceeds resulted and the Closing Date has been extended to 1978 to
allow the use of these savings for project related items. The Third Educa-
tion Project (Loan 900-ZA) is proceeding satisfactorily.
7.        Since Independence, the Government has placed emphasis on quan-
titative expansion of the formal education system at all levels. The sys-
tem has now grown to such dimensions that it becomes necessary to con-
solidate and strengthen administrative and support services in order to
maintain high quality instruction. Future reforms would also need the
support of such services. Furthermore, the implementation of the govern-
ment policies to expand agricultural production and promote rural devel-
opment requires urgent improvements in farmer training and agricultural
extension efforts. Finally, the training for skills in business and com-
merce should be expanded to meet the acute shortage of Zambian manpower
in these fields. Therefore, the interim investment program is designed:
(a) to provide Zambia with an adequate administrative structure
to consolidate the educational services;
(b) to assist rural development by improving farmer
training and the extension service; and
(c) to increase the supply of trained staff in the business
and commercial sectors of the Zambian economy.
The Project
8.        The project was identified during a Bank economic mission which
visited Zambia in June 1975. A Government request for Bank assistance was
made in October 1975. Bank missions in November 1975 and March 1976
assisted the Government in preparing the project and appraised it. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington from November 15 to 19, 1976. The delegation
of the Government of Zambia was led by Mr. P.A. Siwo, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Education.
9.        The proposed project is designed to meet the objectives of the
interim investment program outlined above, consisting of: (a) improvement
of education administration, research and curriculum development through the
construction, furnishing and equipping of Phase II (para. 10) (Phase I is a
component of the Third Education Project) of the Educational Services Center
(b) expansion and improvement in business education through the provision of
additional boarding capacity and equipment for the Evelyn Hone College of
Applied Arts and Commerce and instructional equipment for commercial and



- iv -
secretarial courses at five Trades Training Institutes; (c) improvement in
the training of agricultural staff and farmers through provisions for and/or
or renovation of teaching and boarding facilities, utility services, staff
housing, instructional equipment and transport in eight existing Farm Insti-
tutes and 20 existing Farmer Training Centers; (d) technical assistance con-
sisting of 25 man-years of specialist services and 40 man-years of fellowships
for staff development at the Evelyn Hone College and 13 man-years of specialist
services and 8 man-years of fellowships in agricultural education and extension;
and (e) completion and evaluation studies. The project would also include
a survey of the construction industry.
Detailed Features
10.       Educational Services Center, Phase II.  The Ministry of Educa-
tion maintains a number of uncoordinated educational services facilities (e.g.
curriculum development, student services and several examination services
sections) which located all over Lusaka and in other provinces, generally
housed in temporary or sub-standard facilities.  Phase I of the Center is
be-ing carried out under the Third Education Project (Loan 900-ZA); it provides
for the first time a unified administration and includes a Curriculum Unit, an
Audio-Visual Center, the Correspondence Course Unit, the Zambia Library
Service, Orbit Magazine, Administrative Services and a Printing and Documenta-
tiDn unit. The proposed project would assist in Phase II and would add an
Examination Section including a Standards and Certification Division, a
Research, Evaluation and Guidance Section and an expansion of the Printing and
Documentation Unit. The Examination Section administers examinations for all
primary and secondary schools, Trades Training Institutes, Teacher Training
Institutes and post-secondary technical schools.
11.       Business Education.  The project would expand the supply of Zambian
business and accountancy manpower by: (a) increasing the boarding capacity of
the Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and Commerce by 250 places and
providing the college with required instructional equipment and furniture;
(b) assistance in the training of Zambian teachers for the college's business
and secretarial studies department; and (c) assisting in the establishing
of commerciai and secretarial courses in five Trades Training Institutes
through the provision of instructional equipment.
12.       This college campus has a capacity of 1,200 student places, of which
only 950 are filled due to limited boarding capacity (640 places) and the lack
of other housing facilities for students in Lusaka. The increase in boarding
piaces at the college campus would allow for an expansion in enrollments
in the business and accountancy studies departments. Since the teaching staff
of the Business Studies Department is still composed entirely of expatriates
the project would include a staff development scheme which is to be updated
in detaii by the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training
(Section 3.06). I/ Beneficiaries of the fellowship scheme would be required
to teach at least three years at the colleges.

v 
13.       Trades Training Institutes located in the eight provinces
have been successful in the basic training of certain skilled manpower
demanded by Zambian industry inside and outside big business centers. Five
institutes, located in areas of growing demand for secretarial manpower have
been chosen for the introduction of commercial courses. With the provisions of
the required instructional equipment, classes could start immediately. No
problems are anticipated in recruiting specialized teachers for these courses.
14.       Farm Institutes and Farmer Training Centers operated by the Department
of Agriculture, Ministry of Rural Development. Residential farmer training is
carried out 14 27 centers, each of the eight provinces having 3-4 centers
where short courses for farmers and farm women are offered and in eight Farm
Institutes, one in each province, where mainly in-service training for extention
staff is taking place. A recent study which was conducted under the Third
Education Project (Loan 900-ZA), revealed that while farmer training and
extension activities had some influence in improving agricultural production,
their overall impact has been minimal due to the following constraints: (a)
the instructors at the centers and institutes and the extension agents and
their assistants are inadequately trained; (b) the institutions do not have
transportation facilities necessary to bring in farmers and staff for train-
ing; (c) provisions for water and electricity are inadequate; and (d) some
teaching facilities are substandard and essential instructional equipment is
lacking. As a result of these constraints these institutes and centers have
operated at only about 54% of their capacity. The proposed project would
assist in upgrading the quality of the agriculture staff and farmer training
programs by providing the necessary facilities, equipment, thirteen man-years
of specialists services for an agricultural educator, an extension educator, a
rural home economics educator, an audio-visual and teaching aids specialist,
and eight man-years of fellowships for advanced training in agricultural and
home extension education and audio-visual and teaching aids. Three institutes
and seven centers are presently being upgraded under the Third Education
Project (Loan 900-ZA). The remaining twenty centers and five institutes are
expected to be improved under the proposed project. The three previously
assisted institutes would receive an audio-visual workshop and additional
equipment. These improvements would allow the centers to admit 13,400 addi-
tional farmers and farm women. The Government confirmed that: (a) the four
specialists would be appointed within nine months of the date the Loan Agreement
(Section 3.07); and (b) that with the help of the agricultural specialists, a
detailed plan satisfactory to the Bank, for the retraining of the teaching and
extension staff and the improvement of the instructional and extension programs
of the Department of Agriculture will be prepared and submitted to the Bank
within 18 months after the date of the Loan Agreement (Section 3.08).
15.       Special Studies - The proposed project would include assistance
to carry out the following studies:
(i) Survey of the construction industry.
The industry is now dominated by firms owned by
expatriates and little is being done to promote the
development of local Zambian contractors. Due to the
present uncertainties over whether the Government intends



- vi. -
to encourage or curtail private initiative, many con-
tractors are reluctant to undertake additional work;
this has inflated prices. Aware that such problems
exist, the Government has requested assistance to
undertake a survey which would give guidance on how to
promotes a viable industry. The survey would review the
industry as a whole, including the infrastructure.
The terms of reference of the survey have been pre-
pared by the Government and reviewed by the Bank.
The cost of the survey is estimated at US$250,000
equiva:Lent.
(ii) Complet:ion and Evaluation Studies. To facilitate the
evaluation of the proposed project after its completion,
funds would be provided under the proposed loan for
conducting evaluation studies of project components.
The completion and evaluation studies report would be
submitted to the Bank for review within three months
after completion of the project. The terms of reference
of these studies would be mutually agreed upon between
the Borrower and the Bank.
Proiect Cost and Financing
16.       The total project cost is estimated at $23.2 million equivalent
including taxes ($1.0 million equivalent) of which the foreign exchange
component is US$15.0 million, equivalent or 65%. The proposed loan would
cover $13.3 million of the foreign exchange costs, the balance of $1.7
million being provided by a grant from the Norwegian Agency for International
Development. The Government would provide most of the funds required ($7.8
miilion equivalent) to meet the local currency expenditures, the balance of
$0.4 million being provided by NORAD. Standardized building designs previously
developed by the Buildings Branch of the Ministry of Public Works and consultant
architects will be used where practicable and emphasis will be given t:o the
maximum use of local materials and simplified building technology. Base unit
costs of US$270 per square meter on average for construction for the
Farm Institutes and Farmer Training Centers is somewhat high due to, inter
alia, their remote locations and small size of work involved. This compares
with US$350 (October 1975) in Zaire and US$250 (September 1976) in Madagascar.

Implementation of the Project
18.       The projiect would be implemented in about six years after loan
effectiveness. Thes Project Unit established in the Buildings Branch oi- tie
Ministry of Public Works for the implementation of the Third Educatfo.  Froject
(Loan 900-ZA) would be responsible for the financial and administrativiN
control of the project, and for liaison with the Bank and various M.i_- iries
and agencies (Section 3.02(b)).  The Unit hitherto has functioned satsiffCtorily..
Because of increased workload it will be strengthened through the  ad i  of
a full-time assistant project director to be provided by the NoTweg a, Aqency
for International i)evelopment (NORAD).  Any new appointments to t   p         ons
of project director, assistant project director, architect, equipment E.peciallst
and the accountant would be made in consultation with the Bank,  Tl^e 'L-rower
will continue to maintain the unit and its staff (Section 3.02(b)).  I-.cluded
in the project would be supplemental operational expenses of the Pro ect Unit.
NORAD is to provide, on grant basis, technical assistance consisting of about
18 man-years of specialists services for the Project Unit and about  8 man-years
of services of building construction supervisors.
19.       Design and supervision of construction of all project instit-utions
would be carried out by consultant architects/engineers.  Standardized bufId-
ing designs and documents previously developed by the Buildings Branch of
the Ministry of Public Works and consultant architects would be ut-Ilized .-C`
the maximum extent practicable.  The consultants would be under t.e s-po-
sion of the Project Unit and would be employed within six months of- t-e C-ante
of the Loan Agreement (Section 3.02(a)).

Procurement
20.       Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines except as follows: (i) due to wide dispersion of the rural
construction sites, civil works contracts to cost less than US$250,000 equiv-
alent (estimated at US$4.5 million); (ii) furniture, equipment and vehicle
contracts to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent (estimated at US$0.3 million);
and (iii) locally procured transportation services for furniture and equipment
(estimated at US$o.1 million). Contracts for items (i) to (iii) are likely
to have a total value of US$4.9 million, equivalent and would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally and in accordance with
local procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Standardized sketch designs, draft
tender documents and master lists of furniture, equipment and vehicles,
indicating proposed grouping for tender, would be reviewed by the Bank. Items
would be grouped to the extent practicable to permit bulk procurement. Review
of tender evaluation documents by the Bank prior to award would be required
only for contracts above US$250,000 equivalent for civil works and above
US$50,000 equivalent for equipment, furniture and vehicles. Qualified domestic
manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preference of 15%
or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing foreign suppliers.
Disbursements
21.       Disbursement would be on the basis of: (a) 100% of foreign expendi-
tures for imported construction materials, furniture, equipment, including
vehicies and technical assistance; (b) 100% of ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured furniture and equipment; (c) 45% of total expenditures for civil
works; (d) 70% of total expenditures for imported goods purchased locally and
local transportation services; and (e) 35% of professional services, special
studies and project administration, All disbursements would be fully documented.
Disbursements for expenses under project administration would be made against
a certificate of expenditure and made available for inspection by the Bank
during project supervision. Annual auditing of expenditures incurred by the
Project Unit would be required (Section 4.02(c)).
Benefits, Justifications and Risks
22.       In quantitative terms there will be substantial benefits from
the proposed project. It will allow an increase in the supply of extremely
scarce middle and advanced level manpower (in particular accountants) in
business and commerce from 40 p.a. to 300 p.a., create the opportunity for
training of an additional 13,400 farmers and farm women p.a. in the Farmers
Training Centers and improve the in-service training capacity of the Farm
Institutes for agricultural and extension staff. In qualitative terms, the
project would for the first time permit the fuil coordination and administra-
tion of educational services which have come into existence since Independence,
and improved educational research, evaluation and guidance will bridge the
gaps between the school system and the labor market needs. The tailoring of
all school examinations to Zambian requirements will be made possible as well



-x -
as more efficient cooperation between curriculum development units and examina-
tion administration. A special feature of the project is technical assistance
and staff development for the Evelyn Hone College which will allow, over a
span of six years, to Zambianize a hitherto 100% expatriate Business Studies
Department faculty and will quintuple Zambian teaching resources in busJness
studies. Training of farmers would be greatly improved through better qualified
instructors and extension agents. The risks of the project relate basically
to the Farmer Train:Ing Centers, their program orientation and the attendance
of farmers. Therefore, the improvement in physical facilities is only one of
the inputs required to develop an effective system of farmer training. In
order to minimize the risks, the project includes technical assistance and
evaluation studies.
Aree,ments Reached and Recommendations
23.       Agreement was reached with the Government on the following prin-
ciple points:
(a) technical assistance, staff development, in-ser-
vice training of agricultural teaching and exten-
sion staff and evaluation studies (paras. 3.09,
3.14 and 3.17); and
(b)  employment of architectural/engineering consul-
tants, auditing procedures and project implemen-
tation arrangements (paras. 4.03, 4.11 and 4.17).
24.       Retroactive financing in the total amount of $100,000 equivalent is
recommended for expenditures incurred from December 1, 1976 for "a survey
of the construction industry and architectural and engineering services"
(paras, 3i17 and 4.11)6
25.       The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank lcan
of $13e,3 million equivalent to the Republic of Zambia on standard IBRD lean
terms,



I. DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS
Economic Development
1.01      Zambia is a landlocked country in the southern half of Africa.
Most of the country consists of a high plateau intersected by valleys of
the Zambesi River and its tributaries. With an area of 752,600 square kilo-
meters and a population of 4.9 million, the country is sparsely populated.
The people are of Bantu stock and there are seven major languages with
English serving as the "lingua franca" of the Nation. The per capita in-
come is about US$540 equivalent -- one of the highest in Africa south of the
Sahara. Zambia has large mineral reserves and wide areas of land suitable
for crops and livestock, and has the potential for sustained development.
However, over the past decade, overall growth has been disappointing; per
capita income, in real terms, has remained unchanged from 1965 to 1975. The
modern sector of the economy continues to be dominated by copper mining which
contributes about 40% of GDP and over 90% of the value of exports. Despite
levels of gross investment which have averaged 27% of GDP, output has grown
by only about 3.5% p.a. from 1970 to 1974 as a result of near stagnation in
the mining and agricultural sectors.
1.02      Manufacturing contributes 13% to GDP, 11% to employment and con-
tinues to grow rapidly, based mainly on import substitution for consumer
goods, but employment creation has been low (about 2% p.a. from 1970 to
1974) due to the use of capital intensive techniques. Despite large
mining investments in the past few years, it is expected that copper pro-
duction will expand at about 3% p.a. on average from 1975 to 1980. Agri-
culture contributes 12% to GDP and 9.5% to employment, and production has
expanded slowly (about 1.7% p.a. from 1970 to 1974) but is expected to im-
prove as an effective agricultural policy is developed and implemented.
1.03      Owing to the failure to contain growth of recurrent expenditures
and to maintain adequate foreign exchange reserves when copper prices were
high, the Government is Lacing financial difficulties. The Government has
tried to diversify its tax base away from mineral revenues by restructuring
personal income tax, introducing new sales and excise levies, and raising
most tax rates. However, recurrent expenditures have increased rapidly and
consequently government savings have been generally lower than in the past
decade (1964-1974). In real terms, government capital expenditures during
the first three years of the Second National Development Plan (SNDP) 1972-1976
averaged only 71% of the annual amounts envisaged in the Plan.
1.04      During 1975, low copper prices led to a drastic drop in Zambia's
foreign exchange earnings and low profits in the mining industry caused
reduced tax revenues, The closing of the Benguela railway through Angola due
to the civil war in that country and congestion in other Eastern African ports
serving Zambia, made the export of copper very difficult and force majeur
declarations had to be issued for a sizeable volume of contracted deliveries.
In addition, large transit stocks of copper were blocked in Angola and ship-
ments were delayed from other Eastern African ports. In the other direction,



vital imports did not reach the country timely or only after heavy losses, and
the price level for imported goods rose sharply. Most affected by reduced and
more expensive imnports were the construction and manufacturing industries. In
January 1976, the Government announced a series of austerity measures, :includ-
ing a reduction in recurrent and capital expenditures, increases in cus:-om
duties and sales, excise and income taxes and control over imports and foreign
exchange transactions.  In July 1976, the kwacha was devalued by 20%, an
important step towards restoring Zambia's international competitiveness
for industrial and agricultural products.
1.05      The recenL economic difficulties have heightened the Government's
awareness of the need for drastic changes in development strategy. The
President and the National Council of the United National Independence Party
(UNIP) announced in June 1975 that a return to the land and an increase of
agricultural production would be given top priority in order to contain the
high urbanization rate (paras. 1.08 - 1.09), to lessen dependency on food
imports and to reduce income differentials. Within this context, the Govern-
ment has announced a rural reconstruction program and is discussing with the
Bank specific measures to improve agricultural output in both short and
long-term planning. A Bank agricultural sector survey is recommending the
following: (a) an increased allocation of infrastructure investment and
provision of supporting services to rural growth centers; (b) a greater
allocation than in the past of skilled manpower to the planning and execution
of rural development projects and a regional decentralization of these func-
tions; and (c) an improved efficiency of the marketing organization.  The
recent Government decision to increase producers' prices for major agricul-
tural commodities indicates that appropriate action is being taken to stimul-
ate an increase in farm output and reduce income differentials. Farmers'
training will have to play an important role within the context of this
strategy.
1.06      At the same time, the Government plans to rationalize and improve
manufacturing and commerce in order to increase their contribution to out-
put and employment. A shift from capital intensive to labor intensive tech-
niques and a general improvement in management and organization of both
parastatal and private companies are needed to increase the competitiveness
of Zambia industry and reduce the high degree of subsidy and protection
presently afforded.  Improved training in business and accounting is required
to meet these objectives.
Implications for Education Policy
1.07      At IndeperLdence in 1964, Zambia had a comparatively small numner of
educated and trained local manpower.  During the 1960s the manufacturino  --d
mining sectors expanded rapidly and the gap between the demand for and tne
supply of educated manpower widened. Consequently, the country remained
dependent upon a large number of expatriates. In 1972, 24% of the jobs in the
mining and quarrying sector were held by expatriates. This dependency _s
also well marked in the civil service and parastatals -- particularly in



professional posts where it is estimated that 63% are non-Zambians. Of the
highly qualified personnel in Zambia today, about 65% are expatriates.  In
the future, Zambia intends to produce trained local manpower to replace these
expatriates. Obviously full Zambianization is not feasible in the short run
particularly for those jobs which require long experience and for which train-
ing in Zambia is too expensive, but it is reasonable to assume Zambianization
as a target to be achieved by the mid or late 1980s. In addition to supplying
the manpower for the modern sector, provisions of education and training for
the development of the rural agricultural sector are to complement the Govern-
ment's agricultural development objectives and strategy (para. 1.05).
Population, Employment and Income Differentials
1.08      The population of Zambia has an estimated growth rate of 2.9%
p.a. There is a wide discrepancy, however, in population growth rates among
the eight provinces which range from as low as -0.9% p.a. in the Luapula
province to a high of 5.2% p.a. in the Central province. As a result, the
distribution of the population among provinces is also rapidly changing.
The Central and Copperbelt provinces continue to receive large numbers of
immigrants and the remaining six provinces continue to show a net loss in
interprovince migration. The extent of these migration flows in relative
terms was not as large in 1969-74 as in 1963-69. There are several reasons
for this: (a) the absorptive capacity of Central and Copperbelt provinces is
unlikely to be increasing at the same rate as the population growth and so
the attractiveness of these provinces to potential migrants may be declining
somewhat; and (b) growth points, attractive to potential migrants are appear-
ing in other provinces. The urban population 1/ growth rate p.a. has declined
from 8.9% in 1963-69 to 6.8% in 1969-74, and during the same periods the rural
population growth rate has risen from 0.5% to 1.2%. Thus the rate of urban-
ization is still rapid even though it appears to be slowly declining. The
proportion of the population living in urban areas is now 35.3% (compared
with 29.4% in 1969), an extremely high proportion by African standards.
1.09      Population is evenly distributed among five of the eight provinces -
specifically, Copperbelt, Central, Southern, Northern and Eastern. However,
employment in the modern sector does not follow the pattern of population
distribution. For example, the number of wage employees as a percentage
of the provincial population in 1974 was 25.7% for the Copperbelt, 19.5% for
the Central, 7.6% for the Southern and 2.1% for Luapula. In the remaining
provinces (North Western, Northern, Western and Eastern), wage employment
ranged between 3.0% and 4.8% of the population.
1/   Urban areas are defined as those with a population of at least 5,000.

1.10      While data on unemployment are incomplete, it is believed tha~- both
unemployment and underemployment in Zambia are increasing. Due to the. use
of capital intensive technologies, the labor absorption capacity of the modern
sector is limited, and the few new jobs which are created often require skills
or training not possessed by a large number of the labor force. Unemployment
was estimated by thes Zambian Central Office of Statistics to number 141/000
in 1975, an increase from 56,000 in 1968. Nevertheless, the urban industrial
areas attract large numbers of job seekers in part because they represent
opportunities for uipward mobility.
1.11      The total labor force in Zambia is now estimated to be about 1.5 mil-
lion. Of this number, some 400,000 1/ are now employed in the monetary sector.
Wages in the modern sector are high relative to other East African countries
at a comparable stage of development and to incomes in the rural areas. It is
estimated that about 30% of the population, dependent on the modern sector,
enjoy a per capita income of about K690 per year as compared to K70 a year for
the 70% of the population dependent on the traditional sector. In addition,
recent wage increases have aggravated the situation and rising wages have
accentuated the urban-rural gap which in turn has led to rising consumption
patterns, greater demand for imports and an increase in Government recurrent
expenditure. Furthermore, earnings in the modern sector in Zambia appear high
relative to productiLvity, particularly if the subsidy of consumer goods
through low agricultural prices is taken into account. Although the official
Government policy since 1970 has been that wage increases should be related to
productivity and not: exceed 5% p.a., in practice this has not been true. as
witnessed by the 25%x average increase for civil servants granted in 1975. The
growthi of the parastatal institutions which are semi-independent of the
general civil service in their salary determination has also placed an upward
pressure on wages. In general, the parastatals have paid higher salaries and
given better fringe benefits than the civil service. Naturally, the mining
sector has traditionally played a crucial role in forcing upward the wage
structure.
1.12      Wage employment in 1971 was estimated at 365,000 and increased at
a rate of 2.3% p.a. up to 1974. In 1974, there were about 390,000 wage
employees who comprised about 26% of the active labor force. The percentage
distribution of wage employment by sector in the six-year period 1969-74 was
as follows:

1.13      The major employer during this six-year period has been the public
sector including community, social and personal services, construction, mining
and manufacturing. There have been no significant changes in the sectoral
employment pattern over the last six years. The only moderate change has been
in the construction sector, reflecting the government investment program
which was geared to the implementation of the Tanzania-Zambia (Tanzam) railway
in the early 1970s and which is now likely to witness a serious decline, in
volume of both output and employment.
Manpower Requirements
1.14      The Government had projected that during the SNDP wage employment
would increase by about 100,000, an average of 20,000 jobs a year. This
growth of about 5% p.a. would have been consistent with a projected GDP
growth of 7.5% p.a. The projected growth rates were clearly unrealistic.
But even measured against more modest goals, the actual performance has
been disappointing. The table below illustrates that during the first
three years of the Plan wage employment grew at only 9,300, or 2.5% a
year on the average. GDP grew by less than 4% p.a. in this period. In
1975, GDP fell and employment has most likely not increased over the level
attained in 1974.

1.15      Preliminary government estimates for the period of 1977-1981 appear
as unrealistic as the ones contained in the SNDP. Assuming that employment in
1976 would be 410,000 the estimates project a wage employment in 1981- of some
535,000. This assumes a growth rate of about 5.5% p.a. for employment over
the period of the TNDP which, in turn, would mean a monetary GDP growth rate
of at least 7% p.a. On the assumption of a more realistic growth rate of
monetary GDP of about 5% p.a., wage employment would increase by some 3% p.a.
and its distribution by sector would be as follows:

Total                        386,300        522,000
1.17      On the basis of conservative assumptions as to attrition rates
for death, retirement, etc. (2% p.a. reflecting an implied average working
life of 33 years and the comparatively young age profile of the persons
now in employment) and on the hypothesis that some 80% of the over 30,000
expatriates in professional, technical, administrative and managerial posi-
tions will be replaced by Zambians by the mid- or late 1980s, the Bank staff
projects that manpower requirements over the period 1974-1984 would be
as follows:
Total Manpower Requirements
1974-1984
Professional & Technical                        35,500
Administrative & Managerial                     25,500
Clerical                                        24,500
Sales                                            8,800
Services                                        53,800
Production                                      93,400
241,500
At the highest occupational levels which are also those most significant
for educational planning purposes, the projection is extremely sensitive
to the assumptions regarding Zambianization policy because net job crea-
tion is expected to be small (some 2,500 p.a.).
1.18      Data on the education background of job holders by occupational
categories are scanty and imprecise. In order to estimate the need for
outputs of the various levels of the education system, the Bank staff has
developed a matrix regarding the required education background for new
entrants into wage employment on the basis of international comparisons
and conservative assumptions. The matrix takes account of the Government's
intention to broaden participation in junior secondary education so as to
attain eventually a universal basic education of ten years (paras. 2.29).
This will have the effect to gradually raise education qualifications for
various occupations, particularly for those at the bottom of the wage em-
ployment ladder. At the same time, however, the matrix takes account that



- 8 -
shortages of teachers prevent a major expansion of post-secondary and
upper-secondary education and as a result, the educational profile of new
entrants in professional, technical, managerial and administrative cate-
gories would be lower than that normally found in countries of Zambia's
level of development. The matrix is provided below:
Educational Background of New Entrants in Wage Employment
1974-1984
University &                     Form I1I
Post-Secondary       Form V        or Less
Professional & Teclnical                20%              40%           40%
Managerial & Administrative             15%              40%           45%
Clerical                                 5%              25%           70%
Sales                                    5%              40%           55%
Services                                 5%              10%           85%
Production & Agriculture                 5%              10%           85%
On the basis of thi's matrix, during the 1974-1984 period, education output
needs are estimated at some 20,000 for graduates of the University of Zambia
and other post-secondary institutions, 50,000 for Form V graduates and 170,000
for junior secondary or primary school graduates. These estimates do not
inclulde primary and junior secondary school teachers for which separate
projections have been carried out as summarized in paras. 2.20 and 2.21.
1.19      Projections of the supply from the education system have been
carried out by Bank staff on the basis of the enrollment targets in para.
2.36 and of observed participation rates of graduates into the labor force 1/.
They indicate that with some 20,000 entrants into the labor market from
the University and other post-secondary institutions and 40,000 from upper
secondary education, manpower needs and supply would be broadly in balance
at the higher levels, but that some 125,000 junior secondary school leavers
and over a million primary school leavers would compete for about 160,000
jobs. Furthermore, due to the high degree of urbanization of Zambia (para.
1.08), youth unemployment in the towns is likely to reach acute proportions:
under optimistic circumstances, in urban areas there would be only a job
for every five teenagers with primary or junior secondary education. This
reinforces the need for carrying out an effective program of agricultural
development which would create productive self-employment in rural areas
and for revising the incentive system as is now being undertaken by the
Government (para. 1.05).

tions, 70% for secondary school graduates.

1.20      Available data does not provide sufficient information to identify
shortages of high and middle level manpower by major disciplines. However,
interviews with employers reveal that gaps are particularly serious in
science-based occupations for the reasons outlined in paras. 2.17, 2.21
and 2.22. In commercial occupations, some 55% of those now employed are
expatriates and in agriculture, expatriates account for 50% of those
occupying professional posts.
1.21      As a conclusion, the following priorities emerge for manpower
development:
(a)  expansion and improvement of professional, technical and admin-
istrative training for both the high and middle levels with em-
phasis on preparation for science-based occupations and for jobs
in commerce and agriculture; and
(b) reorientation of primary and junior secondary education to pre-
pare school leavers for a productive life on the land as a part
of a well-conceived development program.
II. EDUCATION SECTOR ANALYSIS
Background
2.01      At Independence, Zambia was one of the African countries least
prepared in educational terms. Very few Zambians had completed higher or
even secondary education or participated in skill training and as a result,
Zambia almost entirely relied upon expatriates for preparation and execution
of development programs. In the early days of colonization, education for
Africans was exclusively organized by religious missions. Nevertheless,
when Great Britain in 1924 assumed direct administrative responsibility
for Northern Rhodesia, a fairly widespread education system had been in
existence, however operating on a very low standard. In 1964 it was appar-
ent that national development could only be gained by placing major emphasis
on educational development and consequently the expansion of the educational
sector received priority in the Emergency Development Plan (January-December
1964), the Transitional Development Plan (January 1965-June 1966) and in
the First (1966-1971) and Second (1972-1976) National Development Plans.
Enrollments, therefore, expanded rapidly and increased about 120% at the
primary level and 360% at the secondary level from 1964 to 1974.
2.02      Today, the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for almost all
educational activities, channeling about 90% of public recurrent expenditure
for education into primary, secondary, tertiary education, vocational training,
adult education and the Zambian Youth Service. Other public entities with
sizeable educational activities are the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD)



- 10 -
(extension service), the Ministry of Labor and Social Services (MLSS)
(through its Depart:ment and Community Development, community development-
oriented adult education), the Ministry of Health (MOH) (para-medical trades
and in-service training for all categories of medical personnel) and the
Ministry of Defense (MOD) (training of unemployed youth in rural camps).
The Office of the President, the Ministries of Telecommunication, Mining,
Aviation, Defense and the General Post Office either have or have had sub-
stantial training programs for the benefit of their own staff, including
manual workers. In addition, the mining industry plays a major role in
professional and skill training at various levels.
The Formal Education System
2.03      The structure of the education system, the education pyramid,
enrollment in primary and secondary education and comparative education
indicators are included as Annexes II-1, II-2, II-3 and II-4. The full
primary course consists of seven years of schooling but in some rural areas
schools with four classes only, are still in existence with about 65% oi- the
pupils advancing from Grade 4 to Grade 5.  In 1974 there were 1,585 fulL
(Grades 1-7) primary schools and 1,069 with a reduced number of grades. About
75% (643,200 pupils) of all primary schools are operated by the Government;
24.6% (211,500 pupils) Government aided, and less than 1% (3,500 pupils)
are private. Participation of the relevant age group (7-13 years) in primary
schooling is about 88%. The primary course is concluded with the "Grade
7 Composite Examination", determining who will gain access to Lower Second-
ary School and who will have to find employment or ways leading to further
education or skill training. The secondary course is composed of a Lower
Cycle (3 years, Forms I-III) and an Upper Cycle (2 years, Forms IV-V).
Some 13% of the age group are enrolled in secondary courses and about 20% of
Grade 7 primary school leavers progress to the secondary level and upon
completion of the third year of secondary schooling (Form III), the "Junior
Secondary School Leaving Examination" is taken. It serves as certification
for those leaving the course and for the selection of students for entry to
the upper cycle. About 46% of these students progress to the upper cycle and
take at the end of Form V, the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (COSC)
examination conducted and administered by MOE. Today there are 111 secondary
schools in operation and about 50% of them have received Bank assistance under
Loan 592-ZA and Loan 900-ZA. Basic data on general education are presented
below:

2.04      Vocational training is provided in 19 trades which, in themselves,
comprise clusters of occupations (e.g., plumbing, pipefitting, sheet metal
work) in accordance with Zambian conditions.  Eight Trades Training Insti-
tutes (TTIs) and a Secretarial College offer full-time two-year pre-employ-
ment courses. It is planned to enlarge the programs of five TTIs by adding
commercial and secretarial classes in order to meet critical manpower demands
in well-identified areas (para. 1.17). Total enrollment (June 1975) was 1,930
(9% girls) with an output (1974) of 550.
2.05      Technical Training is taught in three post-secondary technical
institutions with Form V entry requirement:  the Northern Technical College
(Nortec) at Ndola, assisted by Bank Loan 592-ZA, the Zambian Institute of
Technology (ZIT) at Kitwe, and the Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and
Commerce (EHC) at Lusaka. Nortec offers trades training and post-secondary
training for technicians and technologists (automobile, mechanical drafting,
refrigeration, and structural fabrication courses). The 1975 enrollment was
462 students (all men). ZIT has industry-oriented programs comprising archi-
tecture, civil engineering, computer programming, electrical and electronic
engineering, metallurgy, mining, telecommunications, and mechanical engineer-
ing generally of three years duration. In June 1975, ZIT had an enrollment
of 834 students (11% women). The EHC is Zambia's most important single
institution for pre-employment vocational training with 1,200 student places,
of which 250 presently are unoccupied because of lack of boarding facilities.
As a central institution, EHC is admitting students from all over the country
as far as the limited boarding capacity allows. In 1975, five departments
were operating (Academic and Applied Sciences; Para-medical; Hotel and Cater-
ing, Visual and Creative Arts; Business and Secretarial Studies). In an
Extension Studies Department another series of similar courses are offered.

2.06      Medical t          4Enin   s conducted on three levels, all receiving Bank
assistance under Loan 900-ZA: (i) post-secondary professional training of
3-7 years duration; (ii) para-medical training for a period of 2-3 years;
and (iii) training of medical auxiliary staff of 2-3 years duration for
Form III leavers. Only about 16% of the 610 doctors working in the coun-
try are Zambians.  With increased production of UNZA and graduates retuirn-
ing from abroad on Government and mining industry scholarships, the sit:uation
will improve in favror of Zambian nationals in the profession in the early
1980's. The training of dentists and pharmacists remains a problem. For
registered nurses, para-medical and medical auxiliary staff, shortages are
being met through the expansion of existing training programs and the estab-
lishm.ent of new training centers. Over 90% of auxiliary medical staff are
Zambians.
2.07      Agricultural education is supervised by the Ministry of Rural
Development (MRD) except at the higher level. Higher education in agricul-
ture is offered by the School of Agricultural Sciences at the University of
Zambia, graduating some 30-40 students a year. Specialized three-year diploma
courses in agriculture, agricultural education, engineering, livestock, farm
management, irrigation and nutrition are offered at the Natural Resources
Development College (NRDC) in Lusaka.  NRDC has a capacity of 600 student
piaces but has a present enrollment of only 450 due to lack of facilities for
laboratory and practical work in certain courses. Two-year certificate courses
for agricultural and veterinary assistants are taught at three intermediate
agricultural colleges. Government and church groups sponsor three additional
farm schools.
2.08      In eight provincial Farm Institutes (FIs), in-service training
of extension staff and three months of basic training for commodity demon-
strators are carried out. FIs also conduct farmer training courses for
their local districts but suffer from poor facilities and a high turnover
of personnel. At the farm level, aside from 540 agricultural camps where
extension activities are based, 27 Farmer Training Centers (FTCs) are
active and each usually serves one or two districts. Training programs.,
however, have not been fully effective as revealed by a recently completed
evaluation study.  Details are provided in paras. 3.11-3.13.  As indicated
in paras. 1.19 and 1.21, the improvement of agricultural education and farmer
training is a vital element for the implementation of the rural development
program under preparation by the Government of Zambia.  Therefore, it has
high priority and requires urgent attention.
2.09      Higher Education is offered at the University of Zambia (UNZA)
established in 1966 with an initial enrollment of 312 students. In 1974,
total enrollment was 2,516, distributed over eight schools: Natural Science,
Engineering, Medicine, Agricultural Sciences, Education, Law and Mining.
The total academic staff comprised 307, with only 44 or 14% Zambians.
Since its inception, UNZA has produced 860 graduates. All students enter
one of the two basic schools: (a) the School of Natural Sciences for Medi-
cine, Engineering, Agricultural Sciences and Mining; or (b) the School of
Humanities for all other programs. After one year, they proceed to the spe-
cialized school of their choice. In addition to degree programs, courses



- 13 -
leading to the Diploma in social work and several in education are offered,
as are post-graduate programs leading to MA and MSc degrees. Academic stan-
dards are high and the University is experiencing all of the problems of a
young and growing institution. In mid-1975, it was announced that UNZA will
be expanded and two additional campuses established: one in Ndola for the
first two years of undergraduate studies and another in a rural area yet
to be determined for the Schools of Agriculture, Veterinary and Forestry
Sciences. A planning team has been appointed to work out details for in-
clusion of the decentralization/expansion program in the TNDP.
Non-Formal Education
2.10      Mass Media for educational purposes are still in the initial stage
of development. School radio is on the air for 23 hours a week during 27
weeks of the year mainly offering English language courses supporting class-
room teaching and external and correspondence course programs. Content and
presentation of locally produced programs have not yet reached a very high
qualitative level. More and better trained personnel are needed to make
radio an efficient educational tool. Radio is considered potentially
useful for extension work, literacy and women's education. Television
remains an expensive item accessible only to few urban dwellers and has
not yet penetrated rural areas. It offers an educational program of 20
hours weekly during 27 weeks of the year with little relevance to the cur-
ricula of primary and secondary schools. As a printed learning aid, MOE
is publishing "Orbit," a very attractively presented magazine but too
sophisticated for young people.
2.11      Extension Service operates in 540 agricultural camps (farming areas)
scattered all over the country, and is reaching the adult rural population
through direct contact at farm sites and in cooperation with FTCs (para 2.08).
The extension branch of the Ministry of Rural Development headed by the Deputy
Director (Extension) has a full establishment of 15 superscale officers, 62
professional officers and is well staffed at senior levels, although only few
posts are filled by Zambians. There are 34 vacancies out of 158 technical
officer posts, and 60 vacancies out of the cadre of 720 junior technical
officers and agricultural assistant posts. The 140 agricultural demonstra-
tors are at full establishment, and there are an additional 760 commodity
demonstrators. There is about one extension staff for every 385 families (or,
excluding the three-month trained demonstrators, one extension staff member
per 760 families). Although this appears to be a good ratio, many camps are
run by demonstrators with inadequate training and the lack of recurrent funds
for travel and transport facilities have reduced the contact intensity between
extension agents and farmers over the 1968-1975 period.
2.12      Adult Education Centers under the responsibility of MOE exist
in the four major cities of the Copperbelt. Their main activity is to offer
"academic" courses leading to external grade 7 and Form III certificates and
the training of typists/secretaries. In 1974, total enrollment in the Centers
was 2,480. Academic courses were attended by 1,730 persons and 530 were
enrolled in secretarial courses. About 65 attended foreign-sponsored shop and



- 14 -
saLes courses, leaving some 155 for adult education proper, all enrolled in
hone economics, Aside from Adult Education Centers, there exist throughout the
country some 730 evening schools with about 60,000 participants preparing for
the external primary composite examination and 52 "supervised study groups"
with 6,500 participants aiming at the external junior/secondary examination.
There exist considerable difficulLies in recruiting qualified part-time
teachers and with the exception of the secretarial courses, the efficiency of
Adult Education Centers, the evening schools and the study groups, is limited.
Completion rates for external courses are very low and the value of the whole
programr remains, therefore, doubtful. Other important adult education insti-
tutions are the Department of Community Development (DCD) of the MiniLstry of
Labor and Social Services, and the Ecumenical Centers.  The DCD is the main
organizer of adult literacy programs and is specialized in rural development.
Other activities of the DCD are to undertake minor self-help projects (water
supply, school building, feeder roads) and to form rural women's clubs for
learning home improvement. Ecumenical Centers operate combined training
(homecraft and farming) and rehabilitation efforts for the benefits of adults,
adolescents and c:hildren.
2.13      The "National Service" (created after Independence) is being reac-
tivated for all primary and secondary school leavers. Students of higher
edutcation may have to participate under a formula yet to be elaborated.  The
purpose of the Service is to give the youth, within the political doctrine of
Zambian humanism, a taste for simple living and an understanding of agricul-
ture and the rural environment (para. 1.19-1.21).  No detailed plans for the
Service have been made public as yet but the Ministry of Defense, which is
responsible for the operation, is preparing a training scheme and several
mod[el camps have been established. The Service is still in the testing stage
and the first camps appear not to have been entirely successful. More expe-
rience and institutionalization are needed before an evaluation is possible.
In the short run, the Government is intending to use the Service as an ins-
trument to absorb large groups of the unemployed primary school leavers
recognized as a new major social problem (para. 1.19). To a smaller extent,
the Zambian Youth Service of the MOE is providing community development
oriented elementary training in building trades and agriculture for primary
school leavers.
2.14       The educational activities of the mining industry are numerous
and in the several mining training centers, there are about 2,000 persons
in training or retraining in any given month. Altogether more than 4,000
persons each year participate in some type of training under the sponsor-
ship of the mining industry.
Issues in Education Development
2.15       Administration.  With the rapid expansion of the school system,
the strengthening of supporting educational services and the improvement
of administrative structures became necessary.  According to the stiptu-
lations of the Education Act of 1966, MOE acts with the advice of a Na-
tional Council of Education (including regional and local representatives



- 15 -
and of all major interest groups) and at the periphery, with regional and
local councils. The advisory structure is not however providing significant
returns because of a generally centralistic orientation of MOE and competi-
tion, at the regional and local level, with the development committees. In
order to improve administration, it is planned therefore to merge regional
and local education councils with the development committees. Primary
schools and adult education centers are administered and supervised by
Regional Education Officers stationed in the nine educational regions. A
unified educational reporting system has been introduced recently in order
to increase the information flow from the periphery to the center and vice
versa. Its usefulness seems to meet expectations but a later in-depth eval-
uation will have to confirm this. The MOE itself is organized into Adminis-
trative, Professional, Planning and Inspectorate Divisions and is adequately
staffed. The Planning Division is functioning particularly well and is re-
sponsible for many educational innovations. However, in certain Divisions,
many higher-ranking specialized positions remain occupied by expatriate
professionals on contract with the Government. Supporting educational ser-
vices have yet to offer benefits due to the lack of coordination as a result,
inter alia, of being located in Lusaka and other towns and also due to un-
suitable or temporary substandard facilities. Coordination of the education
sector with other sectors (industry, commerce, and agriculture for example)
is not well developed, except for vocational training activities under the
Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training (DTEVT), which
cooperates with an advisory council including representatives of the major
industries and trades.
2.16      Curricula and Teaching Methods.  In Zambia, as in other African
countries after Independence, it was felt that the content of learning at
all levels should be aligned with the new national and social reality.
Therefore, a Curriculum Development Unit was established in the MOE, and
in 1971 a new "Zambian Primary Curriculum", stressing the pedagogical impor-
tance of active learning and confrontation of the pupils with their immediate
social and physical environment, was introduced. The new curriculum is now
being taught in about 75% of all primary classes. In line with the importance
of the rural segment of the population, emphasis was given to simple environ-
mental science, homecraft, attitude formation towards manual labor and the
establishment of permanent literacy in one of the seven major Zambian languages
and English. However, primary education was not intended to be a terminal
course and, therefore, did not prepare students for rural living and one of
its main functions remains as a preparation to subsequent levels of education.
The new curriculum is well supported by text books and other teaching materials
but low teacher quality prevents its effective implementation. Lack of
adequate supervision tempts many teachers to apply the new curriculum in a lax
manner, in particular, with regard to the application of English as the medium
of instruction. The majority of the teachers need to be retrained. The
Chalimbana Teacher Training College (enrollment 250 teachers) is offering
in-service training of three months to one year duration according to the
individual needs of the teachers. Its capacity, however, is far too small to
solve the problem of teacher up-grading within a reasonable time span. This
problem is under discussion as a part of the proposed educational reform.



- 16 -
2.17      At the lower secondary level as well, a significant change of cur-
riculum was introduced, emphasizing the development of skills useful for
later employment in industry and commerce (technical drawings woodwork, metali
work, homecraft, commerce and agriculture). The change was promoted with
Bank assistance which provided, inter alia, the necessary facilities. The
assumption was that 95% of the boys and 70% of the girls would find employ-
ment in the modern sectors of the economy after completion of Form III. To
date, the new secondary curriculum is only taught in selected schools due to
the lack of specialized teachers and much investment in workshops and equip-
merit is therefore not yet brought to full use 1/.   Expectations with
reference to employment prospects of Form III leavers have as well proved
to be far too optimistic (para. 1.19). The upper cycle of secondary schooL-
ing continues to follow the pattern of the British Grammer Schooi but with
increasing adjustments to Zambian needs. Examinations for the COSC, though
based on the syllabi prepared by the Cambridge University Examination
Syndicate, are largely conducted and administered by the MOE. In 1973. 22%
of the candidates failed with the percentage of failures particularly high
in General Science (57%), Mathematics (47%), History (51%) and Biology (43%).
There exists the widespread opinion in Zambian educational circles that in
order to improve examination results, standards should be lowered, a measure
not supported by industry and post-secondary training institutions. Lately,
there have been pronouncements which advocate a systematic rural orieltation
of primary and secondary schools but the contents and specifications of this
orientation are yet to be finalized (para. 2.30). In a general overview it
can be stated that although the primary and secondary school curricula are
generally satisfactory, their effective application leaves much to be desired
and that a concerted effort to improve the quality of education deserves
highest priority. The improvement of education services (para. 2.15) can
assist towards this objective.
2.18      Efficieliu.  The internal efficiency of the education system is
constantly improv-ing but is not yet satisfactory at all levels. Intensive
efforts over the past ten years to expand primary enrollment have resulted
in the overcrowding of existing primary school facilities with double shift-
ing and, in some urban areas, triple shifting.  Also numerous schools are
operated in dilap-idated and incomplete facilities. For secondary schools,
the situation has greatly improved as a consequence of the Bank-assist:ed
First and Third Education Projects (Loans 592-ZA and 900-ZA). Another prob-
lem is that absenteeism is still frequent particularly in remote rural areas,
Repeating of grades is controlled by a stipulation in the Education Act of
1966 and is permitted only one time in Grades 4 and 7 and in Form III and V,
and only if studertt places are available. On the average, about 2% of all
primary pupils repeat with a concentration of about 3% in Grade 4 and 9% in
Grade 7. Pupils with very weak learning or motivation either voluntarily
drop out or are phased out, in particular at the secondary level. The dropout
rate is higher for pupils in the rural areas and for girls generally. Rural

under Loans 592-ZA and 900-ZA are expected to be completed in 1978.

primary schools with limited classes are being expanded to offer the full
course since it is realized that four years of primary education is neither
sufficient for obtaining employment nor for acquiring permanent functional
literacy.
2.19      As indicated in para. 2.03, the participation of the relevant age
group in primary schools is about 88% and about 13% of the relevant age group
in secondary schools. About 20% of Grade 7 leavers progress to the lower
secondary level. A very selective examination at the end of the lower second-
ary cycle eliminates 54% of the Form III students. This is done to reduce
dropout in the upper secondary cycle to a minimum and under the assumption
that most Form III leavers would find immediate employment. While a low
dropout in the upper cycle has been achieved, the expectation with regard to
the employment prospects of Form III leavers has not materialized (para. 1.19).
For the full secondary course the completion rate is 41' which leads to an
output quantitatively higher than the requirements of the labor market. But at
the same time, because of decreasing secondary school leaver quality, industry
and post-secondary institutions have great difficulties in finding candidates
with qualifications for employment or enrollment in higher education.
2.20      The strongest impediment for a rapid improvement in the internal
efficiency of the education system remains quality and adequate supply of
Zambian teachers. Only 3% of the primary school teachers are non-Zambians
(mostly long-standing residents in the country of non-European origin) with
80% of all primary teachers ranging in the lowest grades and pay scale.
Since the pay scale is based upon qualifications, it can be used as a quality
indicator. Zambian educational authorities fully realize that the quality of
primary schooling is an essential prerequisite for the success of all subse-
quent educational levels and the improvement of primary teacher quality is to
be given high priority during the forthcoming decade. Plans to this effect are
being formulated within the context of a sector review conducted by the Govern-
ment (paras. 2.29). In numerical terms, primary teacher supply may be expected
to soon reach an equilibrium with demand under the assumption of universal
education to Grade 7 and a class size of 40.
2.21      At the secondary level, the teacher situation is quite different.
In 1968, only 8% of secondary teachers were Zambians; at present this propor-
tion has reached some 32%, with non-Zambian teachers recruited mainly from
English-speaking countries throughout the world. However, since 1968, a
decrease in the quality of expatriate teachers has been noted basically
due to the young professional age of new recruits and as a result of a deter-
ioration of the terms and conditions of employment, coupled with reduced job
security. Science teaching is almost exclusively in the hands of expatriate
teachers. Secondary teacher colleges and UNZA have a combined output of about
420 teacher graduates p.a. and this is expected to increase in 1977, when two
new colleges are fully operational. Under the assumptions of: (i) a continua-
tion of an increase in enrollment only reflecting population growth; and (ii)
a gradual decrease of a present teacher attrition rate of 15% p.a. to 5% p.a.,
only by 1985 will all expatriate teachers be replaced by Zambians. As regards
the development of universal education up to Form III (para. 2.26), this
target could be reached only much later as under no circumstances could the
present supply of secondary teachers be considered sufficient. As a first step,



- 18 -
however, the Government, in an attempt to prevent secondary school teachers
from leaving the school system after only two or three years of service for
better-paying jobs in the parastatal sector, has placed a ban on transfers
and salary scales have been restructured throughout the public sector, which
reduces the incentive for leaving the teaching profession for employment in
the parastatals.
2.22      External Productivity.  The quality of school leavers at all levels
has been recently reviewed by employers as well as by the Government.  Employ-
ers and the teaching staff of vocational and post-secondary instituticns have
observed a lack of preparedness of school leavers for their subsequent careers,
In particular, many school leavers' knowledge of English is considered
insufficient for employment in the modern sector. In secretarial and business
courses, English is therefore the main subject taught. Another area where
preparation is weak is in the sciences due to the lack of teachers (para.
2.21). Consequently, many training programs of the mining industry and other
important employers are designed to compensate for the shortcomings of primary
and secondary education. Teacher Training Institutes (TTIs), with Form III
entry requirements, de facto, accept 50% of candidates with Form V status and
the ERC and ZIT tend to admit to certain academic courses only candidates with
consiLderably better examination records than formally required.
2.23      The principal objective of the Zambian education system has been
to provide the trained manpower to elaborate and carry out the Government's
development plans. In particular, Zambianization of the high and middle level
manpower has been one of the major thrusts of government policy.  However, as
indicated in paras. 1.14 - 1.19, education outputs have not been in line with
actual absorptive capacity of the labor market and while most high and middle
level positions are occupied by expatriates, unemployment of primary and
junior secondary school leavers is estimated to be about 140,000 and growing
steadily. The requirements for jobs which previously necessitated a Form III
level. education have gradually been "pushed up" and employers seek persons
with a Form V certificate. To date, the MOE's Zambian Youth Service has
taken some measures to provide training for some primary school leavers,
Also, the National Service (para. 2.13) is expected to absorb a larger num-
ber of these unemployed school leavers. On the other hand, well-identified
manpower needs are not being met.
2.24      At present, of the estimated 5,000 managers of business concerns,
nearly 70% are expatriates and there is only one Certified Public Accountant
of Zambian nationality in the country.  At the lower level, a large number of
bookkeeping and secretarial positions are filled by expatriates mostly coming
from the Asian subcontinent and the West Indies. In Lusaka alone, it is
estimated that 500 secretaries of enterprises are expatriates. Lower level
training in business and commerce is given in seven locations.  The combined
output of these institutions in 1975 was less than 300 and ali of them found
employment immediately. Graduates of the two- and three-year courses in
business and commerce from EHC, UNZA, ZIT and the Administration College of
Chingola have also found employment subsequent to graduation. High level
manpower particularly in the field of accountancy is in particularly short
supply.



- 19 -
2.25      Another critical area is that of high and middle level manpower
for agricultural production and development in line with the Government's
4ntention to implement an effective rural policy. In this area, the need
is not to expand supply, except for certain women specialists, because (as
outlined at paras. 2.07-2.08 above) there are sufficient numbers of agricul-
tural technicians at various levels, and post-secondary agricultural training
institutions have an annual output of 120 which accords with estimated long-
term needs. The need is for qualitative improvement. Agricultural techni-
cians require urgent retraining and an effective scheme of in-service training
of agricultural staff should be implemented.
2.26      Equity.  There are no major inequalities in education opportuni-
ties in Zambia. Access to all levels of education is not hampered by a
punitive fee structure; in fact, no school fees are levied. In some rural
areas (para. 2.03), only some 65% of primary pupils have an opportunity
to advance to Grade 5. However, provisions for offering the full primary
course (Grades 1-7) at all schools were made in the SNDP and are expected to
be extended and completed as a part of the TNDP. In order to improve equity
and to raise the quality of school leavers, the Government and the UNIP are
contemplating to expand primary and lower secondary education to such an
extent as to make universal schooling possible up to Form III (para. 2.30).
However, no date has been set for the achievement of this target. As a
heritage from pre-Independence times, three types of primary schools (Gov-
ernment, Government-aided and private primary schools) remain which differ
with regard to teacher quality and advancement in implementing the full
curriculum. The Government, however, is undertaking strong efforts to
unify the system and to assume full responsibility for the remaining Gov-
ernment-aided and private schools with the intention of giving equal oppor-
tunity to all children. Nevertheless, due to Zambia's continued dependence
on highly specialized mining staff, a few fee-paying primary schools may
in the future continue to serve the particular needs of the expatriate
community. Migration within rural areas and between rural and urban areas
(para. 1.08) has caused some unsatisfactory distribution of primary schools
and urban children continue therefore to enjoy easier access to schools.
Poor quality of English of rural school leavers is often a handicap through-
out their educational and professional careers. The hope that differences in
English language proficiency would ievel out during secondary schooling was
not fulfilled and only at the university level did it tend to disappear.
2.27      The degree of geographical concentration of educational oppor-
tunities at the secondary level has been calculated by the Bank staff. 1/
For the analysis, the division into the eight provinces was used. The T974
population of the age group between 14 and 18 was extrapolated by use of the
1969 Census of Population and the 1974 Sample Census of Population whose
growth rates for specific areas were used to project the growth of age group
relevant to secondary education. On the basis of this data, the measurements
of education equity were derived by calculating the Representation Index

since Zambia will soon be reaching universal primary education.

(RI) and the GINI coefFicient. 1/ The relevant age group population along
with school capacity was distributed geographically as follows:
Representation
Provinces            Percentage of Age Group             Index
1.  Copperbelt                     29.29                      1.292

4.  North Western                   4.30                     0.956
5.  Eastern                         8.29                     0.692
6.  Central                        18.22                     0.910
7.  Southern                       13.94                     1.246
8.  Western                         7.35                     0.837
The RI indicates that the Eastern province is particularly under-represeated.
If the Government intends to raise the present enrollment and possibly ex-
pand secondary education enrollments in order to obtain a more equitable
distribution of secondary education, the student places should be provided
to the Eastern province. Further expansion in Copperbelt and Southern dis-
tricts would simply distort the situation further. However, overall second-
ary education capacity is rather well distributed with a GINI coefficieni:
calculated at 0.1161 - one of the lowest in Africa. In addition, regional
imbalances are mostly compensated by the rule that boarding secondary schools
(= 63% of all student places) admit 20% of students from outside the immediate
attendance area. Differences in teacher quality do exist between urban and
rural areas and because of the centralized pattern of higher education, urban
dwellers have easier access to UNZA and other post-secondary institutions.
2.28      At all levels, girls are a minority and have a greater tendency
to drop out, particularly in the rural areas.  This fact was noted by the
Government in 1968 and some elements of the egalitarian doctrine of Zambian
humanism have been reinterpreted to allow temporarily, that better educational
opportunities are given to the sex and specializations most in demand in the
labor market. However, equal educational opportunities for girls remain as
an important target of Zambian educational policy.
The Sector Review and the Proposed Reform of the Sector
2.29      The growing feeling of the public and educational authorities that
the education sector does not produce the attitudes and skills conducive to
self-reliance and national development, has led to an overall review of the
sector to pinpoint and analyze its shortcomings. As part of the review
exercise, teams of experts have been analyzing the educational systems of
1/   Percent of distributed goods (e.g., capacity, teachers, recurrent
costs per student).
RI = Percent of distributional basis (e.g., age group population).

Cuba, Jamaica, the People's Republic of China and selected African countries.
After a period of public discussions and analysis, and following ratification
by the political entities scheduled by late 1976 at the earliest, the main
conclusions will be used as a basis for educational program targets for the
TNDP. Prior to the review, the UNIP provided guidelines for "national educa-
tion policies for the decade 1974-1984", including 20 points, of which four
are particularly important as follows: (a) to restructure the system of
education and provide for ten years of universal education; (b) to improve
and expand the programs of adult education; (c) to develop a locally based
examination system in order to replace the COSC and; (d) to merge the func-
tions of the local and Regional Councils of Education with those of the
District and Provincial Development Committees. These points indicate that
the fundamental policy as to (i) the length of basic education, (ii) the role
of adult and nonformal education, (iii) the reorientation of the content of
secondary education, and (iv) the administration of education, have already
been decided. In addition, the President of Zambia has indicated that every
student should develop a positive attitude towards productive work (guided by
provisions in the curricula) and, prior to entering into higher education,
should have participated in the National Service (para. 2.13).
2.30      The principles and strategies of the educational reform have been
elaborated during the first half year of 1976. At present, a draft reform
program is under discussion and by early 1977, the educational reform is
expected to be finalized. The "theme" of the draft reform is "education
for development" and the proposals lead to a combination of study and work.
The most fundamental change envisaged at the first level of the system is
the introduction of ten years of compulsory basic education for all children.
Since present limited capacity of the primary school and junior secondary
system would only allow the enrollment of a small additional number of pupils,
changes in the school calendar (four instead of three terms) and a new
"rotative" intake system are expected to provide additional capacity. The
"rotative" system would mean that one-half of the children in grades 8-10
(Form I-III, according to the present system) would be attending school
during two of the four terms while the other half would remain at home pursu-
ing a course of "self-instructional" lessons or doing community project work
under the guidance of local leaders. Through rotation, together with more
intensive use of existing facilities, it is expected to double the enrollment
in basic education and at the same time to increase the teacher force by only
20%. At the secondary level, changes are expected to be radical as well.
Since Forms I to III would be integrated in and become grades 8-10 of basic
education, "second stage education" would include various separate vocational
and/or sub-professional courses (for agricultural assistants, nurses, junior
accountants, medical assistants, etc.). The traditional general secondary
course would lose its importance because of the terminal character of basic
education as well as of "second stage education" and changes in the examina-
tion structure. New curricula would be designed, including a strong element
of civic education and introducing professionalization into the "second stage
education." After graduation all "second stage" leavers would participate in
the National Service before proceeding to employment or higher education.
Third stage education (higher education) would provide a combination of
professional courses and general education.



- 22 -
2.31L     Adult education, henceforth called continuing education, would as
well undergo transformation. A new Department of Continuing Education would
be responsible for the national literacy campaign, formal education by part-
time study, skills training programs for adults and certain parts of the
in-service training of teachers.  Courses for adult education would be
revised in order to reflect adult interests and experience and to allow
participants to take, as external candidates, any of the new examinations
of the reformed system.
2.32      The combination of "study and work"' would have higher educational
and productive objectives. Every pupil or student would participate in pro-
duction as an att-itude formation exercise, for occupational preparation and
to add to the national output. There is much hope expressed in the draft
reform to finance a substantial part of education costs from the proceeds
of the students productive activities (cooperative farms, school-community
projects, infrastructure projects, school building, school furniture manu-
facturing), which would be geared to food production and to the development
of cottage industry.
2.33      The new education system would require changes in teacher training
and administration/organization of the sector. Teachers would have to play
a leading role in organizing productive work and MOE would have to change
its management procedures in order to keep administration efficient and
flexible.  Among other things, the Government's ongoing Zambianization, program
(paras. 1.07 and 2.23) and its decision to merge the functions of the local
and regional educational council with those of the district and provincial
development committees are steps towards attaining better administration
and management. It is expressed at several places of the draft reform that
the proposed educational changes can only be achieved by "greater sacrifices
and more intensive efforts by all of the people" and by the creation of
a spirit of volunteerism, in particular on the part of the teachers. The
Party is expected to play the major role in launching and sustaining the
refcrm. Costs and financing of the reform proposals are yet to be worked out;
it is expected that they would be defined after the essential principles
of the draft reform have been accepted by UNIP and the public opinion.
2.34      The reform is expected to lead to the formulation of a broad sector
investment program as part of the Third National Development Plan. It is
noted that the reform explicitly confirms the right of each Zambian to at
least ten years of basic education and that, in planning for education, social
demand considerations will prevail over manpower considerations. The imple-
mentation period for the reform is foreseen to be one decade.
2.35      From the outset, however, it appears that the main constraint on the
implementation of the reform is the present and projected shortage of teachers
and instructors at all levels but primary education (paras. 2.21 and 2.22).
Also, while the expansion and improvements of adult education could be based
upon the improvement and a more effective utilization of existing schools, a
shortage of physical facilities and financial restraints are likely to prevent



- 23 -
the growth and broadening of junior secondary education to attain universal
education of ten years, even after the introduction of the "rotative" intake
system (para. 2.30).
2.36      Estimated education recurrent expenditure requirements during the
period 1976-1986 are presented in the following table. These estimates are
based on the assumption that compulsory education up to Form III (or grade 10)
will be provided beginning in 1977. Based on 1976 prices, recurrent expendi-
ture would amount to about K 240 million in 1981, which is more than double
the estimated recurrent expenditure in 1976. By 1986, the recurrent expendi-
ture would increase to about K 296 million. These estimates include a 20%
nominal increase in teacher salaries as authorized by the recent implementa-
tion of revised salary schedules, along with moderate increases in student
requisites. Based on these financial estimates, MOEC's total recurrent expen-
diture from 1976 to 1986 would increase at about 11.1% p.a. in real terms. By
1986, how, ever, total education recurrent expenditure would reach 37% of the
budget which is an extremely high proportion. On purely financial grounds,
it appears that the Government's stated policy of universal and compulsory
education up to Form III is highly improbable, unless the cost-saving devices
promoted as a part of the reform prove to be effective.

2.37      An alternative enrollment projection was developed by Bank staff to
examine the financial implication of more realistic targets. This projection
envisages a 100% participation rate in primary, a progression rate of 18% to
junior secondary education between 1976 and 1981 and 50% from 1981 to 1986.
The recurrent expencditure implications of the afore-mentioned projections in-

Recurrent education expenditures would account for a comparatively reasonable
proportion of the budget. Furthermore, their projected share of government
total recurrent expenditure could be reduced if the cost-saving devices
depicted above are successful.
The Role of the Bank in Zambian Education Development
2.38      The Bank has had a significant role in assisting the education
sector in Zambia. Excluding the education component of the Lusaka Sites
and Services Project (Loan 1057-ZA), three education projects are provid-
ing improved facilities for some 70,000 student places including about
40,000 new student places. Over 85% of the student places to be provided
and/or improved under these projects are in large comprehensive secondary
schools with facilities for the teaching of practical subjects (para. 2.17).



- 25 -
Of the remaining 15%, the majority are for expansion of the University of
Zambia. The three projects touch only very slightly upon agricultural edu-
cation and do not provide assistance to training in management, administra-
tion, accounting and bookkeeping. Qualitative advances were promoted, inter
alia, by the Bank's financial aid for technical assistance specialists and
fellowship training.
2.39      Zambia is one of the countries of the Eastern Africa Region where
broad sector lending for education can be contemplated. At the moment, how-
ever, there are three major obstacles: (a) the formulation of specific
programs suitable for a sector lending approach awaits the finalization of the
reform and of a well-conceived investment proposals for the achievement of its
objectives and targets; (b) project implementation capacity requires strength-
ening in particular as it concerns the development of trained local staff to
replace the expatriate personnel; and (c) as there are various uncertaintities
and difficulties in the construction industry, a comprehensive study of the
industry should be carried out in order to determine, inter alia, ways and
means to increase the industry's capacity to be in a position to implement
construction programs (including school building programs) at reasonable
costs.
2.40      There are, however, urgent and immediate priorities which will
not be affected by the findings of the education sector review and which will
meet well-identified manpower and training needs and provide the infrastruc-
ture necessary for introducing the reforms being contemplated. On the basis of
these priorities, the Government and the Bank have developed an interim
investment program which would round off programs initiated under the previous
three projects and improve training in the areas of agriculture and commerce.
2.41      The following priorities and recommendations are derived from this
analysis:
(a) the quality of agricultural education and farmer training
should be urgently improved to assist in the implementation
of the rural development program (paras. 2.07-2.08);
(b) business education and management training
need expansion and improvement to meet well-identified
manpower gaps (paras. 2.24); and
(c)  the administrative system of MOE needs institutional
strengthening and better accommodation for the many
existing services, allowing for better supervision and
coordination (para. 2.15).

III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Strategy
3.01      During the decade after Independence, priority was given to quanti-
tative expansion of ithe formal school system at all levels (para. 2.01).
Nonformal education and the development of efficient administrative and
educational support services received relatively little attention even thiough
their institutional. framework was set up (paras. 2.15-2.18). In the meantime
the educational system has grown into dimensions which make it necessary to
consolidate and strengthen its administrative and support services before
other important targets are approached. Also, the training of agricultural
personnel and farmers requires urgent up-grading to allow the implementation
of programs for increased agricultural output and productivity (para. 2.08)
and training of accountants, bookkeepers and middle-level administrators
is of high priority (para. 2.24).  Therefore, the interim investment program
prepared by the Zambian Government and the proposed project are designed to
provide Zambia with an administrative structure to consolidate the educational
achievements, to improve training for agricultural staff and farmers for
rural development, and to increase the supply of middle and advanced level
commercial and business know-how, atypically scarce, and consequently, in.
strong demand in the modern sectors of the Zambian economy. The proposed
project consists of:
(a) improvement of education administration, examinations
system, research and curriculum development through
the construction, furnishing and equipping of Phase II
of the Educational Services Center;
(b) expansion and improvement in business education
through (1) expansion of the boarding capacity of
the Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and Commerce;
and (ii) provisions of equipment and furniture for the
Business and Secretarial Studies Department at EHC and
for five Trades Training Institutes;
(c)  improvement in the training of agricultural staff
and farmers through provisions and/or replacement as
required of teaching facilities and boarding faci-
lities for women, utility services, staff housing,
instructional equipment and transport in eight exist-
ing Farm Institutes and 20 Farmer Training Centers;
(d) technical assistance consisting of 25 man-years
of specialist services and 40 man-years of fellow-
ships for staff development of the Evelyn Hone
College and 13 man-years of specialist services and
eight man-years of fellowships in agricultural educa-
tion and extension; 36 man-years of specialists ser-
vice for the project unit (to be provided by NORAD) and



- 27 -
(e) special studies consisting of:
(i) Survey of the construction industry,
(ii) Completion and Evaluation Study of the
proposed project.
Student places and approximate enrollments are as follows:

Project Items
3.02      Educational Services Center (ESC), Phase II.  The MOE maintains
a number of educational services facilities (e.g. curriculum development,
student services and several examination services sections) located all over
Lusaka and in other provinces. These services are generally housed in temporary
or sub-standard facilities and administration is difficult due to their
scattered locations and the lack of adequate physical facilities (para. 2.15).
Establishment of Phase I of the ESC was the initial step taken towards the
consolidation and improvement of all the service units of the MOE and is now
being carried out under the Third Education Project (Loan 900-ZA) and would
provide for the first time a unified administration of these services. The
services included in Phase I are the Curriculum Development Unit, Audio-visual
Aids Unit, Correspondence Course Unit, Zambia Library Service, Printing and
Documentation, Orbit Magazine, and Administrative Services. The proposed
project would assist in Phase II and would add to the Center an Examination
Section including a Standards and Certification Division for the DTEVT, a
Research, Evaluation and Guidance Section and an expansion of the Printing and
Documentation Unit.



- 28 -
3.03      An important step forward in the equalization of educational oppor-
tunities in Zambia was the centralization and standardization of examinations
at all levels. This Division administers examinations to all primary schools
(about 115,000 in 1975 expanding to 202,000 in 1985), lower secondary (about
16,000 in 1975 to 32,000 in 1985), upper secondary (about 7,000 in 1975 and
25,000 in 1985) and primary teacher colleges (about 900 in 1975 and 1,500 in
1978). A special section within the Division would be administering ancl
conducting examinations in trades and para-medical subjects offered in all of
the TTIs and post-secondary technical institutes, and is expected to grow
rapidly over the coming years. These examination activities would be supported
by a Certification Section in the Division which would issue and distribute all
awards and maintain an extensive filing system.
3.04      Curriculum improvement and development at all educational levels
are foreseen to be El priority undertaking of the MOE during the forthcoming
decade (paras. 2.16, 2.17 and 2.31). The Research, Evaluation and Guidance
Division whose main function is to supervise and monitor the implementation
of all niew or revised curricula and evaluate the outcomes of instruction
therefore plays a very important role in educational development.
In addition, this Division administers aptitude and ability tests for job
placemient to all Form V students and provides career and educational guid-
ance to teachers and compiles all educational statistics.
3.05      Business Education.  Business and commercial skills at all levels
have been in great demand since Independence and supply has not kept up with
demand (para. 2,24). Secretaries have been systematically recruited from
abroad and many continue to occupy senior positions in government and industry.
The situation is even less satisfactory in accounting, bookkeeping, and
business administration where only a few Zambians have received degrees or
similar qualifications and dependence on foreign expertise is continuing. In
order to improve the supply of Zambian business and commercial manpower the
project would: (a) increase the boarding capacity and improve conditions for
the teaching of accounting and related subjects through the provision of
instructional equipment and furniture of the Evelyn Hone College of Applied
Arts and Commerce; (b) assist the replacement of expatriates by Zambian
teachers through a staff development scheme; and (c) assisting in the estab-
lishment of commercial and secretarial courses in five Trades Training Irnsti-
tutes through the provision of instructional equipment.
3.06      EHC is Zambia's most important single and centralized post-second-
ary vocational training institution.  Its capacity is 1,200 student places,
of which only 950 are filled at present due to limited boarding capacity
(640 places). Since housing for students, other than boarding facilities
of educational institutions, is almost non-existent in Lusaka, MOE has
proposed the construction of 250 boarding places at the EHC campus. This
measure would increase the enrollment in the business studies departments
and would allow more equitable admittance of students from all regions of
the country.

3.07      The EHC follows, in a very flexible way, the immediate needs of
the labor market in regard to its course planning. For this reason, in only
five departments, a wide range of subjects are covered and diploma and certi-
ficate programs offered. Since its inception in 1964, EHC has shown parti-
cular concern for specialized and in-service training of teachers. In 1975,
four departments were operating, offering training as follows: (i) Academic
and Applied Sciences Department providing a 2-year Science Laboratory Techni-
cian course and science teaching for other EHC programs; (ii) Para-medical
Department offering three-year courses leading to Diplomas in Pharmacy Tech-
nology,-Public Health Inspection, Medical Laboratory Technology, Physio-
therapy, Radiography and 6-month courses in Meat and other Food Inspec-
tion and to train Dispensary Assistants; (iii) Hotel and Catering Department
with 3-year courses in hotel management and courses leading to various spe-
cializations in the catering and tourism area; and (iv) Visual and Creative
Arts Department offering 3-year full-time courses for Secondary School
Teachers in Art and courses leading to the Secondary Teacher Diploma in Music.
Shorter courses in Graphic and Fashion Design, Printing and Composition,
Printing Machinery and Journalism are also organized. EHC admits candidates
only with practical experience and upon recommendation of their employers.
3.08      The nucleus of EHC activities is however the Business and Secre-
tarial Studies Department with a combined enrollment of 525 students (58% of
the total enrollment in 1975). The following courses are offered in the
Business Section: (i) 18-month courses leading to the certificate in ac-
counting and business studies for persons already engaged in book- or rec-
ord-keeping employment; (ii) diploma course in accountancy; and (iii) var-
ious courses of varying durations in store-keeping, personnel management,
procurement and secretarial trade. Instructional equipment to be provided
under the project would make possible improvements in the courses offered
by this Department.
3.09      Unlike the other departments of EHC, where Zambianization on the
average has reached 50%, the teaching staff of the Business and Secretarial
Studies Department is still composed entirely of expatriates, hired under
technical assistance contracts from the UK, other African countries and South
Asia. Only 50% of the expatriate teachers, upon arrival in Zambia, have had
previous teaching experience and for some subjects, qualified teachers are
not available under existing terms of employment. Therefore, in order to
improve the teacher situation, the project would include 25 man-years of
technical assistance specialists and 40 man-years of fellowships (Annex
III-1) for studies abroad to implement a staff development plan prepared
by the DTEVT. Beneficiaries of the fellowships would be bonded to teach
at least three years at EHC and would be carefully selected among graduates
or professionals who have already shown an interest or special ability for
teaching which would minimize the attrition rate. The Government confirmed
that within six months of the date of the Loan Agreement they would provide
to the Bank an updated Staff Development Plan prepared by the DTEVT for
the Business and Secretarial Studies Department of the EHC including a
detailed plan for the recruitment of technical assistance specialists which



- 30 -
would include, inter alia, a schedule for the appointment of specialists and
the training of fellows and exchange views with the Bank regarding the plan
as so updated and its implementation.
3.10      Trades Training Institutes (TTIs) located in eight provinces of the
country have so far been successful in the basic training of certain slkilled
manpower demanded by the Zambian industry inside and outside big business
centers. The proximity of their locations to, and their close contact with
industries outside the Copperbelt, seem to have been an important factor in
reducing the migration of skilled manpower to other parts of the country.
Five of the eight existing TTIs at Kabwe, Luanshya, Mansa, Nkumbi and Lukashya,
all located in areas of growing demand for secretarial manpower, have been
chosen for the introduction of the commercial subjects. The proposed project
includes provision for furniture and instructional equipment for a total of
seven classrooms for commercial and secretarial courses. In preparation for
the inmnediate offering of commercial courses, the DTEVT has recruited about
ten commercial teachers.
3.11      Farm Institutes (FIs) and Farmer Training Centers (FTCs).  The pro-
motion and improvement of agricultural production in Zambia are undertaken
mainly by the Department of Agriculture, Ministry of Rural Development
(DAMRD - Annex III-2) largely through residential farmer training and agricul-
tural extension programs. Residential farmer training is carried out in 27
FTCs, each of the 8 provinces having 3-4 centers where short courses for
farmers and farm women are offered.  Extension work is conducted in 540
agricultural camps (extension stations), each camp consisting of a farming
area where generally an agricultural assistant with one or two commodity
demonstrators perform extension activities.  Eight FIs, one in each province,
are operated by the DA-MRD for in-service training of its staff.  Occasionally
training for more advanced farmers is also conducted. These training insti-
tutions and agricultural camps are intended to cater to the training needs of
about 600,000 farm families with over a million farm workers, and some 2,000
extension and training officers and other technical staff.
3.12      Training and extension activities, however, have not been efficient
and effective. A recently completed evaluation study of the farmer training
and extension programs of the DAMRD which was conducted by the Rural Studies
Bureau of the University of Zambia under the Third Education Project (Loan
900-ZA), revealed that while farmer training and extension activities had some
influence in improving agricultural production, their overall impact has been
minimal due to certain serious constraints, as follows:
(a) the instructors at the FTGs and FIs and the extension
agents and their assistants are inadequately trained
for their jobs. Most of the instructors have had no
training in teaching methods while the commodity de-
monstrators who usually have the most contact with
farmers, receive only 12 weeks of training in agricul-
tural and extension education after they are recruited
into the service among Form III leavers;



- 31 -
(b) a number of training institutions do not have reliable
transportation facilities necessary to bring in farmers
and staff for training, adequate provisions for water and
electricity and accommodations for women trainees
and instructors; and
(c) in many institutions, essential instructional equipment
is lacking.
3.13      Farmer training and agricultural extension programs in Zambia have
the potential to contribute considerably to rural development and are the
only educational programs available to farmers for their technical guidance.
However, although the existing training and extension programs are not large
enough to meet the training needs of the entire farming population, the
evaluation study recommended that no further expansion of training and exten-
sion activities should be considered until the existing programs are upgraded
to reasonable standards. This recommendation was accepted by the DAMRD and
the Government decided to launch a program for the improvement of agricultural
training in accordance with the findings and recommendations of the study,
with the following objectives: (a) to maximize the intake of the FTCs and
FIs, (b) to upgrade the teaching and technical skills of the training, exten-
sion and other technical staff of the DAMRD and (c) to raise the quality of
farmer training. These objectives would be attained by: (i) improving the
instructional facilities, student and staff accommodations (particularly
for women), utilities and operational services of eight existing FIs and 20
existing FTCs; and (ii) providing technical assistance consisting of special-
ists and fellowships to assist in staff development and in planning and
organization of more effective training and extension programs. Three FIs
and seven FTCs are presently being upgraded with Bank assistance under the
Third Education Project (Loan 900-ZA) and are expected to be completed by
March 1977.
3.14      Under the proposed project, eight FIs would be provided  with home
economics and audio-visual workshop, improvements in staff accommodations,
water supply and electricity and vehicles where needed. The improvement of
transportation and accommodation facilities would enable the FIs to operate at
full capacity and with better operational and educational efficiency. About
1,500 additional MRD staff would be trained p.a. as a result of this upgrading.
Thirteen man-years of expert services would also be provided consisting of
three man years each for an agricultural educator, a rural home economics
educator, an audio-visual and teaching aids specialist, and four man-years for
an agricultural extension educator (Annex III-1). The agricultural education
specialist would assist in developing the skills of the residential training
staff in planning and organizing relevant instructional programs, in the use
of effective methods of teaching farmers and in developing a manual on planning,
organizing and implementing residential training programs for farmers and
extension staff. The extension specialist would assist in training the
extension staff in carrying out community surveys as a means of determining
their needs and as a basis for program planning and in setting up and conducting



- 32 -
mass instruction activities such as field days, field demonstrations and
community assemblies and in developing an extension workers' manual in planning,
organizing and implementing agricultural extension programs. The rural home
economics educator would assist in training home extension agents and in
planning and implementing home extension programs and would assist the agricul-
tural educator and extension specialist in preparing the manuals. The audio-
visual and teaching aids specialist would assist the training staff of t:he MRD
in the preparation, production and use of locally developed teaching aids and
in the operation and maintenance of audio-visual equipment. About eight
man-years of fellowship training is also included for the Zambianizatiort of
the posts (Annex III-1). The Government confirmed that they would appoint the
specialists within nine months after signing of the Loan Agreement.  The/
Government also confirmed that with the help of the agricultural and the rural
home economics specialists, a detailed plan satisfactory to the Bank, for the
in-service training of the teaching and extension staff and the improvement of
the instructional and extension programs of the DAMRD would be prepared and
submitted to the Bank within 18 months after the signing of the Loan Agreement.
The Plan would, inter alia, include recommendations regarding provisions for
adequate travel fund allocations in order to increase the contact intensity
between the extension agents and farmers (para. 2.11).
3.15      The proposed improvements to the 20 FTCs include provisions for
student housing for women, home economics workshops, instructional equipment,
vehicles, improvement of water and electricity supply and limited renovation
and/or replacement of dilapidated office/classrooms and dining facilities.
The inadequacy of essential physical facilities, the lack of instructional
equipment and absence of well trained teaching staff have rendered training at
the FTCs ineffective. The lack of vehicles to transport trainees to and from
the centers, inadequate boarding facilities for women and lack of water and
electricity have been largely responsible for hindering the Centers from
operating at full capacity (para. 3.14). With the proposed improvements, a
total of about 198,000 man-days of training can be conducted at the FTCs as
compared to 64,000 man-days of actual training in 1973-1974. As a result, an
additional 13,400 farmers and farm women p.a. in ten-day courses would attend
the FTCs. Providing vehicles in each Center would not only help solve the
transportation problems of the trainees but would also improve the communication
and movement of the FTC staff outside of the Centers, since these Centers are
located in areas which are generally inaccessible to public transportation.
Instruction at these FTCs is expected to be greatly improved with better
trained instructors, who would have received in-service training at the FIs
(para. 3.16), and with additional equipment which would be provided under the
proposed project.
3.16      It is expected that adequate staffing of the FIs and FTCs in the
project will easily be provided since there are now a total of 990 training
and extension officers who are based in the provinces from which to draw
instructors.

3.17      Special Studies - The proposed project would include assistance
to carry out the following studies:
(i) Survey of the construction industry. The Zambian construction
industry is the largest employer in the country (para. 1.12)
but there has been a noticeable lack of planning in the sector
and even in the Government's building program resulting what
is described as a "feast and famine" situation which adversely
effects the industry. The Government has attempted to develop
the Federation of Building Cooperatives and has encouraged
Zambian contractors by limiting work valued under K 100,000
(US$124,000) to wholly Zambian owned firms. However, these
measures have been unsuccessful due to the lack of managerial
capacity and credit facilities. The industry, as a whole, is
predominantly operated by expatriates and organized under
"Council for the Construction Industry" made up of representa-
tives of the contractors, design professional groups and certain
government agencies. The Council, even though it represents a
broad scope of the industry, has had little success in developing
lines of effective communication with the Government. Also,
the industry can be described as being dominated by firms owned
by expatriates with little being effectively done in promoting
the development of local Zambian contractors. Due to the present
uncertainties over whether the Government intends to encourage
or curtail private initiative and enterprise, an unhealthy
atmosphere has developed and many contractors are reluctant to
undertake additional work. The overall situation has also been
aggravated by recent difficulties in obtaining import licenses
and foreign exchange for imported items for construction. In brief,
the industry is going through a very critical period awaiting for,
inter alia, indications from the Government as to its future
policies towards the sector. The Government has recently recog-
nized that such problems exist and has requested assistance from
the Bank to undertake a "Survey of the Construction Industry" which
would give guidance as to steps to be taken to promote a viable
industry. The Government gives high priority to this survey and
retroactive financing up to US$50,000 equivalent is recommended
for expenditures incurred from December 1, 1976. The survey would
review the industry as a whole, including the infrastructure of the
industry, such as local manufactures of building materials and
components, transportation and firms providing professional services
(i.e., architects, enginers, quantity surveyors, etc.). The terms
of reference of the survey have been prepared by the Government and
reviewed by the Bank. The cost of the survey is estimated at
US$250,000 equivalent.
(ii) Completion and Evaluation Studies. In order to facilitate
the evaluation of the proposed project after its comple-
tion, funds would be provided in the project to cover ex-
penditures in conducting evaluation studies of project



- 34 -
components when completed. These studies, therefore, may
take place long before the project as whole is completed.
Among other things, these studies should include prelim-
inary assessments of implementation as well as of Bank
procedures and interventions in connection with the
project. These studies would be managed by a desig-
nated official of the Government in cooperation with
the Project Director under terms of reference satisfac-
tory to the Borrower and the Bank. The Government con-
firmed that the completion and evaluation studies report
would be submitted to the Bank for review within three
months after the completion of the project.

4 02      Construction, furniture and equipment costs have been derived
b'y the Government and reviewed by Bank staff on the basis of recent quota-
tions received for similar project items in the First, Second and Third
Education Projects (Loans 592-ZA, 645,ZA and 900-ZA) and in consultation with
architects and quantity surveyors of the MOE and the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW).  Base unit costs of US$270 per square meter on average for construction
at the officlal exchange rate for the FIs and FTCs is somewhat high due to,
inter alia, their remote locations and small size of work involved. Cost of
the EHC and the ESC of US$335-400 per square meter provides for more complex
requirements, i.e., additional electrical and mechanical services and a
mult:-story structure for the boarding facilities at the EHC due to limita-
ticons of available land. This compares with US$350 (October 1975) in Zaire
and US$250 (September 1976) in Madagascar.  Transportation difficulties both
for imported and locally manufactured items and the present status of the
construction induistry (para. 3.17) contribute to the high unit costs. To
minimize costs, standardized building designs previously developed by the
Buildings Branch of MPW and consultant architects will be used where practi-
cable. Emphasis will be given to the maximum use of local materials and
simplified building technology. The proposed schedule of accommodations are
functional and areas per student place are realistic. Furniture and equipment
would be kept to a minimum and of the type pertinent to the basic needs of the
country to accomplish the educational objectives of the project. Academic and
comnmunal facilities, including the ESC, represents about 51% of the buildings
costs; boarding 40%; and staff housing 10%. Site development is equivalent
to about 31% of the total cost of civil works reflecting the project's emphasis
on improving essential utility services to the existing institutions.
4.03      Customs Duties and Taxes.  Items directly imported for educational
faci-lities are exesmpt from import duties and taxes. The project has been
costed net of import duties and taxes on those items but includes taxes
estimated at about US$1.0 million equivalent representing tax on loca:lly
procured construction materials and equipment, imported directly by contrac-
tors or vendors and for services.  The Government confirmed that:  (i) all
imported project items procured directly by the Project Unit would be free
of import duties and taxes; and (ii) that all necessary documentation, in-
cluding required import licenses and authorization to remit foreign exchange,
as may be required, will be processed in an expeditious manner so as not to
delay project implementation.
4.04      Contingency Allowances.  For physical increases, 10% has been
added to the base cost of civil works and professional services (architec-
tural/engineering) and equipment (including vehicles) and 5% for furniture,
technical assistance, special studies and project administration. Estimated
price increases are based upon the following annual rates for which price
escaLation has been caLculated from the base cost date (September 1976) in
accordance with the implementation schedule (Annex IV-2).

Since 1970 prices in the construction sector have risen considerably over
Xhe general price index.  From June 1970 to December 1974 the price index
for building materials moved from 118.8 to 185.5. Since then, changes by
two to seven index points/month have been frequent. For selected items
(timber, metal products, paint and allied products) price increases between
December 1972 and September 1974 were 85% to 42% and have become more dynamic
thereafter. Difficulties by contractors in obtaining imported items and lack
of competition due to the present uncertainties over whether the Government
intends to encourage or curtail private initiative and enterprises (para.
3.17) also contribute to the present high cost level. As noted, Zambia has
had a rate of inflation considerably above the international rate and only
a gradual slow down in the rate of increase is expected.
_      The foreign exchange component has been calculated by Bank staff
in consultation with the Government as follows: (a) site development 78%;
(b) buildings 45%; (c) professional services (architectural/engineering),
special studies and project administration 35%; (d) furniture 95%; (e) equip-
ment 90%; and (f) technical assistance 80%. These percentages have been
calculated on the assumption that it is likely that contracts for civil
works and professional services will be awarded to firms already operating
in Zambia and the bulk of furniture and equipment contracts awarded to over-
seas firms. Including contingencies, the foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$13.3 million excluding the grant (technical assistance) by the
Norwegian Agency for International Development (NORAD).
Financial Plan
4.06      The total project cost of US$23.2 million equivalent would be
financed as follows:

4.07      An IBRD loan of US$13.3 million equivalent would finance the for-
eign exchange component of the project which represents 66% of the total
project cost excluding taxes and NORAD's contribution.  The Government's
counterpart funds of US$7.8 million equivalent would be phased over six years
with an estimated maximum contribution of US$2.5 million equivalent required
in any one Zambian fiscal year.
4.08      Recurrent cost generated by the proposed project is estimated at
Kwacha 0.6 million p.a. at 1975 prices or less than 1% of the estimated total
Government recurrent expenditure. The Government is expected to be able to
provide these expenditures, including its share of the capitaL costs.
Implementation of the Project
4.09      The project would be implemented in about six years (Annex IV-2)
afteI loan effectiveness with a proposed Closing Date of March 31, 1983.
Key indicators for project supervision are included as Annex IV-3.
4.10      Administration.  The Project Unit established in the Buildings
Branch of the MPW for the implementation of components of Third Education
Project (Loan 900-ZA) would be responsible for the financial and administra-
tive control of the proposed project including liaison with the Bank. The
Unit would also be responsible for the coordination with the various Minis-
tries and agencies involved in the project. The Project Director is part
time and the Unit would be strengthened by the addition of a full time assis-
tant project director to be provided under the NORAD technical assistance
program. Any new appointments to the positions of project director, assis-
tant project director, architect, equipment specialist and the accountant
would be in consultation with the Bank. The Government confirmed it would
continue to maintain the unit and its staff. Included in the project would be
supplemental operational expenses of the Project Unit. NORAD is to provide,
on a grant basis, technical assistance specialists (Annex IV-4) for the
project unit consisting of about 18 man-years of specialists services for the
Project Unit and about 18 man-years of services of building construction
supervisors. These supervisors would be responsible for the day-to-day super-
vision of construction work on project institutions. Qualifications and terms
of reference of the construction supervisors would be satisfactory to the Bank,



- 41 -
4.11      Professional Services (Architectural/Engineering).  Design and
supervision of construction of all project institutions would be carried
out by consultant architects/engineers selected and commissioned on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Standarized building designs and
documents previously developed by the Buildings Branch of the MPW and con-
sultant architects would be utilized to the maximum extent practicable.
The consultants would be under the supervision of the Project Unit. The
Government confirmed that the consultants would be employed within six
months of the date of the Loan Agreement. It is expected however that the
majority of the consultants would be appointed prior to the signing of the
Loan Agreement and retroactive financing up to US$50,000 equivalent is recom-
mended for expenditures incurred from December 1, 1976. The building con-
struction supervisors (para. 4.10) would be responsible for the day to day
supervision of construction on all project institutions. These supervisors
would be employed in the Project Unit and would work in conjunction with
the consulting architectural/engineering firms who would be responsible for
all technical items relating to the construction of project institutions.
4.12      Sites.  Work under this proposed project consists of renovation
and/or expansion of existing institutions located on satisfactory sites which
are Government owned.
Procurement
4.13      Contracts for civil works, furniture, instructional equipment and
vehicles would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines for Procurement except as
follows:
(i) Civil works contracts to cost less than US$250,000
equivalent each (total estimated at US$4.5 million);
(ii) Furniture, equipment and vehicle contracts to cost
less than US$50,000 equivalent (total estimated at
US$0.3 million); and
(iii) Locally procured transportation servi,ces for furniture
and equipment (total estimated at US$0.1 million).
Contracts for items (i) to (iii) would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding, advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfac-
tory to the Bank. The aggregate value of these contracts is likely to be
US$4.9 million equivalent.
4.14      Standardized sketch designs, draft tender documents and master
lists of furniture, equipment and vehicles, indicating proposed grouping for
tender, would be reviewed by the Bank. Items would be grouped to the extent
practicable to encourage competitive bidding and to permit bulk procurement.
Review of tender evaluation documents by the Bank prior to award would be
required only for contracts above US$250,000 equivalent for civil works and
above US$50,000 equivalent for equipment, furniture and vehicles.



- 42 -
4.15      Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be
allowed a preference of 15% or the existing rate of import duties, which-
ever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing foreign suppliers.
Disbursements
4.16      Disbursement (Annex IV-5) would be on the basis of:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures for imported construction
materials, furniture, equipment, including vehicles,
and technical assistance;
(b)  100% of ex-factory cost of locally manufactured furniture
and equipment;
(c)  45% of total expenditures for civil works;
(d)  70% of t:otal expenditures for imported goods purchased
locally and local transportation services for furniture
and instructional equipment; and
(e)  35% of professional services (architectural/engineering),
special studies, and. project administration.
4.17      All disbursements would be fully documented.  Disbursement for
operational expenses under project administration would be made against a
certificate of expenditure, documentation of which would not be submitted
for review but would be retained by the Borrower and would be available for
inspection by the Bank in the course of project supervision. Auditing would
be required on an annual basis on expenditures incurred by the Project Unit.
Auditing procedures have been mutually agreed upon by the Bank and the Bor-
rower. Undisbursed funds would be used for project-related items as approved
by the Bank.

V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
5.01      The proposed project would finance an interim investment program
and would provide the necessary infrastructure for a fundamental education
reform which is expected to start soon (paras. 2.29-2.35). Benefits in
quantitative terms would be substantial. The supply of extremely scarce
middle and advanced level manpower (in particular, accountants) in business
and commerce would increase from 40 p.a. to 300 p.a., and technical assist-
ance and a staff development scheme to Zambianize the business studies faculty
over a span of six years. In the rural sector, the project would create
additional capacity for the training of 13,400 farmers and farm women p.a.
through the FTCs and improve the in-service training capacity of the FIs for
agricultural and extension staff.   Most of the new capacity in the FTCs is
designed and reserved for women--a target group neglected in the past-and the
training programs would undergo major revisions.
5.02      In addition, the project would promote coordination and adminis-
tration of educational services and improved educational research, evalua-
tion and guidance is expected to bridge the gaps between the school system
and the labor market needs. The standardization of examinations would gear
the content of instruction in various levels and types of education to Zambian
needs. Finally, the study of the construction sector would provide the basis
for the reorganization of a sector whose orderly development is vital to all
other sectors of the economy.
5.03      Risks.  The risks of the project relate basically to the FTCs, their
program orientation, the attendance of farmers, etc. In fact, as pointed
out in para. 3.15, the improvement in physical facilities is only one of the
inputs required to develop an effective system of farmer training. In order
to minimize the risks, the project includes about 13 man-years of technical
assistance and evaluation studies (para. 3.14 and 3.17).
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Agreement was reached with the Government on the following principle
points:
(a) technical assistance, staff development, in-
service training of agricultural teaching staff
and evaluation studies (paras. 3.09, 3.14 and
3.17); and
(b) employment of architectural/engineering consul-
tants, auditing procedures and project imple-
mentation arrangements (paras. 4.03, 4.11 and
4.17).
