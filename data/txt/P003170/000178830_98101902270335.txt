REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
FOR A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Zambia for the equivalent of US$13.3 million
to help finance an education project. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.70 percent per
annum. Norwegian Agency for International Development (NORAD) will par-
ticipate in the co-financing with a grant of US$2.12 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent report on Zambia (Report No. 49-ZA) was issued on
December 26, 1972. A basic economic mission visited the country in June/
July 1975, and its report is expected to be issued in February 1977. The
information in this report was gathered by the mission and also by three
subsequent missions which visited Zambia between October 1975 and April
1976. The most recent economic data are summarized in Annex I.
3.        With its large mineral reserves and wide area of land suitable
for crops and livestock, Zambia has the potential for 'rapid and sustained
development, but over the decade real gross domestic product has grown at
a modest rate of less than three percent per annum. GNP per capita was
$540 in 1975. The economy is characterized by a pronounced dualism be-
tween a large modern sector dominated by copper mining and a rural sub-
sistence sector. The large differential in incomes between the urban and
rural sectors has led to continuing rapid migration to towns. Today more
than one third of the country's population lives in towns and there is sub-
stantial urban unemployment.
4.        The broad economic and social goals of Zambia's last two national
development plans (1966-70 and 1972-76) may be summarized as follows: (a)
raising the general level of welfare; (b) diversifying the economy to make it
less dependent on copper; (c) narrowing the gap between urban and rural
incomes; and (d) raising the level of education and developing a wide range of
technical and managerial skills.
5.        Slow aggregate growth has been the result of near stagnation in
mining and a low rate of agricultural expansion. All other sectors of the
economy (except construction) have been growing at fairly rapid rates -
manufacturing at 9.4 percent p.a., services at 6.2 percent p.a., and trans-
port, communications and storage at 5.1 percent p.a.

6.        In 1975 a relatively ,unfavorable year for mining, the sector still
accounted for more than 90 percent of exports and for about 25 percent of
GDP. Such a heavy reliance has unfortunate repercussions for the country.
Widely fluctuating and unpredictable world copper prices have caused serious
instability in Government revenues and the balance of payments. Periods of high
prices, and hence high revenues and high foreign exchange earnings, resulted
in high levels of expenditure, which could not be sustained without serious
stress in periods of low prices. As a result of the slump in world demand
for copper, Zambia is presently passing through its most serious economic
crisis since independence (paras 13-18). Efforts of the two Government-
controlled mining companies to raise production from 700,000 to 900,000
tons per annum between 1972 and 1976 (as projected in the Second National
Development Plan) have not been successful because of delays in investment
caused by transport rerouting necessitated by the Rhodesian border closure in
1973, and later by the lack of funds resulting from the low copper prices. At
presently projected copper prices for the near future, the companies should be
able to continue their expansion program, so that by 1980 an output of 800,000
tons might be reached.
7.        Despite plentiful land resources for crops and livestock, the
overall performance of agriculture has been disappointing. During the past
ten years, output expanded only 1.7 percent per annum on the average, result-
ing in greater reliance on imports of food and agricultural raw materials.
8.        For a long time, the Government's economic development strategy
did not give the agriculture sector the priority it deserved. While farm-
ers failed to receive proper incentives to increase output, public invest-
ment failed to set the stage for the longer-term development of the rural
areas. The prices of agricultural products, most of which are fixed by
Government marketing boards, were not allowed to rise as rapidly as those
of manufactured goods, discouraging production and depressing farm incomes.
With the rapid rise in modern sector wages, the gap between urban and rural
areas widened. At the same time, investments in agriculture were insuffi-
cient and, over a long period, the schemes suffered from inadequate planning
and implementation, largely because of the shortage of qualified personnel
and weak organization.
9.        It is against this background that the Government has begun in the
last two years to devote greater attention to the rural areas and to seek
the means of improving its overall economic strategy. In mid-1975 producer
prices for maize and wheat were raised by 26 and 33 percent, respectively,
and in January 1976 producer prices on a number of important farm products
(e.g. cotton, groundnuts and milk) were raised by amounts ranging from 20
to 56 percent. These increases, which substantially reduced the gap between
domestic and border prices and increased the prices of farm products relative
to those for non-farm products, provided greater incentives for farmers while
raising their real incomes. For 1976 preliminary estimates indicate a record
maize harvest. The Government has also designed a number of programs aimed
at reorienting attitudes (particularly among youths) toward rural work and
living. All those who leave primary and secondary school are supposed to
serve two years in agricultural and paramilitary training in rural work camps
(National Service). Also, there are plans for the establishment of a School

14.       The impact on Government revenues was equally devastating.   Reve-
nues in 1975 declined by 30 percent, reflecting in part a $435 million fall
in revenue from mining. Meanwhile, recurrent expenditures climbed by more
than 30 percent: government wages went up by 25 percent; subsidy payments
to enterprises and for fertilizer, maize, and other foods increased by 75
percent while substantial debt service payments were made. The result was
an unprecedented $490 million budget deficit as compared to a $132 million
surplus in 1974.
15.     - In January 1976, the Government announced a series of austerity
measures including a reduction in recurrent budget expenditures (mainly by
sharply reducing subsidies) and also in net capital expenditures, increases
in customs duties and sales, excise and income taxes, and other measures to
reduce demand and encourage savings. The net result of the budgetary meas-
ures would be to reduce the size of the budget deficit to 50 percent of the
1975 level. In addition, imports and foreign exchange transactions were to be
kept under continued control until the need for restrictions could be gradually
reduced. On July 9, the Government announced a central rate for the kwacha to
be maintained against the SDR rather than in terms of the US dollar. The new
central rate of KI = SDR 1.085 represented a 20 percent devaluation of the
kwacha. The 20 percent realignment is an important step towards restoring
Zambia's international competitiveness; it is expected to promote greater
export diversification and more appropriate import substitution, and thereby
assure a better utilization of labor and other domestic resources.
16.       Recurrent expenditure in 1976 was budgeted at 11 percent below
the preliminary actual figure for 1975. This sharp reduction was a central
part of the austerity program. The largest single source of savings was a 40
percent reduction in subsidies, particularly those aimed at lowering the
retail prices of maize and fertilizers. In order to provide room for increasing
producer prices while reducing subsidies, the Government in mid-1975 and
February 1976 increased consumer prices substantially. Further, in an effort
to keep wages in line with prevailing economic conditions within the country,
the Government decided to freeze the salaries of Government employees during
1976 and 1977 and to hold the line on wage increases in parastatal organizations.
Later, as economic conditions improve, increases in wages will be linked to
productivity gains.
17.       The 1976 budget estimates of total capital expenditures, includ-
ing gross lending to public institutions, amounted to K 156.6 million which
is 37 percent less than in 1975. Investments in health and education were
cut least, while the largest reductions took place in trade and industry
local government and general services. Priority was given to projects sup-
ported by substantial foreign financing and to projects whose implementation
was already far advanced.
18.       Reducing subsidies and increasing consumer prices required consid-
erable political courage on the part of the Government and reflects the ex-
tent of the Government's concern about the current financial crisis, as



- 5 -
well as the need for providing adequate price incentives for agricultural
production. The Government's recent performance gives a positive indication
that it intends to carry out programs and policies to achieve its objectives
of economic growth and social equity.
19.       On the basis of an estimate of about 700,000 tons of copper exports,
the Bank's current copper price forecast of $0.63 per lb. (as compared with
$0.56 per lb. in 1975) and a successful execution of the Government's program
to reduce the value of merchandise imports by $250 million over 1975, the
balance of payments current account deficit in 1976 would be $340 million as
compared to $719 million in 1975.
20.       Zambia has relied on external capital flows to an extent similar to
other African nations of comparable per capita income (e.g., Ivory Coast and Congo).
The terms of these flows have varied, ranging from the very concessionary
terms given by the People's Republic of China to suppliers' credits and Euro-
dollar loans. The Bank is the country's third largest creditor after the
People's Republic of China and private banks. Zambia's outstanding and
disbursed external public debt amounted to $948 million at the end of 1975.
however, owing to the magnitude of its export earnings, which have averaged
47 percent of GDP at current prices over the past five years - Zambia's debt
service ratio has generally been low (e.g. only eight percent in 1975).
21.       With respect to the future, Zambia's capital requirements and debt
service burden will depend to a considerable extent upon the developments in
the copper sector. First, the investment programs of the mining companies
indicate that, after a decade of stagnation, copper production and exports
should expand from 700,000 to 800,000 tons between 1976 and 1980 and at
about two percent per annum thereafter. Second, according to Bank long-
term forecasts for copper and international prices, the improvement in
Zambia's terms of trade, over 1975, should be 50 percent by 1980 (with most
of the improvement occurring by 1978), and 67 percent by 1985. Third, the
recovery from the present recession may take about a year, but thereafter,
as mining output expands and import controls are loosened, the GDP growth
rate would be about 5 percent p.a. untiL 1980 declining to a 4 percent rate
for the 1980-85 period due to a slower expansion of mining. On this basis,
Zambia's gross capital requirements would cumulatively amount to about $1.8
billion over the next five years. Its debt service ratio would rise from
eight percent in 1975 to 15 percent in 1980 and then decline to about 12
percent in 1985.
22.       These projections are very sensitive to copper prices.    If this
price in each year is 10 percent lower than is currently forecast by the
Bank, Zambia's terms of trade would still improve, but its current account
deficits would increase fivefold in current terms and its capital require-
ments would reach $3.0 billion over the 1977-81 period. Its debt service
ratio would then reach 23 percent in 1985. In view of the rapid rise of
debt servicing relative to exports and GDP implied by such a forecast, it
is highly unlikely that Zambia would be capable of mobilizing a capital
inflow of this magnitude.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
23.       The Bank has made 21 loans to Zambia since lending operations began
in 1956. These loans amount to a total of $477 million, of which $323
million (65 percent) financed 10 physical infrastructure projects. Power,
transportation and communications accounted for 75 percent of the lending
for the infrastructural development which has helped Zambia develop basic
facilities essential for mining, manufacturing and commercial farming sec-
tors. Three Bank loans for education helped to expand and develop Zambia's
secondary school system, teacher training and higher education. The Bank
made a loan in 1974 for urban development and another loan in 1976 for the
Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) to assist diversification of the economy.
More recently, the Bank made a program loan to help provide foreign exchange
for importation of essential capital and intermediate goods, raw materials
and spare parts for agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Ten loans are
now fully disbursed and one for a livestock project was cancelled and the
disbursed portion prepaid (677-ZA). In 1975 the Bank's share in Zambia's
total debt (outstanding and disbursed) was 19 percent while the Bank's share
in Zambia's total debt service payments was 22 percent. On the basis of
present projections, these percentages should be about 32 percent and 18
percent respectively in the mid-1980s.
24.       IFC made its first investment in Zambia in 1972 providing $1.1
million (of which $227,500 is equity) for the expansion of the Zambia Bata
Shoe Company, Ltd., and in June 1973, IFC made an additional investment of
$1.2 million for a tannery. IFC in May 1975 invested $1.04 million to Cen-
tury Packages, Ltd. for a packaging materials factory. The most recent IFC
investment of $550,000 equivalent was in the share capital of the Develop-
ment Bank of Zambia (February 1976), in conjunction with the $15.0 million
Bank loan to that institution. A summary statement of Bank loans and IFC
investments as of October 31, 1976 along with notes on the execution of
ongoing projects are contained in Annex II.
25.       Agriculture and rural development remain the most difficult areas,
mostly because of the Government's weakness in making and carrying out suitable
policies and formulating and implementing effective programs. However, the
Bank made four loans during 1968-73 for industrial forest plantation, live-
stock, commercial crops and integrated family farming. The livestock loan
was cancelled in 1973 at the Government's request because the project was
having serious problems due mainly to adverse pricing policies and poor man-
agement. Two projects which had been prepared with Bank assistance were
withdrawn in March 1975 because of inadequate implementing capacity. To
help identify and break the constraints, the Bank at the Government's re-
quest, undertook a rural sector survey in 1975. The report has stimulated
wide discussions about agriculture and rural development at all levels of
Government, and is playing an important part in the Zambia-Bank dialogue.



- 7 -
26.       In addition to the agricultural and rural sector survey, the Bank
has recently studied urbanization and water supply and sewerage. A Basic
Economic Mission visited Zambia in June/July 1975 and examined in particular
the industrial and mining sectors as well as manpower planning in its broad-
est aspects. The reports of these missions will figure in the continuing
Bank-Zambia dialogue, especially in connection with the preparations under-
way for the Third National Development Plan.
27.       The Bank's future lending program emphasizes agricultural and
rural development, to help diversify the economy and improve the living
conditions of the rural poor. Lending to industry and commercial agricul-
ture through the Development Bank of Zambia, also important to diversifica-
tion, will continue, as will support to the development of physical and
social infrastructure, although with declining emphasis on power and com-
munications. In all aspects of the Bank's program, institution building
also will continue to occupy a central position.
28.       In the field of agricultural and rural development, which com-
mands primary importance, the Government has begun identification and prep-
aration of the first of three agricultural projects, for which it expects
to request Bank financing during the next three years. The Bank's Resident
Mission in Eastern Africa has already begun assisting in identification and
preparation work. For the five-year period FY77-81, the Bank's lending
for agriculture is expected to be approximately one third of total lending.
Bank assistance in this sector, however, is not just limited to agricul-
tural projects as such. This project, for instance, has a major compo-
nent for training farmers and Government agricultural technicians. A
second urban project recently appraised and a rural water supply project,
now under preparation, will provide assistance to smaller towns in
predominantly rural environs. An appraisal report of the second industrial
forestry project to help finance forest plantations, logging, sawmilling and
wood processing is under preparation.
29.       Outside of the rural sector, a Bank mission has been to Zambia
to preappraise the next stage of the country's hydropower development and
appraisal of a third road project, which will concentrate on improving road
maintenance and developing staff in the transport sector is scheduled for
early 1977. The urban project which was appraised in October 1976, in addi-
tion to the smaller provincial towns, will include squatter upgrading and
water supply development in three cooperbelt towns.

PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
The Sector and its Problems
30.       At independence in 1964, Zambia had a very limited pool of trained
manpower and relied almost entirely on expatriates for the design and execu-
tion of development programs. The expansion of the education system was,
therefore, given top priority in Zambia's national development plans. From
1964 to 1974 primary school enrollments doubled and at the secondary and
higher levels they more than quadrupled. Although the supply of educated
manpower increased quantitatively, expatriates still predominate in certain
areas, e.g., nearly 70% of the managers of business concerns and 60% of
personnel in specialized technical and professional occupations are expa-
triates.
31.       The general education system consists of seven years of primary
education (aged 7-13), five years of secondary education (aged 14-18) and
four to six years of university education. About 88% of the relevant age
group are enrolled in primary schools and 13% in secondary schools. Courses
in a variety of vocational subjects are offered to junior secondary school
leavers and a number of diploma courses to upper secondary school leavers.
The University of Zambia, established in 1966 now has a total enrollment of
over 2,500.
32.       The principal issues in education development can be summarized
as follows:
(a) Administration and Management. In general, in spite
of successful efforts to link technical and vocational
education with industry, the administration of education
is not well coordinated with that of other government
services either at the national or provincial levels.
In addition, the supporting educational services (e.g.,
curriculum development, education research and guidance,
etc.) suffer from poor integration and lack of unified
direction;
(b) Curricula and Teaching Methods. Although balanced
curricula have been developed for primary and secondary
education, their application is not wholly satisfactory
because of low teacher quality, high staff turnover and
inadequate supervision. The problem is particularly acute
in secondary education where about 68% of the teachers
are expatriates who have comparatively short contracts.
(c) External Productivity. The emphasize on capital-intensive
sectors in Zambia's development and relatively high wages in
the modern sector have constrained job creation. The situa-
tion is further aggravated by lack of preparedness of school
leavers for their subsequent careers. As a result, the



-9-
tendency of employers to choose capital-intensive tech-
nologies and to hire expatriates instead of nationals is
strengthened. While the expansion of junior secondary
education has outgrown the absorptive capacity of the
modern sector, the output at the higher levels is still
insufficient to meet the demand particularly in commer-
cial and agricultural occupations. More attention must,
therefore, be given to both the quantitative and qualita-
tive aspects of education at these levels, in order to
achieve closer integration between the manpower needs of
the economy, on the one hand, and the education/training
system, on the other other.
33.       In order to develop solutions for these and other problems, the
Government undertook an overall review of the sector. The main conclusions
of the review are expected to be developed in early 1977 and used for the
formulation of educational objectives and targets of the Third National
Development Plan (1977-1981). The review is being conducted within the
framework of the United National Independence Party's (UNIP) guidelines
for national education policies for the decade 1974-1984 whose main points
are: a) to restructure the system of education and provide for ten years
of compulsory education; (b) to improve and expand the programs of adult
education; (c) to develop a locally based examination system; and (d) to
merge the functions of the local and regional education councils with those
of the local and regional development committees in order to develop an
improved administration. The review is also guided by President Kaunda's
directive that every student should develop positive attitudes towards pro-
ductive work and should render national service before entering higher edu-
cation. The results of the review would be the basis of educational reforms,
guided by the principle that students must not be seen only as consumers of
social services but also as productive forces contributing to the economy.
34.       In accordance with the broad educational objectives outlined in
UNIP policy guidelines, the task of the review is to: (a) determine how
best to achieve these objectives within reasonable time limits and exist-
ing and projected resources and constraints; (b) develop a comprehensive
long-term educational development plan with quantitative and qualitative
specifications; and (c) prepare a phased program for its implementation.
Upon completion of the review, comprehensive projects are
expected to be developed with Bank assistance. Meanwhile, the Government
has developed an interim investment program to meet urgent and immediate
priorities which will not be affected by the findings of the review. This
project is a major part of the interim program.
35.       The Bank has had a major role in assisting education in Zambia.
Three Bank projects are providing improved facilities for some 70,000 stu-
dent places including 40,000 new places, mostly in secondary schools and
at the University of Zambia. The First Education Project (Loan 592-ZA),
after numerous initial delays and more recently delays attributed to civil



- 10 -
strife in adjacent countries is now proceeding satisfactorily and is expected
to be completed in 1978. The Second Education Project (Loan 645-ZA) has been
satisfactorily completed as originally appraised. As a result of contribu-
tions of equipment by bilateral sources, a savings of $1.0 million from the
loan proceeds resulted and the Closing Date has been extended to 1978 to allow
the use of these savings for project related items. The Third Education
Project (Loan 900-ZA) is proceding satisfactorily.
Priorities for an Interim Investment Program
36.       Since Independence, the Government has placed emphasis on quantita-
tive expansion of the formal education system at all levels. The system has
now grown to such dimensions that it becomes necessary to consolidate and
strengthen administrative and support services in order to maintain high
quality instruction. Future reforms would also need the support of such
services. Furthermore, the implementation of the Government policies to
expand agricultural production and promote rural development requires urgent
improvements in farmer training and agricultural extension efforts. Finally,
the training for skills in business and commerce should be expanded to meet
the acute shortage of Zambian manpower in these fields. Therefore, the in-
terim investment program is designed:
(a) to provide Zambia with an adequate administrative structure
to consolidate the educational services;
(b) to assist rural development by improving farmer training
and the extension service; and
(c) to increase the supply of trained staff in the business and
commercial sectors of the Zambian economy.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The project was identified during a Bank economic mission which
visited Zambia in June 1975. A Government request for Bank assistance
was made in October 1975. Bank missions in November 1975 and March 1976
assisted the Government in preparing the project and appraised it. Nego-
tiations were held in Washington from November 15 to 19, 1976. The delega-
tion of the Government of Zambia was led by Mr. P.A. Siwo, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Education. A loan and project summary is provided as Annex III.
38.       The proposed project is designed to meet the objectives of the
interim investment program outlined above, consisting of: (a) improvement
of education administration, research and curriculum development through the
construction, furnishing and equipping of Phase II (para. 39) (Phase I is a



component of the Third Education Project) of the Education Services Center;
(b) expansion and improvement in business education through the provision
of additional boarding capacity and equipment for the Evelyn Hone College
of Applied Arts and Commerce and instructional equipment for commercial and
secretarial courses at five Trades Training Institutes; (c) improvement in
the training of agricultural staff and farmers through provisions for and/or
renovation of teaching and boarding facilities, utility services, staff hous-
ing, instructional equipment and transport in eight existing Farm Institutes
and 20 existing Farmer Training Centers; (d) technical assistance consisting
of 25 man-years of specialist services and 40 man-years of fellowships for
staff development at the Evelyn Hone College and 13 man-years of specialist
services and 8 man-years of fellowships in agricultural education and exten-
sion; and (e) completion and evaluation studies. The project would also
include a survey of the construction industry.
DETAILED FEATURES
39.       Education Services Center, Phase II.   The Ministry of Education
maintains a number of uncoordinated educational services facilities (e.g.,
curriculum development, student services and several examination service
sections) located all over Lusaka and in other provinces, generally housed
in temporary or sub-standard facilities. Phase T of the Center is being
carried out under the Third Education Project (Loan 900-ZA); it provides for
the first time aunifie administration and includes a Curriculum Unit, an
Audio-Visual Center, the Correspondence Course Ubit, the Zambia Library
Service, Orbit Magazine , Administrative Services and a Printing and Docu-
mentation unit. The proposed project would assist in Phase II and would add
an Examination Section including a Standards and Certification Division, a
Research, Evaluation and Guidance Section and an expansion of the Printing
and Documentation Unit. The Examination Section administers examinations for
all primary and secondary schools, Trade Training Institutes, Teacher Training
Institutes and post-secondary technical schools.
40.       Business Education.   The project would expand the supply of Zambian
business and accountancy manpower by: (a) increasing the boarding capacity
of the Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and Commerce by 250 places and
providing the college with required instructional equipment and furniture;
(b) assistance in the training of Zambian teachers for the college's business
and secretarial studies department; and (c) assisting in the establishing of
commercial and secretarial courses in five Trades Training Institutes through
the provision of instructional equipment.
41.       This college has a capacity of 1,200 student places, of which only
950 are filled due to limited boarding capacity (640 places) and the lack of
other housing facilities for students in Lusaka. The increase in boarding
places at the college would allow for an expansion in enrollments in the
business and accountancy studies departments. Since the teaching staff of
the Business Studies Department is still composed entirely of expatriates the
project includes a staff development scheme which Is to be updated in detail
by the Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training (Section
3.06 of the Draft Loan Agreement). Beneficiaries of the fellowship scheme
would be required to teach at least three years at the college.

42.       Trades Training Institutes located in the eight provinces have been
successful in the basic training of certain skilled manpower demanded by
Zambian industry inside the outside big business centers. Five institutes,
located in areas of growing demand for secretarial manpower have been chosen
for the introduction of commercial courses. With the provisions of the re-
quired instructional equipment, classes would start immediately. No problems
are anticipated in recruiting specialized teachers for these courses.
43.       Farm Institutes and Farmer Training Centers operated by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, Ministry of Rural Development. Residential farmer train-
ing is carried out in 27 centers, each of the eight provinces having 3-4 cen-
ters where short courses for farmers and farm women are offered and in eight
Farm Institutes, one in each province, where mainly in-service training for
extension staff is taking place. A recent study which was conducted under
the Third Education Project (Loan 900-ZA), revealed that while farmer training
and extension activities had some influence in improving agricultural produc-
tion, their overall impact has been minimal due to the following constraints:
(a) the instructors at the institutes and centers and the extension agents
and their assistants are inadequately trained; (b) the institutions do not
have transportation facilities necessary to bring in farmers 'and staff for
training; (c) provisions for water and electricity are inadequate; and (d)
someteaching facilities are substandard and essential instructional equip-
ment is lacking. As a result of these constraints these institutes and
centers have operated at only about 54% of their capacity. The proposed
project would assist in upgrading the quality of the agriculture staff and
farmer training programs by providing the necessary facilities, equipment,
thirteen man-years of specialists' services for an agricultural educator, an
extension educator, a rural home economics educator, and an audio-visual and
teaching aids specialist, and eight man-years of fellowhships for advanced
training in agricultural and home extension education and audio-visual and
teaching aids. Three institutes and seven centers are presently being
upgraded under the Third Education Project (Loan 900-ZA). The remaining
twenty centers and five institutes are expected to be improved under the
proposed project. The three previously assisted institutes would receive an
audio-visual workshop and additional equipment. These improvements would
allow the centers to train 13,400 additional farmers and farm women. The
Government confirmed that: (a) the four specialists would be appointed
within nine months of the date the Loan Agreement (Section 3.07 of the Draft
Loan Agreement); and (b) that with the help of the agricultural specialists,
a detailed plan satisfactory to the Bank, for the retrianing of the teach-
ing and extension staff and the improvement of the instructional and exten-
sion programs of the Department of Agriculture will be prepared and submitted
to the Bank within 18 months after the date of the Loan Agreement (Section
3.08 of the Draft Loan Agreement).
44.       Special Studies - The proposed project would include assistance to
carry out the following studies:
(i) Survey of the Construction Industry. The industry is
now dominated by firms owned by expatriates and little



- 13 -
is being done to promote the development of local Zambian
contractors. Due to the present uncertainties over
whether the Government intends to encourage or curtail
private initiative many eontractors are reluctant to
undertake additonal work; this has inflated prices. Aware
that such problems exist, the Government has requested
assistance to undertake a survey which would give guidance
on how to promote a viable industry. The survey would
review the industry as a whole. The terms of reference
of the survey have been prepared by the Government and
reviewed by the Bank. The cost of the survey is estimated
at US$250,000 equivalent.
(ii) Completion and Evaluation Studies. To facilitate the
evaluation of the proposed project after its completion,
funds would be provided under the proposed loan for con-
ducting evaluation studies of project components. The
completion and evaluation studies report would be submitted
to the Bank for review within three months after completion
of the project (Section 3.09 of the Draft Loan Agreement).
The terms of reference of these studies would be mutually
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank.
Project Cost and Financing
45.       The total project cost is estimated at $23.2 million equivalent
including taxes ($1.0 million equivalent), of which the foreign exchange
component is US$15.0 million, equivalent or 65 percent. The proposed loan
would cover $13.3 million of the foreign exchange costs, the balance of $1.7
million being provided by a grant from the Norwegian Agency for International
Development. The Government would provide most of the funds required (7.8
'million equivalent) to meet the local currency expenditures, the balance of
$0.4 million being provided by NORAD. Standardized building designs pre-
viously developed by the Buildings Branch of Ministry of Public Works and
consultant architects will be used where practicable. Emphasis will be given
to the maximum use of local materials and simplified building technology.
Base unit costs of US$270 per square meter on average for construction for
the Farm Institutes and Farm Training Centers is somewhat high due to, inter
alia, their remote locations and small size of work involved. This compares
with US$35o (October 1975) in Zaire and US$250 (September 1976) in Madagascar.
Project costs are summarized in Annex III.
Implementation of the Project
46.       The project would be implemented in about six years after loan
effectiveness. The Project Unit established in the Buildings Branch of the
Ministry of Public Works for the implementation of the Third Education Proj-
ect (Loan 900-ZA), would be responsible for the financial and administrative
control of the project, and for liaison with the Bank and various Ministries
and agencies. The Unit hitherto has functioned satisfactorily. Because of



- 14 -
increased workload it will be strengthened through the addition of a full-
time assistant project director to be provided by the Norwegian Agency for
International Development (NORAD). Any new appointments to the positions of
project director, assistant project director, architect, equipment specialist
and the accountant would be made in consultation with the Bank. The Borrower
will continue to maintain the unit and its staff (Section 3.02(b) of the Draft
Loan Agreement). Included in the project would be supplemental operational
expenses of the Project Unit. NORAD is to provide, on a grant basis, tech-
nical assistance consisting of about 18 man-years of specialists services for
the Project Unit and about 18 man-years of services of building construction
supervisors.
47.       Design and supervision of construction of all project institutions
would be carried out by consultant architects/engineers. Standardized
building designs and documents previously developed by the Buildings Branch
of the Ministry of Public Works and consultant architects would be utilized
to the maximum extent practicable. The consultants would be under the super-
vision of the Project Unit and would be employed within six months of the
date of the Loan Agreement (Section 3.02(a) of the Draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement
48.       Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Guidelines except as follows: (i) due to wide dispersion of the
rural construction sites, civil works contracts to cost less than US$250,000
equivalent (estimated at US$4.5 million in total); (ii) furniture, equipment
and vehicle contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent (estimated at
US$0.3 million in total); and (iii) locally-procured transportation services
for furniture and equipment (estimated at US$0.1 million in total). Con-
tracts for items (i) to (iii) are likely to have a total value of US$4.9
million, equivalent and would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding,
advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to
the Bank. Standardized sketch designs, draft tender documents and master
lists of furniture, equipment and vehicles, indicating proposed grouping for
tender, would be reviewed by the Bank. Items would be grouped to the extent
practicable to permit bulk procurement. Review of tender evaluation docu-
ments by the Bank prior to award would be required only for contracts above
US$250,000 equivalent for civil works and above US$50,000 equivalent for
equipment, furniture and vehicles. Qualified domestic manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be allowed a preference of 15% or the existing
rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing
foreign suppliers.
Disbursements
49.       Disbursement would be on the basis of:   (a) 100% of foreign expend-
itures for imported construction materials, furniture, equipment, including
vehicles and technical assistance; (b) 100% of ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured furniture and equipment; (c) 45% of total expenditures for civil

Loan No. 701-ZA     Kariba North Project:   US$82.1 million loan of July 29,
1970, as amended on August 16, 1974; Effective Date:
December 16, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The first 150-MW generating set (out of four) went into commercial
operation on May 1976 and the second in August. The third and fourth sets
are expected to be commissioned in December 1976 and March 1977 respectively.
The project is now in the last stage of construction and no serious problems
are anticipated; in spite of the seven month delay in completion, there is no
change in the cost estimate. The Central African Power Corporation is now
fully responsible for operation of the power station. The staffing position
has improved and an adequate number of experienced staff is available at site
to satisfactorily operate the generating sets as they are commissioned.
Loan No. 882-ZA      Integrated Family Farming Project:   US$11.5 million loan
of February 28, 1973; Effective Date: July 26, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Average tobacco and maize yields for the 1974/75 season were about
20% above appraisal estimates and so are the estimates for 1975/76. The
recruitment of farmers is about one year behind schedule. Scope exists
for quality improvements mainly through improving curing facilities. Improved
returns on tobacco are necessary to make this crop more competitive in regard
to maize. Cost savings are equally important and could be accomplished through
substituting costly mechanical land preparation through increased family labor
input and draft animal mechanization. The Revolving Fund for seasonal credit
has not been established, which is necessary to permit disbursement against
incremental credit requirements.
Loan 900-ZA          Third Education Project:  US$33.0 million loan of
June 6, 1973; Effective Date: August 9, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979
Project implementation is generally proceeding satisfactorily.
Initial delays resulting from belated appointments of certain key staff
are being overcome. Recruitment of technical assistance specialists in
health education is no longer a source of delay. Difficulty experienced in
obtaining contractors to construct numerous small facilities located in remote
areas have been overcome but at higher than anticipated costs and some delay.
The Borrower has decided to split the University into three separate campuses,
which may require modification of the Loan Agreement. The project is expected
to be completed by the original September 30, 1979 loan Closing Date.

Loan No. 919-ZA     Kafue Hydroelectric Project (Stage II):    US$115.0 mil-
lion loan of July 16, 1973; Effective Date: January 15,
1974; Closing'Date: December 31, 1979
Construction of the main dam is proceeding on schedule; 60 percent
of the rockfill has been placed and the storage target for this year has been
accomplished. Current expectations are that the project will be completed
on schedule and within the appraisal cost estimate. Over the past two years,
the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation has made considerable progress in
improving its financial management but its financial performance has not
been satisfactory. However, performance is expected to improve considerably
from FY77 with the implementation of a new financial framework for the sector
that has been substantially agreed to by all parties, including the Central
African Power Corporation. The one remaining issue to be settled is the
tariff for short-term Zambian electricity exports.
Loan No. 1057-ZA    Lusaka Squatter Upgrading and Site and Services Project:
US$20.0 million loan of December 6, 1974; Effective Date:
April 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project execution is now proceeding satisfactorily after initial
delays caused by postponement of loan signing and the Implementation Unit's
unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures. Upgrading of the first
major squatter settlement was completed in late 1976. Some site and services
plots should be ready for allocation later in 1977 with all of them being
serviced by late 1977. All squatter areas should be upgraded by mid-1978.
Loan No. 1131-ZA    Telecommunications Project:   US$32 million loan of
June 24, 1975; Effective Date: December 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Project procurement and execution is approximately one year behind
schedule but no major problems exist. An increase in telecommunication tar-
iffs has been approved by Government, delays in billing have been eliminated
and arrears substantially reduced. Implementation of the financial/manage-
ment consultants report is proceeding satisfactorily. Implementation of
the initial capitalization of the newly formed Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation, however, still remains to be completed.
Loan No. 1210-ZA    Development Bank of Zambia:   US$15.0 million loan of
February 18, 1976; Effective Date: April 23, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The loan became effective on April 23, 1976. It has been committed
to the extent of US$213,205. Two sub-projects involving US$1.8 million, which
are, above DBZ's free limit, are presently under review. In view of the
present economic recession and investment climate, commitment of the Bank
loan is likely to be slower than project at appraisal.

Loan No. 1322-ZA      Second Program Loan:  U$30.0 million loan of
September 17, 1976; Effective Date: October 6;
1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The loan became effective on October 6 and as of November 19, 1976
about $8.-0 had already been disbursed. A special unit in the Bank of Zambia
has been set up to process the loan, and a special project account established
in the Ministry of Finance to which the kwacha equivalent of the proceeds of
the loan are being credited. The working group studying ways to strengthen
the Ministry of Rural Development is expected to submit its recommendations
to the Government shortly.

Zambia Bata Shoe Company Ltd. - 216 ZA and 250 ZA - Shoes and Tannery
The company continues to perform well. Sales volume during 1975
decreased due to imports but this was offset by an increase in selling
prices which resulted in a net profit after tax for 1975 which was approxi-
mately the same as that of 1974 and slightly higher than projected in the
1973 Board Report.
Century Packages Ltd. - 307 ZA - Packaging Materials
Project construction is well underway. The project is expected to
be completed by the first quarter of 1977, compared to October 1976 estimated
in the 1975 Board Report. The revised project cost is estimated at K2.2 million
compared to K1.7 million estimated in the 1975 Board Report.
