PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Agricultural
Extension and Farm Management Training Project in Somalia, for which Credit
905-SO in the amount of US$10.5 million was approved in April 1979. The
credit was closed on December 4, 1987, two and a half years behind schedule
and about US$40,000 was cancelled. The last disbursement was on October
13, 1987.
A draft of the PCR was prepared by the Borrower and finalized by
the Agriculture Operations Division of the Africa Regional Office, Country
Department II. It is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Credit Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; and other project documents.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and comments received
from the Project Management are attached to the Report as Attachment I.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND FARM MANAGEMENT
TRAINING PROJECT
(CREDIT 905-SO)
EVALUATION SUH4MARY
Objectives (para. 12)
1.        The objectives of the project were to establish a solid basis
for the progressive build up of operational and efficient extension and
farm management services in Somalia. The emphasis was on training and
institution b.tilding.
Implementation Experience
2.        Overall project performance was good.  Delays in the procurement
of civil works and technical assistance resulted in a delay in the
completion of the project, but did not affect the attainment of project
objectives. The proiect succeeded in the establishment of extension
service on T&V lines, and the dissemination of extension recommendations to
farmers which they found beneficial. There were delays in actual
implementation of almost all the components. Substantial delays in civil
works procurement caused large cost overruns due to inflation. The
Government had to apply for supplementary funding from the African
Development Fund (AfDF). The actual execution of the civil works contract
also took longer than expected because of changes in specifications. In
the meantime, the FUA in which the AfDF loan was denominated depreciated
appreciably.   On account of the shortage of funds, some buildings could
not be completed (para. 29).
3.        The SAR envisaged establishment of extension services in three
regions (Lower Shebelli, Middle Shebelli and Bay), where natural conditions
are more favorable and supervision from headquarters is feasible. However,
the government expanded activities into other areas without prior
examination of the availability of trained manpower, technology and the
feasibility of effective supervision. A mid-term review was held in 1984
and a joint decision was made to scale back and focus on the three regions
(para. 21).
4.        The role of the Farm Management Advisory Service (FMAS) was
reduced during the project period as a result of the Government's new
policy of converting many of the unprofitable large state farms to
smallholder agriculture. The Government and Bank disagreed on how to use
the funds for this component. The Bank wanted to finance large farm
subsector studies, but the Government preferred to continue to finance the
Demonstration State Farm for extension to the larger private farmers. The
funds were finally used for two studies which the Government did not find
useful (para. 62).



V-
Results (paras. 57-61)
5.        The impact of all the components by and large was positive
except for the Farm Management component. The extension service based on
the Training and 'Jisit (T&V) model was operating down to the field level in
the three project regions. It extended to four other regions, but at a
higher ratio of farmers to extension agents.   A Monitoring and Evaluation
survey indicated a large difference in rates of adoption between contact
and non-contact farmers of four key management practices on maize and
sorghum, giving rise to yield increases. The success can be attributed to
the effectiveness of the extension service and also Government's policy
action to provide adequate producer incentives.   The extension service has
thus made a significant contribution to irrigated agricultural production
in the Lower and Middle Shebelli Regions and to a lesser extent to rainfed
production in the Bay Region. In the rainfed areas, extension agents were
constrained by the lack of extension messages.
Sustainability
6.          The basic physical and institutional infrastructure for an
extension service has been established in this project. The follow on
project, Agricultural Extension II (Cr. 1794) aims to strengthen the
extension system in eight regions and agricultural research. It would
finance the operating costs of the system on a declining basis so that by
the end of the project, the Government would be operating the service with
its own budget.
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.        The main lessons learned are:
(a) Implementation of a full-fledged e tension project
covering the entire country was beyond the capacity of
Somalia's administrative system, as the lead time
required for an extension system to take root is long.
Consolidation of the system in the area covered is
needed before the system can be expanded;
(b) When many donors finance an extension project, it
is necessary to arrive at a prior understanding
regarding the extension methodology to be followed;
(c) The research base was weak, with little to
recommend to farmers, particularly in rainfed areas.
The proiect included a research strategy study but
should have included an adaptive research component
and clear linkages should have been established with
projects with adaptive research components;
(d) It is essential in an extension project to make
adequate provisions for vehicle maintenance to avoid
constraints on field staff mobility.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Agricultural Sector
1.        Agriculture, including livestock and f sheries, is the key
sector in the econnmy of Somalia, on which around 80X of the population
lives. Three important farming systems exist in Somalia: rainfed
agriculture, irrigated agriculture and livestock production.
2.        Agriculture in the country is largely rainfed; however, rainfall
is not only low but erratic in nature, resulting in failure of crops two
out nf five years. An average family will cultivate about 5 ha growing
sorghum as a main crop together with pulses, maize, millet and groundnut.
Yields are low and post harvest losses are heavy.  The Shebelli and Juba
rivers, which provide controlled irrigation to a limited area of 50,OCO ha,
flow through the southern part of the country. The Shebelli flows for
about 7 months a year while the Juba is perennial. In the irrigated areas
which are mainly large sized state farms, the most significant crop is
banana, but maize, rice and sugarcane are also grown. In areas under flood
irrigation, crops may suffer either due to water excesses or shortages. It
is estimated that about 110,000 ha of land in Somalia are farmed under
flood irrigation, producing sorghum, maize, sesame and groundnut. In
general, inputs used are restricted to seed, family labor and hand hoe
(Yambo). Crop production suffers from unsatisfactory land preparation, low
quality seeds, inadequate seeding rates, uneven plant coverage and
inefficient weed control. Little use is Lnade of animal traction and
livestock has not been integrated into the farming system.
B. Major Constraints to Production
3.        The severe drought of 1973-75 disrupted the economy.  Since
then, the Government has given high priority to agriculture in order to
achieve self-sufficiency. The means for achieving this were mainly through
the accelerated development of state farms and cooperatives and
intensification of government services to farmers. However, the lack of
trained manpower at all levels impeded Government efforts.
4.        The large scale production units, namely state and cooperative
farms, were managed by government officials but they lacked technical
background and managerial skills. Also, there were limited and poorly
qualified staff available for extension work at the regional and district



- 2 -
levels. They possessed eight years of schooling and their only
agricultural training consisted of short in-service training courses.
Headquarters staff and regional coordinators were a mixture of university
and secondary school graduates. There was no effective field service
beyond the district level.
5.        Consequently, inadequate technical guidance was provided to
large a-- mall farms, farming cooperatives, settlement farmers, crash
progr. -armers, as well as state run seed farms. In addition, the
reseprch base was poor and linkages between research and extension wer.e
weak. Infrastructural facilities were inadequate for distributing inputs
to rarmers, such as fertilizer, improved seeds, pesticides and credit.
6.        Thus, agricultuzal development in Somalia is constrained by a
number of factors, including unfavorable climate, inefficient allocation of
financial resources, unfavorable pricing policy, lack of trained technical
and managerial personnel, weak extension services, inadequate and untimely
availability of credit, and insufficient research and technological base.
C. Historical Background of the Project
7.        As a result of the increased emphasis on self-sufficiency in
food, the State Planning Commission rer1uested the Livestock II and
Settlement II identification missions to consider the po^sibility of a
project covering agricultural research, training and extension. This
request, made in November 1976, was also supported by the Ministry of
Agriculture. The proposal called for the incorporation of a training and
extension component in the proposed Settlement II project.
8.        Subsequently the Settlement II proposal was abandoned because of
the high project costs. Nevertheless, steps to prepare the extension and
training component had already been taken; it was therefore proposed that
the component be placed in another agricultural development project. Later
the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture suggested the
inclusion of a large farm management training program since the lack of
management expertise was identified as being the major constraint in the
large farm sub-sector and probab.v the most serious overall constraint to
agricultural production in Somalia. At the time. the Government was keen
on improving state farm production since they were all located in thie
irrigated areas.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
9.        Project preparation started in November 1976 with assistance
from the Bank's Regional Mission in Eastern Africa (RMEA). A pre-appraisal
mission took place in December, 1977 and appraisal was carried out in
January, 1978.   Negotiations with IDA were held in Washingtor. from March
15-23, 1979. The appraisal mission had advised the Government of Somalia
of the fI'nancing gap for the project. USAID, the African Development Fund
(AfDF) and EEC showed interest in the program. Based on the project
document prepared by the World Bank, AfDF and USAID conducted their own
appraisals.



-3-
10.       IDA approved the project on May 14, 1979 and signed the Credit
agreement was signed on October 24, 1979 while the AfDF Board approved the
project on December 9, 1978 and signed the loan agreement in May 1979. The
USAID cleared the project in May 1979 and signed the agreement in August
1979.   Since the World Bank was the Administrator of the Special Action
Account established with funds contributed by the member states of EEC, the

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Obiectives
12.       The Project was designed to provide technical assistance,
strengthen the Extension Service, develop a national research strategy and
establish a Farm Management Advisory Service in order to bring the
essential knowledge to the farm level. The Project also provided for the
training of staff who were expected to identify farmers' needs and to
communicate them to those who made production decisions. The aim of this
Project was to establish a basis for the progressive build up of
operational and efficient extension and farm management serv4ces in
Somalia. The emphasis was on training and institution building.
B. General Project Description
13.       According to the SAR (Report No. 2170a-SO), the project would,
over a period of 5 years, provide technical assistance and physical inputs
to strengthen the extension service and make it operational at the field
level. The project would also establish a Farm Management Advisory Service
to assist large scale producers ar.d develop a farm management capability to



-4-
run state and cooperative farms efficiently. Specifically, the project
would provide for:
(a) The establishment of a Farm Management and Extension Training
Center (FMETC) at Afgoi to provide practical pre-service
training for farm managers, assistant managers and for regional
and district level extension staff.  Thus FMETC's purpose was to
train professional staff as well as to organize special training
for subject matter specialists and field managers. Facilities
of the FMETC included: a 60 ha training farm, staff housing, a
library, classrooms, a dormitory, a workshop and other
facilities needed for training, as well as transport.
(b) The strengthening of the National Extension Service (NES)
through the introduction of the T&V extension methodology and
provision of training to extension personnel. The project
provided for the conversion of two Farmers' Training Centers, at
Bonka and Jannale, into Extension Training Centers (ETCs).
Project items included the construction of staff housing,
offices and other facilities, transport and incremental
operating costs.
(c) The establishment of a Farm Management Advisory Service (FMAS)
to provide field support to farm managers and advise Government
on large scale farming and related issues. This included the
rehabilitation of a 400 ha state farm at Jannale into a
Demonstration State Farm (DSF), and strengthening the
management of the two other state farms in the vicinity of
Jannale which, along with the DSF, would be used by FMETC
students during field internships. The project provided for
the construction of staff housing, offices, a workshop, storage
facilities and transport and operating costs for three years for
the DSF, and for five years for the other activities of the
FMAS.
(d) Operations of a Project Management Unit. The project provided
for the construction of staff housing and office space,
transport and operating expenditures for five years.
(e) Strengthening the Agricultural Secondary School at Afgoi through
the provision of teachers and training equipment.
(f) Establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation unit to assess the
progress of project implementation and the extent to which the
objectives were realized.
(g) Overseas training covered: (i) post-graduate training abroad
for 38 faculty graduates; (ii) three to six week trips abroad
for senior Ministry of Agriculture personnel (9 man months);
(iii) study trips of at least 3 months duration for senior
extension and farm management field technical staff (21 man
months); and (iv) about 2 month study trips for district
extension officers (192 man months).



(h) Developing a master plan for strengthening the national research
system and its links with extension.
(i) Strengthening the Central Statistics Department in the State
Planning Commission and setting the stage for a National
Statistics Development Program.
14.       In brief, the extension project was required to disseminate and
generate useable technology and to teach management skills to help small
farmers with limited crop production resources.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Start-up
15.       The project was declared effective from August 29, 1980 upon
fulfilling the various conditions provided by IDA for effectiveness. Thus,
there was a time lag of more than a year between the date of effectiveness
assumed in the SAR (July 1979) and the actual date (August 29, 1980) of
commencement of the project. The delay occurred on account of the
following:
Mi)       Although the Financial Controller and the Project Director
(General Manager) were on board in September 1979, the Project Technical
Manager was identified and approved for the position only in July 1980.
(ii)      The appointment of a procurement agency to assist the
project management in drawing up specifications, preparing tender documents
etc. was finalized in July 1980.
B. Revisions During Implementation
16.       With the start-up of project activities and on receipt of
contract bids for the civil works, buildings and land development of FMETC
and the Demonstration Farm (DSF), as well as machinery and equipment for
the DSF, it became clear that there would be cost overruns in the AfDF
funded components. This issue was discussed in the cofinanciers' meeting
held in June 1981 and the Government emphasized the need for additional
funds to complete them. An official request was made to the AfDF. When
information on the financing gap became available as a result of final
negotiations with the contracting parties, AfDF sent a Re-appraisal Mission
in July 1982 and submitted a report to the AfDF Bank Management on November
17, 1982. The supplementary loan was approved in March 1983.
17.       Originally the AfDF had provided 8.0 million FUA (equivalent to
US$8.88 million) to finance civil works, buildings, land development and
machinery and equipment, but as a result of the re-appraisal, their
contribution increased to 11.2 million FUA (equivalent to US$12.2 million).
As a result of currency exchange fluctuations, the amount later came down
to about US$11.0 million equivalent.



- 6 -
18.       The cost overruns in the above items were mainly on account of
substantial increases in the cost of civil works. Secondly, in the
original project proposals, there was no provision for the cost of civil
works supervision which was later added during re-appraisal.
19.        USAID funded technical assistance (13 experts) for the NES and
the FMETC. and overseas MS degree studies.   During the course of
implementation, USAID and GOS agreed to the revisions in the IDA supported
components in January 1984 (see para. 21), reducing the number of
expatriate experts from 13 to six, with a proviso that after the incumbent
experts in Livestock and Entomology completed their contracted term, the
positions will be phased out. Thus, there remained effectively 4 positions
namely, Agricultural Extension Specialist, Agronomist, Farming System
Economist and Agriculture Engineer to support NES activities. Another
important modification was the inclusion of 'Applied Research" in NES
activities. The roles of the expatriates, therefore, changed to training
of field staff and generation of technology through organizing adaptive
trials and testing and verification of technology under farmers' own
conditions. The supervision of field extension activities was thus taken
out from their terms of reference and in its place USAID insisted that a
position of Assistant General Manager be provided in the NES to carry out
regular supervision work.   GOS agreed and the position of Assistant
General Manager in charge of NES/FMETC was provided from 1984. This change
was on the whole beneficial to the project. The USAID team was
particularly strong in planning and implementation of field trials and
training of staff but weak on field extension. Thus, the roles of the
USAID team and the Technical Manager team became complementary to each
other.
20.       Within the USAID supported components, the allocation for
training by short term consultants was increased from the original
provision of US$7.8 million to US$8.5 million.
21.       The SAR envisaged establishment of extension services in three
regions (Lower Shebelli, Middle Shebelli and Bay), where natural conditions
are more favorable and supervision from headquarters is feasible. However,
the Government in its eagerness to extend project coverage, expanded
activities into other areas without prior examination of the availability
of trained manpower, technology and the feasibility of effective
supervision.   At the time of the mid-term review in 1984, a joint decision
was made to concentrate efforts on the three regions. Extension activities
in the northwest were transferred to the Northwest Region Agricultural
Development Project (Cr.1538-SO). so that supervision can be carried out
more effectively from Hargeisa.
C. Implementation Schedule
22.       Overall, there were delays at the preparation stages which in
turn resulted in substantial delays in implementing the main physical
components like civil works, procurement of machinery and equipment and
appointment of technical assistance staff.



23.       The project item responsible for substantial delays was civil
works, due to the following reasons:
(i)       Excessive time for preparation of tender documents
(ii)      Cost overruns
(iii)     Need to arrange for a supplementary loan from AfDF to
cover the cost overrun
(iv)      Delays in actual execution due to specification changes and
others
Instead of six months, preparation of tender documents took about 20
months. The architects were first requested to examine the suitability of
prefabricated structures in order to save time and then prepare the tender
documents. Tender documents were prepared both for the development of
farms (Demonstration State Farm, Jannale and Training Farm at Afgoi)
requiring surveys, and buildings for which designs had to be prepared. The
time lapse between the preparation of cost estimates in the SAR and the
time when tenders were finally issued (about 4 years) resulted in cost
overruns due to inflation. After the cost overruns were discovered, it
took another year for the AfDF to re-appraise and approve the supplementary
loan, which was signed in March 1983. Likewise, the actual execution of
the civil works took about 2 years and 6 months against the SAR
anticipation of 2 years. The additional time was partly due to the changes
in specifications from prefabricated to conventional houses, for which the
project had to obtain the clearance of the AfDF. The total delay in the
completion of civil works was 3 and a half years.
24.       Delays and cost overrun in civil works could have been avoided
if the project had a PPF to finance the employment of consultants and
preparation of designs and tender documents. In the absence of advance
funds, no preparation could be done until the project became effective.
D. Reporting
25.       The project fulfilled all the reporting requirements of all the
donor agencies.   At the beginning, the project was supplying monthly
reports to all donors, and this practice continued till 1982. Subsequently
on the suggestion of the World Bank Review Missions, the reporting period
was changed to six months.   Therefore, since 1982 the project has been
preparing and supplying to all concerned six monthly reports on project
performance.
26.       A mission of the AfDF in July 1987, however, drew the attention
of the project to the AfDF requirement for quarterly reports, although
there was no mention of it by AfDF staff at headquarters or on supervision
missions. This requirement will be complied with in future projects.



- 8 -
E. Procurement
27.       The procurement procedures of IDA and AfDF are similar except
for minor differences. The project did not encounter any difficulty in
complying with the procedures.
28.       The entire civil works component was financed by AfDF and the
contracts, except for construction of houses for Field Extension Agents,
were awarded after issuance of ICB. Contracts for the construction of
houses for FEAs were awarded through local competitive bidding. An Italian
contractor, with the help of a local sub-contractor, executed all the major
jobs including development of the DFS at Jannale and the ETC Farm at Afgoi,
construction of offices, houses, sheds and others at Afgoi and provision of
services such as electricity, water supply and roads at headquarters. All
the furniture and equipment financed by IDA were also supplied by them.
29.       In actual execution, certain additional works had to be done at
the DFS and specifications were changed from pre-fabricated to conventional
in respect of the buildings at the Afgoi headquarters. Due to the drastic
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the FUA in which the AfDF loan was
denominated, depreciated appreciably. On account of the shortage of funds,
the contractor could not complete the buildings at Jannale nor start any
construction at Bonka.
F. Costs (Annex I)
30.       There were successive devaluations in the value of the So.Sh.
vis-a-vis the US$ over the project period as shown below:

NOTE:     For the purposes of comparison, the Supplementary Loan of AfDF
and the increased amount of Grant by USAID have been converted
at the rate of exchange of the original estimates viz. US$1 =
So.Sh. 6.30. Variance of So.Sh. figures between SAR and Actuals
are due to successive devaluations.
32.       The actual costs, particularly of items financed by IDA and EEC
are accurate as these figures were constantly tallied with regular monthly
statements of disbursements receiveA from IDA/EEC.   Furthermore, actual
disbursements from all sources are based on audited figures up to 1985 and
from Project Account records for subsequent periods. As such, there was
fairly accurate recording of costs, though efforts had to be made by
project staff and the Auditors to have the costs updated in respect of
actual disbursements for the AfDF and USAID financed components.
33.       Cost underruns caused by devaluations of the local currency were
offset by overruns for civil works (see para. 23), delays in procurement
and the increase in operating costs and staff engaged. Total actual costs

G. Disbursements And Financial Sources
34.       Tables 1 and 2 given above contain information on disbursements
by donor and category. Except for a small amount of IDA funds (US$40,515),
all other loans/credits were fully disbursed. The rate of disbursements,
almost by all donors, were slower than SAR estimates. This is largely due
to delays in implement'-ion of civil works and currency fluctuations.
35.       The original loan of AfDF and the subsequent supplementary loan
were designated in FUA. At the time of appraisal, the value of the FUA was
equivalent to US$1.11. At the time of the supplementary loan, it dropped
to US$1.01 and subsequently to US$0.09. As such, the actual disbursements
in terms of US$ worked out to be about US$1 million lower than the
appraisal/re-appraisal expectations.
36.       USAID managed their own grants and assumed responsibility for
cost variations.
37.       GOS counterpart funds were made available to the project fairly
regularly. GOS also contributed in equivalent local currency towards the
overrun in civil works costs in accordance with the supplementary loan
agreement with AfDF. GOS contribution therefore amounted to US$4.4 million
equivalent, 13 percent more than appraisal estimates.
H. Performance of Consultants and Suppliers
38.       Foreign consultants played a positive role in program planning,
establishment of an extension system, training of field staff, generation
of technology, and introducing a well structured management and financial
system in the project. Overall, a process of human resource development
has been started which would benefit not only the project but the country
as a whole.
39.       Technical assistance included the provision of a Project
Technical Manager and a Financial Controller for the Project Management
Unit (PMH), subject matter specialists/consultants for the National
Extension Service and Farm Management Training Center and a Farm Economist
and Farm Management Specialist for the FMAS and DSF. The size of the
technical assistance was, however, revised keeping in view the needs of the
project and summarized below:

…-----------------------------------------------------------------------_
40.       The consultants were employed largely for organizing specific
skill related training. On IDA's recommendation, the Farm Economist and
Farm Management specialist in the FMAS conducted large farm sub-sector
studies.
41.       The project engaged a consulting firm to carry out procurement.
It handled the ICBs for land development (DSF and Afgoi farms), civil
works, miscellaneous services, furniture, vehicles and equipment. Another
firm was hired as supervision engineers. Their contract came to an end
much before the completion of the buildings and could not be renewed for
want of funds. Further supervision had to be carried on by the project
civil engineer.
42.       The overall designing and siting of the offices, houses, etc.
left much to be desired. Compared to some of the office and residential
buildings of other projects in Somalia built around the same time, the
quality of workmanship, and perhaps of specifications, are wanting in many
respects. The project also had to contend with the change of
specifications midway - from prefabricated to traditional construction -
and financial constraints caused by exchange fluctuations. Because of the
lack of funds, certain buildings at Jannale could not be completed and none
could be constructed at Baidoa (see para. 29).
43.       The contract for vehicles and agricultural machinery was awarded
to a company that went bankrupt before supplying the tipper truck and
spares for all the vehicles and agricultural machinery. The vehicles and
agricultural machinery delivered were of standard makes and at competitive
prices.
V. OPERATING PERFORMANCE - OVERALL ASSESSMENT
44.       Overall project performance was good.  Despite many constraints
the project achieved most of the targets envisaged in the SAR. Almost all
the civil works planned at project headquarters were completed. Although
not envisaged in the SAR, regional offices were set up in all the regions,
including the Northwest, in renovated buildings taken over from other
government agencies. About 150 D type houses were completed (to temporary
specifications) to take care of office cum residential requirements of
FEAs. A complete organization structure, both at headquarters and in the
regions were set up for technical and administrative functions.   The
demonstration farms at Jannale (330 ha) for mechanized cultivation and at
Afgoi (60 ha) for training purposes were developed. Agricultural
machinery, laboratory and other equipment were procured in line with SAR
estimates. The project succeeded in creating the necessary infrastructure
for an extension service.

45.       There were some delays in actual implementation of almost all
the components. Part of the delays can be attributed to the unrealistic
time frame assumed in the SAR, teething problems faced by the project in
its initial stages and the complexity of different donor procedures.
46.       Even though there was no agreement among donors on the extension
methodology to be followed until the mid-term review of the project, there
was cooperation among them when it came to a question of assisting the PMH
in implementing the project. USAID contributed additional financial
assistance by providing local funds for rentals of offices and housing for
technical assistance personnel and a portion of operating costs, which
enabled the project to go ahead with the planned activities despite the
delays in construction works. IDA, who also administered the EEC credit,
assisted in identifying technical assistance personnel including
expatriate members of the PMH and by carrying out regular supervision
missions which came up with useful suggestions. AfDF approved a
supplementary loan to ensure adequate funding for civil works.
47.       Development of land, construction of buildings, procurement of
agricultural machinery, vehicles and equipment were in accordance with the
SAR, except that the civil works program could not be completed in Lower
Shebelli and Bay Region for want of funds. As pointed out earlier, the
attainment of project objectives was not affected by these delays or the
pruning of a portion of the civil works program.
48.       Some important factors which could have improved the project
impact are:
(i)       Provision of PPF to enable an early start-up of the
project;
(ii)      More attention to research.  After a stage, the project did
not have sufficient recommendations to propagate
particularly in rainfed areas which are much higher in
proportion compared to irrigated areas;
(iii)     Assumption of more realistic baseline costs for civil works
and a workable time schedule.
These have been addressed in the Second AgriLaltural Extension Project
(Cr. 1794-SO).
VI. FINANCIAL PERi;'ORMPNCE
A. Economic Analysis
49.       The economic rate of return for NES was estimated to be in the
range of 13 to 272 and for FMAS to be in the range of 30 to 392 in the SAR.
However, because data are not available on the number of project farmers,
by category of farmer per year and the incremental production of those
farmers each year, it has not been possible to re-calculate the ERR.



-  13  -
Furthermore, since the FMAS component was drastically reduced to reflect
the change in government policy towards the la;ge farm subsector midway
through the project, calculation of an ERR for FMAS is no longer relevant
(see para. 62).
50.       Some rough estimates have been made on the incremental
production in the project area. A study carried out by a monitoring and
evaluation expert showed that the project possibly exceeded the incremental
production targets of the SAR. However, this increase should be partly
attributed to the Government's liberalization of grain pricing and
marketing around 1983. The new policy provided incentives to farmers, and
maize production nationwide almost doubled between 1982 and 1985.
B. Financial Covenants
51.       Major financial covenants in the Credit Agreement were:
(i)       Contribution of So.Sh 3 million by the GOS towards a revolving
fund to be increased to So.Sh 5 million by the end of the first
year.
As soon as the project became effective, the GOS contributed the entire
amount of So.Sh 5 million and maintained the same till the end of the
project. However, the amount became insufficient to meet the needs of the
project after successive devaluations. GOS deposited an additional
So.Sh 25 million, without which it would not have been possible to continue
with the project activities. In future, to safeguard against unstable
local currencies, Government's contr.bution to the revolving fund should be
specified in SDR or US$ but kept in equivalent local currency.
(ii)      Separate accounts would be kept reflecting the expenditures
financed by the cofinanciers. Project accounts would be audited
by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA and audited accounts
would be submitted within six months of the end of each
financial year.
Due to the delay in the appointment of auditors, the first audit covered
accounts up to the end of 1981. Thereafter, there were regular audits till
1985. However, audits for 1986 and 1987 were late as Government objected
to the previous auditor and there was a delay in appointing a new one.
VII. MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
52.       The performance of all the components by and large has been
positive except the Farm Management component which was cut back due to
government policy changes (see para. 62).
53.       The extension service based on the T & V model was operating
down to the field level with the lowest farmer to extension agent ratio in
Lower Shebelli, followed by Middle Shebelli and Bay regions and higher
ratios in Hiran, Gedo, Bakol and Juba. A system of periodic on-the-job
training of field agents operated satisfactorily, although there were



- 14 -
limited new extension messages for dissemination. This gap would be
bridged in future projects as new information becomes available through
adaptive trials and testing and verification of technology over a period of
time and revamping of farm research. It is nonetheless recognized that the
project succeeded in establishing various institutions and making them
operational. At the time of project closing, the extension service was
providing extension service to 150,000 settled farm families in the project
area and 20,000 refugee families. There were 185 FEAs supported by 26
DEOs, 10 SMSs and 8 REOs in the field.
A. Building Professional Capabilities of
Extension Functionaries
54.      The project training program made significant impact on
strengthening professional capability and is summarized below:

55.       Of the participants sponsored for the long term training abroad,
33 had already returned and only one was still studying in the U.S. as of
project closing. There were 5 dropouts. The higher education covered
agricultural extension, agricultural education, farm management and
agricultural economics, finance and accounts. agronomy, agricultural
engineering, communication and livestock development. These were important
specialities that the country lacked.
56.       On-farm training was an integral part of the extension system
and was carried out each month for primary field workers and their
immediate supervisors; they were exposed to field problems and assisted in
finding solutions. Thus, each month more than 200 extension workers
received skill related training and, in turn, advised their group of target
farmers.
B. Extension Impact
57.       The extension service accomplished: (i) timely advisory service
through d'ssemination of improved technology applicable under farmers' own
conditions, (ii) skill teaching in the field, keeping in view the resources
available to farmers, (iii) generation of technology which is suitable and
involves minimum risk to the small farmers, and (iv) refining of the
extension messages with emphasis on their economic viability in the field.
It also adopted group dynamics, besides scheduled visits to individual
farmers. The group approach included holding of group meetings on a
regular basis: using fields of contact and other progressive farmers as
demonstration for those who were still following conventional methods of
crop production and organizing farmers field days during the cropping
season. This approach benefitted more farmers in the project area and the
pace of technology dissemination quickened.
58.         Based on the cropping survey conducted by the Monitoring and
Evaluation unit of the project, the rate of adopticn in maize and sorghum
crops during 1988 Gu season is shown in the following table. These
adoption rates were possible due to two reasons: the extension service was
effective and adequate producer incentives provided by the Government
encouraged farmers to adopt proven extension recommendations.

59.       The increased adoption of recommended practices made a
significant impact on the yields of maize and sorghum crops as shown in the
table below:

60.       In the area of technology generation the project has since 1984
initiated a number of steps on a limited scale, including:
(i)      Acquisition of technology from local research stations and
from outside institutions.
(ii)     Layout of adaptive trials on project farms.
(iii)    Testing and verification on farmers' fields before
formulating extension messages.
(iv)     Validatirng the recommendations and refining the messages
jointly with research from year to year.
61.       The above efforts generated useful technology on plant
population in maize, row planting, weeding, control of stalk borers and
inter-cropping in rainfed areas.   A base for technological development has
started but requires strengthening in follow-on projects.



-17 -
C. Farm Management Advisory Service
62.       At the time of appraisal, an important large farm subsector
existed in the country. To provide extension to large farms, the project
included a component that established the Demonstration State Farm and the
Farm Management Advisory Service. However, in the early 1980s, the
Government changed its policy and gradually converted the large state farms
to smallholder agriculture.  The component therefore became redundant.  IDA
recommended the suspensior of financing for DSF operating costs starting in
1984 and urged the Gover'tent to privatize or lease it out. IDA also
recommended that funds be used to carry out studies on the large farm
subsector. The Government disagreed with these recommendations and
emphasized that the DSF, which by that time was fully operational, was
important to demonstrating machinery operation to the larger private
farmers.   In the face of donor reservations about this subsector, funding
for DFS stopped in 1984, and the FMAS was disbanded. The studies were
completed, but the Government did not find them useful since the policy of
reducing the role of large farms was already under implementation.
D. DONOR PERFORMANCE
63.       The overall performance of all the donors has been satisfactory
and has contributed towards achieving the goals and objectives of the
project. Separate periodic supervision missions from the respective donors
provided stimulus to the project implementation, but the executing agency
felt that it could have benefitted more if there had been joint missions
from time to time. Many of the coordination problems would have been
resolved expeditiously. The different views of the donors on extension
methodology in the early stages of the project also complicated the project
and confused project management (para. 46).
VIII. LESSONS LEARNED
64.       The main lessons learned are:
(a) Implementation of a full-fledged extension project
covering the entire country was beyond the capacity of
Somalia's administrative system, as the lead time
required for an extension system to take root is long.
Consolidation of the system in the area covered is
needed before the system can be expanded;
(b) When many donors finance an extension project, it
is necessary to arrive at a prior understanding
regarding the extension methodology to be followed;
(c) The research base was weak, with little to recommend to
farmers, particularly in rainfed areas. The project
included a research strategy study but should have
included an adaptive research component and clear



- 18 -
linkages should have been established with projects
with adaptive research components;
(d) It is essential in an extension project to make
adequate prorisions for vehicle maintenance to avoid
constraints on field staf' mobility.
