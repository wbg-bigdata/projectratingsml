APPRAISAL OF THE MASKELIYtk OYA STAGE TI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT AND

._TM9AR LTE AD r0C. T1TSTSW
i±        This report oers the appn4sal of a pr^uct     nsistingr of a 90 Mnv
hydroelectric power station, the second of a three-stage development of the
Maskeliya Oya, a 25 MW gas turbie unit to provi-de therr'a  _=u  to the
power system and the services of accounting and management consultants. A

BLk loan oWLI1AL U$ J  L..illAon equ i-Vlent is p.-oposed.
4i. vhe Baru.. has m,adue three pre-vious po-wer -loans to theli GovPes,nment OI'
Ceylon (in 1954, 1958 and 1961) totalling US$37.3 million. The projects which
thl.ese Loarns helpeu toi fir,iance are oper-atl[g satisfac ei-ly.
iffi.     The Borrower would be the Ceylon KLectricity Boaru (CEB), a statuto--j
authority established pursuant to the Ceylon Electricity Board Act, No. 17 of
1969. ITe newly created Board would be a separate administrative entity to
which the present Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (DGEU) wi:,.
be transferred. DG-'s low tariffs reflect the absence in the past of a
policy to provide revenues adequate to finance a reasonable portion of the
cost of capital works. 'This policy is now incorporated in the new Act.
Since continuation of the low tariffs would place the Board in a weak financial
position and produce an unsatisfactory financing plan during the project
construction period 1970 through 1973, the Govemment has approved an increase
in its electricity tariffs by about 170% which will be implemented from July
1, 1969.
iv.       In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the seven members of
the new Board are to be appointed on July 15, 1969. This action will enable
the Board to sign the loan agreement. However, as a condition of effective-
ness of the loan the Government agreed that the legal transfer of property,
rights, obligations and liabilities relating to the DGEUJ mould be effected b-y
means of the required Ministerial order published in the Government Gazette.
v.        As a revenue earning undertaking DGEU has not been organized satis-
factorily for commercial operation. Further, its accounting system geared to
meeting Treasury requirements for national budgetary purposes, was not appro-
priate for the modern commercial operation of a public utility. Notwithstand-
ing the organizational improvements expected upon the creation of the Board
and the financial policies provided by the Act, particularly relating to the
application of revenues, the Board will appoint consultants to help establish
its new organization, reorganize the accounting and financial functions and
revalue its net plant so as to provide a sound basis for efficient management
of a public utility. The consultants' services would be financed out of the
loan.



- ii -
vi.       DGEU consumers' unpaid bills for electricity supplied as of Sep-
te=,ber 30, 17Q8 represented the equivalent of1 over six months billings. This
large sum was exceptional and was caused by delays arising during the process
of chaugiug over tuo a new Dilimng system; by a breaKaown of one oI- the machines
during this period, and by DGEU's own inability to enforce collections from
local authorities. The new Act provides collectilon procedures which will
enable the Board to enforce prompter payment from local authorities in the
future. During negotiations it was agreed that as conditions of effectiveness
of the loan, bills for electricity supplied by the Borrower or its predecessor
would be sent to consumers within 45 days of meter readings, and that bills
rendered for electricity supplied to local authorities on or before February
15, 1969 and unpaid as of June 10, 1969 would be further reduced by a sum of
not less than Rs 8 million. It was also agreed that by September 30, 1970 all
amounts due to the Borrower in respect of electricity supplied, other than
amounts disputed pursuant to Section 55 of the Act would not exceed the
equivalent of the aggregate amount of the three months billings immediately
preceding September 30, 1970.
vii.      The cost of the project amounts to US$31.5 million equivalent and
the proposed Bank Loan to finance the foreign exchange costs amounts to
US$21.0 million equivalent including interest during construction. Cost
estimates, prepared by the consultants, are based on similar work recently
carried out on the Stage I developcment of the IHaskeliya Oya. The appoint-
ment of consultants to supervise the construction of the project would be
a condition of effectiveness. Contracts for major civil works,equipment and
materials would be awarded on the basis of intermational competitive bidding.
The project is expected to be in full operation towards the And of 1972.
viii.     The Drolect wouild be the least cost nlternative to meet Ceylon's
growing demand for power.  At the prevailing rate of exchange (US$1.00
Rs 5.95) and with the present cost of fuel (about _8.00 per ton, exclusive of
duty) the incremental rate of return would be about 24%. At a rate of exchange
of USi -Oon = RS 923     the incremental rate of return would fall to 18%.   a
substantial reduction in fuel prices would produce only a marginal increase
in t.hese returns.
ix.       The project wol d be suitable for a B'ank loan of US$21.0 million
equivalent, for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
1/ This rate of exchange would be equivalent to the Foreign Exchange
En.titlemt-ent Certificate (rEEC) rate used to reduce excess demand
for imports, by a de facto devaluation covering a selected group of
imports.

APPRAISAL OF THE MASKELIYA OYA STAGE II HYDROELECrRIC PROJECT AND
cPHER GENERATDNG FACILTPES
1.  INTRCDUCT ION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of a 90 IDS
hydroelectric project on the Naskeliya Oya; thermal backup in the form of a
25 MW gas turbine unit to be installed as an extension of the existing 50 111
'Grandpass theinall stvat-ion in Col10M,vbo; ar.d who se&rV-_iceS of accol-irti.." nnd
management consultants.  The hlydroelectric project, which would be the second
of a three-stage development of the I1askeliya Oya, is expected to be in
commission towards the end of 1972.
1.02      The Government of Ceylon has requested a loan from the Bank to
finance the foreign exchar-nge cost anountilng to US $21c0 million equivalent,
including interest during construction. The Project's total cost is estimateI
to be US$31.5 million, which includes the cost of engileering and accounting
consultant services.
1.03      The Government has received three Bank loans for power developmenti
US$19.1 million in 195-4 (101-CE), of which US$3.2 million was cancelled, 'o
help finance the expansion of the 25 W§J Laksapana hydroelectric plant by an
additional 25 Hv- and the construction of the Castlereagh dam; US$7.3 miiliJ-
in 1958 (209-CE) to help finance construction of the thermal power pl-nt at
Grandpass, Colombo; and USt$14.1 million in 1961 (283-CE) to help finance a
25 IMi extension at Grandpass, the construction of the 50 MW Norton Bridge
hydroelectric stiation, and related transmission and distribution lines. Ail
these projects are operating in a satisfactory manner.
1.04      The Borrower would be the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) a govern-
ment corporation established by the Central Electricity Board Act No. 17 oi
1969. The Act provides for the Ministerial appointment of seven Board members
and these appointments are to be rncde on July 15, 1969.  in accoruance .ith zh
provisions of the Act the Board must offer DGEU staff terms and conditions of
service with the Board no less favorable than they had enjoyed in tile service
of DGEU. After this has been done, the transfer by Ministerial order, of
DGEU property, rights, obligations and liabilities would bring about DGEU's
reconstitution as a new power entity. This transfer would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. The financial projections in this report
assume that the CEB as the Borrower will be fully operational by October 1,
1969.
1.05      The question of setting up an Electricity Board has been under
consideration since 1961 when the last loan for power was made. At that tiii,e
the Government and the Bank agreed upon the need to establish an independent
power utility to take over from DGEU and begin life without the deficiencies
(described in paragraph 2.03) which handicap that Government department.
Because of an impending power shortage, the Bank agreed to make the loan even
though the new Board had not been established. The first draft Bill to cruato
the Board waS introduced in the Parli-ament in December 1961, but strong 'rgue



union opposition concerned with the conditions of service under the proposecI
Board caused the Bill to be withdrawn. A second Bill, amended under trade
union pressure, was presented in August 1962 and was being considered by a
Select Committee when the Parliament was dissolved in 1964. The present
Government, which took office in April 1965, decided to present a new Bill,
but it was not until early 1969 that it was presented to Parliament. It
was approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate in May 1969 and
received the assent of the Governor General in June 1969.
1.06      This report has been prepared by J. Beach and S.S. Scales.   It is
based upon information obtained from engineering studies by T. Ingledow and
Associates Ltd. and unon information provided by DGEU during an appraisal
in February/March 1969.

2. THE BORROWER
Background
2.01      Electricity was first supplied in 1895, in Colombo, by a private
company.  in 1901 electricity supply was introduced in Kandy, and in ly12 in
Nuwara-Eliya. The private company continued operations until 1927, when its
facilities were purchased by the Colonlal uovernment and opera-Gea Dy the newly
established DGEU.  At that time, electricity service was being provided to
only 10 Ceylonese communities; today, nearly all the major towns and villages
in the country have electricity. DGEU produces over 90% of the energy generated
in the Island and is responsible for the transmission of the energy it generates.
Some 75% of DGEU's energy sales are retailed in Colombo and five other commun-
ities; the balance is sold to local authority licensees for retailing.
2.02      The Electricity Act of 1950, as modified by the Electricity (Amend-
ment) Act of 1957, embodies the present electricity law relating to the genera-
tion, transmission, distribution, supply and use of electrical energy. The
responsibility for the generation and transmission of power is reserved to
DGEU except where local authorities operate their own plant in the absence of
supply from the DGEU transmission system. The Government licenses the local
authorities to distribute and sell electricity whether self-generated or
bought from DGEU; the licenses normally stipulate the area of supply, voltage
and method of supply, and price and method of making charges. The licensees
operate as separate entities, but DGEU is empowered to exercise certain con-
trols to ensure public safety and enforcement of the provisions of the Act.
Organization and I4anagement
2.03      DGEU's present organization and operations are unsatisfactory,
nrint,inally bec2use of t.hpe folloW ing
(a)  The management does not have adequiate independent responsibility
for its own overall policies relating to power development,
fi;nnn;nirn of itR nnfivitiAs. And nersonnel management.
(b)  The system of accounting is not appropriate for a commercial public
utility as it is geared to meeting Treasury requirements for budget-
a-yr prp-oses. For xa-Xnple - revin.e -is oJ , nn nn   c'2rua1  basis and
expenses on a "cash" basis; there is no provision for depreciatiol;

C nylon I2,ec'.ici;;  Bo,; dAc  No. 17 of 1965.  MTe t,:'ansfe:. of I  s'-ff -ind
fu;,ction3s of DGEU to the neUw Board, expected by October 1, 1969 will bring
about the following major changes.
(a) The Board would be organized as a single autonomous entity.



(b) For the first time. financial policies would be introduced which
clarify the application of revenue, and specifically provide for
depreciation and financing a reasonable proportion of the cost of
development of electricity services.
(c) This will effect a change in the philosophy of rate-making (see
paragraph 2 .12) .
2.05      The Act stipulates that the Ceylon Electricity Board shall be a
body corporate, have perpetual succession, and may sue and be sued. The
Board consists of seven members: folu members Twho have had considerable
experience in engineering, commerce, administration or accountancy, one rep-
resenting local authoities, one represe-tin" industry, and a Treasury off-cer
nominated by the Minister of Finance.   The members will nonrally serve for
five years a.nd be eligibDle for reappointment. However, the term. of office of
throc of the Boa:-z nombers first appointed. by the "Ninister of Pot er n4il enld
after three years from -t-hte e of appon--ment. Tbe     .air-ian will be appoi r. .Cj
by the Minister for Power from among the seven members. The General Manager,
appointed 'with the Minister's approval, will be responsible to the Board f oP
planning, directing, coordinating and controlling the corporate activities.
2.06      The Board isill be responsible for developing and coordinating the
generation, supply and distribution of electrical energy, and for tak'ig over
and administering DGEU's activities and, as directed by the 1Minister, othe-
electricity departments of local authority licensees. The Act sets out ths
framework of financial policy by -
(a)  directing the Board to ensure that total revenue will be adequate
to meet outgoings properly chargeable to revenue account including
depreciation, interest on capital and a reasonable proportion of
the cost of development of the Boardis services; tariffs fixed by
the Board would be subject to prior Government approval;
(b)  empowering the Board to borrow money "by way of loans from the
Goverrnent, by the issue of Ceylon Electricity Stock .... or in
any other manner whatsoever";
(c)  directing the Board to keep accounts of income and expenditure
which would conform to the best commercial standards; and
(d) directing that the unpaid loans from Government payable by DGEU
shall be deemed an equity investment in the new Board, on which
annual dividends not exceeding 8% per annum would become payable.
2.07      Notwithstanding the structural and functional improvements expected
upon its creation, it will be necessary that the CEB be assisted in:
(a)  establishing the new accounting system;
(b)  preparing inventories, revaluing assets, and developing an
acceptable depreciation policy;
(c)  arranging for meaningful audits to be made; and
(d)  es-tablishing and maintainirg a rational insurance roic-   s
pal-agraph 2.09).



The services of special;zed consultants will be required, and their role
would be consistent with that visualized in a review nof DGElJ's onpertions
carried out in 1964-1966. 1/ During negotiations it was agreed that the CEB
would apDoint accounting and management consulltants acceptable to the Barnk
with suitable terms of reference to assist it:-
(i)  to set up its new organization;
(ii)  to reorganize the accounting and financial functions so as to
provide the management of the _ad w-th a basIs for conduct.g
a sound and efficient public utility; and
(iii)  to make a full study of the valuation of plant and depreciation
not- later than eight een months aft ter l th Irrug  ofI the   LAI.v
study would be reviewed by the Bank in conjunction with Government
and the Board as it wul1d form, the basis for regla Lg     r Uf
levels (see paragraph 6.06).
Audit
2.08      The Act provides for the Board accounts to be audited by the
Auditor-G-eneral, who ma-y unploy the services of a qualified auditor to assist.
hiL;. The auditing arrangements were discussed during negotiations and would
be satisfactory to thle Bank.  The teni 'qualified auditor! refers to ei-ther
an individual who has a certificate to practice or a professional firm eacYh
of whose partners has a certificate to practice, issued by the Council of
the Insti'ute of Chartered Accountants of Ceylon.
Insurance
2.09      It has not been DGEU's practice to obtain outside insurance against
certain risks such as damage by fire, explosion, etc.  After the Board is
set up, it will become responsible for the cost of replacing and repairing
damaged property and meeting claims by third parties. It was agreed during
negotiations that it would be prudent for the Board to insure assets where
risks of major losses lie, and that the new Board would seek advice from an
insurance advisor with experience in the electricity supply industry.
Past Earnings
2.10      Income statements for the four years ended September 30, 1968, are
sumnarized in Annex 7. Revenue increased from Rs 51 million in 1964/65 to
Rs 74 million in 1967/68 - i.e., at an average rate of growth of 13% (with
tariffs remaining unchanged since 1962). Although in the samie period,
expenses (excluding depreciation) increased at a smaller average rate the
internal cash generation net of debt service, represented only 12f of the
capital outlay. In fiscal 1968/69, the estimated internal cash generation,
I/ A cormittee, chaired by Mr. J.N. Goswami, a Colombo Plan Adviser, set up
by the Ceylon Government to examine and report on Power Cost ard Power
Development in Ceylon.



-6-
net of debt service, represents only 3% of the capital investment for the
yr These low perc-ages have been due ranly to the looY tariff level
prevailing in the absence of any policy to provide revenue adequate to finance
areasona'ble proport-ion, of the- co+ _of cap-+it  wrs  ThJs policy isJ t^
UAJr.;~IV U   W   -C.J  W.,  At  -. -l c   s  
included in the Act, as noted in paragraph 2.06; and the tariffs will now
require more frequen- review and reguation.
2.11      Tlhe present taridf structure was introduced in 1962 after the Bank
had suggested that the existing structure did not adequately represent the
costs of serving various classes of cons-amiers.  The ccmumercial and indus+rial
tariffs are of the two part type which includes a monthly maximum demand
charge and a charge for each unit of energy consuwmed. The dor,estic tariff
relates charges directly to energy consumed. The 1962 tariff structure was
critically examined by the Goswaii Committee. Although some revisions Jun
demand and energy charges were recommended in order to increase revenue, no
change of substance in the structure was proposed. Aside from the neeu Do
raise additional revenue it may be assumed that the relations amongst the
tariffs applicable to the several classes of consumers are generally consistent
with the costs of service.
2.12      The financial situation reveals thatu if present tariffs were to
prevail over the next four years it would becom,e necessary to raise - in
addition to the foreign loans - loans from Government or other local sources
of the order of Rs 200 million or US$33 million equivalent.  This sum rep-
resents an unreasonable burden on the Government. In view of the need to
mobilize domestic resources for investment in Ceylon, it would be reasonable
to expect the Board to contribute 35% of its capital requirements from its
own resources; this in turn, would require a tariff increase of about 17%.
The revenue, however, would be insufficient to provide for the payment of
dividends on the Government's equity investment. A tariff increase of 17%
has now been approved by the Government and will be irpDlemented from

2.13      DGEU has been run in the past without any objective performance
criteria and this has resulted in operating costs being higher than would
normally be expected in an undertaking of the size of the DGEU. Compared
with similar systems in India the payroll of 6,000 employees would appear
large. With the advice of consultants (paragraph 2.07) and the gradual
development of criteria to assist evaluate nerformance, the management should
be better informed to control personnel and labor costs more effectively. A
modest impr_vemn t in onerating efficiency has been nroiected.
Present Financial Positi-on
2.14      The balance sheet as of September 30b 1968; is DGEU's last audited
one.  A notional balance sheet as of September 30, 1969, has been projected.
This is set out below, as a basis for discussing DGEFts n-resPent f-inancial
position. A notional balance sheet as of October 1, 1969 - the beginning of
Ae new fisc 'l year - is alon shown '-u  ninci_,e vith, +-he date it is assurr,ed
that DGEU will be integrated into the new Board. This balance sheet reflects
(a) the transformation of the loans from Government into equity (paragraph
2.06 (d)   and (b) the accumaulated depreciation, assixlming that as of

September 30, 1967, the accumulated depreciation was equal to 20% of the dveiagce
book value of gross plant in fiscal 1967 and tlat subsequent denreciation  -eas
at a composite rate of 2&A per annum. As noted earlier, the valuation of
assets is in question, and in fact a study (naragranh 2.07) will be renuired
before their realistic value is known. The balance sheets presented in this
report must be viewed accordingly.

enforce collections from local authorities. The new Act provides collection
procedures which wijl enaile the Board to enrforce prmUpter collect-on in
future. The Banc pointed out to Government the undesirability of continuing
the large back log of bilis at this level and asked for the position to be
remedied. During negotiations it was indicated that collections from consumers,
other than local authorities, had impraved considerably, and that unpaid b lls
from local authorities had only shown little improvement compared to the
position at the end of September 1968.   It was t-herefore agreed that as
conditions of effectiveness of the loan, billing delays would be reduced to
45 days or lessl an- an addition'al su-. of no: less than As 8r million
would be collected from local authorities against bills for supplies rendered
up to February 1969 which were still unpaid as of June 10, 1969. Although
the loan may not be effective by the date the new Board becomes fully opera-
tional, the effect of these actions would be to reduce consumers accounts
receivable of the new Board to approximately 40% of a year's revenue from
sales by about October 1969. The Government further agreed that by September
30, 1970 consumers receivables for electricity supplied, other than amounts
under dispute pursuant to Section 55 of the Act would not exceed the total of
the three months billinigs for July through September 1970 or about 25  of
fiscal 1970 revenue from sales.
2.16      The high debt/equity ratio of ;7/J.3 reflects tlhe large proportion
of total capitalization represented by long-termi debtu. The transformation
of government loans into equity shows a pronounced change in the debt/equity
ratio to 32/68 as of October 1. 1969.  Information concerning the long tern debt
is shown in Annex 11. The foreign indebtedness increased in November 1967
by about Rs 36 million as a result of a 20% devaluation of the rupee. The
resultant increase in annual debt service was initially about Rs 5 nillion.

3. THE POTER SECTOR
3.01      Ceylon has an area of some 25,00O square miles and a population of
about 12 million. The recent progress of the economy was described in the
Bank's last economic report - Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ceylon, dated February 7, 1969.  Gross National Product in 1967 was Rs 8,791
million or a per capita GNP equivalent to US$126 (measured at current market
prices).  The rate of growth of CNP. which averaged 3.5% for the period
1960-66, increased to 7% in 1967 and to over 8% in 1968.  Agriculture con-
tinues to be the largest sector (35.8% of GIP at factor costs).  However,
much attention is now being given to industrial expansion, particularly in
the  anrufacu+ring i-dustry. New fa+ctoies recently built or under constructiori
cover the manufacture or production of textiles, plywood, ceramics, cement,
rubber tires and tubes, and include a steel rolling mill. This growth in
industrial activity will have considerable impact on the Board's sales to
jndustrial co.sumers, and +his has been allowed for in the forecast of sales.
Thus the annual growth in sales, which has averaged about 8% since 1961, is
exqpected to irncrease rapi-dl over the course of the next two or three years
as industrial activity increases and new factories come into production.
3.02      Two monsoons, the South West and the North East, are responsible
for maost of the ann-.ual precip-i ao n. Annual average rainfall var es from
below 40 inches inthe drier areas in the northern part of the Island to over'
200 inches at certai places on thULe southwes4 s    o              The
source of the Maskeliya Oya and the catcbment area which the hydroelectric
project will utbilize are situated nr. the area of very heary precipitatione
Existing Facilities
3.03      Tne System supplies power in bulk to local author-iies, pla4-tatio
estates and industries throughout the central and southern part of the Island
by means of transmission and sub-transmission faclities oper-ating at 132 kV,
66 kV and 11 kV. It also retails power directly to consumers in the Munici--
pality of Colombo, in five towns in the central hig'rlands area, and in areas
where it has undertaken rural electrification programs. In addition, DGEU
generates power in Jaffna in the north and supplies power in bulk, by means
of an isolated system, to industries and local authorities in the immediate
vicinity of Jaffna town.
3.04      Upon completion of transmission facilities now under constructiOn,
the major facilities will be integrated into a single system and will be able
to service most of the Island, including the Jaffna area, from central genier-
ating sources.
3.05      With the recent commissioning of the Uda Walawe (6 NW) andPolpitiya
(75 MN) hydro stationsthe effective generatilng capacity of the system is
261 MN with a firm capacity of about 220 MW. Polpitiya is the first stage
development of the Maskeliya Oya (see Nap 2). Existing generating capacity
includes 50 N hydro capacity at Laksapana, 50 MI hydro at Norton Bridge,
50 NW (thermal) at Grandpass (Colombo), 10 1W hydro at Inginmyagala,
14 NW1 diesel at Chunnakam (Jaffna), and 6 M%W diesel at Pettah (Colombo). All
additional 6 Mf of steam and diesel capacity is available at Pettah, but they

are very old units maintained as emergency standby capacity only and are
not available to meet load under normal operating conditions.
3.06      At Castlereagh is a center for the training of electricians,
wiremen, linesmen and fitters; it was established in 1965 with French
Govermment assistance. A five-man team who carry out maintenance on
energised transmission lines (hot line maintenance) was trained in Bangalore,
India. A second team is to be sent there for training. The introduction of
such advanced techniques gives some indication of the technical alertness of
the organization.
Development Program
3.07      The estimated peak demand and energv reouirements of the nower
system, compared with available plant capacity and energy, are indicated
in Annexes 2 and 3. The effective firm rapacity and enerev availabilitv
will be sufficient to meet system requirements only until about the end
of 1971. Thereafter it will be necenssrv to haver ecoirse to nld standbv
capacity or to rely on the chance that water conditions will be favorable.
3.08      The next step in the development program proposes the initiation
of cn sttlitihn of the second-stage detvelopment of the Maskeliya Oya (see
Map 2). It is unlikely that this could be commissioned until late in 1972.
To meet the AAfMi+. in enenr that *._1l ase +nards the enrd of 1971 and

30      Ins fo.L'UZreseeni a  Utis time, tne IutUure power generating requireirierius
will be met by the development of the Mahaweli Ganga. This is a major
project involv-ing the diversion oI the Mahaweii Ganga at Poigolia, near
Kandy, and the irrigation ultimately of some 900,000 acres of cropland in
the nort-heastern part of Ceylon.  The total potential power generation is
of the order of 4,700 million kWih annually, with an installed capacity of
about 900 riMw. Of the 40 potential hydroelectric power station sites,
11 would be built as multipurpose units. The project is planned to be
implemented under a phased program over a period of 20 years. Irrigation
benefits constitute the primary justification for the project and will
dictate the timing of major works including power development.  Present
plans are to follow the construction of the Maskeliya Oya Stage II Project
with the installation of 40 Mw at Polgolla to be commissioned in late 1973,
and 120 MWf at Victoria, to be commissioned in two stages of 60 MW each in
the late 170;s.  Stage I of the Mahaweli Ganga Development, including
Polgolla, was appraised from both agricultural and power viewpoints in
February/Aarch 1y6y. It is expected that a loan and credit for this project
till be presented to the Executive Directors late in 1969.

for the next stage of development of the transmission and distzibution
system are being formulated; it is possible that an approach to the Bank
will be made about the middle of 1970 to help finance the transmlss1on
program .
3.11      The firmly planned expansion program covers the four fiscal years
1970 through 1973. It will add 115 MW of capacity to the system and is
expected to require an investment of about Rs 400 million or about
US$68 million equivalent.

4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The Project consists of a diversion dam on the Maskeliya Oya,
a pressure tunnel and penstocks, a surface power station housing two 45 MW
hydroelectric units, and a 132 kV switchyard. Included in the Project
would be a 25 MW gas turbine extension to the existing Grandpass thermal
station in Colombo, a 5-mile 132 kV transmission line to connect the hydro
project to the existing transmission system, a new 132 kV switching station
at Eriyagama, and the services of accounting/management consultants referred
to in paragraph 2.07. The hydro project would be the second stage of a
three-stage development of the Maskeliya Oya. The first stage development,
consisuting of a reoulating reservoir at Mousakelle and a hydroelectric power
station at Polpitiya with installed capacity of 75 MW, was commissioned
recently;   it was financed in part by a Canadian loan of Can$10.8 million
and in part by a loan of Rs 19.4 million by the civil engineering contractors,
Ingra of Yugnslavia. for the cost of nersonn-p1  and construction eauipment.
The third stage is likely to consist of a tunnel and penstocks connecting the
outlet of Mousakelle dam wi-th a nowerhouse at Canyon reservoir housing one
15 1M0 unit. The Project's location and general arrangement are shotln in
Maps 1 and 2; the detailed descprition is in Annex h. The cost of the
Project would be US$31.5 million equivalent which is about 46% of the Board's

cover the analysis of bids received, the preparation of detailed designs
and the supervision of project construction. The estimated cosu of these
services is included in the proposed loan. The appointment of consultants)
acceptable to the BanK, would be a condition oI effectiveness Of the loan.
There would be some advantage in continuing with the same consultants and it
is possible that after proposals are received TIAL will be re-engaged. Should
consultants other than TIAL be retained however, the Bank would insist
tney be allowed to satisfy themselves on the studies already made even though
this might delay the start of the Project.
4.04      The construction of the Stage II hydroelectric project is expected
to extend over a period of nearly three years from the date the main civilw Torks
contract is awarded. On the assumption that this will not be later than



- 13 -
December 1969, the Project should be in full operation by the beginning
of October 1972. DGEU's performance in managing contracts for similar work
carried out for the Stage I development has been reasonably good.
Cost Estimate
4.05      TIAL prepared the cost estimate on the basis of the costs of
similar work being carried out on the Stage I development of the Maskeliya
Oya, for which TIAL is engineering consultant. A contingency allowance of
12% a-nd 7% of direct civil and electrical/mechanical costs, respectively,
has been used in the cost estimates shown below. The cost per kW of hydro
plant installed to,,1lt 'h nbout. US$MAIM! this includes the cost of trans-
mission and also the hydro project's share of the indirect costs shown
below. For a project desined to operafte at an annual plant factor of
43%, based on firm energy considerations only, this cost figure is reasonable.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF TBE PROJECT
The Power Market
5,01      The load forecasts are based on a projection of the growth in
-basic" load (all load  _ pt hea.ir ;ndustl) +oeher wtht 2 nrniectinn
of the requirements of a number of major industries the Government proposes
+wes+ablishV or exar.d -- +he next few yez.The basic load, exclusive
of the large industrial, is projected to grow at an annual rate of 8% per
arum ;4this is cons-istent -444 boj  the actu 0 aver-age load grov"rH of' a

little over 8% since 1961 and the current expectations concerning the country's
probable Luture economic performiance.  Est-iated demands and sales over the
period through 1974 are indicated in Annex 5 and are shown graphically in
2Ainex 'L.
5.02      as indicated in the table below, Industrial (light anrd mediur),
Commercial and Licensees presently account for about 82% of all sales. Their
consumption is expected to grow at a rate of a'bout 10%0, 7% and 6% per annum,
respectively, over the period covered by these projections. Consistent with
past performance and the economic prospect of the country in general, domes-
tic consumption (which presently accounts for about 10% of all sales) is ex-
pected to grow at an annual rate of about 6%. Actual growth in this category
since 1961 has ranged from 2% to 4%. This low rate of growtrh has been at-
tributed to import restrictions which have limited the supply of appliances
available to consumers. Following some easing of import controls recently
and the prospect that certain appliances may be manufactured locally, it is
likely that future growth rates wsill be somewhat higher than those experienced
in the past.
5.03      The power requirements of large industrial consumers were the
subject of a special study by a Government Committee; its findings, modified
by the Bank to reflect information on timing and extent of loads which has be-
come available since the Committee published its report, form the basis of the
projected energy demands for large industry shown in Annex 5.
5.04      The effect of industrial expansion on the distribution of energy

5.05      The total maximum demand to be served by the system is projected
to increase from 136 MW in fiscal 1967/68 to 274 MW in 1973/74. The annual
system load factor is estimated to improve from 53c to 57% during the same
period under the influence of the large industrial loads, most of which are
expected to operate at high load factor. The load factor of the basic load
has been assumed to remain constant at about 52%. This is consistent with
the actual performance of the system over the past 10 years.
Size of the Project
5.06      The consultants have determined that the most economic size of
the Stage II Project would be 90 MW with a firm enerzy capability of 337
million kWh per annum; this takes into account the available head between
the Canyon diversion dam and the New Laksapana powerhouse (the lowest
elevation of which is limited by the maximum height of water at the Stage I
diversion dam at Laksapana), as well as the average annual inflow into the
Mousakelle reservoir and into the water course of the Maskeliya Oya between
14ousakelle and Canvon dam.  The Prolect is expected to be nln-ed in serviee
in October 1972, which will enable 16 1MW of very old thermal plant to be
permanently retired and permit a reduction in thermnl generation at Grand-
pass. System capacity and energy requirements including reserve requirements
will he met until 197), or 1975, byrwhich tirne it is probable tha+- th f-
stage development of the Mahaweli Ganga project will have been commissioned.
Thermal Backup
5.07      A review of monthly load duration curves indicates the need for
high load factor therm-,al generation duriLng c-i tical load periods in months
of minimum flow, and raises the question as to whether available thermal
generation reserves are adequate tw ensure reliable sysLem operauion.  FIrrri
flows cannot be guaranteed during periods of extreme drought although this
situation may- be expected to prevail not more than 5% of the time. Further,
it may be desirable for the Board to operate its reservoirs at certain times
so as to minimize the danger of downstream flooding, and thereby effectively
reduce the firm energy available to the system. Thus, there is an inherent
risk that system supply may have to be curtailed during minimum flow periods
in some years. This happened during the first quarter of this year, particu-
larly towards the end Of March, when it became necessary to introduce ex-
tensive power cuts. The cause was prolonged drought coupled with persistent
troubles in the Grandpass boilers. The 25 IVMWJ gas turbine unit which is pro-
posed to be installed towards the end of 1971, in order to meet the energy
shortage that will occur during 1972 until the Stage I1 hydro project comes
into service, will help the system by increasing the amount of available
thermal reserve against unforeseen water shortages. It will also permit
increased utilization of available secondary energy by expanding the system
thermal base and, by virtue of its quick starting and load-taking character-
istics, relieve peaking duty on the existing Grandpass thermal units - designae(
for base load operation - during certain maximum flow months.
Thermal Alternative to p;p, ,t
5.08      Ceylon has no proven sources of fossil fuels, hence an alternative
thermal station would have to burn imported fuel oil.  The alternative chosen
as a basis for comparison with the Stage II development is an extenicn tc

the existing Grandpass thermal station in Colombo, comprised of two 35 T-W oil-
fired gas turbine generating units. Gas turbine units, in combination with
the existing conventional thermal units, would provide more flexibility of
operation than would be possible with additional conventional steam plant.
The consultants have estimated the cost of the extension to be roughly US$150
per kW installed;  this includes local civil works. duties and other indirect
costs.
5.09      The Maskeliya Project was compared with the sequential construction
of the thermal capaci+ty descrihbed above.  The total costs +to onnstruict and
operate each alternative over a 50-year period (the assumed economic life of
the Project) were then compared on a present value or discounted cash flow
basis. It was found that for costs of capital of 15% or less the Project
based altemative rpresent- the -ore economic ^-      cc. If th e calculations
were based on the FEEC rate  of exchange of US$1 =lRs 9.23 1/ this wOmld s,:i.l1
hold good for cos+vs of capi tC-al of-P 16% o r l ess.
5.10      The in.cremenrta- l r-ate of retur-n on the poVposed nvestm ent vi thLe
Project would range from 24% to 18% using the present and FEEC exchange rates
reSpectively and valuing new sales attibutable to the Project at uaifS
which include the 17% increase already approved by the Government. Until the
PrJject is fully loaded, benefits include tne cost of fuei saved at the Grand.-
pass thermal station. The returns are strictly financial returns to the
Board on the new investment, and not necessarily a full measure of the eco-
nomic return to Ceylon. Because the demand for power is likely to be inelastic
with respect to price changes, it is probable that current tariffs understate
the value of power to consumers.  To the extent this is true, the economic
return may be expected to be greater than the financial return calculated here.
5.lL      Tne above analyses have been made using a fuel cost, exclusive of
duty, of Rs 109 per ton (Rs. 2.63 per million BTUs). The cost of fuel per
unit has been based on average station heat rates likely to be attained in
operation: 14,500 and 17,500 BTUs per kTWh for the steam and gas turbine
installations respectively. The cost of fuel is high, equivalent to about
US$18 per ton. In the main, the high cost is due to the Board's inability
to conclude a more favorable contract for oil supplies because of the small
quantities used. If generation by thermal plant were to be developed on
a larger scale some reduction in oil prices should be possible. The price
of fuel oil in Singapore is about US$12.0 per ton. On the assumption that
fuel oil at this low price could be available to the Board the above analyses
were repeated. These showed that for both rates of exchange the Project
based altermative would still be more attractive for cost of capital less
than about il% and the incremental rates of return would improve by about 1%.
1,/ This rate of exchange would be approximate to the Foreign Exchange
Entitlement Certificate (FEEC) rate used to reduce excess demand for
imports by a de facto devaluation covering a selected group of imnorts3

6.02      During the four-year period, the total capital requirements would
amount to Rs 419.1 imillion or US$70.4 million equivalen-. O-r this sun'., the Board
would finance about 40% from its own resources and 60% would be financed
from borrowings - 46% coming from foreign exchange loans including the Bank
loan (30%) and the balance of 14% from locally borrowed money. The cost of
certain transmission facilities was excluded from the proposed Project as
being premature.  For this reason it is assumed that the Board would arrange
future (foreign) loans for financing the transmission facilities on Bank
terms in fiscal 1970/71. The proposed financing plan is acceptable, and
represents a reasonable level of self-generated funds.
6.03      Inasmuch as the unpaid balance of the loans from Government would
be deemed an equity investment upon establishment of the Board. the resultant
saving in debt service on the loans would be about Rs 12 million a year.   This
saving, however, would be offset by the ndditional debt. servi-e arising on
suppliers' credits contracted in connection with Maskeliya Oya Stage I, which
amount tGo Rs 77 million or US13 mnillion equivalent.  These suppliers' credits
have short-term repayment periods; e.g., Rs 30 million are repayable over a



fiscal five-year period 1970-19u7, w      Rs 1 7 rILLL±on o ver0 - igh y  The- 
credits include a contract for approximately Rs 19 million for foreign personnel
and equipment during construction of the civ--il .works - tunnel, penstocks, etc.
6.04      The new borrowings assumed during tThe period, apart LroImw wthe
continuation of draw-down of existing loans and suppliers, credits, are:
(a)  The proposed Bank loan of US$21.0 million, including interest
during construction, is assumed repayable over a term of 25 years
including a five-year grace period, carrying interest at 6.5%
per annum and a corrnmitment charge of 3/4 of 1% on the undisbursed
portion of the loan.
(b)  Foreign loan on Bank terms for the cost of transmission and
distribution facilities.
(c)  Borrowing by way of loans from the Government (Section 42 of the
Act) assumed to be repaVable over 25 years with interest at 7p
per annum, which together with internal cash generation complete
the financing plan.
Future Earnings
6_o5      Forecast income statements coverine the six fiscal years ending
September 30, 1969 through 1974 are shown in Annex 7. They are based upon
pronected qvPrqAe growth in sales of about ji< per annum (Annex 5). Because
much of the increased sales will be at loe-r pricea tariffs the average growth
over -rf i srr:  19 70 Hhrormb 1974) TWou1d be at a 1eSSG rate.  Ir'while the average
increase in operating expenses between 1969 and 1974 is about 8% per annum,
there "ar connidrIablen anninl fluot        ref ecting t1he p1-lant mix" of
hydro and thermal sources of generation. Fuel expense is the chief cause
of the fluctuation; this is pan i,rarl no       n'hI  for pxAmple. in fiscal
1973 after conmissioning of the projec; andl reuIci.ion in -lhe usc
_of te-lX  capacity.  The "increased staff cost after creation of the nerw
Board" included in expenses will arise for the following reasons:
(a)  The Board w11 finance pensions or provident funds during the
em - oyeets -worl---;- life;  ove.A.tp.sn     ae,rm,ly
financed from revenue during the year the pension is paid, i.e.

the staff will become personally responsible (e.g., contributions
to a Pro-v-ident Fund; Government e,ployees are not normally required
to contribute towards their pensions), and partly to ensure no
less favorable terms and conditions of service than those the
staff has enjoyed as civil servants.
6.o6      The adequacy of future earnings would best be measured by a rate of
return. As noted the valuation of assets is in question, and so it is nOt
possible to draw up an appropriate tariff covenant at this time, although the
proposed tariff increase should assure a sound financing plan for constructing
the project. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Board would:



- 19 -
(a) revalue its net fixed assets within 18 months as mentioned in
paragraph 2.07;
(b) thereafter review its tariffs to achieve a rate of return on
net assets in service of 8% or such higher return as may be
agreed with the Bank;
Furthermore, the Government agreed that dividends on its investment in equity
capital of the Board would only be established after the Government had
consulted with the Board as to its ability to pay such dividends after
meeting oneratinp exTnnsps (ixruliding nrovisinn for denreniatinn) debt

6.08      As noted in paragraph 2.16, the long-term    u debt/equity -ratio would
change from 8743 on September 30, 1969 to 32/68 as of October 1, 1969, as
a result of the transformation of the debt due to Government into a Govern-
ment investment in the equity of the Board. Long-term debt would gradually
increase to 3(7% of totai capitalization by fiscal 1971 and decline to 3&4,
by the end of fiscal 1974. Annual interest would be covered 1.4 times in
1968/69, before the proposed tariff increase and the transfer of the out-
standing Government loans to equity. From 1970 the interest coverage does
not fall below 2.7 times. Debt service would be covered 1.7 times or more
by internal cash generation. This situation would be satisfactory.
6.09      In order to maintain a satisfactory financial position throughout
the term of the proposed loan, it was agreed during negotiations that the
Board would not incur debt without Bank approval unless internal cash
generation in the preceding 12-month period was at least 1.5 times the maximum
future annual debt requirements including the debt service on the proposed
borrowing. Debt would be defined as all debt except that incurred in the
ordinary course of business and by its terms maturing on demand or less than
one year after incurrence. The Board would meet this test only after com-
pletion of its first fiscal year of operation. Until that time, the Bank's
approval would be required before the Board incurred any additional long-
term debt.

7. AGREEMETS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(1)  The Board wiil employ consultants
(a) to help establish the new organization and help reorganize
the accounting and financial functions (paragraph 2.07);
(b) to revalue its net fixed assets (paragraph 2.07) ;
(c) for engineering and supervision of the construction of the
project (paragraph 4.03).
(2) The Board will, after revaluation of its net fixed asset values,
review its tariffs to achieve an annual return on the average
value of net fixed assets in service of 8% or such higher return
as may be agreed with the Bank and the Govemrment (paragraph 6.06).
(3) The Government,will consult with the Board to establish the
dividend to be paid by the Board on the Government's investment
in the equity capital of the Board as defined by section 39 (b)
of the Act (paragraph 6.06).
7.02      The loan would not become effective until the following conditions
have been met:
(a) the legal transfer of property, rights, obligations and liabilities
relating to the DGEU has been effected4
(b) the delay in billing electricity supplied by the Board or its
predecessor has been reduced to h4 days or less after meter
readings;
(c) a sum of not less than Rs 8 millions has been paid in respect of
bills rendered for electricity supplied to local authorities un
to February 1969 and still unpaid as of June 10, 1969;
(d) consultants have been appointed to supervise the construction of
the prnoect.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The project would compriL-se:
;. A hydroe'ectric power statlIon of 90 Mal capacitGy, dSign.ed to
operate at an annual plant factor, on a firm energr basis, of
1about 43%.
2. A double circuit 132 kV transmission line about -    -e m-e" s 3lng
to interconnect the proposed power station at New Laksapana
to the existing 132 kV transmission network.
3. A 132 kV switching'receiving station at Eriyagama.
4. A 25 MAl' gas turbine unit at Grandpass, Colombo.
1. Maskeliya Oya Stage II Hydroelectric Project
The hydroelectric project comprises the second stage development
of the Maskeliya Oya and would utilize the regulated flows from the Mousakelle
Reservoir (constructed as part of the Stage I development).   These flowts
together with inflows between the Mousakelle dam and Canyon would be diverted
by means of a diversion dam at Canyon through an 18,500 feet long pressure
tunnel and 5,900 feet long twTin penstocks to a powerhouse of 90 1N7 capacity
in two units, adjacent to the existing Laksapana powerhouse.
The effective operating head would be 1775 feet.
The diversion dam at Canyon is proposed as a concrete gravity
structure with a central gated spillway and incorporating the intake struct-
ure for the pressure tunnel in the right bank abutment. The storage require-
ments at Canyon are small (30 million cubic feet) and it was therefore neces-
sary to design the spillway to accept a maximum flood discharge of 51,700
cubic feet per second. Such a discharge would result in a surcharge of 32
feet over the spillway crest elevation. The consultants have concluded that
a design for potential earthquake shock is unnecessary.
The proposed tunnel would be about 18,50O feet long and the
alignment chosen wmuld nrovide adequate rock cover. An unlined tunnel cross
section will generally be employed and altered only where local rock con-
ditions dictate the need for concrete lining.  Rock traps will be provided
to prevent loose rocks from entering the turbines. On the basis of economic
comprisons made yr the consultants, the optimum tunnel section has been
determined as a 12.5 foot diameter "D" section.  A surge tank will be located
on the tunnel line about 750 feet from. the downstream portal.  The diameter
of the tank has been determined at 13 feet and the height in the proposed
loca+ton w..uld be about 300 feet.



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 3 pages
The prnnosed nPenstc:ks would consist of twin steel conduits each
approximately 6,200 feet long, including about 300 feet of tunnel penstocks
and 5,900 feetof surface penstocks.   A valve house accommodating a butter-
fly valve for each penstock will be located just inside the downstream portal
of each tunnel. Each penstock will be prnoided with a tiurbine inlet valve
at its lower end within the powerhouse. The surface penstocks will be
fabricated in 56 foot lengths, except .w.here local topogrnphical features
dictate the need for special lengths and will be jointed with flexible
coupligs.MTh  4-.+e-.a dameter -f +k.e          T.As4-1k -tTn va fmmn a maximum
of 74 inches to a minimum of 61 inches.
The proposed New Laksapana powerhouse will be located on the right
bUarm oi therz M1a:Sr'^eliL,=ya a u^1JtraU_at;1JY ups.treamL( ofj Lh eis, Ltsp<^
powerhouse. The new Switchyard will be located on the left bank of the
river opposite tUle new powe-rhouse.  The installed capacitqy of 90 "'AWI wwll
consist of two 45 MW generators driven by vertical shaft impulse turbines.
Tne generator output will be stepped up to 132 KV Uj six -singl phase
21.5 MVA transformers arranged in two banks of three adjacent to the power-
house.  The transformers will be connected to the switching facilities across
the river via an intermediate angle tower. The switchyard will be provided
with double circuit switching facilities to feed the output from Nwew
Laksapana into the system. Facilities will be provided for the automatic
remote control of the plant from its own control room or remotely from the
existing control center in Laksapana powerhouse.
2. 132 kV Double Circuit Transmission Line
The output from New Laksapana powerhouse will be conveyed to the
Board's 132 kV system by means of a five mile long 132 kV double circuitutrans-
mission line between the switchyard at New Laksapana and the main switching
station for the area at Polpitiya power station. The cost of this line
together with the cost of providing the necessary switching bays atPolpitiya
have been included in the estimated cost of the Project.
3. 132 kV Switching Station at Eriyagama
A 66/33/11 kV substation fed from Laksapana power station already
exists at Eriyagama. It is now planned to build a new 132 kV switching
station at Eriyagama. The 132 kV double circuit line between Polpitiya
and Anuradhapura, now under construction, will be looped into Eriyagama and
the necessary switchgear and switchyard structures will be provided for
this purpose. A 132/33 kV 10 MVA transformer located at the swLitching
station will meet load growth in the area. New loads, which cannot be met
from the existing substation, would include a new textile mill (3 MW) and
supply to an industrial estate (2 MW). The cost of the switchgear and
structures and the 10 MVA transformer are included in the estimated cost of
the Project. Provision will also be made for future 132 kV connections to
Colombo and to the power aenerating facilities to be constructed under the
Mahaweli Ganga development, viz. Polgolla and Victoria Fa41s hydroelectric
proJects which are exoected to be commissioned late 1973 and the late 70's
respectively.

4. 25 RIW Gas Turbine Unit at Grandpass
It is proposed to augment the cppacity of the existing 50 AWi
thenmal (steam) plant at Grandpass, Colomb-Ou, uy the addition of a gas turbine
generating unit of 25 MW capacity. Specifications for this unit have not
yet been finalized but it is proposed tnat the unit should be ol tle lnuus-
trial type using furnace oil. Existing fuel handling facilities at Grand-
pass would be utilized but additional storage facilities would be necessary.
The unit vould be of the packaged type housed in a steel structure and w-yould
be complete with air-inlet and exhaust ductIng, a silencer of the industrial
type and generator and oil cooling equipment. The unit would be complete
with all equipment and accessories required for normal operation and mainten-
ance including substation equipment and control gear.

Rate of Return on Incremental Investment
1.        hne method followed to determine the rate of return on the in-
cremental investment consists of comparing the streams of costs and be-
nefits attributable to the Project. In the calculation, the following
elements have been taken into consideration:
Costs
i.  Investments in the Project (excluding the 132 kV
Eriyagama Switching Station) during the period
Fiscal 1970 through Fiscal 1975, net of interest
during construction and of customs duties on im-
ported equipment; and
ii.  Operating and Maintenance costs including over-
heads and the cost of fuel attributable to the
gas turbine unit.
Benefits
iii.  The revenues on incremental sales attributable to
the Project, calculated at tariffs exnented to be
effective by the time the facility would be com-
missioned: LLnd
iv.  For 1973 on]-. the fuel savings obtained hv operating
Maskeliya Oya Stage II hydroelectric plant in lieu of
Grandpass thermall nlant.
2.        The rate of return on the incremental investment is the discount
rate at which the present value of costs equals the forecast value of bene-
fits. At the prevailing rate of achange, i.e. U$l.O = Rs 95.95     nd the
prevailing fuel oil price of US$18 per ton, the rate of return is about 24%.
The resulting strea ms of costs and benelits for these conditions are shown
on page 2.
3.        To test the sensitivity of the Project to a reduction in the
price of fuel oil and t-o chan.ges in the value of the .-upee cor jpared with
other currencies, further analyses were made with oil at US$12 per ton and
using an exchange rate of US$.0 -      9.23 (        .10     5    ) '
analyses produced the following results:
