PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DOURKALA II IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Loan 1416-MOR)
PREFACE
This is the PCR of the Morocco Doukkala II project for which Loan
1416-MOR in the amount of US$41.0 million was approved on April 12, 1977.
The original closing date was June 30, 1984; the actual closing date was
June 30, 1986. In 1985, US$3.0 million was cancelled as part of the
Special Action Programme. Final disbursement was made on January 21, 1987,
and US$3.33 million of the loan was cancelled.
The project was  the  second  and  final  development phase of the
"'lw-service' perimeter of the Oum-er-Rbia river basin. In addition to the
Doukkala II Irrigation Project,  the  Bank  Group  has financed seven other
irrigation projects, of which one was the Doukkala I Irrigation Project.
This PCR was prepared by the Regional Agricultural Development
Office for Doukkala (ORP4VAD) with the assistance of the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP).  It was  approved  and sent forward by the
Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office to OED, where the
decision was taken not to subject the project to further evaluation.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
DOUKKALA II IIRIGATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.1      General.  The Doukkala II irrigation project was appraised in
October 1976 and a loan of US$41 mdllion was granted in 1976 to finance the
project, which was successfully completed in June 19861x  By the end of June
1986 same US$ 35 million had been disbursed and US$3.0 million cancelled in
1985 as part of the special action programme.
1.2      The projtect area lies to the southwest of the Oum-er-Rbia river
basin in a semi-arid zone characterized by highly variable, low rainfall,
light winds, irregular topography and shallow soils. These conditions
resulted in a decision that the project area should be sprinkler irrigated.
The project was formulated with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD cooperative
programme, on the basis of feasibility studies and detailed engineering
studies of part of the project carried out by consultants. Together with
the Doukkala I project, completed in 1981 (1201-M0R), this project .
represents the final phase of investments to maximize.the use of the water
resources mobilized by the main "low service' canal, which carries water
from the Im Fout reservoir on the Oum-er-Rbia.
1.3      Formulation.  At the time of the appraisal, the project consisted.
of the following elements: (i) land consolidation, the building of farm
roads, windbreaks and drainage; (ii) construction of a sprinkler irrigation
system covering 16,600 ha; (iii) enlargement of the main low service
channel; (iv) construction of six pumping stations and power-lines; (v)
improvement of main highways; (vi) construction of an infrastructure for
extension services and village centres; (vii) on-farm development:
construction of cow sheds, purchase of Friesian cattle and farm equipment
financed by medium-term credit; and (viii) studies and technical
assistance. The main problems identified during the appraisal involved: (i)
recovery of operating, maintenance and investment costs through water
charges and a betterment levy; (ii) establishment of annual prograwnes in
applied research at the Agricultural Research Institute's experimental
station near Zemamra; (iii) the establishment of a telecommunications
/1f Some of the final work will be completed in 1987 (especially that
involving classified roads, see Annex 11).



- v -
network. Responsibility for the implementation of the project is divided
between (i) the Regional Agricultural Development Office for Doukkala
(a*MVD), for the construction the irrigation and drainage networks and farm
roads; (ii) the Roads Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works for the
main road network.
1.4      Design and ccove. There were no major changes in the technical
design over the course of the project. The parameters applied in
construction were the ones cited in the feasibility study and accepted
.during appraisal.
1.5      All the works anticipated during appraisal have been completed,
with the exception of the following: (1) construction of pipe manufacturing
plant; (ii) installation of windbreaks; (iii) supply of tractors to the
CMVs; (iv) infrastructure projects in the UREPs; and (v) procurement of
public works equipment for maintaining the networks.
1.6      Prolect Lementation period. Most of the work on the project
occurred over the six years between 1980 and 1986. After a delay of two
years prior to startup, it was possible to ccmmission 9,400 ha in 1982 after
two years of work and to maintain a rate of 1,750 ha for 4 years, reaching
16,400 ha in 1986.  The total delay of 3 1/2 years in relation to the
estimates contained in the loan agreemnt is due almost exclusively to the
budgetary difficulties experienced by Morocco in 1978/79, the projected date
for the startup of the works, and again in 1983, resulting in significant
delays in constructing the Extensions.
1.7      Land consolidation and distribution. The consolidation operation
was a ccmplete success.  It has made possible (i) the creation of more
viable family farms and the almost complete elimination of fragmentation;
(ii) the allocation of an irrigoted plot to each family; and (iii) the
allocation to more than two-thirds of the farmiers, of a lot on.which a house
can be built in one of the new village centr?s (the remaining farmers will
oontinue to live in their traditional villages). The consolidated farms
have been successfully incorporated into the distribution system for
irrigation water and consolidation was completed prior to the completion of
the irrigation works. *The distribution of land according to the scale of
the farming operations is characterized by the predominance of small farms.
Average farm size is 2.2 ha, with 75% of the farms being smaller in acreage
than the average.
1.8      Procurement.  The goods and services required for the project have
been provided or performed under the terms of 80 separate contracts, 64 for
ORun D and 16 for the Provincial Roads Directorate.  The value of the
contracts open to international competitive bidding (ICB) represents 84% of
the value of all contracts for the project, albeit only 54% of the total
number.
1.9      Costs.  Total actual project costs amounted to DH 544 million, or
18% more than the initial estimate. Expressed in dollars, however, actual
costs are 26% lower than the initial estimate. While the cost of civil
engineering works in dirhams differed only slightly from the appraisal
figure, those of all kinds of equipment were 50% higher.



- vi -
1.10     Agricultural development.  Since the equipment was put into
service, development has taken off most satisfactorily and at present far
exceeds the appraisal mission's forecasts.  The West 1, West 2 and South
(9,370 ha) sectors were comissiuned in November 1982, and the North sector
(3,730 ha) in September 1984. The Sidi Smail (1,400 ha) and Faregh (1,900
ha) extension sectors will be commissioned in November 1986.
1.11     In 1985-85, all crops, including wheat, were grown under
irrigation, with the crop intensity being high (107%) and most yields
exceeding targets set during appraisal. All the crops planned were
introduced with the exception of cotton, which has been gradually abardoned
by all the farmers in the Doukkala area. Sugar beet, the development of
which is accorded high priority by Government, has achieved  ery high yields
(55 t/ha), while yields of wheat and maize reached 4.0 t/ha in both
cases. Soyabeans were introduced for the first time in 1985-86 with yields
of 1.5 t/ha. The development of forage crops, on the other hand, has been
relatively slow, hampered by the years of drought. Livestock raising has
developed quite satisfactorily. The excellent performance of farm
production can be attributed essentially to the following factors: (i) the
predominance of small farms with very high crop intensity; (ii) the use of a
large quantity of fertilizer and improved seed varieties; and (iii) the
close monitoring of farmers by C(RM*VD and the Local Development Commission,
whose role is to ensure adherence to cropping patterns and work schedules.
According to recent projections compiled by ORMVAD, crop intensity will be
144% when development is ccmplete, instead of 141% anticipated during
appraisal. The main changes at present anticipated in the cropping
patterns, compared to the projections coVpiled for the appraisal, are the
introduction of soyabeans, an expansion of output of sumier and winter
vegetables, a reduction in the acreage of cereals planted and the
abandonment of cotton as a crop. These revised projections appear
reasonable in light of the results obtained in 1985-86. Full development of
cereals, industrial crops and vegetables should be reached in 1989. Full
development of forage crops will not be reached in 1991, as C(U4VAD had
forecast, unless the extension effort is intensified to promote
livestock-related activities in the project area.
1.12     Institutional asecs.  As was the case in Doukkala I, aRMVAD's
performaice in the iplemention of this project has been excellent.  This is
due primarily to the stability and the exceptional continuity in the project
managemnt and to the calibre of the managers. However, all the problems
related to the project's implementation were generally analyzed at the
meetings of the Provincial Coordination Committee, at which representatives
of all the ministries involved met once a month under the chairmanship of
the Governor of the Province of El Jadida.  Internal ORWVAD questions were
dealt with at the meetings of the Office Technical Comnittee (Comite
Technique de l'Office), which normaily took place once a quarter under the
Governor's chairmanship. Since 1986 a standing coamittee on agricultural
problems in.the province has met with the Governor on a weekly or bi-weekly
basis.



- vii -
;.13     Operation and maintenance.  The tletworks Management Service suffers
fran insufficient budgetary resources to meet maintenance requirements.  It
has been established that funds on the order of 300 DH/ha should be
allocated for operation and maintenance for the entire Doukkala perimeter,
while the 1983 figure for actual disbursements was only 180 DH/ha (60%).
Nevertheless, on the ground productivity per employee remains higher than in
any other major irrigation area in North Africa.  This may be due to the
quality and responsibility given to farmers in the operation of the network
within the irrigation blocs. The overall efficiency of the distribution
network between the head gate structures and the hydrants was estimated at
75% in 1984-85. It must be noted that water use during the first year of
irrigation in the Tnine Gharbia sectors was high, approaching the appraisal
target for full development. It is also interesting to note that, since the
regulations issued to deal with the shortage in 1983-84 had no significant
impact on output, it would be desirable to envisage more rigorous management
of the water resources in order to improve the return on the system now in
place. Appropriate measures were instituted as part of the Large-scale
Irrigation Improvement Project (PAGI).
1.14     §plyU4of ints and extension.  The project's four CMWs were
appropriately staffed for the distrlbution of inputs and extension. Current
intensity of extension services is one agent for every 302 farmers, or 727
ha. The supply of inputs, administered by ORMVAD, is doubtless an efficient
chanMel for conveying the extension messages, and has certainly been a key
factor in the favourable agricultural development registered in the newly
irrigated sectors. However, the lion's share of the extension agents'
efforts is devoted to distributing inputs to farmers, closely monitoring the
sugar beet crop, collecting statistics and implementing the Investment Code
regulations. There is thus little time available for the real work of
extension. The problem has been recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture
and Agrarian Reform (MARA) and steps have been taken to divert funds from
competing services as part of the Large-scale Irrigation Improvement Project
(PAGI). The establishment of an extension division in each OR14VA is
scheduled to begin in 1987.
1.15     Cost recovery.  The water charges (balance raze) of 0.029 DH/m3,
introduced in1969were increased to 0.054 DH/m3 (+86%) in June 1980.  It
was subsequently raised 0.089 DH/m3 in 1983-84 and 0.100 DH/m3 in 1985-86.
The supplementary pumping charge indexed to the price per KWh increased from
0.058 DH/m3 in 1982-83 to 0.140 DH/m3 in 1983-84 and 0.160 DH/m3 in 1985-86.
1.16     As is the case elsewhere in Morocco, water charges and the costs of
supplying other services are deducted fran the revenues fram cash crops
before the farmere receive their payment. To the extent that most of the
farmers involved in the project grow suigar beet and have obtained excellent
yields and excellent incomes, water charges have been set at a high level.
The rate of recovery of these charges is one of the highest in Morocco,
rising fram 90.3% in 1983 to 97% in 1985. ORMVAD's financial position is
the best of all the oRMVAs in the country. The operating budget has not
needed a subsidy since 1985. Debt due is dropping sharply (1.2 million DH
in 1985) both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the total amounts
collectable (para. 90). one of the consequences of the predominance of



- viii -
farms of less than 5 ha in the project area is that only 28% of the farms i.
the project area are subject to the betterment levy as stipulated by the
Investment Code, set at 8,500 DH/ha.
1.17     Economic appraisal.  The project's economic rate of return should
reach 18. i, compared to 11.6% anticipated during appraisal. This high rate
is due to crop intensities and especially to higher yields than expected for
most crops: yields for 1985-86 have in most cases already exceeded the
targets for full production set during appraisal. The additional net
benefits of the project., measured in 1986 prices, should reach DH 218 million
per year at full crop production in 1989 a'd DH 269 million per year when
forage reaches full production in 1991. Production of sugar beet and wheat
should make possible some import substitutions, resulting in a saving of
currency reserves amounting to US$11.2 million and US$3.5 million
respectively.  The relatively high level of crop intensisity achieved in 1985
(107%) had a favourable impact on underemployment. The total economic cost
of the project at 1986 prices was around DH 708 million (financial cost: DH
718 million).
The main lessons drawn frcm e2xerience and recommendations
1.18     The essential lessons to be drawn from the experience of this
project in terms of improving the design of future irrigation projects are by
and large identical with those cited in the Doukkala I project completion
report.  The following are particularly important:
i)   the presence of a decentralized project implementation
agency, such as CRMVAD or the other Moroccan
irrigation agencies, with full responsibility for the
construction, operation and maintenance of the
irrigation and drainage networks and for agricultural
development (para. 1.12);
ii)  that the same consultant prepare the master plan,
conduct the feasibility studies and the detailed
studies;
iii) to establish in advance all the physical, social and
legal implications of the land consolidation, which
must be carried out efficiently if the programme is to
succeed; and to ensure that the consolidation is
completed before the construction work begins (para. 11);
iv)  to ensure that extension activities are not diverted
by administrative responsibilities related to credit,
supplies of inputs and marketing (para 1.14); a
substantial improvement in the context of PAGI is
required;
v)   to insist that the Ministry of Finance allocate
sufficient funds on an annual basis for the
maintenance of the infrastructure.



- ix -
1.19     In addition, the Doukkala II project has shown that:
in terms of project design: it is not enough to design a
relatively sophisticated development that meets
essentially all the requirements of an irrigation
project; the consulting engineer of the Office should
also have checked the capacity of the main canal to
provide for the extension of the perimeter; the study of
the canal's regulatory equipment, which will be carried
out under PAGI, should have been conducted as part of
Doukkala II, or even Doukkala I;
- eg!u±ment 2rocurement: it is vital that the Ministry of
Finance be persuaded to allocate the funds necessary for
equipment procurement prograumes, especially when work on
the infrastructure has been carried out in advance. An
attempt should also be made to plan more rigorously
(using the PERT method, for example) the linkage bejtween
construction work and procurement: in addition to startup
delays, caused by budgetary restrictions which were
inqossible to anticipate, the periods during which many
structures were not in use   (para. 35)    resulted in
very substantial interest charges; in the future, it
would be desirable for the Ministry of Finance to be
apprised of all the consequences of budgetary
restrictions affecting infrastructure work which has
already progressed quite far;
the agency was able to provide all supervision for the
works, while for the preceeding phase (Doukkala I) it
required the assistance of a consulting engineer;
2rations:  the three-year drought (1980-83) resulted in
the impositior. of conservation measures by the agency and
the use of water to maximum effect by the farmers.
Although there was a slight drop in crop intensification
during this period, the reduction in yields was minor.
No significant increase occurred in the volume of water
used per ha cultivated when the normal rainfall resumed,
which perhaps reflects a new-found habit of wnter
conservation. A field survey amongst the farmers would
help to elucidate the problem more clearly. In addition,
the opportunity should be seized to buttress the efforts
to disseminate irrigation techniques, stressing the theme
of water conservation.  The effect of such extension
efforts could be taken into account in determining the
water requiremnts of future irrigation areas, which
would constitute an additional argument in favour of
reducing the peak flow used for calculating the size of
irrgation networks;



- x -
agricultural production: despite satisfactory results in terms of
agricultural production (yields, acceptance rate for irrigation),
the discrepancies in yields between development centres (CMVs)
would indicate the existence of significant short-term growth
potential for production through th*! concentration of effort in
extension and network management in the less advanced CMVs; it
would be relatively simple to tap this potential on the basis of an
easily drawn-up action plan;
agricultural research:  a review is needed of the concertation
machinery between the agricultural research organizations and the
RMV"s in order to iwprove applied research in the irrigated areas
and promote greater flexibility in cropping patterns.

I, GENERAL
1.       The project area forms part of the Doukkala perimeter, located to
the southwest of the Oum-er-Rbia river basin. The Oum-er-Rbia, Morocco's
second largest river, has long provided water for traditional irrigation in
the Doukkala areas, near to El Jadida, and to Tadla, near BSni Mellal, thus
paving the way for the development of modern irrigation. Six multi-purpose
dams have been built on the river and its tributaries. These include the
Im-Pcut dam, built in 1944 and the El Massira dam, completed in 1980, which
provide irrigation for the Doukkala perimeter. A master plan for the waters
of the Oua-er-Rbia basin was prepared in 1973-74 by a firm of consultants
(SCmT International), with the assistance of the PAO/IBERD cooperative
programme, with the aim of optimizing the allocation of water between the
various competing claims. The recommendations of the plan for Doukkala were
as follows: (i) the maximum development possible, based on the existing
water infrastructure, through the irrigation of the *low service' Doukkala
perimeter (approximately 60,000 ha), supplied by the existing "low service'
canal; and (ii) the preparation, for irrigation of an additional 40,000 ha,
to be supplied by a proposed *high service" canal.
2.       The present Doukkala II project (16,400 ha), constitutes the final
development phase of the "low service" perimeter, which includes:
- The First Irrigation Phase (PIP) of 27,300 ha, completed in 1975,
comprising the Faregh, Sidi.Bennour and Sidi Smail subdivisions,
with gravity irrigation, and the first sprinkler systems in the
Boulaouane area;
- The Second Irrigation Phase (SIP) of sane 32,000 ha, entirely
sprinkler irrigated, comprising the subdivisions of:
- zemamra (15,400 ha) developed between 1976 and
late 1980, finan;od by the Bank's loan No. 1201-
MoR (Doukkala I).14
- Tnine Gharbia (13,100 ha) and the Faregh and Sidi
smail extensions (3,300 ha), comprise the
Dcukkala rI project, completed between mid-1980
and mod-1986.
3.       The project area is located in three different regions:
- the Tnine Gharbia subdivision (13,100 ha) lies south
of the Zemamra subdivision on the right bank of the
main 'low service' canal, approximately 90 km south of
El Jadida;
- the extension to the Sidi Smail subdivision (1,400 ha)
lies to the east of the Thine Gharbia subdivision
around the town of Sidi Smail;
J1 See the Doukkala I project completion report of June 1982.



- 2 -
- the extension to the Faregh subdivision (1,900 ha) lies to the
southeast of it.
The climate is semi-arid, characterized by hot, dry sunmers and relatively
short, cool winters.  Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, averaging
300 me, which limits rainfed crops to wheat, maize and pulses, with very low
yiel's. Prior to the project, farms were small and fragmented, and the
fanmsrs lived in small traditional villages ("Douaras) scattered throughout
the countryside; the project area was heavily populated (95 inhabitants per
km2) and the majority of the population was underemployed. The soils are
appropriate for a wide variety of irrigated crops, although they are not
deep enough to permit the levelling necessary for gravity irrigation.
Sprinkler irrigation was therefore proposed during the preparation of the
project. Windepeed is sufficiently low (often less than 4 m/s) to permit
this type of irrigation.
4.       In addition to the Doukkala II project, the World Bank group has
also financed the following seven irrigation projects:

In addition to the irrigation projects, the Bank has financed five
agricultural credit projects (FY 66, 73, 77, 79 and 84), five agricultural
development projects centred on rainfed agriculture in the areas of Meknes
(PY 75), Pis-Karia-Tissa (FY 79), Loukkos (FY 80), Mid-Atlas (FY 82) and
Oulmis/Rownani (FY 83), one project for the production and marketing of
early ripening crops (FY 80), a forestry project (PY 82) and an agricultural
sector reform programme (FY 85). Performance appraisal reports have been

written for the agricultural projects in Morocco, covering the first three
agricultural credit projects carried out by CNCA, the Sebou I project and
Doukkala I.
5.      Government policy in the agricultural sector has always favoured
investments in the irrigation subsector.  These investments have acccunted
for more than 60% of the total investment in agriculture since 1965. After
it had assigned priority to the development of water resources through the
construction of dams and head gate structures during the 1970s, the
Government's effort was focussed on the construction of irrigation areas for
which the collection infrastructure was already in place. The policy was
supported by a comprehensive and efficient set of measures, included in the
1969 Code of Agricultural Investments (Code des Investissements Agricoles),
which constitutes a valuable framework for promoting the rational use of
agricultural resources within irrigation areas. Some of the provisions of
the code are particularly interesting, such as the following: (i) the
recovery of operation and maintenance costs and up to 40% of the capital
costs from medium-sized and large farmers (although in practice this 40%
rate of recovery of investment costs is only partially applicable, because
of the exemption from payment for the first 5 ha of properties under 20 ha;
(ii) the obligation imposed on farmers to ensure the rational use of water
and to adhere to the cropping pattern established for each irrigation area;
(iii) the limitation of land fragmentation, by imposing a 5 ha minimum on
each farm resulting from the dividing up of property; (iv) the introduction
of the legal provisions necessary for consolidation; (v) the introduction
of the provisions necessary for the imposition of water charges; and (vi)
the guidelines for the organization of technical and financial assistance
provided by Government for the development of livestock raising, tree
farming, high-yield varieties of wheat, forage crops and farm mechanization.
6.      In the wake of the budgetary difficulties experienced by Morocco in
the early 1980s, Government placed the emphasis on the retiabilitation of
existing perimeters, the improvement of operation and mai:-.tenance by
limiting the construction of new infrastructures to priority areas of small
and medium-scale irrigation.

II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES, ELEMENTS AND PROBLEMS
7.       This project constitutes the final stage in the use of all the
water resources that can be supplied by the existing main "low service'
canal which carries water from the Im-Fout reservoir. Feasibility studies
for the entire project area were completed prior to the appraisal. The
agro-industrial elements, which, although not part of the project, were
taken into account as a market for the resulting output, have been completed
by the private sector: a sugar refinery at Zenamra with a capacity of 4,000
tons per day and 400,000 tons per year, as well as a dairy in El Jadida with
a capacity of 100,000 litres per day have been operating since 1982 and 1978
respectively.
8.      The objectives of the project are as follows:  (i) to reduce
underemployment in the heavily-populated project area and improve rural
incomes by increasing the production of wheat and maize and introduction
high-yield crops, particularly sugar beet, cotton, *vegetables (except
tc,natoes) and forage for livestock; (ii) to improve the standard of living
of the beneficiaries of the project, most of whom are small farmers, by
building roads and schools and establishing new rural centres. At the time
of the appraisal, the project assigned 16,600 ha for sprinkler irrigation
spread over three subdivisions: Thine Gharbia and the Sidi Smail and Faregh
extensions.  It included the following main elements:
a)   land consolidation, the construction of farm roads, windbreaks and
drainage;
b)   the enlargement of the main supply canal over 22 km, the
construction of 10 km of feeder canals for the tiorth and West
sectors and the installation of automatic gates to regulate the
flow;
c)   the construction of six pumping stations with a total installed
capacity of 11,300 kW, each with one equalizing reservoir;
d)   the construction of underground distribution systems totalling 450
km, including hydrants, each serving some 16 ha, and mobile
equipment;
e)   the construction of 31 km of 60 kV and 62 km of 22 kV lines and one
substation;
f)   the construction of a main drainage channel (excavation of
approximately 300,000 m3);



- 5 -
g)   the construction of 40 km of new asphalt roads and 60 km of gravel
roads, and widening and reinforcement of 64 km of existing asphalt
roads and a telecommunications network linking the El Jadida
headquarters, the Zemamra and Sidi Bennour subdivisions and the
mobile units;
h) the construction of buildings and procurement of equipment
including tractors for four development centres (CMVs),
refrigerated milk collection centres in each CMY and office
buildings for operation and maintenance in the Zemamra subdivision;
i)   on-farm development consisting of the construction of cowsheds,
purchase of Friesian cattle for crossbreeding, and purchase of farm
equipment, to be financed by medium-term credit from CNCA;
j)   provision of extension services, artificial insemination,
agricultural inputs and app'.ied research;
k)   the construction of five village centres, including schools, public
water supply and public lighting; and
1)   consulting engineering services.
9.      At appraisal, the Bank again emphasized the problem of cost
recovery. mhe Government agreed to continue its effort to recover the
actual costs of operation and maintenance through water charges and a
betterment levy in Doukkala, as in all the irrigated perimeters, as well as
a reasonable proportion of the actual infrastructure costs.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Area ngipped
10.     The Doukkala II irrigation area, which covers a total equipped area
of 17,539 ha, was developed between 1980 and 1986 and ccmmissioned beginning
in 1982.

Consolidation, land distribution and ownershig
11.     The consolidation, which was completed before the sectors were
equipped, made possible:
- the creation of more viable family farms by eliminating land
fragmentation almost entirely and by prohibiting subsequent
division;
- the allocation to each family (in 70% of cases), in addition to
farmland, of a lot for building a house in the UREFs (rural
equipment and operating unit: unite rurale d'6quipment et de
fonctionnement) established for this purpose.



- 7 - .
The plots have been consolidated in ^Trame 8, which presents the
following characteristics (figure 3):
- the area of the basic irrigation units is approximately:
* 7.80 and 15.50 ha for the Tnine Gharbia subdivision depending
on the type of cropping pattern (4 fields of 270m x 72 or 144
m);
* 8.30 ha for the PTI extensions (4 soles of 288 m x 72 m)s
- the properties form parallel strips running along the entire length
of the block. The boundaries of the fields (crop strips) are at
right angles to the property lines;
- the quaternary pipes are aluminium pipes (semi-permanent units
moved only at the end of the season) fed from discharge outlets on
the hydrants. They are spaced at regular intervals varying between
approximately 80 and 300 mi, depending on the size of the fields and
the cropping pattern itself;
- land preparation can be carried out collectively parallel to the
tertiary pipes.
12.     The gross area consolidated is 19,659 ha distributed between the
Tnine Gharbia subdivision (15,325 ha) and the Paregh and Sidi Smail
extensions (2,458 and 1,876 ha respectively).  It comprises 21,618 plots for
7,532 properties (or approximately 2.90 plots per property) and 200 ha of
cammon land not included in the irrigation area.  The table below indicates

The following comments apply to the above table:
- there has been a considerable reduction in land fragmentation. The
number of plots cultivated has declined fran 21,618 to 10,042 and
average plot size has almost doubled (from 0.9 ha to 1.62 ha)J
- since the average size of the properties is small, they can be
regrouped following consolidation into single farms capable of
interesting neighbours or tenants if the owner does not wish to
farm the land himself;
-  co-ownership is cummon in the project area: 2,249 properties for
10,012 co-properties and 6,415 ha.  This comes to 4.45
co-properties per property of 2.85 ha, representing 29% of the
number and 39% of the net irrigated area;
- 19 of the planned UREPs have not yet been developed. They occupy
692 ha for 5,285 recipients, or 0.13 ha per lot for approximately
70% of owners. The remaining 30% receive irrigated land located
close to the douar in which they live.
13.     After consolidation, the land structure of the properties is
characterized by a predeminance of small farms: 71% have less than 2 ha and
represent approximately 25% in terms of area, as opposed to 0.9% with more
than 20 ha representing some 17% of the area. Table 2 of Annex 2 presents a
detailed breakdown of the land structure of the project area after
consolidation.

PrOJIec works
14.     The project involves the installation of sprinkler irrigation over
16,400 ha, covering four new sectors of the SIP and two extensions in the
FIP. The following works .-ave been copleted:
- consolidation of the areas identified by the Project (financed by
Dwukkala 1I)
- enlargaunt and installation of hydraulic equipnnt on the main low
service canal (Lot NO. 10):
- construction of a feeder cal for the West I and West II sectors
and a feeder pipe for the North s.ctor:
- construction of six equalizing reservoi s 12 m in diameter and 60 m
high, with an average capacity of 500 m3;
- procuraent and laying of the network of underground pipes;
- procureunt and installation of the hydrants;
- corstruction of drainage networks,
- improv_nt of the network of classified roads and the
establishmunt of a sugar beet area in each sector;
- construction of a new subdivision at Tnine Gharbia, of four new
developmnt centres and hosing for the extension agents and those
responsible for operating the networks in the Tine Gharbia sector;
3 layingof W power lines for the puXping stations;
sterethening of (RMAD's technical divisions for the manageent of
ths project,
- creation of 19 UMEFa to concentrate housing and enable the
inhabitants to take advantage of the plamed social and economic
facilities.
The main features of the irrigation eqitipmnt are described in Annex 10.
15.     These works, which are essential for the immediate and efficient
use of the irrigation water, were capleted in acordance with the estimates
ccMied at appraisal. The majority of the irrigation, drainage and road
networks were built as planned, with no major changes in the initial
engineering design. The cnents that were not carried out or were
changed in relation to the initial plans are:



- 10 -
- construction of pipe manufacturing plant;
- installation of windbreaks;
- procurement of tractors for the CMVs:
- establishment of an infrastructure in the UREFs;
- procurement of public works equipment for network maintenance.
16.     The construction of a plant to manufacture prestressed concrete
pipes was ehvisaged at a time when it was feared that existing plant
capacity was insufficient to meet the demand from all the projects planned
for Morocco. A bottleneck was anticipated between 1978 and 1982 (with a
temporary period in 1977 when the laying of the final sectors of Doukkala I
coincided with that of the initial sectors of Doukkala II: 22,000 ha). When
the pace of installation slowed beginning in 1978, it became apparent that
existing plant capacity was adequate and a decision was taken to forego
construction of a new plant.
17.     The windbreaks:  the failure of successive attempts to install
windbreaks in Doukkala I (see para. 4.10 of the Doukkala I PCR)i had
discouraged the Office from a similar undertaking in Doukkala IIL In
contrast to the previous project, however, it was found that a number of
large farmers had already installed windbreaks at their own expense.
PurthermDre, in light of the favourable results obtained from the
installation of windbreaks along RP 8 (130,00  plants), the Office decided
to continue the operation in 1986: 200,000 plants are in the process of
being installed according to the following plan:
RP 8      :Zemamra       -   JmSa Sabim            :  35  km
RP 126    : Zenamra      -    Thine Gharnia        :  20  km
Tnine Gharbia            -    perimeter boundary  :  14   km
CT 6512                                            :  14  km
Station West 2 - Station South                     :  10  km
CPBS           - Station North                          8   km
RP 8           - junction North feeder                  4   km
RP 8           - Station South                     :   2.5 km
Total windbreak length of                          : 107.5 km
18.     With regard to the procurement of tractors for the CMVs, the Office
decided to do away with this component of the project because of the low
return on its existing farm equipment. The U4ARA, moreover, suggested that
the other ORMVAs adopt the same policy.
19.     The infracture of the UREFs: The construction of five village
centres envisaged during the appraisal of the project has not been carried
out, in light of the negative experience of the Doukkala I project (see PCR
of this project, para. 4.11).

20.     Network maintenance equipment:  No equipment has been procured
under the project, since the Office has preferred to contract out the major
maintenance work to private companies. The Office does, nevertheless,
maintain an equipment pool (which is in the process of being replaced under
the PAGI project) for urgent, local action.
-21.     Agricultural research:  The coordination anticipated at appraisal
between oRMaND and the agricultural research services has proved lax. Since
ORMVAD doeb not participate in developing the research programmes, it
derives little benefit therefrom. Now that the INPA has embarked upon a
reorganization, improved cooperation can be expected in the future. For the
Doukkala II project, the Office has carried out applied research programmes
at the Zemamra agricultural development experimental station (SEMVA: station
exp6rimentale de mise en valeur agricole), the results of which are
applicable to the Doukkala I and II projects. The idea of establishing a
SEMVA in the Gharbia sector has been abandoned, however, as the
corresponding credits were allocated to the Zemamra SEMVA.
inlementation period of the project works and delays
22.     Most of the project works were carried out over a six-year period
between 1980 and 1986, as opposed to the planned five-year period between
1978 and 1982 (see Figure 2). At appraisal, it was expected that the first
3,600 ha would be ccmmissioned after two years, with an annual progression
of 4,330 ha for three years, for a total of 16,600 ha. In pra-tice,
however, after a two-year delay in startup, it was possible to commission
9,400 ha in 1982 after two years and to proceed at an annual rate of 1,750
ha for four years, reaching a total of 16,400 acres under irrigation by
1986. The slowing of the rate of installation coincided mainly with
introduction of budgetary restrictions, which became increasingly severe
from 1983 on.
23.     The year when the project theoretically started, 1978, coincided
with the first year of budgetary restrictions in Morocco. Work on the
project did not, moreover, begin until mid-1980, following the ccmpletion of
the Dcukkala I project.
24.      The consequences of a two-year delay in the start of the project
were, however, not entirely negative.  In particular, it made it possible to
avoid the double load of procurement for Doukkala I and II, which would
inevitably have strained the capacities of CRMVAD and caused bottlenecks in
some itens. It avoided, for instance, the construction of a pipe
manufacturing plant with benefits for the national economy.
25.      The implementation work on the Tnine Gharbia South and West
sectors, which were the first to receive first water in 1982, can be judged
to have been well planned and the necessary funds were made available on
time, so that the pumping stations, the equalization tanks and the
irrigation networks were all finished at the same time when the sector
received first water. In the other sectors, budgetary restrictions resulted
in the immobilization of substantial investments for relatively long
periods. In Tnine Gharbia North, the pumping stations and the pipe networks



- 12 -
were completed one year before first water, and the raised tank remained
unused for two years; first water was also delayed by the drought in 1983.
In the Sisi Smail and Faregh extensions, the raised reservoirs and pipe
networks lay idle for three and two years respectively because the pumping
stations were not completed.
Costs and 2rocurement
26.      Project cost.  The total project cost was DH 544 million compared
to the estimate at appraisal of DH 532 million, including physical
contingencies and inflation. If approximately DH 70 million is subtracted
from this estimate for components which were not carried out (procurement
for CMVs, UREFs etc.), the overall project cost was some 18% more than
estimated. This increase is due almost entirely to physical contingencies,
since estimates for price inflation were very close to the actual increase
of the Statistics Division's wholesale price index:
Inflation rate                 Indices
.977-79 1980-82 1982-86
t                1977   1982   1986
- Appraisal report (1977)        12       10      (10)     100    166   (243)
- Actual wholsale price index    9        15       10      100    169    250
27,      The total project cost, calculated at 1986 prices on the basis of
the wholesale price index (see Annex 1) is DH 718 million ($76 million at
the rate of 9.42 DH-$l), a unit cost of 43,800 DH/ha ($4,650/ha). Annex 10
gives a breakdown of unit prices by component.
28.      Project costs expressed in US dollars were $77.4 million, when
actual annual expenses are converted at the average rate for the year in
question. This amount compares with the initial estimate of $105 million,
taking into account deductions of some $16 million for components not
carried out. The project cost expressed in dollars was therefore 26% lower
than the initial estimate.
29.      There was practically no increase in the cost of civil engineering
works (accounting for 64% of the total), capared to the appraisal report,
while the actual cost of equipment (19% of the total), which varied widely
from contract to contract, was 50% higher than anticipated (Annex 1).
Procurement
30.      The goods and services required by the project were provided by
means of 80 contracts, all of which were financed by the Bank loan (see
Annex 9). The loan agreement stipulates that:



- 13 -
i)    except for local equipment purchases of less than $250,000,
contracts financed by the Bank shall be open to international
competitive bidding in accordantce with the Bank's Guidelines for
procurement;
ii)    individual purchases of equipment not exceeding $125,000, which
will be financed fron the Bank loan,may be procured in accordance
with local procedures up to an aggregate amount of $250,000.
31.      At appraisal, the intention was to carry out the works by means of
21 contracts, averaging on the order of $4 million. Ultimately, however,
CRMVAD was obliged to split up the works and the procurement into 80
contracts, average 6.8 MDH (or approximately $1 million). While the number
of contracts for the supply of mobile and electromechanical equipment and
the hydrants increased only from four to six, the number of civil
engineering contracts quadrupled. The Office made no attempt to avoid
international competitive bidding, since 29 out of 43 invitations for civil
engineering bids, accounting for 92% of total disbursements, were issued in
accordance with this procedure. -The main reasons cited by the implementing
agencies for not having combined the works into a smaller number of
contracts are as follows: (i) the budgetary resources provided by the
Ministry of Finance to cover the disbursements committed for and carried out
each year are quite limited; (ii) the awarding of larger contracts could
have resulted in longer delays in the implementation of the project. The
administrative and financial capacities of the bidders-all local-is
limited and is not adequate to meet the conditions set for larger
contracts. On the other hand, experience in Morocco has shown that larger
contracts would not have attracted more interest on the part of foreign
bidders; (iii) construction work on ordinary buildings was combined into a
large number of contracts on the basis of the type of work (CMVs, offices,
roads etc.) and their geographical location in the project are-A  and (iv)
contracts for the procurement and laying of the pipes were divided according
to whether the pipes were small or large diameter, so as to adapt the works
to the local market, since different suppliers and companies are hired to
lay each type of pipe.

33.     The table above indicates that:
a)   the average amount per contract is DH 6.8 million, varying bet'ween
DH 6.5 million for equipment and DH 7.2 million for civil
engineering works. The largest contracts involved:
- mobile equipment, two contracts for an average of DH 23.4
million each;
-  electromechanical equipment for the pumping stations, two
contracts for an average DH 20.7 million each:
-  the underground pipes, nine contracts for average of DH 20.5
million each;
b)   the average amount of contracts awarded through international
competitive bidding (ICB) was DH 10.7 million (maximum DH 49
million), compared to an average of DH 2.2 million (maximum DH 7.5
million) for local contracta;
c)   the total amount of contracts awarded through ICB is DH 460 (US$66
million) accounting for 85% of the total value of all contracts
awarded and 80% of the value of contracts to be awarded through ICB
according to the appraisal report. Contracts awarded on the basis
of ICB involve the enlargement of the main canal, the construction
of the pumping stations and the drainage network and the purchase
of equipment, except for the power lines and hydromechanical
equipment, for which ONE and SNCE have a monopoly.
34.     Although bids were frequently invited from foreign companies in
ac_ordance with Bank guidelines, all contracts, with one exception, were
negotiated with Moroccan companies.:
i)   a single Spanish ccmany (ABENGOA) supplied all the
electromechanical equipment for the four pumping stations at Tnine
Gharbia for a total of DH 27.4 million (some $4 million), of which
DH 16.1 million (60%) was paid directly in foreign currency;
ii)   no foreign contractor submitted a bid on the civil engineering
works, even for those involving large amounts of money, such as the
supply and laying of large diameter pipes (totalling US$13.2
million). This has also been true of most of the agricultural
projects financed by the Bank in Morocco, and was the reason why
the Bank agreed to the recommendation contained in the Sebou I and
Doukkala I Project Completion Reports to dispense with ICB for all
civil engineering works;
iii)   as far as the road construction works are concerned, the Bank
accepted local procedures, in that the Roads Directorate showed
that no foreign contractor had ever shown interest in this type of
work.

Disbursements
35.     Of the $41 million loan awarded by the Bank, the amount disbursed
as of June 30, 1986, the final closing date of the loan, was US$34.7
million. On this date, the Bank acceded to the Government's request to
continue disbursements upon presentation of requests for withdrawal of
funds, for works carried out prior to the closing date, without, however,
postponing the closing date. The delays in the forwarding of requests for
withdrawal of funds were due in large measure to personmel changes in the
Ministry of Finance,%as a result of which several requests submitted by
ORMVAD were lost within the Ministry itself.  A balance of US$3.0 million
was cancelled in 1985 under the special action prograume. The comparison
between the estimated and actual disbursements by category appears in the
following table:

IV.  AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
36.      Summary.  The development of the first three sectors that were
commissiohed in 1982-83 (some 9,400 ha), significantly exceeded the
estimates at appraisal, since the intensification rate reached 120% in the
course of this year. Subsequently, in the wake of four successive dry years
(Figure 1), the reduction in water available from the Al Massira dam
resulted in a reduction in supplies for irrigation and the decision not to
plant mast spring crops, with a resultant decline in the rate of intensity
(102% in 1984-85). This did not improve until 1985-86, when it rose again
to 107%. The increase in the water reserves at the Al Massira dam since
1985 and the equalization works on the main low service canal projected
under PAGI should under normal circumstances enable the project to achieve
the anticipated target of 144% in 1991. Livestock raising should reach full
development more quickly than in the case of Doukkala I in light of new
market opportunities (the decision by a number of industries to establish in
the area) which represent a definite factor favouring the rapid development
of intensive dairy farming and will provide processing facilities for the
substantial quantities of dairy products anticipated at full development.
Crop rotation,, land use and yields
37.     First irrigation occurred between November 1982 and January 1983
for the West 1, West 2 and South sectors (9,370 ha), and in September 1984
for the North sector (3,730 ha).  The extension sectors in the Sidi Smail
(1,400 ha) and Faregh (1,900 ha) subdivisions will be commissioned in
November 1986. In contrast to the Zemamra irrigation sectors in the
Doukkala I project, in which all types of cropping pattern from single crop
to six year rotation were represented, and in an attempt to adapt the
cropping patterns to the size of the farms, the Doukkala II project has only
three ypes of cropping pattern: monoculture (small farms), two year (small
and medium-sized farms) and four year (large farms). Pour year rotation is
the most cumnon (81.7% of the total area), followed by two year (15.7% and
single crop (2.6%).
38.     in the first year of irrigation (1982-83), the crop intensity rate
in the West 1, West 2 and South sectors registered a sharp increase from 83%
to 120%. The rate dropped in 1983-84 (108%) due to restrictions on
irrigation water imposed from April 1984 on as the water reserves in the Al
Massira dam declined after four consecutive drought years; The result of
these reductions in the irrigation quotas ("turns by outlets in a sprinkler
system, as opposed to the normal "on demand' system) and even the decision
not to plant most spring crops (no crops after cereals or beets). Although
the restrictions were lifted in the fall of 1984, the intensity rate
continued to decline in 1984-85 (102%). The reason for this may lie in the
fact that the North sector (3,730 ha, or 28% of the area of the Gharbia



- 18 -
subdivision) was cammissioned under such unfavourable circumstances and
probably also in the exaggered reduction in the cropping prograrmie by
farmers, who were afraid of the potential impact of the new water
restrictions on their crops. The improvement in the intensity rate in
1985-86 (107%) would appear to bear out this hypothesis.
39.      The table below illustrates the following points:
i)  land use has been total since the first year of irrigation in the
Gharbia subdivision;
ii)  all the crops projected in the cropping pattern have been
introduced, with the exception of cotton, while CMVAD has
introduced a numbet of new crops that were not projected, such as
soyabeans, which have become a major crop, following conclusive
trials by farmers, and which has oncreased the proportion of
industrial crops. In addition, winter vegetables which were not
part of the initial plan have doubled the area given over to
vegetables in carparison with the estimates (1,714 ha instead of
790 ha);
iki)   the projection of agricultural development at full development as
achieved by CORNMD differs markedly from that projected during
appraisal, even though the total crop acreage has remained
essentially the same (23,145 ha instead of 23,541 ha);
.iv)   the intensity rate projected for 1991 is 144%, which is a slight
--     improvemnt over the 141%.
40.      The major changes in the cropping plan involve maize, with half the
projected area (2,900 ha instead of 6,051 ha), cotton which has disappeared,
and winter vegetables and soya which were not part of the original plan.
41.      The yields achieved since the entire Gharbia subdivision received
first water have often exceeded very substantially the estimates at
appraisal: 150% for wheat and maize, 250% for summer vegetables, 122% for
alfalfa and 272% for berseem. The estimated sustained yield for sugar beet
was achieved in the first year of irrigation.
42.      The equalizing works in the main low service canal planned under
the PAGI starting in 1988 will enable development to achieve the projected
intensity (144% at full development) with no limiting factors with regard to
irrigation water.  The capital costs involved in this work corresponding to
the area of the Gharbia subdivision were taken into account in the economic
appraisal of the project.
43.     The reasons for the satisfactory results of agricultural
development in the project area can be found in the following factors:
i)  ORYAD's efficient monitoring of the farmers and the role of the
local agricultural development commission in pErsuading farmers to
adhere to the cropping patters %"d the schedules for farm work;

2 Net irrigable acreage

ii)   the predominance of small farms, which as a rule have better crop
intensity (90% of the farms are of less than 5 ha). This is why,
for example, in the case of sugar beet the analysis of the results
according to farm size shows that for the same CMV the best yields
are obtained by farms of less than 1 ha, which make up 50% of the
total number of farms (see Annex 3);
iii)   the efficiency of the services provided by ORMVAD with regard to
supplies of inputs for cereal crop, maize and sugar beet;
iv)   increasingly widespread use of improved seed varieties for the
major crops and the use of appropriate dosages of fertilizer.
Agricultural performance
44.      Sugar beet is the most successful crop, not only in the project
area but throughout the Doukkala region. This is reflected in the constant
pressure exerted by the farmers to obtain the necessary authorization from
CRMVAD to increase their acreage of sugar beet. The reason for this may lie
in particular in the high rate of return on this crop, characterized by
favourable farm gate prices and satisfactory response to modern inputs.
Sugar beet has benefitted from the high priority accorded to it for more
than twenty years by the Ministry of Agriculture. In the project akrea, most
of the extension work done by ORMVAD agents has been devoted to monitoring
the production and marketing of sugar beet.
45.     Sugar beet production is limited to the Zemamra.refinery, which
started in May 1982 and also receives the output from the Doukkala I project
area. In the context of the review of the sugar beet production system, the
transfer to the private sector is planned of some of the services at present
performed by CRMVAD (refineries, fertilizer companies) and an increase in
farmers' participation in the system of production. CRMVAD established and
chairs a Regional Technical Committee on sugar beet responsible for
monitoring the crop throughout the year. This Committee, made up of all the
parties involved (the farmers' association, the Sidi Bennour and Zemamra
refineries, the plant protection and agricultural research services), deals
specifically with aspects of extension with regard to sugar beet. In
anticipation of its gradual disengagement over a three-year period under the
PAGI, ORMVAD continues to supply farmers with seed, fertilizer and
pesticides in sufficient quantities to ensure satisfactory yields. There
has been a temporarv slowing of the extension of the programme to introduce
monogerm seed, which is more productive but far more demanding in terms of
mechanization, irrigation water requirements and vulnerability to pests,
while the cropping techniques are mastered, especially with regard to
mechanization aimed at reducing labour costs. In order to solve these
problems, CRMVAD has instituted the following measures:
i)  the introduction in the 1986-87 crop year of pesticides in
granulated form: these are more expensive but remarkably effective
(with effects lasting up to three or four months, in contrast to
the liquid pesticides used hitherto, which act on contact and are
of limited effectiveness;



- 21 -
ii)   the recruitment of an engineer specializing in plant pathology;
iii) assistance to a private company with plans to perform general work
on the entire area sown with monogerm seed, particularly since this
coincides with ORMVAD's desire to end its own involvement in this
work;
iv)   the acquisition of sowing equipment by the refineries for
'demnnstration purposes.
46.     The following observations are based on analysis of the sugar beet
yields obtained in 1984-85 (see Annex 3):
i)   the best yields are always obtairn,d by farms of under 1 ha (within
the same CMV), which may be due to the use of available family
labour;
ii)   farms of over 20 ha generally have satisfactory yields, probably
because of the size of the crop area which justifies more intensive
mechanization;
iii)   the best results are obtained by the farmers of CMV 343 (sector
North) (65 to 83 t/ha). These results prove conclusively that the
target for full development (65 t/ha) is quite feasible.
47.     Wheat is a traditional crop in the project area (more than 60% of
the land was sown with it prior to irrigation). The good yields obtained (4.
t/ha in 1985/86) are due tc the use of high-yield varieties of seed and
sufficient quantities of fertilizer as well as the excellent quality of the
land (93% of the soils of vertisols). The yields could nevertheless be
imroved further if the wheat were irrigated more intensively and the
practice of chemical weeding more widespread.
48.      Maize is also a traditional crop in the project area.  It is used
primarily for human consumption and secondarily for animal feed. It remains
the second crop in the project area, despite ORMVAD's plans to downgrade it
to last place at full development.  The problem with maize is that farmers
are reluctant to use the new varieties of hybrid seed supplied by ORMVAD.
These varieties are all imported and less resistant to disease than local
varieties, especially to sesamia disease, the chemical treatments for which
are expensive and of limited effectiveness. These problems notwithstanding,
maize yields rose from 2,9 to 4 t/ha between 1982/83 and 1985/86.
a
49.     Cotton.  The appraisal report included projections for 1,635 ha of
cotton at full development, representing 10% of the project area. At
present there is no cotton grown in the project area. Its development is
very limited even in the other irrigated areas of Doukkala: the area
planted in cotton has declined from 2,500 ha in 1971-72, to barely 1,000 ha
limited to one gravity irrigation area (Sidi Bennour). The lack of
obligation on the part of the farmers to grow cotton has had the effect of
increasing yields from 17.9 qx/ha in 1985-86 compared to only 9.8 qx/ha in
1980-81. Although this was not specified clearly in the project appraisal



- 22 -
report, feasibility studies had stressed the uncertainties surrounding
cotton plantations in the project area and as a result had recommended that
cotton be limited to no more than 5% of the total area. The reasons for the
decline of the cotton crop in the Doukkala area are as follows:
i)   the crop is far more labour-intensive, especially at the harvest;
ii)   at least six treatments per year are required for pest control,
especially pink worm;
iii)   losses have always been heavy in early fall, when the first rains
prevent the cotton bolls fram opening normally, causing a drop in
the yield of fibre seeds and affecting the quality of the fibres;
iv)   the crop season is long and harvest time (October-November)
coincides with the seedtime of the other major crops, to which the
farmers give higher priority (wheat and sugar beet);
v)   sowing is often delayed by the weather, which is relatively cool in
March;
vi)   farm gate prices do not provide enough incentive, despite a slight
increase in the past two crop years.
Al1 these reasons combined to motivate FRMVAD's decision to exclude cotton
production frcm the project objectives.
50.     Winter and summer vegetablest.  The yields have substantially
exceeded the estimates at appraisal (30 t/ha compared to estimates of only
12 t/ha at appraisa. for summer vegetables).  The total area devoted to
vegetables in 1986 was 69% larger than initial estimates (Annex 3).
51.      For!a    crop.  Yields are substantially higher than initial
estimates  12% for alfalfa and 270% for berseem, hence a slight
ccopensation in the small scale of the acreage under cultivation. Thus for
the 1985-85 crop year the area sown with green forage was no more than 10%
of the estimate for full development, and yet produced almost 20% of the
total forage target. There is obviously a correlation between the
development of forage crops and the development of livestock raising, which
is still in its infancy, as the project area prior to irrigation was
primarily a cereal growing area. Many farmers, convinced of the profit in
intensive dairy farming, prefer to grow cereals on land intended for forage
crops while accumulating the capital required to invest in livestock.
Livestock development
52.     Since this was a cereal growing area prior to irrigation, livestock
has taken some time to develop. The transformation fram a cereal farmer to
an intensive dairy farmer requires, in addition to extension efforts, other
conditions such as: (i) access to agricultural credit facilities (guarantees
and cash flow) for the construction of cowsheds and the acquisition of
purebred animals, (ii) a sufficiently well-developed network of milk



- 23 -
collection centres, (iii) the desire on the part of some farmers to build
cowsheds on the plots provided and (iv) the maintenance of farm gate prices
(fixed by the Government) that offer an incentive to the farmer. CRMVAD has
nevertheless embarked upon an extension and incentive prograume, the results
of which are becoming apparent. Starting from 8,600 head of local animals
prior to irrigation, the herd had by 1985 grown to 12,900 head, 28% of which
were purebred or of improved breeds. Since 1985, (3MVAD has installed-4n
the project area a livestock subdivision headed by a livestock engineer and
a veterinarian. Incentives have in addition been provided to a private
veterinarian to settle in the project area in 1986. The action taken to
encourage the development of livestock raising are summarized in Annex 3.
53.      The office has also established a policy package aimed at
introducing purebred or improved livestock over a seven-year period, with
the acquisition of some 400 urebred dairy cows per year.  By the end of
this period, the dairy herd should have increased to 16,300 head (35% of
which will be purebred and 55% of improved breeds), intended for mixed
dairy-beef production.

Acceptance rate of irrigation
54.      At appraisal, full developient was scheduled for 1989, seven years
after the start of the project, which at the time was expected to occur in
1982. The hypothesis was that the average yields of the project would be
achieved within five years following caomletion of the project.  The
appraisal report assumed that crop intensity would reach 141% at full
development. Experience has shown that the rate of acceptance of irrigation
progressed more quickly than expe'ted.  In 1983, the year the first sectors
of the project were ccmmissioned (para. 38) , it was 120%, declining in 1984
and 1985 as a result of the reduction in available water resources due to
the drought, and recovering in 1986. All the crops have been irrigated,



- 24 -
including wheat which the farmers tend not to irrigate. It proved necessary
to irrigate wheat when the rains failed in 1983. It is, however, probable
that irrigation of wheat will continue in future, to the extent that a
majority of farmers are now convinced that yields will rise substantially
with only five or six extra irrigations.
55.      According to new ORMVAD projections, crop intensity will reach 144%
at full development, which will be achieved in 1989 for cereals, industriaIl
crops and vegetables, and in 1991 for forage crops and livestock. The
targets for cereals and industrial crops should be substantially exceeded in
1989, based on the Lesults achieved hitherto. To the extent that sales of
green forage (alfalfa, berseem etc.) can be expected only during
exceptionally dry years, the development of forage crops will go hand in
hand with livestock development.

V.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Coordination between the implementing agencies for the project
56.      The Doukkala II project is part of the programme for the general
development of the province of El Jadida. A project Cordination cmmittee
was established, chaired by the Governor of El Jadida and includinq the
local representatives of all the Government agencies involved in the
implementation of the project: unfortunately, the Committee did not meet
during the period of project implementation. All problems arising out of
the implementation of the project were nevertheless usually discussed at the
monthly meetings of the Provincial Coordinatiorn Cacmittee, chaired by the
Governor and consisting of representatives of all the ministries involved.
Internal CRWYAD issues are dealt with by the Office Techical Comnittee,
which usually meets once a quarter under the chairmanship of the Governor.
Since 1986, a standing cammittee dealing with agricultural issues in the
province has met with the Governor usually on a weekly basis.
Organization for project implementation
57.      As planned during appraisal, ORMVAD has been the primary
implementing agency, responsible for the construction, operation and
maintenance of the irrigation networks, the drainage works and agricultural
development. The Office was assisted by consultants in the compilation of
detailed studies of the project and procurement procedures.
58.      It should be pointed out that the entire execution of the project
was supervised by the staff of the Office, in contrast to Doukkala Y for
which the Office used private consulting firms.
59.      As in the case of Doukkala I, ORMVAD's per±ornanc%  rn Uhe
implementation of the project was most satisfactory. This may be due in
large measure to the stability, continuity and qualifications of the
management of the Office throughout the period of the project. In contrast
to many Moroccan government departments and agencies, the Office has had tne
advantage of keeping the same director and virtualty all its management
staff since the actual start-up of the project in 1980.  The senior managers
responsible for construction, operation and mainterance hold degrees in
^rural engineeringw, with training in both engineering and agronomics.
Those in charge of development are agronomists from INAVHII or ragricultural
engineers with excellent backgrounds in agricultural problems in the field.
60.      As was recommended at appraisal, the Office was reorganized and,
strengthened for the implementation of the project. Four territorial
subdivisions were established in the project area responsible for
construction, operation and maintenance, agricultural development and
livestock. Prior to first water, four development centres (CMVs) were
created, one in each irrigation sector: in the South, WVest 1 and WIest 2
sectors in 1982 and in the North sector in 1983. All the new positions were
staffed on a temporary basis: ten agricultural engineers were assigned to
ORMVAD's headquarters and five agricultural engineers and veterinarians,



- 26 -
together with 38 technicians, were assigned to the CMVs. In view of the
prevailing budgetary restrictions and with the intent of increasing its own
efficiency, the Office succeeded in meeting its staffing requirements for
the project by reassigning experienced agents within the organization. Only
the key positions of subdivision directors were staffed by recruiting recent
university graduates.  The following chapters will summarize ORt4VAD's
achievements in the organization and management of the project act.vities.
Supervision of construction works
61.      ORMVAD's Construction Division established a team of engineers
responsible for supervising the works. When the work waP completed, most of
the members were reassigned to the Operations and Maintenance Division. The
Construction Division also provided qualified local personnel to assist the
consultants in charge of the detailed studies and preparing the bidding
documents.
Operation, maintenance and water management
62.      General organization.  The official organization chart of the
division responsible for operation and maintenance provides for only two
subdivisions for the entire perimeter. one of them, based in Zemamra, is
supposedly responsible for the Doukkala I and II projects. In order to
provide for more effective proje.ct management, however, the Office
unofficially created an autonomous subdivision based at Tnine Gharbia, which
in turn was organized into four Network Management Centres (CGR: Centres de
Gestion des Reseaux), each responsible for a sector (South, W1, W2 and
North). The staff assigned to this subdivision currently consists of 36
agents distributed as follows: 1 subdivision manager, three CGR managers
(one of whom is not yet operational), 4 pumping station managers, 2
operations section managers, 16 water works technicians and 10 labourers and
watchmen.
63.      The primary responsibilities of the CGRs are the operation of the
network, coordination between the pumping station and the network,
especially during the filling phase. They supervise the use of the mobile
irr2.gation equipment in accordance with the instructions they receive and
inform the subdivision of any repair work needed on the equipment they
operate. Maintenance is thus centralized at the subdivision level, which
assigns maintenance crews on request. The subdivision will be the
coordination and monitoring unit for the private companies that are
increasingly assuming responsibility for equipment maintenance under
multi-year contracts (CRMVAD's current thrust). Maintenance of the pumping
stations is the responsibility of a unit with the status of a subdivision
which is responsible for the main low service canal and all the pumping
stations within the perimeter. The taxation section of the subdivision is,
moreover, responsible for billing for irrigation water by compiling water
charges lists at the end of each crop year of water users in the subdivision
area.

65.      The table above shows that productivity per agent is much higher in
the project area than in some other large-scale irrigation areas. There may
be two main reasons for this: the coherent design of the network in general
terms and the way in which the farmers themselves are responsible for
distribution, made possible because of the well-designed system of mobile
irrigation equipment: after initial distribution, just prior to the
cammissioning of each sector, the mobile equipment becomes the property of
the farmers, who thus assume responsibility for its maintenance and
replacement. Use of this equipment aiso enables water to be distributed to
each ploc without the involvement of RMVAD agents, since the cammunity
sprinkler ramp imposes the discipline of a turns within the block.
66.      Distribution to the plot.  The irrigation network is designed to
meet water Reed  during the peak growing month of the most demanding crop in
the cropping pattern. These needs have been calculated at 2,400 m3/ha per
month, or a dose of 60 mm every 7.5 days.  The mobile equipment must
consequently exhibit the following characteristics (see Figure 3: Internal
equipment diagram):
- length of the field: 270 m or 15 positions on the sprinkler ramp
spaced 18 m apart;
number of sprinklers on the ramp: 8 or 4, with a field 144 m or
72 m;
sprinkler output: 6 mm per hour;
ramp operating time: 10 hours for a dose of 60 nm;



- 28 -
two ramp positions a   day are planned and two hours for sweating
and repositioning of the ramp after each position, totalling 24
hours; rotation arcund all 15 positions takes 7.5 days.
67.      Since the properties have been consolidated within the blocks,
perpendicular to the length of the field, the length of time each farmer
keeps the sprinkler ramp depends oip the number of positions corresponding to
the widtn of his plot.
68.      It should be pointed out that the network has not functioned as
initially anticipated for cyclical reasons having to do with lack of water
in the Al Massira dam (following four years of drought from 1980 to 1984)
and weaknesses in the equalizing system in the main low service canal which
have been corrected since the Tnine Gharbia sectors were commissioned.
69.     In order to cope with the shortage of water in the Al Massira dam
during the 1983-84 crop season, restrictions were imposed on the irrigation
doses and on crop sowing. While restrictions on the dose caused no
difficulties in gravity irrigation ( 5 hours/ha instead of 8 hours), in
sprinkler systems, where irrigation occurs on demand from the hydrant, it
was necessary to use one turn using the main network outlets, fed directly
frcm the pumping stations. The main outlets of the Zemamra and Gharbia
subdivisions were consequently divided into 3 lots, with each lot of outlets
receiving water for 5 days out of 15 during the off-peak months. During the
peak months the turns functioned with two lots each irrigating 5 days out of
10.
70.     The selection of outlets making up each lot was dictated by the aim
of achieving as regular a flow as possible in the main canal in order to
limit the impact caused by operating problems (para. 68).
71.     During the period of the severest restrictions (1983-84), the
impact of this operating system was as follows:
-  for the off-Peak Period each of the three lots of outlets was
operated for 5 days out of 15, or 2 irrigations per month. During
these 5 days the ramp had to cover the entire field, i.e. 15
positions, or 3 positions a day, with 7 hours in each position (1
hour was allowed for repositioning the equipment);
-  for the peak period, the 2 lots of outlets were operated for 5 days
out of every 10, which allowed 3 doses per month. As in the
preceding case, each dose corresponded to 7 hours of ramp operation.
Over the course of a month it was thus possible to deliver 6 mm/hour with a
dose of 7 mm/hour = 42 mm (420 m3/ha):
-  i.e.:  2 x 420 =   840 m3/ha in an off-peak month
-  or:    3 x 420 = 1,260 m3/ha in a peak month



- 29 -
which is approximately half the peak requirements for alfalfa (the MOst
demanding crop).
72.     Apart from this period of restrictions, this operating system has
been maintaiped as a temporary measure to correct the weaknesses of the
equalizing system of the main low service canal, which has caused a number
of problems since Doukkala II was commissioned. These are probably due to a
longer response time for all dam manoeuvres, together with a sizeable daily
variation in greatly increased demand (the farmers refuse to irrigate during
the night except during peak months). The turn on the outlets, by creating
a peak situation, does away with the daily variation in flow in the main low
service canal and necessitates a carefully considered combination of outlets
in each lot. It therefore offers a practical method of operating the
equalizing system on the main canal while awaiting improvements in light of
a study under way in the context of PAGI.
73.     In conclusion, it can be said that the flexibility of sprinkler
irrigation in terms of distribution to the plots constitutes a constraint
in this case as long as the problem of equalization on the main low service
canal remains uncorrected. This flexibility is temporarily limited by
imposing discipline upstream on the main outlets, by reducing to a minimum
the tine during which the system is used as a function of the crops' water
requirements throughout the crop season.
74.     Water use.  The introduction of the turn on the outlets resulted in
increased efficiency in the use of the energy consumed by the pumping
stations. The proportion of energy consumed during the night (off-peak
rate) increased from 31% during the 1982-83 crop year to 35% for the 1983-84
crop year (introduction of the turn on the outlets), to its current level of
36%. It is expected to reach 38% eventually.
75.      The volume of water delivered is neasured at the dam, at the
intakes on the main low service canal and at the pumping stations. The
overall efficiency of the feeder and distribution networks is estimated at
75%, which breaks down to 77% for the main canal, which is covered for only
10% of its length, and 97% for the underground network.
76.      Since the project was commissioned, water use on the plots has been
5,650 m3/ha for the 1982-83 crop year. This is high compared to Doukkala I,
where consumption did not reach 5,000 m3/ha for the three years following
first irrigation. Water use in the Tnine Gharbia subdivision has been as
follows:

b volume delivered to the pumping stations
77.     This intensive use of water can be explained on the one hand by the
intensification rate achieved during this crop year (120%), and on the other
by the low rainfall recorded that year (154 mm). Consumption per hectare
declined in subsequent crop years for the following reasons:
i)   in 1983-84, the restrictions imposed because of water shortages;
ii)   in the two subsequent years, the first irrigation of the North
sector (2,450 m3/ha during the 1984-85 crop year), and probably as
a result of insufficient irrigation of the cereal crops which
account for some 50% of the area planted in this sector.
78.-     The following table shows that average consumption per hectare over
the period fran 1982 to 1986 was noticeably higher in the Zenamra
subdivision (Doukkala I) than in Doukkala, despite the similarity of the
operational conditions of the networks (water restrictions, turn by outlet).

1985-86                      3,850         7,130
79.      If in future years consumption of water in Doukkala II continues at
its present low level, it would be advisable to carry out a study to
determine the raasons for this stagnation and to define what action should
be taken to improve the level of water use, since this is a necessary
precondition of attaining optimal developnent in the project area:
experience has in fact proved the existence of a direct correlation between
the intensification rate and output and the level of water consumption.

80.      Equipment maintenance.  CPMVAD's responsibility for maintaining the
irrigation equipment extends to all structures and equipment installed on
its behalf, except for mobile irrigation equipment, which is considered the
farmers' property once it is handed over to them at first water. Both the
operation and maintenance of this equipment is consequently entirely the
farmers' responsibility.
81.     Mobile irrigation equipment:  Generally speaking, mobile equipment
is poorly maintained throughout the entire irrigation area, due to the fact
that it is jointly owned and the users' inability to agree on repairs and
replacement.  The Doukkala Project Completion Report concluded that the
reason for this was to be found in supply problems, but two observations
have proved that this is not the case:
i)   the availability of inventories (acquired as part of the equipping
of se-ctors ZO0 Z2 and Z3) to farmers in the Zemamra subdivision at
very affordable prices (unchanged since the acquisition), shows
that sales are negligeable in relation to the necessary repairs.
The low level of such sales has led the companies, which were
either obliged to open stores under the terms of their supply
contracts or were contacted subsequently, have either closed down
the stores or refused to proceed;
ii)   In the Boulaouane area, which was cc missioned in 1970, the mobile
equipment is in such a deplorable state that it not only seriously
hampers irrigation operations, but continually disturbs the
operations of the pumping station because the leaks give rise to a
substantial increase in flow and cause the pressure to fall, in the
absence of flow regulators on the hydrants. In 1984 the Office
established a programme, with the agreement of the farmers in the
subdivision, to replace the entire inventory of mobile equipment;
ORIMVAD assumed responsibility for consultations with various
suppliers and with the CNCA to finance the operation (7% over five
years). Once the farmers were informed of tre prices, however, at
the conclusion of the consultations, they withdrew and have failed
to follow up on the proposals. In conclusion, it would be
desirable for CRMVAD to introduce incentives for farmers to repair
their mobile equipment or replace it when necessary.
82.     Pumping stations:  The pumping stations are maintained under two
types of contract entered into with various companies.  The first, which
involves the rewinding and maintenance of the motors, is well suited to the
needs it covers. The second, which covers the general maintenance and
repair of the stations, makes it possible to respond quickly and perform
adequate preventive maintenance; it does nevertheless have limitations and
should be reviewed in order better to determine the requirements and specify
more precisely the type of action needed. It has, furthermore, given rise
to administrative problems. These drawbacks have prompted the Office to
abandon this type of contract in its present form; consultations are in
preparation on the basis of a new rate schedule which defines in great
detail the action for which the company is responsible.



- 32 -
83.      Hydrants:  The 959 hydrants are located throughout the four sectors
of Tnine Gharbia and are accessible to riverside farmers. The frequency of
damage to them is such that it has prompted CE.4VAD to support the idea of
charging the 4sers for repairs, with a view less to recovering the costs
involved than to encouraging them to take care of the hydrants. There are a
number of indications that the users are not opposed to this policy.
84.      Underground pipes:  For the leaks in the underground pipes, many of
which are due to different rates of s4ttling, ORMVAD contacts the company
that laid the large diameter pipe, while the Networks Management Division is
responsible for the small diameter pipe. Problems with the earthworks
encountered with the latter have been resolved on a temnorary basis by the
recruitment of casual labourers while awaiting the acquisition of loaders in
the near future.
Cost recovery
85.      The loan agreement requires prompt billing for water charges and a
betterment levy. It also stipulates that the water charges be reviewed
periodically with the aim of recovering the actual operating and maintenance
costs of the project and up to 40% of the actual capital costs. In
accordance with the Investment Code, the costs are recovered by: (i) a fixed
contribution of DH 8,500 per ha. Farmers with 5 ha or less are exempted
totally from the payment of this fixed contribution, farmers with between 5
and 20 ha are exempted from charges on the first 5 ha, and farms of more
than 20 ha are required to pay the full cost; (ii) a basic volumetric water
charge. A minimum of 3,000 m4/ha is systematically debited for every farmer
in order to encourage the use of irrigation water; (iii) where appropriate,
a supplementary charge to cover the cost of energy used in pumping. The
payment of the betterment levy is due at the start of the fourth year
following the completion of the project, either by payment of a lump sun or
in annual installments at 4% interest over 17 years. The basic water charge
increases in a linear fashion and the full rate will be reached on the fifth
year following the completion of the project. The water charge is payable
annually under the provisions of the Investment Code.
86.      Billing for irrigation water:  As is true in most of the sprinkler
irrigation areas in Morocco, metered hydrants have been damaged and cannot
be used for billing farmers for the use of irrigation water. The Office has
therefore instituted the same system used in Doukkala I to establish the
water charges by applying a formula of average consumption per hectare,
determined on the basis of the volume discharged by the pumping station and
the area farmed by each farmer in the sector served by the station. The
charge for tne use of irrigation water is arrived at by applying the price
of a cubic metre of water to the consumption figure. The price of a cubic
metre of water, which is set and indexed by ministerial decree, includes two
components:
- the water charge (= DH 0.1Q per m3 at full development) is
identical throughout the Doukkala perimeter; it increases by 20% a
year over five years from the first irrigated crop year;



- 33 -
-  the supplementary pumping charge ( DH 0.16 per m3 for Thine
Gharbia), which is applied in full from the first year.
87.      The following table illustrates the variation in water charges
since the project began and the water charges for each crop year.

88.      The water charge was increased f om DH 0.054 per m3 to DH 0.089 per
m3 in September 1983 and to DH 0.10 per mtn in September 1985. The
supplementary pumping charge was increased on the rxme dates from DH 0.058
per m3 to DH 0.14 and DH 0.16 per m3. The pumping charge is indexed to the
price of a KMh.
89.      As is the case elsewhere in Morocco, the water charge and the cost
of the other services are deducted from the income from industrial crops
before payment is made to the farmers. To the extent that the majority of
the farmers in the project area grow sugar beet and have received excellent
yields and corresponding incomes, the water charge was increased.  The rate
of recovery of this charge is in fact the highest in Morocco, rising between
1983 and 1985 from 90.3% to 96% and 97%.
90.      The compilation of user lists for water charges posed the problems
of serious delays as the Doulkala irrigation area was extended to new
perimeters, and so CRMVAD undertook the necessary steps to carry out this
operation using data from the sugar refineries, pending the coming on stream
of its own data processing equipment planned in the context of the overall
computerization of PAGI.
91.      In light of the predominance of small farms of less than 5 ha and
the exemptions provided for under the Investment Code, only those owners
farming approximately 5,100 ha (31% of the project area) are subject to the
betterment levy. At current levels for water charges and the betterment
levy, applied in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Code,
approxbiately 60% of the EM Costs are recovered (including the cost of the
energy used in pumping) and a small proportion of the capital cost. The
recovery of capital costs will in all probability remain a topic for
discussion in future irrigation projects in Morocco financed by the Bank.

CaUMD'.s financial position is the best of all the CRMVAs in Morocco. Its
operating budget has not required a subsidy since 1985. Arrears (DH 1.2
million in 1985) are decreasing sharply in absolute terms and as a
percentage of the outstanding amounts, as the above table shows.
Disen gannt from csmpeting services or those which are caommrcial in nature
92.     In the context of its disengagement from activities that do not
fall directly within its mandate and in accordance with the provisions of
the PAGI, ORMAVD, together with the other Offices, has embarked on. a
programun in a number of ateas:
i)   V"ins farmers with ints:  negotiations are under way with the
ugar refineies and fertilizer companies to transfer to them those
activities that do not fall within the context of its extension
programme. 8eginning with the 1986-87 crop year, ORMVAD will bill
at a rate of 9% of the value of the products it distributes.
Accredited private sector dealers currently distribute 95% of the
quantities of fertilizer (sane 200,000 qx) in addition to those
required for the sugar beet, cotton, maize and soft wheat
('integrated operation);
ii) other services: Beginning with the 1986-87 crop year, ORMVAD will
Sill as highas possible a proportion of the actual cost of jobbing
services, service stations, artificial insemination and poul.try
promtion stations;
iii)   d     aigLngement from veterinary services:  ORMVAD instituted a pilot
pro3ftt in 1984 to encourage the opening of private veterinary
practices (6 in 1986 compared to only one in 1984), to which it
transferred responsibility for a portion of the coamunity
. preventive care and all the treatment: this initiative freed human
and material resources for reassignment to extension activities;
iv)   disenqagement from the financial management of the cooperatives
under the agrarian reform and live.icock programes when they have
been in operation for five years.

Extension and supply of inputs and services
93.      The CMVs are the basic unit in which the plant and livestock
developrent activities are integrated. Each CMV has at least one manager,
one office employee, one employee responsible for the supply of inputs and
several extension agents. The current ratio is one extension agent for 302
farmers and 727 ha, which is close to that of the Doukkala I project at
appraisal (278 farmers and 565 ha per extension agent). The CMV also has
two livestock agents (one dairy cooperative manager and one inseminator).
94.      CRMVAD's role in the organization and administration of supply
services has without a doubt been a key factor in the agricultural
development of the new irrigated sectors. For those crops for which it
supplies inputs (sugar beet, wheat, maize and forage crops), aRMVD
determines the appropriate varieties of seed on the basis of recent
research, as well as the type and quantity of seed, fertilizer and
pesticides per hectare and specifies when the farmers will fetch and use the
inputs. Every year a considerable quantity of inputs moves through atMVhD's
depots: in 1986, approximately 3,500 tons of seed and 13,,100 tons of
fertilizer were distributed. axMVD has decreased the farm machinery
services it provides to farmers in light of their lack of effectiveness, as
is the case in all the development offices in Morocco. In 1986, less than
10% of the preparation of the land for the sugar beet crop was done with
RHMVD's equipment, while the remainder was carriied out by the farmers
themelves and by private companies.
95.     Beginning in the sumner of 1986, O$MVAD embarked upon a major
reorganization designed to improve the coordination of its responsibilities:
i)  an individual was designated in each subdivision, chosen from the
current subdivision managers (in Doukkala I and II the head of the
agricultural production division) to be responsible for
coordinating the activities of the various divisions.throughout all
the subdivisions (agricultural production, livestock, management of
the irrigation networks, equipment);
ii)   the director of the CMV will henceforth be responsible for the
activities of all the Office's agents in his geographic area
responsible fcr development (extension, livestock agents and
ditchriders),
iii) the establishment within the CMV of four separate sections
(services, extension, agricultural credit and cooperation, plant
protection), aimed at freeing extension agents from purely
admitnistrative tasks so that they can devote themselves entirely to
extension activities.



- 36 -.
Marketing
96.     No major marketing problems have surfaced.  The sugar beet crop is
delivered to the Zemamra refinery, which has been operating since May 1972
with a capacity of 4,000 t/day and 400,000 t/year. No problems have been
caused by the additional production fran the Faregh and Sidi Smail extension
sectors.  In the case of milk, a few problems were encountered with the
availability of refrigerated trucks in those sectors with no collection
centre (South, West 1 and 2). These difficulties had to do with the
ccmpetitive bidding procedure which delayed the start of the centres until
1986. The centres play a key role in the development of intensive dairy
farming. The milk is delivered to the dairy in El Jadida, which has been
operating since 1978 with a capacity of 100,000 litres per day. No
marketing problems are expected with regard to the future development of
dairy production in the project area (40 million litres at full
development), since the existing plant and private businessmen are
interested in processing this output. No vegetable processing units have
cammenced operations in the Doukkala I and II project areas, despite plans
for a number of private sector projects (tomato canning, vegetable packaging
etc.).
Consultants
97.     Consultants have provided valuable assistance to ORWMAD in carrying
out detailed studies of the irrigation, drainage and road networks. Five
consultants were recruited:  three engineers (electromechanical, rural
engineering and civil engineering) and two assistant engineers. It is worth
noting that the feasibility studies and detailed studies for Doukkala II
were carried out by the same firm that prepared the Master Plan for
Oum-er-Rbia in 1975 (SCET-MAROC).
Audit
98.     In contrast to Doukkala I, for which no audit took place, audits
for Doukkala I: took place for the three fiscal years 1983, 1984 and 1985
and the reports were forwarded to the World Bank on schedule. Annex 8
summarizes the system for auditing atMVADs accounts by the Ministry of
Finance. It is, however, worth pointing out that an "a posteriori" auditing
system will be used for the project contract for the Development Programme
that will be signed between the Government and CRMVD in 1988.
Performance of the Bank
99.     As was the case with Doukkala 1, no major problems were encountered
during the preparation, appraisal or implementation of this project. This
was due in part to Morocco's long experience in the design of modern
irrigation areas, especially the application of OTrame B", which proved
particularly well suited to the conditions in Dcukkala (paras. 11-13).
A further explanation is to be found in the skill of CRMVAD's management
team and by the quite exceptional degree of continuity amongst senior
project managers. Under these circumstances, the Bank had the benefit of
excellent cooperation and succeeded in establishing a constructive dialogue



- 37 -
with the project managers. The implementation of the project was,
furthermore, closely monitored by the Bank, which sent twelve supervisory
missions during the six years of implementation (64 man/days). Only 22
man/days, however, were allocated to the appraisal at the end of the
project. The Bank representatives came from varied backgrounds and included
an agronomist, an irrigation engineer and an economist (see Basic Data Sheet,
page ii).
100.     Apart from the successful implementation of the project, it would
appear in retrospect that the appraisal hypotheses were fairly conservative
in at least two areas:
a) The preliminary project studies and the appraisal were based on a
cadastral study limited to a small part of the project area. This
partial study indicated that there were only a few small farmers in
the project area. During implementation, however, it became
apparent that small farmers actually predominated in the area.
Although the discrepancy could have had serious consequences for
the design and cost of the project works, no such major impact was
noted because of the flexibility of the aTrame B' adopted. The
success of the land consolidation operations (paras. 11-15)
greatly facilitated the extension of the project.
- The estimates for yields at full development proved to have been on
the conservative side. As table 1, Annex 3 shows, yields obtained
during the first year of irrigation were higher than the appraisal
estimates for full development. Current forecasts are for yields
to increase still more at full development, especially if the
specified cropping and irrigation practices are adhered to. These
yields, together with the unexpectedly rapid acceptance of
irrigation, are the major factors contributing to a sha.p increase
in the project's economic rate of return compared to the estimates
at appraisal (para. 107).

Vlo A POSTERIORI ECONOMIC APPRAISAL
Benefits of the project
101.     Production:  The appraisal report assumed that, without the
projec .trouco  in the project area would continue to belteto dry
farifng of durum wheat (30), maize (10%), pulses (10%) and barley (30%) and
the production of nilk and beef based on grazing, all of which would show
low levels of yield and output. This hypothesis appears reasonable and has
been retained in this report.
102.    With the p roject,  the appraisal report anticipated: (i) production
based entirely onpinkler irrigation including all the crop and livestock
production without the project" (except pulses), plus a diversification
into sugar beet, cotton, summer vegetables, alfalfa, berseem and other
forage crops; (ii) full production in 1989; (iii) an inrease in crop
intensity from 83% to 141%; (iv) relatively high yields, including net
incremntst in 'without project" crops. Compared to the estimates in the
appraisal report, CRMVAD currently anticipates: (i) a slightly modified crop
model (described in chapter V); (ii) full production (i.e. 100% of the yield
estimates in the appraisal report) two years earlier than forecast, i.e. in
1987. for annual crops and slower development, i.e. in 1991, for forage
crops and livestock; (iii) slightly higher crop intensity than forecast
(144%); and (iv) yields markedly higher than the estimates in the appraisal
report (up to 100%) for all crops (see the table at para. 39).
103.    Irrigation water, by contrast, did not become available until an
average of two to three years later than anticipated in the appraisal
report. The first 9,063 ha (56.5% of the perimeter) were commissioned in
Novenber 1982 instead of in late 1980 and the full development of the
project is expected when the extensions are conmissioned at the end of 1986
instead of 1983.

104.    The new projections for agricultural yields at full development are
extrapolated from the actual yields obtained during the first year of
irrigation (1985-86), which exceeded most of the appraisal report estimates
for full development, even though not all of the farming and irrigation
practices had been adopted by the farmers (e.g. sugar beet, for which CMV
343 achieved average yields 30% to 40% higher than those of the other three
cl4Vs).



- 39 -
105.    As a result of these revised projections of increases in crop
intensity and especially in yields, total production at full development
should be more than double that forecast at appraisal. The following table
compares the estimates of 'without the project" production and production at
full development contained in the 1977 appraisal report and in this
cwpletion report. The table shows that, according to current projections,
production at full development should be significantly higher than initia*ly
forecast, especially in the case of sugar beet, swmer and winter vegetables
and forage crops. Relatively small declines are anticipated for sm  other
crops (cereals, maize and cotton). Asred markets exist for the entire
sugar beet output in the refineries in the area. Forage production should
almost all be consumed on the farm or sold within the perimeter. No
problem are anticipated in the marketing of milk, meat, cereals or
vegetables in local markets or in nearby urban centres.

Project costs
106.     The total economic costs of the project are approximately OH 708
million at 1986 prices. This figure is calculated by deducting the levies
from actual expenses and adjusting these expenses for local and
international inflation. At full development in 1991, the annual economic
costs of the operation and maintenance of the irrigation network should
reach DH.5.5 million, and energy costs DH 18.6 million at 1986 prices.
Replacement costs for the initial capital investment have been calculated on
the basis of the reasonable useful life expectancy adopted by the appraisal
report for each type of equipment. The economic cost of additional labour
for the project was calculated initially at DH 4 per day, correspondiuig to
the value of output without the project. In the PCR labour costs have been
calculated at DH 20 per day (the minimum agricultural wage), corresponding
to the incremental value of rainfed production. During the sugar beet
harvest, however, daily wages as high as DH 60 have been recorded in the
project area.
Economic analXsis
107,    Based on the costs and benefits presented above and assuming a
project life of 40 years, the project's economic rate of return is estimated
at 18.7% (compared to an estimate of 11.6% at evaluation). The main reasons
for this improvement are: (i) the crop intensity under irrigation, which
should increase more rapidly and reach higher levels at full development
than was anticipated at appraisal; (ii) agricultural yields per hectare are
much higher than forecast and in 1985-86 substantially exceeded the targets
for full development; and (iii) full development was achieved earlier than
expected, except for forage crops. The project's actual rate of return will
probably exceed 18.7%, since the economic appraisal takes into account only
the value of the forage and not the downstream benefits to livestock. The
cutoff rate for lowering the economic rate of return to 12% corresponds to a
reduction in the benefits of the project to 40%, which is the result of a
combination of factors, including the underestimates of the yields and
unfavourable trends in the price of inputs or production. A more detailed
sensitivity analysis is given in table 6 of Annex 6.
Farm incomes
108.    The appraisal report included five farm models. The completion
report proposes that this be reduced to four models, defined as follows:

It should be noted that the nubter of farm  under 2 ha greatly exceeds the

109.     The table below indicates the estimated financial rate of return
for each farm model, before and after the deduction of fixed costs. The
figures in the appraisal report for "without the project' and full
developrent have been increased by 149% to take into account local inflation
between 1977 and 1986 and permit an Approximate camparison with the models
used in the PM.  The table shows that: (i) for the farm motdels of 0.5 ha, 2
ha, S ha and 25 ha, the estimated net incomes at full development forecast
by the appraisal report were between 5 and 15 times higher than the
estimated incomes 'without the project"; (ii) for the same farm models, the
estimates in the PCR are, however, significantly lower than those in the
appraisal report; (iii) net income per ha is highest (US$2.044/ha) for the
0.5 ha model and lowst (Us$1.173/ha) for the 6 ha model, which reflects a
difference between the types of crop and crop intensities and the type of
livestock; (iv) the net income per capita forecast by the PM for the 6 ha
and 25 ha farm models, expressed in dollar equivalents, is respectively
US$1,029, which is a high level of average income, and US$5,349, an income



-43 -
level six times higher than the "without the project" figure; and (v) the
PR estimate of net annual income for the 0.5 ha and 2 ha farm modela is
US$1,022 and US$3,850 respectively, which at 5.7 persons per family
represents US$179 and US$675 Per capita. In contrast, per capita income
"without the project" is only US$74 for the 2 ha farm model and US$198 for
the 6 ha model, which is still below the absolute poverty level. The main
reason for the deterioration of the PR estimates in comparison to those of
the appraisal report with regard to net income at full production would
appear to be a rise in farm gate prices which is slower than the general
rate of inflation. The farm models adopted by the PR are presented in
detail in Annex 7.

illustrate the efforts undertaken by CRMN'D to promote the development of
intensive livestock raising:
i) establishment of 4 service stations (1 per CMV), with 8 purebred
breeding bulls with three trained travelling inseminators equipped
with artificial insemination equipment;
ii)    distribution of almost 400 purebred in-calf breeding cows imported
fran FR1 for 51 farmers between 1983 and 1986:
iii.)    creation of a $nursery  with 150 purebred cows (CMV 342) to supply
mnall farmers in the subdivision with breeding cows and provide the
necessary technical supervision (milk quality control, artificial
insemination and dissemination of rational livestock feeding
techniques);
(iv)   dissemination of new methods of.feeding livestock and preserving
forage through awaLeness days on ensilage techniques and trials
conducted with 11 farmers (CMV 342 and 343);
(v) establishment of 4 dairy cooperatives with a mandate to manage the
milk collection centres;
(vi)   granting subsidies to livestock farmers (acquisition of purebred
cattle, construction of cowsheds and pens) totalling DH 217,230
between 1983 and 1985;
