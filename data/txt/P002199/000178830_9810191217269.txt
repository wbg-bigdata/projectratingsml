APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a highway maintenance project for which
an Association Credit of US$15.0 million is proposed. The project is the
second part of an ongoing maintenance program, the first part of which was
financed by IDA Credit 299-RW under the Second Highway Project. The objective
of this project is to continue improvement of road betterment and maintenance
operations throughout the country and to strengthen the capabilities of the
Road Branch. In so doing, the project will prevent deterioration of the road
network, essential to the economy which is dominated by agriculture and
which depends almost exclusively on agricultural exports.
ii.       The project consists of:  (i) a four-year betterment program to
improve 500 km of gravel roads, to rehabilitate or upgrade another 1,000
km of roads to gravel standards, and to seal about 100 km of heavily traf-
ficked paved roads; (ii) a four-year program to strengthen and expand routine
maintenance operations, especially manual, on about 3,500 km of paved and
unpaved roads; (iii) a training program for maintenance personnel at all
levels; and the equipment, vehicles, workshop facilities, materials, and
technical assistance necessary for project implementation.
iii.      Total project cost is estimated at US$23.7 million, excluding
taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of US$17.6 million.
The project will be financed by an Association Credit of US$15.0 million
which will cover about 63% of total project cost and 85% of foreign costs.
Other external sources will provide about US$6.1 million, and the Government
US$2.6 million excluding taxes. The Government will also provide about US$6.7
million for recurrent costs over the four years.
iv.       The bulk of equipment and workshop tools will be procured after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
Spare parts, fuel and materials for the betterment program and the construc-
tion of workshops and classrooms will be procured either on the basis of
prices negotiated with established suppliers or through local competitive
bidding in accordance with Government procurement procedures acceptable to
IDA. Contracts of consultants already employed on the Second Highway Project
will be extended under terms of reference and conditions acceptable to IDA.
v.        The proposed investment for the betterment program is economically
sound, yielding an overall economic return in excess of 100%. For the improve-
ment work, the rate of return is in excess of 150% while for the rehabilitation
and upgrading, it is 35%.
vi.       Subject to the conditions outlined in para. 6.02 of this report, the
project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$15.0 million to the Government of
Rwanda on standard terms.

APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed Fourth Highway Project is the second part of a program
to carry out important betterment work and to strengthen and expand Rwanda's
road maintenance capacity. The need for better road maintenance has been of
Bank concern since 1967 when the Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa prepared
a project to study road maintenance and to purchase emergency maintenance
equipment. At that time the Government elected to seek financing from the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for detailed engineering of the
Gisenyi-Ruhengeri road as well as for the highway maintenance study. Re-
commendations of that study, prepared by the Italian Consultants, Electro-
consult, were scaled down in the light of existing financial and human re-
sources to form the basis of the present maintenance operations. The result
of these operations include reduced transport costs, improved access to
export routes, and more rapid communication between domestic centers of
economic activity.
1.02      The Government, with the assistance of Consultants (Rhein-Ruhr
Ingenieru-Gesellschaft: RRI, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)), prepared the
maintenance program, the first phase of which was financed under the Second
Highway Project (Cr. 299-RW), in conjunction with Government contributions and
grants from UNDP and the Federal Republic of Germany. The first phase did
not fully accomplish the work planned, because of a variety of initial insti-
tutional and financial problems, including the unexpectedly high inflation
rates after 1973, the delay in starting up due to the slow mobilization of
consultants, problems in starting the training of local staff, delayed delivery
of equipment, etc. Implementation of the present project, which is the continu-
ation of the Second Highway Project, will, however, proceed more smoothly since
equipment procured under the project has arrived, technical assistance is in
the field and staff training is well underway.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission com-
prising M. Melegari (Engineer) and M. Le Blanc (Economist) who visited Rwanda
in February-March 1977.
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Geographic and Economic Setting
2.01      The Republic of Rwanda is 2a landlocked Central African country
covering an area of about 26,000 km (see Map). Almost all of its external
trade passes through Uganda, Kenya or Tanzania and is contingent on
political developments beyond Rwanda's control. The topography, which
changes from rugged mountainous terrain in the west to a rolling plateau
scattered with swampy valleys in the east, makes road construction costly
and transportation difficult.



2.02      The population, currently 4.3 million, is growing at an annual
rate of 3%.  Rwanda is one of the most densely pupulated countries in2
Africa with an average of 165 inhabitants per km but over 300 per km in
t>-, --untry's more fertile western half where year-round rainfall permits
several crops annually. The population is predominantly rural. Kigali,
the capital and largest city by far, has a population of about 80,000 and,
in the last four years, has shown an average growth of 17% per year.
2.03      Agriculture dominates Rwanda's economy and agricultural exports
(mainly coffee, tea, pyrethrum) provide about 90% of the foreign exchange
needed for essential imports. Per capita income in 1976 was estimated at
US$127 of which only about 60% is accounted for in monetary terms. The in-
dustrial sector is small, consisting of some light industry in Gisenyi,
Kigali, Ruhengeri, and Cyangugu; most manufactured goods, fuel and some
food items are imported. Tourism, though still very limited, is in-
creasing at Gisenyi on Lake Kivu in the northwest and at the Akagera Na-
tional Park in the northeast.
B. The Transport System
2.04      The transport system relies on a very dense network of poorly
maintained roads. There are no railroads, and the only water transport, on
Lake Kivu, is of no real significance. Scheduled air transport is limited
to international connections through Kigali, the only airport equipped to
handle long-range jet aircraft. The dominance of road transport precludes
any problems of intermodal coordination. Chapter 3 gives details of the
road subsector.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.05      Rwanda's primary transport policy is geared to improving its access
to export-import markets and consequently to the port of Mombasa or, alterna-
tively, to Dar es Salaam. Toward this goal, the First Highway Project (para.
2.08) will expedite transit to Mombasa via Uganda. Access to Dar es Salaam was
partially facilitated by improvement to paved standards of the Kigali-Rusumo
road under a Chinese-financed project; the European Development Fund (FED,
Fonds Europeen de Developpement) is considering financing improvement of the
Rusumo-Lusahenga road, the remaining unimproved section of the road within
Tanzania linking Rwanda to Dar es Salaam.
2.06      A second transport objective, that of improving interregional
connections, involves a long-term plan to facilitate the country's social
and economic integration by reconstruction or improvement of primary routes
linking Kigali with the various regions of the country. The Government also
recognizes that much can be done to improve the condition of the existing road
network through better maintenance.



2.07      Road investment proposals are prepared by the Ministry of Public
Works and Infrastructure (MPWI) and reviewed by the Plan Secretariat and the
Ministry of Finance. Planning is adequate, and the choice of roads for
upgrading as well as construction standards are appropriate.
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement
2.08      The Bank Group has undertaken three road projects in Rwanda.  The
first, financed by a US$9.3 million IDA credit (196-RW) approved in 1970 and
amended by the Association in 1975 to US$18.8 million, provided for the const-
ruction of the Kigali-Gatuna road, the final link in an all-weather road
joining Kigali via Kampala and Nairobi to the port of Mombasa. The project was
completed in late 1977, having encountered many delays due to slow mobilization
of the contractor, shortages of materials, increases in construction quantities,
poor consultant supervision, and slow bureaucratic procedures. Cost overruns
resulted from the severe inflation in 1973-74 and from currency realignments.
2.09      A second project approved in 1972, consisted of a program to reor-
ganize and strengthen highway improvement and maintenance operations. The
US$3.0 million credit (299-RW), amended in 1977 to US$4.2 million, helped
finance a total project cost of US$7.2 million, increased from an appraisal
estimate of US$5.1 million. Project completion was delayed from 1976 to the
end of 1977 by: slow mobilization of expatriate experts; slow delivery of
equipment and vehicles and periodic fuel shortages due to frequent border
closures between Uganda and Kenya; and shortages of Government funds. Reduced
operations and cost overruns resulted. At project completion, about 65 km of
the planned 243 km of roads were improved, and 215 km of the planned 344 km
were rehabilitated; 23% of the work was done in 1975, 32% in 1976, and 45% was
done in 1977. However, in spite of the problems encountered, some gains have
been made. The number of local staff, for example, has grown (para. 3.13) and
would benefit further from the training offered under the proposed project
(paras. 4.11-4.12).
2.10      The third project, financed by Cr. 475-RW approved in 1974, in-
volved improvement to paved standards of the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road (60 km).
Having encountered problems similar to those which plagued the First High-
way Project, project execution was completed in June 1977. The total project
cost increased to US$8.7 million from the appraisal estimate of US$7.7 million;
part of this increase (US$0.4 million) was financed by IDA under the supple-
mentary financing credit for the First Highway Project.
3. ROADS
A. The Network
3.01      The road network, totaling about 6,300 km, is one of the most dense
2
in Africa, with an average 250 m per km  . It is divided into two classes:



- 4 -
(i) the national network (2,400 km), maintained by RB and comprising about
350 km of bituminous-surfaced roads, 280 km of recently regravelled roads,
770 km of very old gravel roads 1/, and 1,000 km of earth roads; and (ii)'
the district network, consisting of 3,900 km of earth roads, maintaft'-d bI"
local authorities. This classification, however, is only functional and
unrelated to the standards of roads. All roads that are not bituminous-
surfaced or recently regravelled are low standard earth roads characterized by
corrugated surfaces, large ruts and potholes, and, in wet weather, by deep
mud.
B. Traffic
3.02       Since 1971, overall traffic has grown at an average annual rate
of about 10%. Traffic volumes were estimated by RB, with assistance from
consultants, on the basis of simple counts on selected roads but with no
origin-destination surveys. According to these counts, which are made at
irregular intervals and not fully reliable, about 1,300 km of roads have an
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of 100-300 vehicles per day (vpd) and 850 km have
an ADT of 30-100 vpd, excluding traffic in urban areas. Trucks still account
for a large ADT portion, varying from 25% to 50%, and on the Kakitumba-Kayonza
road, at present the only route for export-import traffic to and from Uganda
and Kenya, trucks account for 80% of ADT. The proposed project would continue
the training of local staff provided under the Second Highway Project to
improve the quality and reliability of traffic counts and to conduct origin-
destination surveys (para. 4.12).
3.03      During 1967-71, the vehicle fleet grew at an average annual rate of
18%, declining in 1971-76 to an annual rate of 13% because of rising fuel
costs. At the end of 1976 the registered fleet totalled about 13,000 vehicles,
of which 7,150 (55%) were passenger cars, 4,200 (32%) light trucks and vans,
and 1,650 (13%) heavy trucks (Table 1). This represents a vehicle density of 3
vehicles/1,000 persons, as compared to less than 2 vehicles/1,000 persons in
Ethiopia and 11 vehicles/1,000 persons in Kenya. The 13% average annual
growth rate of the vehicle fleet does not compare with the 10% average annual
growth in road traffic because (i) passenger cars, which have the highest
growth rate, are mainly used in towns where no counts are made; and (ii) local
trucks have replaced foreign carriers so that new registrations have increased
by 13% annually even though the actual number of trucks on the roads increased
more slowly.
3.04      Fuel consumption by road vehicles has increased at an average
annual rate of 16% since 1971. The increase in fuel consumption is higher
than traffic growth because traffic counts exclude urban areas (Table 2).
1/   These roads, 10-20 years old, have never been regravelled, and their
gravel surface has almost entirely worn off.



3.05      The typical axle-load in Rwanda of a 12 ton truck and 18 ton trailer
is 8-9 tons, and that used for the design of roads is 13 tons. Overloading is
for the most part prevented by steep gradients, which are common. Government
is revising the still effective 1958 Belgian vehicle control regulations, which
provide for a maximum axle load limit of only 5.5 tons for a single axle and 4
tons for a tandem axle. This low axle load limit will be revised upwards to
the design capacity of the roads, that is, 13 tons.
C. Road Transport
3.06      Rwanda's internal freight transport is handled by:  TRAFIPRO 1/ with
about 30 trucks and a few tractor-trailers carrying about 25% of the imports
(25,000 tons) and collecting 30% of the coffee (5,000 tons); OPROVIA 2/ with
about 20 trucks to haul approximately 16,000 tons of crops and other goods,
such as flour; some agricultural companies; and a number of private owner-
drivers.
3.07      All international transport is done by two competing Belgian forward-
ing agencies, Agence Maritime International (AMI) and Transintra, which do not
have trucks of their own but act as forwarding and receiving agents contracting
with private Kenyan and Rwandese carriers. Among Rwandese carriers the Societe
des Transports Internationaux de Rwanda (60% Government-owned, 40% multinational)
is the most important with about 100 tractor-trailers, followed by Majyambere,
a domestic operator, with 25 tractor-trailers. There are also small domestic
truckers who generally operate as sub-contractors because of heavy border
tolls on vehicles in Kenya and Uganda.
3.08      A public bus company, Regie des Transports Publics (RTP) under
the Ministry of Post and Communications (MPC), provides intercity passenger
service on 21 routes which cover about 2,000 km with approximately eighty
45-seat buses and twenty 24-seat buses throughout the rural area. A large
number of pick-ups operate as taxis; although dangerous and not licensed
for passenger service, they are extremely popular by being cheaper, stopping
on demand, and allowing passengers to board with any type of baggage.
3.09      There is little regulation of the trucking industry and few admin-
istrative restrictions on the importation of vehicles. A readily obtainable
1/   TRAFIPRO (Travail, Fidelite, Progres) is a locally owned cooperative
created in 1965 with Swiss assistance.
2/   OPROVIA (Office National pour le Developpement et la Commercialisation
des Produits Vivriers et des Productions Animales) is a Government
organization for the development and commercialization of agricultural
products, created in July 1975.

vehicle license is all that is needed to enter the trucking business.
Tariffs vary, and competition is fairly strong, despite the existence of
Government-controlled transport companies and Government fixed rates. Per-
mits for passenger transport are available to anyone having a vehicle with
seats, insurance for the vehicle and passengers, and a good conduct certi-
ficate.
D. Financing
3.10      Annual contributions of road users to Government revenues averaged
US$2.5 million equivalent at current prices between 1971 and 1976, increasing
at an average annual rate of 22% from about US$1.5 million equivalent in 1971
to US$4.0 million equivalent in 1976. Revenues in 1976 were 41% from import
duties on fuel, 27% from vehicles, 8% each from spare parts and tires, and
16% from a combination of border tolls (US$30-60 equivalent per vehicle) and
annual vehicle registrations (US$13-500 depending on weight) (Table 3). Total
expenditures for roads, including external financing, have far exceeded road
user contributions. Recurrent expenditures for maintenance, however, have
been less than 50% of road users' contributions (Table 4) but 3% of total
current Government revenues.
3.11      Total expenditures 1/ for roads, including foreign assistance, in-
creased dramatically from about US$1.1 million equivalent in 1971 to US$16.9
million equivalent in 1976 (Table 4). Capital expenditures increased from
US$650,000 in 1971 to US$15.2 million in 1976, and recurrent expenditures in-
creased from about US$400,000 in 1971 to US$1.7 million in 1976. The total
foreign aid supporting this growth increased from US$245,000 equivalent in
1971 to US$13.9 million equivalent in 1976. In contrast to the great rise in
total expenditures for roads, Government contributions to capital and recur-
rent costs increased at an average annual rate of 30% from about US$800,000
in 1971 to US$3.0 million in 1976, and expenditures for road maintenance in-
creased at an annual average rate of 20% from about US$400,000 in 1971 to
US$1 million in 1976 (Table 4). Maintenance expenditures, however, are still
below adequate levels, estimated between US$2.5-3.0 million, and the proposed
project addresses this problem. [During project execution, road betterment
work will substitute for a portion of the presently required maintenance and
therefore an amount of funds less than US$2.5-3.0 million will be needed.]
Road user revenues will be more than adequate to meet the recurrent costs
over the project period (para. 4.24).
E. Administration
3.12      The existing organization of RB under MPWI is shown in Chart 1.
RB is responsible for road construction and maintenance of the national

network (2,400 km) while local authorities are responsible for the district
network (3,900 km). RB includes three technical departments: the Planning
and Engineering Department, which also supervises works; the Workshop and
Warehouse Department for the equipment and vehicles pool; and the Works
Department for road construction and maintenance. In addition, one adminis-
trative division is responsible for staff administration and unit costing
of maintenance operations. Although RB's organization is generally adequate,
the Workshop and Warehouse Department, whose management is financed by FRG,
has become too autonomous of RB, and this increased independence has undercut
inter-departmental coordination and efficiency. This situation will be correct-
ed under the proposed project (para. 4.14 and Chart 2).
3.13      Until the end of 1975, RB had 11 technicians, only one of whom had
a university degree in engineering. In early 1976, 15 technicians were added,
including six engineers. The present total of 26 technicians is an adequate
nucleus of counterpart staff. Capability and efficiency, however, are not yet
satisfactory because most members of the local staff are young and lack the
experience required for their positions; RB must, therefore, still depend
heavily on foreign technical assistance. To offset this lack of experienced
local staff, RB staff includes sixteen expatriates (nine provided by FRG, five
by IDA and two by Belgium), who occupy positions ranging from advisor to the
RB head to chief of a mechanized unit. Of the sixteen expatriates, five are
assigned to the Planning and Engineering Department, six to the Works Depart-
ment (five to the Maintenance Division, one to the Construction Section) and
five to the Workshop and Warehouse Department (Table 8 and Chart 1). These
experts, however, have been unable to effectively carry out their most impor-
tant duty, the training of staff, for two reasons: (i) the Government has
not given them the necessary authority, and (ii) the young inexperienced local
staff have been reluctant to work as subordinate counterparts to expatriate
experts, and have insisted on holding ultimate authority in most decisions,
often disregarding the expatriate experts' advice and profiting only little
from the experience of such experts. Government indicated that it had already
begun to take the necessary steps to improve the relationships between counter-
part staff and expatriate experts and that discipline is being imposed on
local staff to pay appropriate attention to the advice offered by experts.
Training for local staff will be provided under the project by a comprehensive
training program based on an Organization for Rehabilitation and Training (ORT)
Consultant's report, prepared in 1974 and updated in March 1977. The program
will include on-the-job training, courses in Kigali, and scholarships abroad
(paras. 4.11-4.12).
F. Planning, Engineering and Construction
3.14      RB is responsible for planning, engineering, and supervising road
construction work but is capable of handling only minor projects. It con-
sequently entrusts the design and supervision of major projects to consultants.
Major road construction is let to contract according to the procurement pro-
cedures of the financing agency. There are only two local road construction



- 8 -
firms, both branches of foreign companies; among the few domestic building
contractors, one or two are potential road builders, but they presently lack
experience in road construction, skilled and experienced staff, and the capital
for equipment.  The proposed project will address this staff train;ng -r-^
by providing training through the operation of two mechanized units for the
betterment program (paras. 4.03 and 4.06). The Association is planning to
deal with some of the problems endemic to Rwanda's construction industry,
and particularly to road construction, under a possible industry project.
3.15      The RB road investment program up to 1983 (Table 5) appears adequate
for Rwanda's needs. No Government funds will be required for the program which
is being financed entirely by either FED or FRG. Thus contrary to the past,
the Government will have more funds available for maintenance. The proposed
project includes no construction since the only two road improvements which
appear economically justified are already being financed by bilateral agencies.
G. Maintenance
3.16      A 1970 consultants' survey found that most of Rwanda's 6,300 km
network was ungravelled, and roads with a gravel base were already badly
deteriorated. These unfavorable road conditions, which have slowed travel,
rapidly worn out vehicles and substantially increased vehicle operating
costs, have continued because maintenance operations under the Second Highway
Project were hampered by a variety of problems (paras. 2.09, 3.19-3.21). In
1977, consultants (RRI) updated the original survey and found that about 770
km of gravel roads had completely lost their base course, and 500 km of these
roads also required improvement of their geometric standard for the traffic
they carried. In addition, about 730 km of earth roads were found to need
gravelling. The proposed project addresses these problems through a better-
ment program (para. 4.02); a list of roads included in this program is given
in Table 6.
3.17      RB, which is responsible for planning, supervising and executing
routine and periodic road maintenance on the national network (2,400 km), will
in the future assume responsibility for an additional 1,100 km of roads. The
proposed project will allow them to do so by gradually providing the staff,
equipment, vehicles and facilities necessary. Until 1972, RB operations
were limited to the simplest manual operations, such as patching and shoulder
clearing, because of insufficient staff, labor, road equipment and vehicles.
The extreme shortage of equipment and vehicles made mechanized maintenance of
unpaved roads almost nonexistent at that time, although one mechanized unit,
equipped under the First Highway Project, was used to reshape the heavily
trafficked Kigali-Kakitumba road (see Map). Although progress was slower
than expected under the Second Highway Project, maintenance of unpaved roads
improved somewhat from 1973, and especially from mid-1976 when, with the
full use of equipment, operations improved considerably. At present there
is practically no routine and periodic maintenance of paved roads, about



- 9 -
100 km of which have traffic of about 500 vpd and are in urgent need of re-
sealing. Routine maintenance of gravel and earth roads is carried out by
165 road gangs, each crew composed of a foreman and 12 roadmen with respon-
sibility for 12-15 km of roadway. Only reshaping is carried out mechani-
cally by one unit of three graders.  Periodic maintenance (regravelling)
and improvement work are executed by two mechanized units of 25 skilled
workers and 100 laborers each and by two labor units of 2,000 men.  Neither
mechanized unit is fully equipped or regularly supplied with spare parts and
fuel.  In 1977, one unit improved 35 km of road while the other did 90 km of
regravelling. The proposed project includes the full equipping and supplying
of the two improvement units (para. 4.10) in addition to a training program
to increase the number of skilled staff and experienced labor (para. 4.11).
3.18      Workshop facilities (a central workshop in Kigali and a smaller
shop in Ruhengeri) are adequate for the maintenance now performed, but would
be unable to handle the equipment required for the proposed project and
would be far from the sites of some project operations. To meet these needs
the proposed project will build and equip two small workshops in other parts
of the country, and the Kigali facility will be enlarged (para. 4.10).
3.19      MPWI and the Association agreed that the effectiveness of the proposed
project and future maintenance operations will depend on timely measures taken
to avoid a repetition of mistakes and to overcome difficulties experienced
during execution of the Second Highway Project. Among other problems which
arose in the course of that project, an inadequate stock of spare parts often
curtailed, and sometimes stopped, the use of equipment and vehicles. In
addition, many fuel shortages occurred because of frequent closures of the
border between Uganda and Kenya. Since Rwanda has very few supply facilities
and is landlocked and far from markets, procurement of these goods can take
from 6 to 12 months, causing repair, maintenance, and operation of equipment
and vehicles to become slow and costly. To prevent the reoccurrence of this
problem, the proposed project would build up a stock of spare parts and fuel
for the betterment program early in the project's course (para. 4.19).
3.20      Under the Second Highway Project, a cost accounting system for
maintenance operations was introduced in early 1976 by consultants. Adoption
of the system was initially slow but is now improving. To aid execution of
the proposed project, Government agreed to fully implement within RB a sound
cost accounting system satisfactory to the Association and to ensure that
separate accounts are kept to reflect the operations, resources and expendi-
tures of RB(para. 4.14).
3.21      Certain problems encountered during the Second Highway Project are
caused by RB's weaknesses and bureaucracy, and continue to hinder maintenance
work. These include the following:
(i) drivers and operators of RB vehicles and equipment are
hired and paid by MPC so that RB has very little control;



- 10 -
(ii) because of the complex chain of approval needed for
purchase orders, it takes as long as thirty days for
an order to reach a supplier; and
(iii) invoices must pass through an equally lengthy chain,
delaying payments by as much as six months after delivery
and consequently causing suppliers either to add an ex-
cessive mark-up or to refuse to accept new orders. Like-
wise, staff salaries may be delayed by as much as two
months.
Government indicated that it has already taken some steps to correct these
issues through a proposed budgetary and administrative reorganization of RB
(para. 4.14).
4. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to prevent the further
deterioration of the main road network and to expand and strengthen mainte-
nance operations and the capabilities of the Road Branch.
B. Description
4.02      As stated (para. 1.02) the proposed project is the second part
of an ongoing highway maintenance project whose first phase was carried
out under the Second Highway Project.  The project components are:
(i) a four-year betterment program to (a) improve about 500 km
of gravel roads, (b) rehabilitate about 270 km of very old
and deteriorated roads to gravel standards, (c) upgrade
about 730 km of earth roads to gravel standards, and (d)
seal about 100 km of paved roads with a coat of bitumen
and stone chippings;
(ii) a four-year routine maintenance program to strengthen
operations on about 3,500 km per year of earth and gravel
roads and to initiate routine maintenance on about 350 km
of paved roads;
(iii) a strengthening and expansion of RB's capacity to implement
both programs through (a) procurement of some additional
equipment and vehicles, (b) technical assistance; (c) con-
struction and expansion of workshops; (d) procurement



- 11 -
of machine and hand tools; and (e) procurement of spare
parts, fuel and materials (only for the betterment program);
and
(iv) a training program for maintenance personnel at all levels,
including courses and scholarships abroad.
(i) Four-Year Betterment Program
4.03      To prevent the further deterioration of the road network (para.
3.16), the proposed project will improve about 500 km of national roads, on
which the original gravel base has completely worn off because of lack of
maintenance. Two mechanized units will do the work, which entails: (i) minor
improvement of curves, (ii) reduction of gradients of over 12%, (iii) widening
of the roadway, especially at dangerous curves, (iv) filling of low points,
(v) reconstruction of ditches, (vi) replacement of broken culverts, and (vii)
construction of a base course, 15 cm thick and 5-7 m wide, with selected
materials.
4.04      Rehabilitation of 270 km of gravel roads and upgrading of 730 km of
earth roads to gravel standards (para. 3.16) will be carried out by two
mechanized units which will construct a base course, 10-15 cm thick and 4-5 m
wide with selected materials.
4.05      The Government has been unable to maintain Rwanda's paved roads
(para. 3.17). This situation is particularly desperate on three stretches of
roads totalling about 100 km, most of which are more than 10 years old with
traffic volumes of about 500 vpd. The proposed project will undertake the
sealing of these 100 km of roads, using one mechanized unit to apply a coat of
bitumen and stone chippings. The unit will be staffed with a chief, one
assistant, 10 skilled workers and 20 laborers. A list of roads for the
betterment program was agreed with the Government and is given in Table 6
(also see Map).
4.06      The betterment program will be carried out by force account.  The
Government originally considered engaging contractors for this work, but
subsequently decided to implement the program by force account, so that
the experience gained from the work can benefit RB's organization. The
two improvement units will each do 50 km of road improvement per year for the
first two years, 65 km in the third year and 85 km in the fourth year. The
two rehabilitation and upgrading units under the project will each do 100 km
in the first year, 105 km in the second, 140 km in the third, and 155 km in
the fourth year. The projected output of these units is fully consistent
with the amount of work being carried out presently (para. 3.17) since, under
the proposed project, these units will be fully equipped and supplied and
the local staff will be more productive due to the experience gained under
the Second Highway Project.
(ii) Four-year Maintenance Program
4.07      The proposed Credit will provide RB with the resources to expand
its routine maintenance operations from the present 2,400 km to 3,500 km



- 12 -
(para. 3.17). Routine maintenance of the entire earth and gravel road net-
work will be carried out by one mechanized unit staffed by 250 road gangs, and
equipped with 8 trucks and 3 graders. Each gang, staffed with one foreman and
twelve roadmen, will be responsible for approximately 12-15 km of ro.d, its
work mainly involving patching, cleaning culverts, and clearing shoulders,
slopes and ditches. The unit will reshape about 1,100 km of gravel and earth
roads three times a year.
4.08      Routine maintenance of 350 km of now unmaintained paved roads
will be carried out by one unit of six gangs, the unit being staffed with a
chief, two assistants, twelve foremen, sixty skilled workers and ninety
laborers (for equipment involved, see Table 7). The work will be done by
labor-intensive methods and will consist of the same operations as for routine
maintenance of earth and gravel roads (para. 4.07).
4.09      Routine and periodic maintenance of structures and road signs will
be carried out by one unit of two gangs over the entire network (equipment
listed in Table 7). The unit, staffed with a chief, an assistant, 4 foremen,
40 skilled workers, and 60 laborers, will repair stone bedding, replace timber
flooring and paint metal structures and signs.
(iii)     Strengthening and Expansion of RB
4.10      In order for RB to strengthen and expand its capacity to imple-
ment the proposed programs, the project will provide:
For Both Betterment and Maintenance Programs:
(i) procurement of some additional equipment and vehicles to
supplement those purchased under the Second Highway
Project (Table 7);
(ii) technical assistance, amounting to a total of 607 man-months,
to MD, the betterment and maintenance units, and workshops
(para. 4.13);
For the Betterment Program only:
(iii) expansion of the heavy equipment section in the Kigali Central
Workshop and addi ion of a new section for light vehicles
(totaling 1,650 m ), and the construction of two small workshops
in But re and Cyangugu in the south and southwest of Rwanda
(450 m each);
(iv) procurement of additional machine and hand tools for the
workshops; and
(v) spare parts, fuel, materials, as well as staff and labor
for five mechanized units in the betterment program.



- 13 -
(iv)      Training Program
4.11      Because of insufficient skilled local staff, RB still needs a con-
siderable amount of technical assistance to carry out the proposed programs,
both to run operations efficiently, and to train RB counterparts and staff at
all levels. Even though this technical assistance absorbs a sizeable portion
of the proposed project funds, it will advance the Government's objective of
gradually staffing RB with sufficiently qualified local personnel. The
Government believes that this goal can be achieved only through an extensive
training program (para. 4.12). To reach greater staffing self-sufficiency,
Government has recognized the need for and taken steps to:
(i) retain on the project the present number of counterparts
in RB for training purposes, giving clear and precise
instructions to these counterparts on their roles,
their rights and duties, and the roles of the expatriate
experts during their training (para. 3.13);
(ii) ensure that terms of reference of the expatriate experts
provide them with the authority required to carry out
their training duties effectively (para. 3.13); and
(iii)  allocate and retain a sufficient number of trainees to
the project. The proposed project will be helped in
this by the World Food Program (WFP) which will provide
food rations as part of the salaries for about 125 trainees
for 4 years. WFP will also supply food to 250 mechanical
unit workers who will be receiving on-the-job training.
As a condition of credit effectiveness, Government agreed
to make the necessary arrangements to secure food rations
from WFO.
4.12      Under the proposed project, training will be given through courses
to be held in Kigali, on-the-job training and scholarships abroad. All
training will be based on a program described in an ORT report (para. 3.13),
already approved by Government. Under this program, training will be pro-
vided to about 300 road workers, 60 mechanics, and 30 administrative staff.
A special traffic count unit of about 20 men will also be set up and trained
under the project. The whole program will require 84 man-monthg of consul-
tants' services, the construction of classrooms (totaling 650 m ), procure-
ment of teaching aids, and 72 man-months of scholarships abroad.
Technical Assistance
4.13      In total, technical assistance to be furnished to RB under
the proposed project over its four years of execution amounts to 607
man-months, of which 480 man-months are for experts already on the job
(Tables 8, 9 and 10). This is a high input of technical assistance,
but the Government prefers to make a concerted effort at this time to



- 14 -
take advantage of experience gained in the earlier project and the continuity
of present technical assistance. About 75% of the total will be devoted to
carrying out the betterment program by force account.    As itemized in
Table 9, IDA would finance about 227 man-months, UNDP 121, Federal Republic
of Germany 216, and Belgium 43. As a condition of credit effectiveness, Gov-
ernment agreed to secure the necessary cofinancing for technical assistance
from the respective cofinancing agencies.
C. Execution
4.14      MPWI, through RB, will be responsible for the execution of the
proposed project which is scheduled to begin in early 1978 and end in late
1981. Government has agreed to an implementation schedule (Chart 3), quar-
terly progress reporting requirements, and the preparation of an evaluation
report promptly after project completion. RB, with the amount of technical
assistance proposed, will be able to execute the project successfully, pro-
vided that Government follows up on steps already taken, including:
(i) to fully implement within RB a sound cost accounting
system satisfactory to the Association and to ensure
that separate accounts are kept to reflect the operations,
resources and expenditures of RB (para. 3.20);
(ii) to give RB authority to hire, supervise and dismiss
vehicle drivers and equipment operators (para. 3.21); and
(iii) to simplify RB's procurement and payment procedures
(para. 3.21).
In addition, as a condition of effectiveness, Government will place and
maintain RB's existing Workshop and Warehouse Department under the authority
of RB's Works Department as a division at the same level as the Maintenance
Division (para. 3.12).
Labor- and Equipment-Intensive Methods
4.15      The Government considers that routine maintenance of all roads
should be carried out with labor-intensive methods, as is now done with about
2,500 laborers, and periodic maintenance and betterment work should be car-
ried out with equipment-intensive methods. This is in line with the Bank's
recommendation made at appraisal of the Second Highway Project. The Govern-
ment considers that investment in equipment for the proposed betterment pro-
gram and in trucks to provide mobility for the routine maintenance program
(labor gangs) is necessary. It is prepared as needed to strengthen the pres-
ent organization in order to improve the labor-intensive techniques and oper-
ations which it now carries out.



- 15 -
4.16      To assist Government the Association is planning to send an expert
who would, during a short mission to Rwanda, review the situation with respect
to the use of labor-intensive methods and make recommendations to the Govern-
ment on appropriate work methods. Following this, the Association and the
Government will review the expert's recommendations and discuss what should
follow in the light of these recommendations. In the meantime, the Govern-
ment, although calling for tenders for the entire list of equipment (Table 7),
plans to defer purchase of equipment valued at about US$500,000 including:
two angle-dozers, two loaders, 2 pneumatic tired tractors and six tipper
trucks.
D. Procurement
4.17      Project costs have been estimated in detail, and RB is ready for
project initiation with specific requirements for the betterment program.
Bidding documents, preparatory to International Competitive Bidding (ICB),
for equipment (US$3.4 million), machine and hand tools (US$160,000), and
plans for workshop and classroom construction (US$0.5 million and US$150,000
respectively) were ready at the time of appraisal, were reviewed by the
appraisal mission, and were found satisfactory. Except for small amounts
of equipment which should be standardized with that existing, highway mainte-
nance equipment (US$3.0 million), as well as machine and hand tools, will be
procured through ICB in accordance with Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement".
Bid documents give due attention to equipment standardization and to the
aftersale services offered by possible suppliers. Spare parts, fuel and
bitumen (US$3.2 million, US$3.7 million and US$665,000 respectively) will be
procured on the basis of prices negotiated with established suppliers.
4.18      Materials such as cement, steel and timber for the betterment
program and construction of workshops and classrooms will be procured on the
basis of local bidding procedures in accordance with Government procurement
procedures which have been found satisfactory by IDA. Individual items not
suitable for bulk purchase, costing under US$25,000, may be procured by nego-
tiated purchase after sollicitation of quotations from suppliers or contrac-
tors; the total amount of these purchases will not exceed US$200,000.
4.19      Early procurement of stocks of spare parts and fuel will be impor-
tant to successful implementation of the betterment program (para. 3.19);
therefore, some spare parts (US$1.0 million) and fuel (US$0.1 million) will
be procured in the early stages of the project. Replenishment of the stock
will be based on the following estimated consumption rates per km agreed with
Government:
for the improvement of 500 km of gravel roads;
spare parts                US$4,000
fuel                       US$4,300



- 16 -
for the rehabilitation of 270 km of gravel roads,
and the upgrading of 730 km of earth roads;
spare parts                US$2,600
fuel                       US$2,800
These rates, which were found reasonable, will be used to disburse from the
Credit account against certification by consultants of completed work. Should
these rates vary more than expected, the Government will justify the varia-
tions before IDA approves of disbursing for replenishment.
4.20      The Government intends to extend the ongoing contracts for technical
assistance financed by IDA and UNDP under the Second Highway Project. The
contracts have been updated during execution of the earlier project to ensure
that they give expatriate experts sufficient authority to carry out their
training duties. Terms of reference included in contracts for technical
assistance to MD under the Second Highway Project (consultants RRI) will be
used for the proposed project and have already been approved by IDA.
E. Cost Estimates
4.21      Total project costs, net of taxes but including physical and price
contingencies, are estimated at US$23.7 million. The foreign exchange compo-
nent is US$17.6 million (74%). Government will exempt the project from all
taxes and duties. A summary of cost estimates is given below and detailed
cost estimates are given in Table 11.

4.22      The basic costs, estimated at January 1977 prices and updated to
December 1977, have been derived as follows:
(i) Equipment and machine/hand tools: Estimates were prepared by
consultants (RRI) on the basis of unit prices quoted by Kigali
suppliers. The foreign component is based on c.i.f. cost Kigali,
and the local component includes local handling and transport
costs.
(ii) Construction of Workshops and Classrooms: Estimates of the
local, foreign and total costs of construction items were
prepared by consultants (RRI) on the basis of unit prices
quoted by domestic builders for similar work.
(iii) Betterment Program: Operating costs were estimated by consult-
ants (RRI) and based on prices of spare parts, fuel, materials
and personnel, and on average outputs recorded in Rwanda, and
in other African countries for similar works. The foreign
component for spare parts, fuel and materials was calculated
on the basis of c.i.f. costs Kigali and the local component
includes local handling and transport costs.
(iv) Training Program: Estimates were based on a specific price
proposal from ORT consultants, who prepared the training
program, and were found reasonable when compared to similar
works in other African countries.
(v) Consultant Services for Technical Assistance: Estimates for
consultant services were based on actual costs for similar
services under the Second Highway Project. They were compared
to similar costs in other countries and found reasonable. The
billing rate is estimated to average US$6,500 per man-month,
including salaries, overheads and fees. Reimbursable expenses
payable to consultants are estimated to average US$1,500 per
man-month including housing, internal and external transport,
telecommunications, reports, etc.
Physical contingencies of 10% have been included in all items. Price contin-
gencies were calculated for both local and foreign costs during execution of
the proposed project from 1978 to 1981. Price contingencies for technical
assistance were calculated on the basis of an annual 8% increase.
F. Financing
4.23      Including the IDA Credit of US$15.0 million, external sources
would provide US$21.1 million, about 90% of the estimated total capital cost
of the project, net of taxes, of which about US$17.6 million will cover



- 19 -
100% of the estimated total foreign cost and US$3.5 million will cover about
57% of the estimated US$6.1 million local cost. The Government would provide
the remaining 43% of the total local cost (US$2.6 million or 11% of the total
project cost). IDA, UNDP and Government will finance their project cost
shares jointly, whereas FRG, Belgium and WFP will offer parallel financing.
As a condition of credit effectiveness, Government agreed to make all neces-
sary arrangements to secure the needed cofinancing.
4.24      Recurrent costs for the four-year routine maintenance program have
been estimated at US$6.7 million equivalent. Provision of not less than US$1.8
million equivalent for routine maintenance operations during 1978 is a condi-
tion of Credit effectiveness. Goverment has agreed to provide a minimum of
US$1.6 million equivalent every calendar year during the execution of the
project starting with the year 1979. Government also undertook to exchange
views with the Association on the adequacy of these amounts by October 31 of
each year, starting with 1978. Without the project, maintenance expenditures
would be considerably higher (para. 3.11) since some of the betterment work
executed under the project will take the place of routine maintenance. The
financing plan is summarized below and detailed in Table 12.

G. Disbursements
4.25      Disbursements will be made for 100% of c.i.f. costs (Kigali) of
maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel, materials, and machine/hand tools
for workshops; 69% of the total costs, net of taxes for expansion and con-
struction of workshops; 81% of the total cost, net of taxes, for construc-
tion of classrooms; 100% of the cost of consultant services, 98% of the c.i.f.
cost (Kigali) for teaching aids; and 100% of the total cost of scholarships.
Retroactive financing of US$250,000 will be required to meet fees of consul-
tants now on the job and to purchase spare parts and fuel needed early for
the project. A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 13.
Replenishment of stocks of spare parts and fuel will be documented and based
on estimated consumption rates per km as described in para. 4.19. The Gov-
ernment's contribution towards consultant costs will consist of salaries of
RB supporting staff, office facilities and equipment, secretarial staff, and
utilities. Any surplus funds remaining in the Credit amount upon completion
of the project could be used, in agreement with the Association, for addi-
tional equipment and materials.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic and Social Aims
5.01      Road transport continues to play a vital role in Rwanda's economy.
While the network is densely developed over the country, only a few roads
provide reliable all-weather service. The bulk of the network is in poor
condition resulting in high transport costs which are passed on to consumers
through high prices and which consequently aggravate the disadvantages in-
herent in a landlocked country. Producers are similarly affected by poor road
conditions since high transport costs decrease their rate of return. Thus
the improved road network, by reducing transport costs, is expected to stim-
ulate production, especially in the agricultural sector, and so generate
greater returns to the producers.
5.02      The aims of the highway betterment and maintenance programs are
to improve interregional connections in Rwanda and to develop a network of
efficient and reliable routes for the transport of imports and exports since
the monetary part of the economy is very dependent on external trade. In
1974, the last year for which figures are available, the value of exports
equaled about 13% of monetary GDP and that of imports, about 22%. To meet or
surpass these levels, the project aims at improving and preserving the exist-
ing network and eliminating the backlog of maintenance that has accumulated.



- 22 -
B. Area of Influence of the Road Betterment Program
5.03      The proposed betterment program will comprise: improvement of about
500 km of gravel roads; rehabilitation and upgrading of 1,000 km of earth and
gravel roads; and sealing of 100 km of paved roads. The project will cover
roads of international, national and regional interest, and will have an
impact on a major portion of Rwanda's territory and population. The results
of the improved road network will allow the country to better collect and
distribute agricultural and mining production destined for local consumption
and export.
5.04      Rwanda is currently trying to increase its revenues from tourism
which will consequently emphasize the role of roads, particularly those roads
adjoining national parks. The greatest influence, however, will be felt in
the agricultural sector, where improved roads will allow the regions' produc-
tion to be channelled to markets and will consequently provide an incentive to
increased production in this sector.
C. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.05      The main quantified benefits from the betterment program will be
the savings in vehicle operating costs (voc), which will primarily accrue to
road users (Table 14). Domestic freight rates can be expected to stabilize
as a result of road betterment and maintenance. Furthermore, since competi-
tion in the road transport sector is keen, it should be expected that pro-
ducers and consumers will share the profits of road users.
5.06      The betterment program yields an overall economic return in excess
of 100%. Improvement of 500 km of roads yields an economic return in excess
of 150% (Table 15), while the return on rehabilitation and upgrading of 1,000
km of roads is 35% (Table 16). In Rwanda vehicle operating costs are substan-
tially higher than those in several neighboring countries because of the very
poor road conditions. Steep grades and tortuous terrain result in low aver-
age speeds and high fuel consumption. Very rough running surfaces on most
roads cause rapid deterioration of tires, shock absorbers and springs, result-
ing in high maintenance and repair costs and high depreciation costs due to
the shortened vehicle life. The proposed betterment program will help reduce
substantially these components of vehicle operating costs which are particu-
larly sensitive to road conditions. Most of these expected savings are likely
to result in appreciable foreign exchange savings as well. Unquantified ben-
efits include time savings and increased comfort to road users, reduced acci-
dents, and better and more rapid access to medical and other social facili-
ties.
5.07      The benefit-cost ratio discounted at 12% for the improvement
component of the betterment program is 3.5 to 1, while for the rehabilita-
tion and upgrading component it is 1.46 to 1.



- 23 -
D. Economic Analysis
5.08      The basis for the economic analysis of the betterment program
is an assessment of costs and expected benefits with and without the pro-
posed program over a range of 7 to 10 years on the different road sections
identified according to the traffic. The investment cost is taken as the
net of tax cost of the improvement, rehabilitation and upgrading, sealing,
as well as routine maintenance for the specific roads identified for the
program, and includes procurement of the additional equipment, expansion and
construction of workshops, procurement of machine/hand tools for workshops,
technical assistance and operating costs. The only quantified benefits are
savings in vehicle operating costs. Other benefits such as road user time
savings, accident reduction, better access to social facilities and increased
comfort for road users have not been quantified.
5.09      Traffic volumes on the road network were determined on the basis of
traffic counts organized by the German Technical Assistance team during 1976.
In all, 39 road sections have been identified for the betterment program
(Table 6). The improvement program consists of 14 road sections having an
ADT ranging from 60 to in excess of 300 in 1976. For the rehabilitation and
upgrading (25 sections), ADT ranged from 30 to 60. Traffic during the past
six years grew at an average of 10% per year; however, this rate of growth is
not expected to continue and for this analysis, a traffic growth of 5% has
been used during the four years of project execution after which traffic is
allowed to grow at a 4% annual rate. Estimated economic rates of return are
also given in Table 6 and range between 14% to over 100%.
E. Sensitivity Analysis
5.10      While the project as conceived is economically sound, there are
two possible risks which have been identified, and for which sensitivity
tests have been performed. The first possible risk involves reduced voc
savings as a result of lack of proper maintenance following the betterment
work. The other possible risk identified is that project costs could escalate
as a result of a serious drop in productivity during execution. Sensitivity
tests were therefore conducted assuming reductions in voc savings and an
increase in project costs. For the improvement program, tests reveal that
large increases in costs or decreases in benefits do not result in unfavorable
rates of return. For the rehabilitation and upgrading program, tests reveal
that, should the costs of this component rise by 15%, the rate of return would
still be 24%. If, on the other hand, voc savings were reduced by 25%, the
rate of return would still yield 14%. A 12% rate of return could be main-
tained even if costs of the rehabilitation and upgrading increased by 37%,
while for the improvement component, costs would have to increase by more
than 250% for the rate of return to fall below 12%. Similarly, benefits
could be reduced by 72% and the improvement component would still maintain
a 12% rate of return; benefits from the rehabilitation and upgrading could
be reduced by 27% before the rate of return would fall below 12%. The con-
clusion that the project earns a satisfactory economic rate of return is
therefore firm.
