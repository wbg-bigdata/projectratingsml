FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 769-RW
PREFACE
1.        IDA provided US$15.0 million for the financing of the Fourth
Highway Project. The Credit Agreement (Credit 769-RW) was signed on April
25, 1978 and became effective on August 4, 1978. The project was
implemented in six years instead of four, due to delays in procurement of
equipment and construction of the training center. The closing date of the
Credit Agreement was extended from July 1, 1982 to June 30, 1984 to
accommodate the two-year delay in project execution. The credit was fully
disbursed.
2.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Transportation Division of Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department,
on the basis of the appraisal report, project files, supervision missions
reports, and Government's project evaluation report prepared by
consultants.
3.        The project was cofinanced by the Government (US$6.76 million),
UNDP (US$1.3 million), FRG (US$2.32 million), Belgium (US$460,000), and WFP
(US$1.94 million). The total external financing covered 100% of the
foreign costs and about 18% of the local costs of the project. The remain-
ing 82% of the local costs were financed by the Government. The Government
also met the recurrent costs of road maintenance amounting to US$10.75
million for the six-year project implementation period.
4.         In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Copies of the draft report were sent to the Borfower and Co-financiers for
comments.  rhe Co-financiers' comments are shown as Annexes IX and X.

RWANDA
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 769-RW
LIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Fourth Highway Project was the second IDA financed road
projects to emphasize road maintenance. It was designed to sustain the
efforts begun under the Second Highway Project (Credit 299-RW) - the first
phase of road maintenance program - to expand and strengthen maintenance
operations and the capabilities of the Road Branch (RB). To achieve these
objectives the project included:
(i)  a four-year road maintenance program consisting of: (a)
betterment works on about 500 km of gravel roads; (b)
rehabilitation and upgrading works on about 1000 km of earth
roads to gravel standards; (c) resealing of about 100 km of
paved roads; and (d) routine maintenance on about 3,500 km
earth and gravel roads and 350 km of paved roads;
(ii)  strengthening and expansion of RB's capacity by providing
equipment, spare parts, materials, supplies, tools, work-
shops and technical assistance; and
(iii)  a four-year training program for maintenance personnel at
all levels.
2.        The implementation of the road maintenance program was carried
out by force account. The execution of the program was carried out in six
years instead of four due to delays in procurement of road maintenance
equipment (para. 3.03). Despite these delays, 100% of the be.terment works
were properly completed; 70% of the rehabilitation and upgrading and 90% of
the resealing works were acceptably completed, and labor-intensive routine
maintenance works ("cantonnage") were carried out and continue to be
carried out satisfactorily (para. 3.05).
3.        The overall ERR for the betterment and rehabilitation and
upgrading programs, is about 155%, compared with the appraisal estimate
which is in excess of 100%. If a sensitivity analysis with a reduction in
benefits of 50% is carried out, the recalculated ERR would be about 80%
which is still satisfactory (para. 5.12). The results of the first year
returns show that these operations were overdue and points to the
importance and urgency of having undertaken the maintenance works in these
roads much earlier (para. 5.14).
4.        The training program was completed two years behind schedule due
to delays in construction of the training center (para. 3.07). The train-
ing program succeeded in training lower level technicians, but no managers
(para. 3.08), with a consequence that technical assistance is still needed
in the medium term to carry out effective road maintenance operations.



- v. -
5.        Despite the two-year delay in project completion, the actual
costa, US$27.78 million, only moderately increased by 17%, compared to
appraisal estimates of US$23.7 million. These cost overruns were financed
by a greater participation of the Government, US$6.76 million instead of
the original pledge of US$2.6 million. The financing of the remaining
costs was shared by IDA, US$15.0 million; UNDP, US$1.3 million; FRG,
US$2.32 million; Belgium, US$460,000; and WFP, US$1.94 million. The dis-
bursement of the IDA credit closely followed project execution and was thus
totally disbursed in six years instead of four.
6.        The project succeeded in strengthening the road maintenance
organization, institutionalizing the labor-intensive "cantonnage"works and
establishing training on a permanent basis as part of RB's regular opera-
tions. The project, however, fell short of training goals as only lower
level technicians were trained and no managers (para. 3.08).
7.        The performance of the Government and IDA contributed to the
achievement of the project objectives. Both institutions collaborated in
designing and executing a project which emphasized improvement of road con-
ditions and strengthening of RB's capacity to carry out proper road main-
tenance operations. However, the Government could have been firmer in
managing the construction of the training center (para. 3.07).
8.        The Government complied with most of the major credit covenants,
in particular, the institutional organization and provision of adequate
funds for recurrent costs of road maintenance operations (para. 4.02).
However, the traffic regulations and safety were not complied with and the
Government is preparing appropriate legislations to comply with this
covenant (para. 4.02).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 769-RW)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Rwanda is a small, densely populated land-locked country, bounded
by Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.  The main transport flows are bet-
ween the capital Kigali and the exterior and between Kigali and regional
centers. External transport is assured essentially by two main surface
transport corridors to the Indian ocean ports and to a much lesser degree
air transport between Kigali and Mombasa. The Northern Corridor (1,740 km)
which comprises the all-road and road/rail routes via Kampala and Nairobi
to Mombasa, and the central corridor (1,720 km) which consists of the
road/lake (Tanganyika)/rail via Bujumbura and Kigoma to Dar-es-Salaam.
External transport, however, has been unreliable, slow, and expensive be-
cause these routes have been subjected to many problems, the most important
of which have been political upheavals in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and
traffic congestion in Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam ports. Also the rugged
topography of the country makes road construction and maintenance costly.
Rwanda has concentrated its efforts in improving to paved standards the
major road links between Kigali and neighboring Uganda, Burundi, and
Tanzania, and between its major regional centers; the Government has also
started to pay more attention to improving the maintenance of the road
network and its organization.
1.02      The present transport system consists of:
(a) about 4,060 km of classified roads of which 627 km are
paved, and 274 km are being improved from earth and gravel
roads to paved standards;
(b) about 6,000 km non-classified earth and gravel communal and
feeder roads;
(c) Lake Kivu for local transport between Gisenyi, Kibuye and
Cyangugu; and
(d)  an international airport at Kigali, a regional airport in
Cyangugu, and four grass airports in the interior to handle
small aircrafts.
There are no railways or navigable rivers.
1.03      Bank Group lending to the road subsector has amounted to US$71.4
million for five projects. The objectives of these projects have been to
assist this land-locked country in: (i) improving major road connections
with its neighbors and between its regional centers and the capital and
(ii) improving its Institutional capabilities to carry out efficient road
maintenance operations.
1.04      The First Highway Project (Credit 196-RW, US$18.8 million, 1970),
the Third Highway Project (Credit 475-RW, US$6.3 million, 1974) and the
Fifth Highway Project (Credit 1250-RW, US$25.9 million, 1982) primarily
financed road construction. They contributed respectively to improvement
to paved standards of the Kigali-Gatuna road (80 km), the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi
road (60 km), and the Butare-Kitabi road (53.5 km).  Excessive delays and



- 2 -
cost overruns occurred in the construction of the Kigali-Gatuna and
Ruhengeri-Gisenyi roads. The difficulties were due to inadequate
engineering and construction techniques, and political instability in
Uganda causing interruption in the supply of equipment and materials. The
PPAR of both projects (dated June 13, 1979), however, concluded that the
improvement works on both roads were still justified, as the increases in
construction costs were offset by higher than anticipated traffic growth
and greater savings in vehicle operating costs. The Kigali-Gatuna road has
deteriorated to the point where reconstruction is necessary; some
maintenance works to keep it passable are being carried out under the
ongoing Fifth Highway Project, and reconstruction works would be carried
out under the proposed Sixth Highway Project.  In view of the difficulties
encountered in the first two road construction projects, the improvement of
the Butare-Kitabi road (Fifth Highway Project) was designed with particular
attention to soil conditions, alignment, grades and drainage; contractors
were prequalified carefully and the supervision team was provided with an
expert in soils engineering. Construction of this road is progressing
satisfactorily and within estimated costs.
1.05      The Second Highway Project (Credit 299-RW, US$5.4 million, 1971)
and the Fourth Highway Project (Credit 769-RW, US$15.0 million, 1978)
contributed to improvement of road maintenance operations and institution
building. The Second Highway Project provided equipment, materials,
supplies, rehabilitation of workshops, technical assistance and training of
personnel. It was designed to carry out periodic and routine road
maintenance Aperations on the entire road network. At the closing of the
Credit, on December 31, 1978, only about 50% of targeted works were
completed successfully. The PPAR (dated June 13, 1979) concluded that,
although the targets set at appraisal were overly optimistic, the project
objectives were largely achieved. The RB organization was improved,
technical personnel increased, training of personnel initiated, workshops
and offices constructed and equipped, road maintenance equipment purchased
and deployed, and maintenance operations were improved and better road
conditions achieved.
1.06      The Fourth Highway Project was thus designed, taking into
consideration the limitations of RB, to consolidate and expand the
achievements of the Second Highway Project.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The Fourth Highway Project was a second phase of an 8-year
highway maintenance program designed in 1971. The first phase, the Second
Highway Project, Credit 229-RW, was completed in December 1977 (PPAR dated
June 13, 1979).
2.02      The project was prepared in November 1976 to January 1977 by the
Government, assisted by FRG consultants. It was appraised by the
Association from February 26 to March 19, 1977, and the Credit w-s
negotiated in Washington from December 12 to 15, 1977. The Credit
Agreement was signed on April 25, 1978.
2.03      The project, consisted of:
(i)  a four-year (1978-1981) periodi^ road maintenance program to be
executed by force account includ.ng: (a) betterment of about 500
km of gravel roads (Annex I(a)); (b) rehabilitation and upgrading
of about 1,000 km of earth roads to gravel standards (Annex
T(b)); and (c) the resealing of about 100 km (Annex I(c)) of
paved roads;
(ii) a four-year (1978-1981) routine road maintenance program
including routine maintenance of 3,500 km of earth and gravel
roads, and 350 km of paved roads; the works were to be carried
out by labor-intensive methods, "cantonnage";
(iii) strengthening and expansion of RB capacity including (a)
procurement of equipment (Annex II), machine and hand tools,
spare parts, materials and supplies; (b) extension and
improvement of the central workshop in Kigali and construction of
two small workshops in Butare and Cyangugu; (c) provision of
technical assistance (607 man-month! j to assist in the management
and execution of works, maintenance of equipment and training of
personnel; and (d) tr.nsforming RB's Workshop and Warehouse
Department into a division of RB's Works Department; and
(iv) a four-year (1978-1981) training program to train RB maintenance
personnel at all levels including: (a) a gradual staffing of RE
with sufficiently qualified local personnel to replace the
extensive technical assistance (iii (c) above); (b) class-room
instruction, on-the-job training and scholarships for the
training of about 300 road workers, 60 mechanics, 30
administrative staff and 20 traffic counting technicians; (c)
construction of class-rooms and procurement of teaching aids,
materials and supplies; and (d) provision of 84 man-months of
consultants services for class-room instruction.
Project Cost Estimates and Financing
2.04      The total project capital costs, net of taxes but including
physical and price contingencies, were estimated at US$23.7 million
(detailed in Annex III), with a foreign cost component of US$17.6 million



- 4 -
(74%) and a local cost component of US$6.1 (26%). The Government exempted
the project from all taxes and duties. The recurrent costs of the
four-year road maintenance program were estimated at US$6.7 million.
2.05      The external sources of financing were to provide US$21.1 million
or about 90% of the estimated total costs, of which US$17.6 million were to
cover 1002 of the estimated foreign costs and US$3.5 million to cover about
57% of the estiamted US$6.1 million local costs; the Government was to
provide US$2.6 million or 43X of the total local costs. The US$21.1
million of external financing were to be provided by IDA: US$ 15.0 million
(Credit 769-RW); UNDP: US$1.3 rillion; FRG: US$2.3 million; Belgian Aid:
US$0.5 million; and WFP: 2.0 villion for food for road workers and
trainees. As one condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit, the
Government had to secure the financing of the other donors. The recurrent
costs were to be borne by the Government. To ensure the financing of
recurrent costs the Government was to provide not less than US$1.8 million
during FY1978 as one condition of Credit effectiveness, and for the
subsequent years at least US$1.6 million annually as a major covenant of
the Credit Agreement (para 4.02, Annex V).

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A. Credit Agreement
3.01      The Credit Agreement, which was signed on April 25, 1978, became
effective on August 4, 1978, only 10 deays past the original deadline of
July 25, 1978. The Government fulfilled the general conditions and all
additional conditions, including the efficient reorganization of RB (para.
3.06), securing financing from other donors and providing required PY 1978
funds for the routine operations of road maintenance (para. 2.05).
3.02      During the project execution, the Credit Agreement was amended
only once. The closing date was extended from July 1, 1982 to June 30,
1984 td accommodate a two-year delay iii project execution (para. 3.05).
B. Procurement of Equipment, Spare Parts, Materials and Supplies
3.03      The project provided for equipment (Annex II) to replenish and
expand the equipment fleet provided under the first phase of the road main-
tenance program (the Second Highway Project, Credit 299-RW). The delivery
of this equipment took longer than was foreseen at appraisal. This was
principally due to delayed preparation of bidding documents by consultants
and delay in contract awards because of complaints by suppliers on
Government's bid evaluation. Bids were called on May 30, 1978 and
suppliers were given 107 days to prepare the bids. Bids were opened on
September 15, 1978. The bid analysis and award were completed by
November/December 1978, and 22 separate contracts were approved between
January and December 1979; the bulk of the equipment was delivered by end
of March 1980. The equipment procured under the project was augmented by
Japanese aid (Annex II). The procurement of materials and supplies
followed local competitive bidding procedures (LCB), and spare parts, fuel
and bitumen were provided by established suppliers on the basis of
negotiated and competitive prices as allowed by the Credit Agreement. The
delivery was made on schedule except for two periods, February - March 1978
and February - May 1979, when the delivery of fuel was interrupted by
political instabilities in Uganda. With consultants assistance, the
inventory of spare parts was carried out, identifying necessary stocks to
maintain the equipmeait fleet, thus rationalizing procurement and minimizing
waste and pilferage.
C. Execution of Road Maintenance Works
3.04      The execution of works was carried out by force account as
planned with: (') two brigades for betterment works on about 500 km of
gravel roads on which base courses were to be rebuilt, grades of about 12%
reduced,dangerous curves widened, and drainage improved; (ii) two brigades
for rehabilitation and upgrading of about 1000 km of earth roads on which
regravelling and improvement of drainage structures were to be carried out;
(iii) one brigade for resealing about 100 km of paved roads which were more
than 10 years old and carried out traffic volumes of about 500 vpd; and
(iv) 256 'cantonnage" teams (road gangs) composed each of one foreman and
twelve laborers for labor-intensive routine maintenance on the 3,500 km of
earth and gravel roads and 350 km of paved roads. Due to delays in



- 6 -
procurement of equipment, only the two brigades for betterment works, one
brigade for rehabilitation and upgrading and the 256 cantonnage teams
operated in 1978 and 1979. All brigades became fully functional by mid
1980. The brigades were staffed by local personnel, and managed by
consultants. Consultants were assigned local counterparts for training
(para. 3.08).
3.05      Due to delays in procurement of equipment, works were completed
in Decomber 1983 instead of December 1981, thus two years later than
planned. At the completion of the project, about 100% of betterment works
had been properly completed, 70% of rehabilitation and upgrading and 90% of
resealing works acceptably completed, while cantonnage teams did and
continue to do very satisfactory routine maintenance works. This
labor-intensive effort is keeping the road network passable all year
round. The original road itineraries (Annex I) were modified with IDA
agreement to reflect the evolution of traffic and economic development in
different regions of the country. An impediment to the performance of the
brigades was the lack of good construction materials within the roads'
right-of-ways, the existing borrow pits having been exhausted. To
alleviate this problem, the Government's soils laboratory was requested,
and did carry out soils surveys well in advance of the brigades to identify
borrow pits which could be readily exploited. To better manage the works,
the consultants introduced cost accounting procedures as a road improvement
and maintenance tool.
D. Improvement of Workshops
3.06      The project provided for the improvement and expansion of the
central workshop in Kigali and the constitution of two small workshops in
Butare and Cyangugu. Works on the central workshop were carried out by
force account, and satisfactorily completed in December 1982. Following a
review of the expansion of the road network and the equipment fleet, it was
found superfluous to build the two small workshops in Butare and Cyangugu.
It was thus agreed to build only one, but in Kibuye. The construction
contract was awarded to a local contractor following LCB. The works
started in August 1983, and were satisfactorily completed in April 1984.
With the rational system of procurement of spare parts put in place by
consultants (para. 3.03), the equipment was properly maintained in the
field and workshops in Kigali, Kibuye and Ruhengeri. Also the Workshop and
Warehouse Department, which had been too autonomous and poorly managed was
placed under the authority of RB for efficiency in carrying out road and
equipment maintenance operations.
E. Training
3.07      To carry out the training program, the project provided for,
inter alia, the construction of classrooms and procurement of equipment and
tools.  The equipment and tools were procured at the same time as the
equipment, materials and supplies for road maintenance (para. 3.03). The
construction of the classrooms, however, was completed only in March 1981
or two and one half years behind schedule compared to appraisal estimates.
The delay was caused by the lack of performance of one local contractor.
Following LCB, this local contractor won the contract and sta ted the works
in September 1977. He could not complete the construction in February 1979
l



as planned, and abandoned the site on April 11, 1980, due to financial
difficulties. The Government cancelled the contract and rebid the works.
Another local contractor was awarded the contract. He started the works in
November 1980, and satisfactorily completed the construction of the
training center in March 1981.
3.08      Due to the delays in the construction of the training center, the
training started in temporary shelters. It was carried out at only about
60% of the anticipated rate for the first two and one half years, and was
completed in December 1983, two years later than planned. On-the-job
training was carried out in the central workshop in Kigali and in field
brigades. Training was carried out by consultants (para. 3.09). At the
conclusion of the program, about 410 technicians (same number as planned
but of different qualifications) had been trained. The trained personnel
includes: 40 foremen, 135 equipment operators, 5 workshop superintendents,
20 store keepers, 15 electricians and 195 mechanics. Of the trained
technicians, 54 best qualified have left the Government services for the
private sector. The program also trained three instructors, including one
mechanic, one equipment operator and one office specialist. However, the
project did not succeed in training higher level technicians and managers.
The lack of training of higher level staff was due to (i) consultants
concentrating more on the execution of works; (ii) lack of qualified
candidates; and (iii) qualified local staff preference to work for the
private sector where pay and conditions are much better. 1/ Although
Government assigned counterparts to consultants, the results are not
encouraging as exemplified by the fact that during the 1984/1985 road
maintenance season, when the consultant's contract ran out, the operations
of the road maintenance brigades deteriorated.
F. Technical Assistance
3.09      To carry out the road maintenance program, the maintenance of the
equipment fleet and the training program, the Government was assisted by
technical experts. FRG provided 227 man-months of technical assistance
services for the management and the execution of workshop operations.
Belgium provided 43 man-months of technical assistance for road design and
management of workshop and warehouse operations. To compensate for the
two-year delay in project execution, technical assistance provided by IDA
and UNDP was increased from 348 man-months to 524 man-months for the
execution of the road maintenance works, and from 84 man-months to 137
man-months for training. The FRG consultants who provided services for the
execution of the road maintenance under the Second Highway Project (Credit
299-RW) continued to provide the same services under this project. Swiss
consultants provided assistance for the training program as subcontractors
to FRG consultants. The consultants satisfactorily assisted RB in carrying
out the road improvement and maintenance program, the maintenance of
equipment and the training of low level technicians. However they did not
succeed in training high level technical staff and managers (para. 3.08)
with the result that technical assistance is still needed in the medium
term to carry out effective road maintenance operations.
1/   The training program for the proposed Sixth Highway Project has been
designed with these lessons in mind.



-8-
G.  Project Costs, Financing and Disbursement
3.10      The actual capital cost of the project was US$27*78 million
(Annex III) with foreign costs component of US$19.56 million (70%) and a
local costs component of US$8.22 million (30%). These costs are about 17%
more than the appraisal estimates of US$23.7 million including contin-
gencies. These costs overruns were due to the two-year delay in the execu-
tion of the road maintenance and training programs. The recurrent costs
were US$10.75 million for the six year period (1978-1983).
3.11      The external sources of financing provided US$21.02 million or
about 76% of the costs, of which US$19.56 million covered 100% of the
foreign costs and US$1.46 million covered about 18% of the US$8.22 million
local costs; and the Government provided US$6.76 million or 82% of the
local costs. The Government participation thus increased from US$2.6
million as originally pledged, to US$6.76 million. The greater Government
participation thus absorbed the project's cost overruns. The IDA (US$15.0
million) and UNDP (US$1.3 million) contribution were sufficient to complete
the project. FRG (US$2.32 million), Belgium (US$460,000) and WFP (US$1.94
million) contributed to the financing of the project. The Government also
provided the US$10.75 million equivalent for recurrent costs of routine
maintenance operations or about US$1.8 million yearly, (FY78 to FY83) about
13% more than the US$1.6 million requested by the Credit Agreement (para.
4.02). The financing details are in Annex III. The credit disbursement
(Annex IV) followed the pace of project execution, reflecting its two-year
delay. The credit was thus totally disbursed in six years instead of four
as originally projected.
H. Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.12      Consultants financed by IDA and UNDP satisfactorily assisted the
Government in the execution of the road maintenance operations and the
training of low level staff. However they did not succeed in training high
level staff and managers. The reasons for this failure are given in
paragraph 3.08. With regard to technical assistance, it is clear that
giving consultants responsibility for both operation and training resulted
in their giving inadequate priority to higher level sltaTf training. This
lesson has been taken into account in designing future training programs.
3.13      Two local contractors satisfactorily completed the construction
of the Kibuye workshop and training center respectively. While one local
contractor, the first lowest bidder for the training center, caused a
two-year delay in the construction of this facility due to financial
difficulties (para. 3.07).
3.14      Suppliers satisfactorily delivered on time and at contracted
reasonable prices, the equipment, materials and supplies.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. Institutional Performance
4.01      As a second phase of the road maintenance program, the Project
consolidated the initial institutional achievements of the Second Highway
Project (Credit 299-RW). The road organization was strengthened by placing
the Workshop and Warehouse Department, which had been too autonomous and
poorly managed, under the authority of RB. The brigades and teams were
expanded and strengthened, and most of all, the labor-intensive
"cantonnage' organization was put in place and has succeeded in
maintaining the road network passable all year round. Also the Project put
in place a permanent training organization, which succeeded in training low
level technical staff.  However one of the aims of the project - to put
local staff in responsible positions - was not achieved, as high level
staff and managers were not trained (para. 3.08).  The result is that
technical assistance is still needed in the medium term to carry out
effective road maintenance operations. Under the proposed Sixth Highway
Project, a training program will be implemented to allivate this
deficiency.
B. Compliance with Credit Covenants
4.02      The experience with credit covenants has been satisfactory
(Annex V). The Government complied with the the major covenants. In
particular the revised organizational improvements were put in place
early by Presidential decree; and the Government provided as required
resources for prompt execution of the project including, funds, facilities
and services. Its yearly budgetary allocations were 13% more than required
by the Credit Agreement or US$1.8 million versus US$1.6 million. However,
traffic regulations and road safety were not enforced, even when weighing
scales were procured under the ongoing Fifth Highway Project (Credit
1250-RW). One impediment has been the lack of adequate unified traific
laws. The Government has prepared a new traffic code covering vehicle
weight and dimension regulations which are in line with the design
specifications of roads built in recent years as well as the regulations in
force in neig.boring countries, primarily Kenya and Uganda, the major
transit countries for this land-locked country. The Government has agreed
during the negotiations of the proposed Sixth Highway Project that this
traffic code will become law by December 1985, and to start its enforcement
in early 1986.



- 10 -
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01           According to the appraisal report, "the objective of this
project is to continue improvement of road betterment and maintenance
operations throughout the country and to strengthen the capabilities of the
Road Branch". The two programs for which a rate of return had been
calculated it appraisal were: (a) betterment of about 500 km of gravel
roads; and (b) rehabilitation and upgrading of about 1,000 km of earth
roads to gravel standards. "The aims of these programs are to improve
interregional connections in Rwanda and to develop a network of efficient
and reliable routes for the transport of imports since the monetary part of
the economy is very dependent on external trade.  The principal
beneficiaries are expected to be the producers in the agricultural sector,
which by reducing transport costs are expected to stimulate production, and
so generate greater returns."
5.02           The economic reevaluation was done comparing the 'with' and
'without' the project scenarios.  The analysis is based on findings of the
final and economic reevaluation reports prepared by the Government as well
as data included in the buff cover SAR of Rwanda Sixth Highway Project.
The economic reevaluation was done in 1984 prices, using an early 1984
exchange rate of 97 FRW to the US dollar. The appraisal report used 1977
prices and an exchange rate of 92 FRW to the US dollar.
5.03           The reevaluated project components are:
(a) betterment of 495 Km of gravel roads (compared with 490
km planned at appraisal);
(b) rehabilitation and upgrading of 682 Km of earth roads
to gravel standards (compared with about 1,000 Km
planned at appraisal); and
(c) resealing of 87 Km of paved roads (compared with 100 Km
planned at appraisal).
5.04           The quantified benefits used in the reevaluation, are
vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings (Annex VI) and maintenance costs
savings (Annex VII). Actual costs were used for the recalculated ERR.
Vehicle operating cost unit savings were computed for two types of
vehicles: light and heavy, following the presentation of the appraisal
report.
5.05           At appraisal the traffic growth rate assumed during project
implementation was 5%, and 4% thereafter. The Government's report in its
economic reevaluation used a 10% growth rate. However, a comparison of
traffic growth rate between 1976 and 1983 for the roads mentioned at
appraisal and which were also kept in the implementation stage shows that
for the appraised roads where betterment and rehabilitation and upgrading
works were carried out, the weighted average growth rate was about 7%. For
the purpose of the present analysis a more conservative growth rate of 6%
was applied to all roads. The economic life of the betterment program is



- 11 -
considered to be 10 years as assumed in the text of the appraisal report
(see Annex VII), while 7 years has been assumed for both the rehabilitation
and upgrading, and the resealing programs.
5.06           On the basis of the inputs mentioned above the ERR for the
individual components is as follows:
Betterment
5.07           The reevaluated ERR for this component is about 147%, as
compared with about 195% a. appraisal. The discrepancy between the ERR at
appraisal and the reevaluated ERR could be explained by the higher cost of
works. A comparison between estimated and actual direct costs shows that
for the betterment works the average cost per Km is about 29% higher than
the appraisal estimate.
5.08           Although the investment for this component is expected to
last at least until 1993 it is still possible that the expected benefits
may not fully materialize. Therefore, if in the sensitivity analysis an
unlikely reduction in traffic of 50% is applied, it still would yield an
ERR of about 74%, which is considered satisfactory (Annex VII). Reducing
the benefits by 90%, yields a threshhold of 17 vpd, and an ERR of 12% which
is equal to the assumed opportunity cost of capital, still making the
program economically justifiable. Kirambo-Kidaho is the road with the
lowest economic rate of return: 57%. An unlikely reduction in benefits of
50% would yield an ERR of 28%.
Rehabilitation and Upgrading
5.09           The original road itineraries were modified with IDA's
agreement during the execution fo the project to reflect the evolution of
traffic and economic development in different regions of the country. The
ADT thus changed from 44 vpd in 1976 to 159 vpd in 1983, or an increase of
about 260%. The reevaluated ERR for this component is about 163% as
compared with 35% at appraisal. The discrepency between the ERR at
appraisal and the reevaluated ERR could be explained by the fact that the
increase in actual average cost per km of about 39% was totally offset by
the 260% traffic increase. Also the growth rate of the traffic is higher
than assumed at appraisal (see para. 5.05).
5.10           Although the investment for this component is expected to
last at least until 1990, it is still possible that benefits may not fully
materialize. A sensitivity analysis assuming an unlikely reduction in
traffic of 50%, provides a reevaluated ERR of about 85%, which would still
make this component economically justified (Annex VII). Reducing the
traffic by about 90%, yields a threshhold of 16 vpd and an ERR of 12% which
is equal to the assumed opportunity cost of capital, still making this
program viable. Munyinga-Gasoro and Gisha-Gishyita are the roads with the
lowest ERR: 69Z. An unlikely reduction in benefits of 50% would yield an
ERR of 32%.



- 12 -
Resealing
5.11           This component was not evaluated at appraisal.  However, an
attempt has been made to quantify it using an economic life of 7 years.
The traffic level excludes urban roads and the road to the airport. The
ERR for this component is about 150% or 78% if benefits are reduced by 50%
(Annex VII). Reducing the benefits by 90% yields a threshhold of 89 vpd
and an ERR of 12% whtch is equal to the assumed opportunity cost of capital
still making this program viable. Kigali-Rusumo is the road with the
lowest ERR: 111%. An unlikely reduction in benefits of 50% would yield an
ERR of about 55%.
Conclusions
5.12       The overall ERR for the betterment and rehabilitation and
upgrading programs, excluding resealing, is about 155%, compared with the
appraisal estimate which is in excess of 100%. If a sensitivity analysis
with a reduction in benefits of 50% is carried out, the recalculated ERR
would be about 80%, which is still satisfactory.
5.13      Regarding the rehabilitation and upgrading program, the fact that
after appraisal many roads with low level traffic were excluded and other
roads with higher traffic were included, does not allow us to directly
compare the reevaluated ERR with the appraisal data, because the
reevaluated program is substartially different from the one described at
appraisal. Nonetheless the program, if anything has improved by these
shifts from low to high volume roads.
5.14      Regarding the timing of the project the first year returns of the
three reevaluated components exceed the assumed opportunity cost of capital
of 12% (Annex VII) which indicates that these works were overdue, and
points to the urgency and importance of having undertaken the maintenance
works on these roads much earlier.
5.15       Notwithstanding certain limitations of the recalculation, such
as the economic life of the project that has not yet been completed, the
project is still well justified.

VI. THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
6.01      The Government performance contributed to the achievement of the
project objectives. It promptly complied with credit conditions of
effectiveness, put in place organizational improvements resulting in better
managed road operations, and promptly provided as needed funds, facilities
and services for the execution of the road maintenance operations. The
Government has been commendable in organizing, operating and maintaining
labor-intensive operations "cantonnage" which are keeping the road network
passable all year round.  It succeeded in establishing training as one of
the permanent functions of RB. But only its lower level staff were
trained, as consultants concentrated their activities more in execution of
works than training, and Government could not induce or recruit high level
staff to be trained as managers to replace the extensive technical
assistance. The Government also could have been more diligent in the
preparation of bidding documents, evaluations and awards of contracts for
the procurement of road maintenance equipment; it could also have been more
forceful in the implementation of the contract for the construction of
training center. This laxity caused a two-year delay in the implementation
of the project.



- 14 -
VII. THE ROLE OF IDA
7.01      IDA contributed to the development of the road subsector.
Particularly, a road maintenance program which took into consideration the
country's limitations in skilled personnel and financial resources was
prepared. It succeeded in focussing the Government's attention more on
road maintenance, resulting in establishment of better organized road
maintenance operations and improvement of road conditions. Its insistence
on labor-based maintenance operations induced the Government to put in
place, and on a permanent basis, a very efficient labor-intensive
(cantonnage) organization for routine road maintenance operations which is
keeping the road network passable all year round. It also assisted in
establishing training as a permanent feature of RB operations.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project was a logical continuation of the efforts started
under previous projects to improve the road network and the road main-
tenance organization and operations. The project was properly designed,
taking into consideration RB's limitations in qualified personnel, the
country's financial constraints, and conditions of the road network.
8.02      Although originally planned to cover a four-year road maintenance
and training programs (1978-1981), it actually was executed in six years
(1978-1983), mainly due to a two-year delay in procurement of road main-
tenance equipment and construction of the training center. This delay
caused US$4.1 million cost overruns; but did not totally compromise the
project execution as financing was adequate to allow the project achieve
its objectives reasonably well.
8.03      The project satisfactorily achieved its physical objectives as
100% of betterment works were properly carried out, 70% of rehabilitation
and upgrading and 902 of resealing works acceptably completed, while the
road gangs ("cantonnage") did and continue to do very satisfactory works
which are keeping the road network passable all year round. The training
program succeeded in training lower level staff, but did not train man-
agers, with a consequence that technical assistance is still needed in the
medium term to carry out effective road maintenance operations. This con-
cern will be properly addressed under the proposed Sixth Highway Project.
8.04      The overall ERR for the betterment and rehabilitation and up-
grading programs, is about 155X, compared with the appraisal estimate which
is in excess of 100%. The results of the first year returns show that
these operations were overdue and point to the importance and urgency of
having undertaken the maintenance works on these roads much earlier (para.
5.14).
8.05      Under the project, the road maintenance organization was con-
solidated and labor-intensive routine maintenance operations institu-
tionalized. The Government and IDA performances contributed to a better
design.of the project and its implementation. However, both institutions
could have been more diligent in processing procurement of the equipment,
and the Government firmer in managing the construction of the training
center, thus avoiding two years delay in project execution.
8.06      The project achieved its objectives in improving the conditions
of the road network, and increasing RB capacity to plan, execute and
control proper road maintenance operations. The project achievements con-
stitute a basis for the implementation of the third phase of road main-
tenance program, the proposed Sixth Highway Project, which will assist this
land-locked country in pursuing its double objective of: (i) improving
major road connections with its neighbors and between its regional centers
and the capital and (ii) improving its institutional capabilities to carry
out efficient road maintenance operations. The Sixth Highway Droject will
put priority on training in general and in particular the trailing of man-
agers to gradually replace the extensive technical assistance provided to
RB. To avoid the shortcomings highlighted in this report (paras 3.08 and



- 16 -
3.12), the program will set specific targets to train managers, and will be
carried out by consultants whose sole job will be training. In addition to
the training program itself, a number of accompanying measures would be
taken to firmly establish training and manpower development within RB.
These include the strengthening of RB's Personnel Bureau, the setting up of
a Training Unit and of a Training Coordination Committee to provide a
functional link between training and personnel management on the one hand
and training and the technical services on the other.

Dear Mr. Watanabe,
We thank you for sending us a copy of your project completion
report on Rwanda Fourth Highway Project. We read the copy with
great interest and its content is of great value to us.
The report is very comprehensive and we have no additional remarks.
For the Rwanda Sixth Highway Project (1986 - 1989) we suggested
to the Rwandese Ministry of Public Works and Energy to improve
the cooperation between the resealing units on paved roads which
are financed by your institution and KfW.
World Bank and KfW should continue their mutual information
on their activities in the sector; in this connection we will
stay in contact with your transport division 1, Eastern and
Southern Africa projects.
Sinc     yours

BiIagc(n):
Dear Sir,
Re : Project Completion Report on Rwanda Fourth Highway ProJect
I herewith acknowledge receipt of your letter dd. February 20, 1986
and thank you for the report attached thereto on the completion
of the Fourth Highway project in Rwanda.
As you . reminded    us, this project was actually cofinanced by
AGCD, although on a very informal basis. AGCD happened to finance
the cost of two experts, long term technical assistants to the
Rwandese Directorate general of Fonts et Chauss6es and its workshop
for mechanisation. We understand that their services were appreciated
during the implementation of the project.
We look forward to receiving also the final project completion
report.
Sincerely,
APR 2 z 1W
