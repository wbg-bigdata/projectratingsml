RWANDA - FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Republic of Rwanda
Amount:        US$15.0 million equivalent
Terms:         Standard
Prolect
Description:  (a)  Objectives:  To improve the main road network by assisting
Government in carrying out a road betterment program and
in expanding and strengthening road maintenance operations
and the capacity of the Road Branch of the Ministry of
Public Works and Infrastructure of Rwanda.
(b)  Major Comporents
(i) A four-year betterment program to improve 500 km
of gravel roads, to rehabilitate or upgrade
another 1,000 km of roads to gravel standards,
and to seal about 100 km of heavily trafficked
paved roads (which receive no maintenance at
present);
(ii) a four-year mnaintenance program to strengthen
operations, on about 3,500 km of earth & gravel
roads and to initiate routine maintenance on
about 350 km of paved roads;
(iii) strengthening and expansion of the Road Branch
through a tratning progran for maintenance per-
sonnel at all leve>a, and equipment, vehicles,
workshop facllitiea.  msterials, and technical
assistance recessart for project implementation.
(c)  Benefits:  The main quan-ified benefits from the better-
ment program will be the savings in vehicle operating
costs which will accmfe primarily to road users.  Domes-
tic freight rates can be expected to stabilize as a re-
sult of road betterment and maintenance. The reduced
transport costs are expected to stimulate agricultural
production and thus increase foreign exchange earnings.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FOR THE FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Rwanda for the equivalent of US$15.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fourth Highway Project. The
project will be co-financed on grant terms by the UNDP ($1.3 million), the
Federal Republic of Germany ($2.3 million), Belgium ($460,000) and the World
Food Program ($2.0 million).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Memorandum on the Economy of Rwanda" (No. 1108-
RW) was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 27, 1976. The next
economic mission is scheduled for April 1978.
3.        Rwanda became independent in 1962.  The present Government was
established in 1973 and faces many challenges. Achievement of lasting
structural improvements in Rwanda's economy is hampered by the country's
acute poverty and by many physical and manpower constraints. With an average
per capita income of about US$110 in 1976, Rwanda is one of the 25 poorest
countries designated as "least developed" by the United Nations, The problem
of an already high population density of 165 inhabitants per km is exacer-
bated by the pressure of a rapidly rising population on the limited arable,
aud indeed total land available. Although agriculture provides more than
half of Rwanda's exports (coffee, tea and pyrethrum the remainder consisting
of minerals), the expansion of export crops is constrained by the priority
accorded to the production of foodcrops for domestic consumption. Rwanda's
manufacturing base is extremely narrow and its expansion is hampered by the
limited size of the market, the lack of raw materials, insufficient knowledge
of the mineral endowment, shortage of trained labor, and inadequate ancillary
services such as banking and marketing.
4.        Despite these handicaps, the present Government has made percep-
tible progress in developing a strategy to lift the economy from its present
low level. Some aspects of the country's characteristics are favorable and
it is around these that the Government has designed its strategy. The popu-
lation has a certain unity, deriving from similarities in customs, ways of
life and standard of living throughout the country. Income and wealth dis-
tribution are remarkably even. There are neither the remnants of a strong
traditional hierarchy nor signs of significant emerging urban-rural polari-
zation. Moreover, the small size of the country reduces the administrative



- 2 -
difficulties and at the same time limits serious regionalism. The country
also has a natural asset in its relatively fertile soil which, provided that
the problem of erosion in Rwanda's hilly terrain can be overcome, can give
good yields for a variety of fooderops. To take advantage of and preserve
these admittedly modest assets, the Government has recognized that its devel-
opment policies must be built around a carefully integrated and balanced
strategy reaching the entire population.
5.        Following an increase of about 1.8 percent per annum between 1971
and 1974, GDP at constant prices expanded by 9.4 percent in 1975 and 7.1 per-
cent in 1976 when increases in agricultural production triggered expansion
of the industrial (including construction) and service sectors as well.
Significantly, more than 85 percent of the increase in agricultural produc-
tion came from subsistence crops. Merchandise exports, in value, neverthe-
less, roughly doubled during these two years owing largely to above average
coffee crops and extremely favorable world coffee prices.
6.        Among the encouraging developments of recent years are also;  (a)
the significant deceleration of the rate of inflation in 1976; (b) substan-
tial improvements in the Government's financial position, the balance of pay-
ments and in the banking system's reserves; (c) increased attention by the
Government to key sectors such as agriculture; and (d) intensified efforts
in development planning which have culminated in the preparation of a plan
for the 1977-81 period.
7.        After rising at a rate of 6.2 percent in 1971-73, prices recorded
an increase of about 30 percent per year in both 1974 and 1975; but the rate
of inflation contracted sharply to 7 percent, in 1976, helped by the return
of supplies to more normal levels, and the arrest of the increase in import
prices.
8.        The Government's current revenues exceeded current expenditures
by 4 percent in 1975 and 32 percent in 1976. The improvement was brought
about by higher imports (import duties are a significant source of revenue),
high coffee prices, and improved collection of income and profit taxes.
Unlike the 1970-73 period when current expenditures expanded much faster
than GDP, in 1974-76 they expanded by 22 percent compared to a growth of
26 percent in GDP.
9.        Imports increased dramatically in 1975, producing a substantial
deficit in the balance of trade; but exports rebounded strongly in 1976
turning the deficit into a small surplus. The chronic deficit in the ser-
vices account rose by more than 50 percent in 1975 and contracted somewhat
in 1976. As a result of these changes, the current account deficit, which
had increased to about $69 million in 1975, declined to $40 million in 1976.
The deficits in both years were more than offset by net inflows of official
transfers and capital with the result that net foreign exchange reserves
jumped from about $7.5 million at the end of 1974 to about $48 million at
the end of 1976, equivalent to about 6 months of merchandise imports.



10.       Agriculture is the principal focus of Government policy, with
higher foodcrop productivity a major objective. A review of the agricul-
tural sector completed by the Bank in 1977 (Report No. 1377-RW) concluded
that a 3% growth rate in yields is necessary in order to meet food produc-
tion needs without endangering soil fertility. To this end, in the last
few years, the Government has been working on a rural development plan with
major efforts directed at foodcrop intensification. These efforts would be
linked with soil conservation and livestock development (two large mixed
farming projects are being undertaken with financial assistance from IDA)
and supported by extension services and appropriate infrastructure, includ-
ing local roads and storage facilities, which will assist Government efforts
to implement a suitable price policy. Inevitably, achieving the desired
results will take time.
11.       In the mining sector (cassiterite, wolframite, etc...), which con-
tributes relatively little to GDP but constitutes a major source of foreign
exchange earnings, the merger of several companies in 1973 into the Societe
Miniere du Rwanda (SOMIRWA) has arrested the decline in the sector's output,
lowered administration costs, and improved technical efficiency. Although
some positive steps have been taken in the manufacturing sector as well, such
as the preparation of a new investment code, progress in this sector is bound
to be slow because of the priority which has to be accorded to food production.
12.       Rwanda's landlocked position at 1,700 km from the nearest port,
Mombasa, has been particularly disadvantageous in recent years when trans-
portation costs have risen sharply. Attempts are being made to improve the
route through Tanzania via Rusumo for alternative access to the ocean while
a new road northward to Uganda was recently completed. The road southward
to Burundi is also being improved. Although these are positive steps, more
efforts to improve the transportation network, both internal and external,
are necessary in order to expand the production base and ameliorate distribu-
tion.
13.       Development planning in Rwanda is indicative in nature.  While the
country did have a formal plan covering the period 1966 through 1970, planning
since then has been based on several ad hoc studies. The draft suimmary plan
for 1977-81 may be seen as an attempt to address the overall and sectoral
problems of the economy in a more structured fashion. Even though the docu-
ment may still be revised before being adopted officially, it throws some
light on the Government's priorities, particularly as it is accompanied by
a list of projects. A major objective of the plan is the improvement of in-
frastructure in order to improve communication and transportation and thus
provide incentives to more intensive cultivation and diversification. The
document projects an annual average growth rate of GDP of about 6 percent.
Of the projected investment of about $580 million over 1977-81, nearly 30
percent would be allocated to physical and administrative infrastructure.
Of an estimated $220 million intended for agriculture, nearly 40 percent
would be devoted to rural development as such. Functionally, almost one
third of the proposed expenditures would go into feasibility studies and
other selected administrative assistance. As a means of promoting small



- 4 -
industries, the plan calls for the setting up of a fund to guarantee loans
to small-scale business. According to the draft plan, 72 percent of the pro-
jected investment would be provided by external sources, 5 percent by the
Government and 23 percent by the private sector.
14.       Although the performance of Rwanda's economy in the last two years
has been encouraging, substantial infusion of financial and technical assis-
tance well suited to the country s needs will be crucially needed in the
years ahead. Assistance in the past has been provided largely by Belgium,
Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, the European
Development Fund, UNDP and IDA. In February 1977, the Government organized
a "Table Ronde" meeting of aid agencies in Kigali to set forth its planning
objectives, to ensure that future projects are more closely related to national
priorities. The meeting provided a useful exchange of views on the future
of Rwanda's economy and a basis for improved coordination among the agencies.
15.       Rwanda's external debt is low.  External debt outstanding and dis-
bursed was estimated at the end of 1976 at about $66 million of which IDA
credits represented $21.1 million (32%). The service payments on debt are
estimated at about $1.0 million per year, or 1-2 percent of exports. Because
of Rwanda's level of poverty, assistance should continue to be on the most
concessional terms possible,including the financing of a substantial part of
the local currency cost of projects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN RWANDA
16.       Bank Group assistance started in 1970 and initially focused on
the improvement of the road network, which is vital for the movement of the
country's domestic and foreign trade. Rwanda has received nine IDA credits
totalling US$59.7 million, of which four (including one supplemental IDA
credit) were for roads, three for agriculture, one for education and one
for a DFC project. There have been no Bank loans. An IFC loan of US$535,000
for a tea factory was signed in 1976. Annex II contains a summary statement
of IDA credits, IFC investments and notes on the execution of ongoing proj-
ects.
17.       The First Highway Project (Credit 196-RW) was affected by cost
overruns and, in 1975, a supplemental IDA credit was approved in the amount
of US$9.5 million. About US$0.8 million of this credit is being used to help
finance cost increases under the Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 299-RW)
of 1972. The Saudi Fund for Development agreed to co-finance part of the cost
overrun on the First Highway Project with a loan of US$5.0 million signed in
Occober 1976.  The implementation of the Agricultural Development (Mutara)
Project (Credit 430-RW of Nov. 29, 1973) began in September 1974, about a year
behind schedule. The project has experienced several difficulties and project
cost has increased substantially. Following a recent in-depth review, it is
now being revised and certain elements eliminated in order to allow attain-
ment of all of its principal objectives. Credit agreements for a DFC and a



-5-
Cinchona Project were signed in August 1976. The Bugesera Est and Gisaka/
Migongo Mixed Farming and Rural Development Project was signed in March 1977.
All three of these projects are in very early stages of execution.
18.       Because of the lack of skilled manpower and expertise in Rwanda
execution of projects will require substantial assistance from Bank Group
staff and expatriate experts. With respect to new operations, we plan to put
primary emphasis on agriculture while continuing our support to the highway
and education sectors. In the case of agriculture, the government is prepar-
ing an extension of the Mutara project (livestock and mixed farming) and a
forestry project is under discussion. In education we are awaiting the
outcome of a UNESCO sector survey which should determine the needs for future
investment. In highways we have indicated our willingness to consider financ-
ing the Kigali-Ruhengeri road if found to be economically feasible. Two other
projects were identified: one in local construction industry where the
Government has expressed its belief that there is a need to develop the
domestic construction industry and to increase the competition among contrac-
tors; the other one in the water supply sector, where a WHO team is currently
in the field conducting a survey under the cooperative program.
9.       We have taken an interest in regional cooperation involving Rwanda.
Last year Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi created a regional economic organization
named the Economic Community of the Great Lakes with its headquarters at
Gisenyi in Rwanda. As this organization evolves we intend to support its
activities through appropriate regional projects.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
20.       The topography of Rwanda, which changes from rugged mountainous
terrain in the west to a rolling plateau scattered with swampy valleys, in
the east, makes road construction costly and transportation difficult.
Transport in Rwanda relies on a very dense network of poorly maintained roads.
There are no railroads, and the only water transport, on Lake Kivu, is of
no. real significance. The international airport of Kigali is the only one
capable of handling long-range jets. The road network, totaling aboMt 6,300
km, is one of the densest in Africa, with an average of 250 m per km .  It
is divided into two classes: (i) the national network (2,400 km), maintained
by Road Branch (RB) and comprising about 350 km of bituminous-surfaced roads,
280 km of recently regravelled roads, 770 km of very old gravel roads, and
1,000 km of earth roads; and (ii) the district network, consisting of 3,900 km
of earth roads, maintained by local authorities. This classification, how-
ever, is only functional since all roads that are not bituminous-surfaced or
recently regravelled are low standard earth roads characterized by corrugated
surfaces, large ruts and potholes, and, in wet weather, by deep mud.
21.       Since 1971, overall traffic in Rwanda has grown at an average
annual rate of about 10%. The national vehicle fleet grew at an average
annual rate of 18% until 1976 when the rate declined to 13% because of rising
fuel costs. The registered fleet totalled 13,000 vehicles mostly consisting
of passenger cars and light trucks and vans. Annual contributions of road



- 6 -
users to Government revenues averaged US$2.5 million equivalent between
1971 and 1976, increasing at an average annual rate of 22% during that same
neriod,
22.       Total expenditures for roads, including foreign assistance, in-
creased in the period 1971-76 from an annual amount of US$1.1 million to
US$16.9 million. Capital expenditures increased from US$650,000 to US$15.2
million and recurrent expenditures increased from US$400,000 to US$1.7 mil-
lion in the same period. Total foreign aid to the road sector increased from
$245,000 to $13.9 million. Government contributions to capital and recurrent
costs increased at an average annual rate of 30% from about $800,000 in 1971
to $3.0 million in 1976 and expenditures for road maintenance increased
at an average annual rate of 20% from about $400,000 to $1.0 million over the
same period.
23.       The Ministry of Public Works and Infrastructure, through the Road
Branch, is responsible for the design and maintenance of the national net-
work. The Road Branch includes three technical departments: the Workshop
and Warehouse Department, the Planning and Engineering Department and the
Works Department. The technical assistance for the Workshop and Warehouse
Department is financed by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), however its
independence of the RB's Works Department has undercut interdepartmental
coordination and efficiency.
24.       The Road Branch is responsible for planning, supervising and ex-
ecuting routine and periodic road maintenance on the national network (at
present 2,400 km plus an additional 1,100 km of roads included in the proj-
ect). The RB's planned road investment program, up to 1983, is adequate for
Rwanda's needs and is being financed principally by the European Development
Fund and the FRG. Thus, contrary to the past, the Government should have
funds available for maintenance.
25.       The Road Branch still depends largely on foreign technical assis-
tance. The twelve local managerial level staff members are young and
inexperienced. At least some of the local engineers would profit from further
training. The training required by local staff will be provided by a training
program which includes on-the-job training, courses in Kigali and scholarships
abroad. RB staff includes sixteen expatriates - nine provided by the Federal
Republic of Germany, five by IDA and two by Belgium. Five of them are assigned
to the Planning and Engineering Department, six to the Works Department and
five to the Workshop and Warehouse Department.
26.       The Bank's first and third highway projects in Rwanda were for road
construction. The first project financed by a US$9.3 million IDA credit (196-
RW) approved in 1970 and increased through a supplemental credit in 1975 to
US$18.8 million, provided for the construction of the Kigali-Gatuna road,
the final link in an all weather road joining Kigali via Kampala and Nairobi
to the port of Mombasa. The project was substantially completed in late 1977,
having encountered many delays due to slow mobilization of the contractor,
shortages of materials, poor consultant supervision, and slow bureaucratic
procedures. Cost overruns resulted from the severe international inflation of
1973-74 and from currency realignments. The third project, financed by Credit
475-RW, in 1974, involved improvement to paved standards of the Ruhengeri-



- 7 -
Gisenyi road (60 km). It encountered problems similar to those which plagued
the first highway project and was completed in June 1977.
27.       The Bank's second highway project, approved in 1972, consisted
of a program to reorganize and strengthen highway maintenance operations.
The US$3.0 million credit (299-RW) helped finance a total project cost of
US$7.2 million, increased from an appraisal estimate of US$5.1 million.
Additional funds ($1.2 million) were provided for this project out of the
supplemental credit for the first project (Credit 196-RW). The UNDP and
the Federal Republic of Germany participated in the financing of that proj-
ect. Project completion was delayed from 1976 to the end of 1977 due to slow
and difficult mobilization of expatriate experts, slow delivery of equipment
and vehicles, periodic fuel shortages due to frequent border closures be-
tween Uganda and Kenya; and shortages of Government funds. In spite of these
problems the project has been relatively successful and the experience should
help facilitate the implementation of the fourth project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.       A report entitled "Rwanda - Appraisal of a Fourth Highway Project"
No. 1673b-RW) dated February 6, 1978, is being circulated separately.
The project is in part the continuation of the second highway project (road
maintenance), Credit 299-RW of April 19, 1972. Negotiations were held from
December 12 to 15, 1977, and the Rwanda delegation was led by Mr. Ntirugirimbabazi,
The Minister of Finance.
The Project
29.       The proposed project, the second phase of a maintenance program
prepared by consultants (Rhein-Ruhr Ingenieur-Gesellschaft, RRI) and the
Government, The first phase of this program is completed and was financed
under the second highway project. The project consists of;
(i) a four-year betterment program to (a) improve about
500 km of gravel roads; (b) rehabilitate about 270 km
of very old and deteriorated roads; (c) upgrade about
730 km of earth roads to gravel standards; and (d)
seal about 100 km of paved roads with a coat of
bitumen and stone chippings;
(ii) a four-year maintenance program to strengthen opera-
tions on about 3,500 km per year of earth and gravel
roads and to initiate routine maintenance on about
350 km of paved roads;
(iii) the strengthening and expansion of the Road Branch's
(RB) capacity to implement both programs through:
(a) procurement of additional equipment and vehicles;



-8
(b) technical assistance; (c) construction and expan-
sion of workshops; (d) procurement of machine and hand
tools; and (e) procurement of spare parts, fuc'..:
materials for the betterment program;
(iv) a training program for maintenance personnel at all
levels, including courses and scholarshiLps abroad.
Betterment Program
30.       To prevent the further deterioration of the road network, two
mechanized units will do betterment work, which in-volves improvement of about
500 kms of national roads on which the original grave base has completely
worn off because of the lack of maintenance. Rehabilitation and upgrading of
gravel roads will be carried out by two mechanized units which will construct
a base course, 10-15 cm thick and 4-5 m wide. The proposed project will
undertake the sealing of 100 km of paved roads, using one mechanized unit to
apply a coat of bitumen and stone chippings. The betterment program will be
carried out by force account. The Governmen. originally considered engaging
contractors for this work, but subsequently decided to implement the program
by force account, so that the experience gained from the work can benefit RB's
organization. The two improvement units will each do 50 km of improvement per
year for the first two years, 65 km in the third year and 85 km in the fourth
year. The two rehabilitation and upgrading units will each do 100 km in the
first year, 105 km in the second, 140 km in the third, and 155 km in the
fourth year.
Routine Maintenance
31.       The proposed Credit will provide RB with the resoturces to expand
its routine maintenance operations from the present 2,400 km to 3,500 km.
Routine maintenance of the entire earth and gravel road network will be car-
ried out by one mechanized unit staffed by 250 road gangs, and equipped
with 8 trucks and 3 graders. Each gang, staffed with one foreman and twelve
roadmen, will be responsible for approximately 12-15 km of road, its work
mainly involving patching, cleaning culverts, and clearing shoulders, slopes
and ditches. The unit will reshape about 1,100 km of gravel and earth roads
three times a year. Routine maintenance of 350 km of now unmaintained paved
roads will be carried out by one unit of six gangs, the unit being staffed
with a chief, two assistants, twelve foremen, sixty skilled workers and ninety
laborers. The work will be done by labor-intensive methods and will consist
of the same operations as for routine maintenance of earth and gravel roads.
Routine and periodic maintenance of structures and road signs will be carried
out by one unit of two gangs over the entire network. The unit, staffed with
a chief, an assistant, 4 foremen, 40 skilled workers, and 60 laborers, will
repair stone bedding, replace timber flooring and paint metal structures and
signs.
Strengthening of RB
32.       To strengthen the RB and expand its capacity to implement the
proposed program, the project will provide it with additional equipment and
vehicles and 607 man/months of technical assistance for the betterment and



- 9 -
maintenance unit and workshops. Also, for the betterment program the heavy
equipment section in the Kigali Central Workshop will be expanded and two
small workshops in Butare and Cyangugu in the south and southwest of Rwanda
will be constructed. In addition, machine and hand tools for the workshops
and spare parts, fuel, materials, and staff for five mechanized units will
also be provided.
Technical Assistance and Training
33.       The RB still needs a considerable amount of external technical
assistance to carry out its functions efficiently and to train staff at all
levels. The project includes an extensive training program. Theoreti-
cal courses will be provided as well as on-the-job training and 72 man-
months of scholarships for study abroad. The whole training program will
require 84 man-months of consultant services, the construction of classrooms,
and procurement of teaching aids.
34.       The Government would extend ongoing contracts for technical assis-
tance presently financed by IDA and UNDP under the Second Highway Project.
The 607 man-months to be furnished under the project over the four years
of execution is a high level of technical assistance, but the government feels
that it is necessary to make a concerted effort at this time to take advantage
of experience gained in the earlier project. About 75% of the total technical
assistance will, however, be devoted to the betterment program, which will
be carried out by force account. Of the total, IDA will finance about 227
man-months, UNDP 121, the Federal Republic of Germany 216, and Belgium 43.
The cost of such assistance is expected to average about US$8,000 per man-
month, including salaries, overheads, fees, housing and transport. This is
comparable with costs in other African countries. This technical assistance
absorbs a sizeable portion of the proposed project costs, but it will advance
the Government's main objective of gradually staffing the RB and its Mainte-
nance Division with sufficiently qualified local personnel.
ProJect Execution
35.       The Ministry of Public Works and Infrastructure through RB will
be responsible for the execution of the project which is scheduled to begin
in 1978 and to end in late 1981. The Government would be required to report
on project progress on a periodic (quarterly) basis (Sect. 3.04 (a and b iii)
of the Draft Development Credit Agreement) as well as provide a project
completion report at the end of execution (Sect. 3.04(c) of the Draft Devel-
opment Credit Agreement). RB, with the amount of technical assistance pro-
posed, will be able to execute the project successfully, provided that
Government follows up on measures already taken, including:
(i) full implementation within RB of a cost accounting system satis-
factory to the Association (Sect. 4.02(c) of the Draft Development
Credit Agreement) and to ensure that separate accounts are kept to
reflect the operations, resources and expenditures of RB; (Sect.
4.02(d) of the Draft Development Credit Agreement);



- 10 -
(ii) to give RB authority to hire, supervise and dismiss
vehicle drivers and equipment operators (Sect. 4.02(b i)
of the Draft Development Credit Agreement); and
(iii) to simplify RB's purchase orders and payment procedures;
(Sect. 4.02(b ii) of the Draft Credit Development
Agreement).
36.       Use of Labor-Intensive Methods:  The Government considers that
routine maintenance of all roads should be carried out wi%h labor-intensive
methods, as is now done with about 2,500 laborers, and periodic maintenance
and betterment work should be carried out with equipment-intensive methods.
It also considers that investment in equipment for the proposed betterment
program and in trucks to provide mobility for the routine maintenance program
(labor gangs) is necessary. It is prepared to strengthen as needed its
present organization in order to improve the labor-intensive techniques on
operations which it now carries out. To assist the government, the Associa-
tion is planning to send an expert who would, during a short mission to
Rwanda, review the situation with respect to the use of labor-intensive
methods and make recommendations to the Government on appropriate work
methods. Following this, the Association and the Government will review
the expert's recommendations and discuss what action should be taken in the
light of these recommendations. In the meantime, the Government, although
calling for tenders for the entire list of equipment, plans to defer purchase
of equipment valued at about US$500,000 (two angle-dozers, two loaders, 2
pneumatic tired tractors and six tipper trucks) until the review has taken
place.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
37.       The project has a total cost of US$23.7 million equivalent net
of taxes and duties with a foreign exchange component of US$17.6 million
equivalent. Project items include road maintenance equipment, materials,
machine and hand tools, teaching materials, construction of workshops and
classrooms, consultant services, and spare parts and fuel. External assist-
ance would provide about 90% of the estimated total cost of the project,
including 100% of the foreign cost and 57% of local cost. In addition, the
Government will provide US$6.7 million for recurrentmaintenance costs.  In
the first year, it will provide $1.8 million (Sect. 6.01(c) of the Draft
Development Credit Agreement) and, thereafter, an amount not less than;
$1.6 million would be provided annually. Consultations between Government
and the Association will be held periodically on th& adequacy on these amounts
(Section 4.03 d, e) of the draft Credit Agreement). See also para. 22 above).

38.       The program of road betterment and maintenance has started in
January 1978 and retroactive financing of up to $250,000 would be provided
for expenditures made after January 1, 1978 to meet fees of consultants now
on the job and to purchase spare parts and fuel needed early in the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Small amounts of other equipment which should be standardized with
existing equipment, except for highway maintenance equipment (US$3 million)
and machine and hand tools (US$160,000) will be procured through international
competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Spare parts,
fuel and bitumen will be procured on the basis of prices negotiated with
established suppliers. Materials for the betterment program and construction
of the workshops and classrooms will be procured locally on the basis of the
Government's competitive bidding procedures which are acceptable to IDA.
Items costing under US$25,000 may be procured by negotiated purchase after
solicitation of quotations from suppliers or contractors. The total amount
of these purchases is not to exceed US$200,000. The project completion date
is July 1, 1982. The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed against:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of road maintenance equipment,
materials, machine and hand tools, spare parts, and fuel;
(b)  70% of the cost of civil works for expansion and
construction of the workshops;
(c)  80% of the cost of construction of classrooms.
(d)  98% of the cost of teaching aids;
(e)  100% of the cost of scholarships; and
(f)  100% of the cost of consultants.

Benefits and Risks
40.       The main quantified benefits of the betterment program will be the
savings in vehicle operating costs, which will accrue to road users. Unquan-
tified benefits also include time savings and increased comfort to road users,
reduced accidents, and better and more rapid access to medical facilities.
Domestic freight rates can be expected to stabilize as a result of road
betterment and maintenance. Since competition in the road transport sector
is keen, it should be expected that producers and consumers will share the
benefits accruing to those engaged in road transport.
41.       In Rwanda vehicle operating costs are substantially higher than
those in several neighboring countries because of the very poor road con-
ditions. Steep grades and tortuous terrain result in low average speeds
and high fuel consumption. Very rough running surfaces on most roads cause
rapid deterioration of vehicles resulting in high maintenance and repair costs
and high depreciation costs due to shortened vehicle life. Thus the proposed
betterment program will help reduce substantially those components of vehicle
operating costs which are very sensitive to road conditions. Most of these
expected savings are likely to result in appreciable foreign exchange saving
as well. The improvement component of the project yields an economic return
in excess of 150% while the return on rehabilitation and upgrading is 35%.
The overall rate of return to the betterment program is in excess of 100%.
42.       While the project as conceived is economically sound, there are
two possible risks which have been identified. The first one involves a
reduction in the benefits as a result of lack of proper maintenance follow-
ing the betterment work. The other possible risk identified is that project
costs could escalate as a result of a serious drop in productivity during
execution. Sensitivity tests were therefore conducted assuming reductions in
vehicle operating costs (v.o.c.) savings and an increase in project costs.
For the improvement program, tests reveal that the large increases in its cost
or decreases in benefits do not result in unfavorable rates of return. For
the rehabilitation and upgrading program, tests reveal that, should the costs
of this component rise by 15%, the rate of return would still be 24%. If,
on the other hand, v.o.c. savings were reduced by 25%, the rate of return
would still yield 14%. A 12% rate of return would be maintained even if costs
of the rehabilitation and upgrading increased by 37%, while for the improve-
ment component costs would have to increase by more than 250% for the rate of
return to fall below 12%. Similarly benefits could be reduced by 72% to
maintain a 12Z rate of return for the improvement component. For the reha-
bilitation and upgrading component benefits could be reduced by 27% and still
maintain the 12% rate of return.

(PROJECTS IN EXECUTION)
Credit No. 196-RW    Kigali-Gatuna Project; US$9.3 million credit of
June 17, 1970; Date of Effectiveness: September 15, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977;
US$9.5 million supplementary credit of December 19, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness:  February 18, 1976
Closing Date: August 31, 1978
The project consisted of building a paved road to link Kigali with
the Uganda Road system, thus reducing by 73 km the road distance to Kampala
through which most Rwandese imports and exports pass on their way to the port
of Mombassa. Construction works were interrupted in April 1975 because of a
cost overrun amounting to about US$16.0 million, including a foreign exchange
component of US$13.7 million. A supplementary IDA credit of US$9.5 million
was made in 1976 of which US$8.7 million was earmarked for the completion of
the Kigali-Gatuna road and the remainder to finance additional costs under
the Highway Maintenance Project (see below). The cost overrun is cofinanced
with a US$5.0 million loan from the Saudi Fund for Development. Due to a
revision of the contracts between the Government and the contractor and the
supervision consultants, savings of about US$1.0 million were made in the
total cost financing of the project. These savings were used to finance fur-
ther cost increases under the Highway Maintenance Project (about US$600,000)
and a cost increase in the Third Highway Project amounting to about US$400,000.
The road was completed in mid-November 1977, but work is still being carried
out near Gatuna at the Uganda border where the road crosses a marshland.
Uganda has agreed to reimburse Rwanda US$100,000 to pay for the contractor's
activities on Ugandan territory but has thus far not paid. We are using our
good offices with the Ugandan administration to speed up the transfer.
Credit No. 299-RW    Highway Maintenance Project; US$3.0 million credit
of April 19, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: January 15, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project aimed at improving road maintenance capabilities of
Rwanda in order to develop an efficient internal and external road communi-
cations system. Project completion was delayed from 1976 to the end of 1977
by: slow mobilization of expatriate exports; slow delivery of equipment and
vehicles and periodic fuel shortages due to frequent border closures between
Uganda and Kenya; and shortages of Government funds. Reduced operations and
costs overruns resulted. The government therefore maintained the road network
mostly manually, and started mechanized operations only in mid-1976. The
estimated total cost has increased from US$5.1 to US$7.2 million necessitating
additional IDA financing of US$1.4 million (see above Kigali-Gatuna Project).
The project was completed at the end of December 1977 and is to be followed by
the second phase of the highway maintenance program which will be carried out
under the Fourth Highway Project.

Credit No. 439-RW    Mutara Agricultural Development Project; US$3.8 million
Credit of November 29, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: September 5, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project which aims at the agro-pastoral development of some
48,000 ha of land in Mutara, situated west of the Kagera National Park in the
north of Rwanda consists essentially in establishing a cropping settlement,
group ranches, and a breeding ranch. Project implementation began about a
year behind schedule because of delays in selecting a suitable consulting
firm to assist in project execution. Various difficulties have since been
encountered, particularly in recruiting staff and in defining the project
area. In a large area, spontaneous settlement has occurred before project
implementation was underway, thus making it more difficult to organize
settlement as envisaged in the project. Most plots have now been allocated
and the final number of farmers settled will exceed appraisal targets; how-
ever, the number of group ranches established will be about half the
appraisal targets as the actual average area per ranch is much above
appraisal estimates for technical reasons. Following a substantial increase
in project costs, from US$4.3 million to US$7.0 million, mainly as a result
of world-wide price increases, an in-depth project review was carried out by
RMEA to revise the project, and the project scope reduced to take into
account the funds available. A follow-up project is being prepared.
Credit No. 567-RW    Education Project; US$8.0 million credit of
June 30. 1975; Date of Effectiveness; December 1. 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project includes the construction, furnishing and equipment of
150 workshops for about 6,000 students and of a print shop, and the provision
of paper for production and distribution of text books written in Kinyarwanda.
The project also provides technical assistance to the School Financing and
Construction Unit (SFCS) which was established under the project and is
operating satisfactorily. The SFCS will undertake all design work for the
project institutions. The architect of SFCS has recently left Rwanda and
an urgent replacement is being sought under the UNDP/UNESCO Technical
Assistance. Construction work is progressing well for the printshop and
the offices for the SFCS.  One work shop has been completed, nine are nearly
completed and 30 others are under construction. All the nine Rwandese print-
ing technicians have returned from a training course in Tunisia including two
who have attended a supplementary two-months course in France. Teaching
equipment has been purchased for the first ten workshops.

Credit No. 655-RW    Rwandese Development Bank Project; US$4.0 million;
Credit of August 20. 1976; Date of Effectiveness:
March 2. 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This line of credit to the Banque Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD)
is intended to fill a gap in the foreign resources requirements of the only
long-term financing institution in the main productive sectors in Rwanda.
This project is proceeding satisfactorily; the Credit became effective on
March 2, 1977. IDA has already approved projects totalling about US$2.0
million. Also, BRD has obtained additional technical assistance from
Germany. Recently, the Government and BRD have inquired about the possi-
bility of reallocating about US$200,000 from this Credit to finance a
feasibility study for the establishment of an auditing firm in Rwanda.
This proposal will be favorably considered since it had been proposed
by the appraisal mission.
Credit No. 656-RW    Cinchona ProJect:  US$1.8 million credit of August 20,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: March 2, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30. 1982
The project which is to be carried out over a period of five years
provides agricultural inputs, extension, marketing and other services to
smallholders to assist in the expansion of cinchona production for export
by extending the present plantations by about 900 ha. Project staff has
been appointed and an expatriate cinchona expert is being hired to visit
Rwanda from time to time to give advice on cinchona production. Progress is
satisfactory and there are no major problems so far.
Credit No. 668-RW    Bugesera Est and Gisaka/Migongo Mixed Farming and
Rural Development Project:  US$14.0 million credit of
March 31, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: November 23, 1977;
Closing Date: September 30, 1982
The project consists of the promotion of mixed farming and rural
development in two regions and the strengthening of the central services
responsible for rural development. The project includes tsetse control, field
extension and infrastructure, provision of farm inputs on credit, construction
and improvement of feeder roads and water facilities, schools, and health
centers, establishment of two cattle ranches and a study for an irrigation
project. The project is cofinanced by BADEA (US$5.0 million equivalent for
livestock development) and Belgium (US$0.9 million equivalent for water
facilities). The French Government has agreed to provide seven of the nine
experts required by the project. Of these, three are already in post (the
Project Director and the two Regional Directors), and the first work plans
have been prepared.
