I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Brazil and the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD)
have requested a Bank loan of US$304.5 million to finance mining, railroad and
port equipment, technical assistance, and a small amount of townsite civil works
for the integrated development of the Carajas iron ore project. The proposed
Project would consist of a 35 million ton per year (tpy) open pit mining develop-
ment in the eastern Amazonian state of Para, a 280,000 dwt capacity deepwater
port at Ponta da Madeira in the northern coastal state of Maranhao, and an
890-km interconnecting railroad line (Map IBRD 16254), all of which would be
owned and operated by CVRD. The Carajas iron ore deposits presently represent
the largest potential for development and export in Brazil's mining sector.
Development of this potential through the Project will expand iron ore exports
and contribute positively to Brazil's balance of payments. The proposed loan
would be the first by the Bank Group directly to CVRD, one of the leading iron
ore mining companies in the world and the largest mining company in Brazil,
and would be the fifth loan in the Brazilian mining sector. 1/
1.02      The Government first discussed the Project with the Bank in 1972
when the Project was in its early stages of formulation. Since then, the
Government, the Project owners, and the Bank have had continuous dialogue
during which the Project has undergone significant modifications in scope,
design and ownership.
1.03      A preparation mission for the Carajas project visited Brazil in
February 1981, followed by a preappraisal mission in June/July 1981. The
Project was appraised in October/November 1981 by a mission comprising
Ms. M. 0. Smith (Chief), and Messrs. J. Franz and B. Stenberg (IND);
Ms. Koch-Weser (AGR); Mr. R. Goodland (PAS); and Messrs. R. Bourton, A. Funes
and F. Higginbottom (Consultants). Follow-up missions were carried out by
Mr. J. Newman (LCP) and by Messrs. M. Lal (LCP), S. Spencer (TWT), A. Funes
(Consultant) and Mr. E. Echeverria (LCP) in January/February 1982 and by
Messrs. Stenberg and Franz (IND) in March 1982.
II. SECTOR ISSUES AND REGIONAL IMPACT
A.   Background
2.01      During 1967-73, Brazil sustained high economic growth (over 10% per
year) while liberalizing trade, reducing inflation rates, building inter-
national reserves, and accumulating only modest external debt. Despite the
severe impact of oil price increases (Brazil at that time imported more than
1/   The Bank Group has participated in three CVRD-sponsored projects, i.e.,
the Trombetas bauxite project (US$15 million IFC investment, Report No.
IFC/J-201, 1977); the Valefertil fertilizer project, (US$82 million, Loan
1411-BR, 1977); and the Valesul aluminum project (US$98 million, Loan
1660-BR, 1979). The other mining sector loans were made for Companhia
Mineira de Aluminio (US$22 million, Loan 526-0-BR, 1968) and Mineracoes
Brasileiras Reunidas S.A. (US$50 million, Loan 785-0-BR, 1971).

80% of its oil), growth continued to average better than 7% per year in
1973-80 under a high-growth strategy by the Government and availability of
external financing in large volumes and on relatively easy terms. Growth in
this latter period, however, was accompanied by accelerating inflation, a
quadrupling of external debt, increasing government intervention in the
economy, and declining rates of domestic saving. 1/
2.02      In 1981, the economy, reflecting Government stabilization measures,
entered into an industrial recession, with industrial production falling by
nearly 10% and GDP by 4%. The balance of trade, however, turned positive
(US$1.2 billion surplus) for the first time since 1977 and inflation was
reduced to 95%, with a steadily declining trend evident through the second
half of the year.
2.03      GDP growth is expected to recover to about 4% in real terms in 1982,
and the Government plans to maintain an average growth rate of around 5% in
real terms for the rest of the decade, based in large part on a strong export
performance. The Government therefore has given emphasis in its investment
policies towards export expansion and further import substitution.
2.04      The Carajas Project forms an important part of this national strategy
because all iron ore produced at Carajas is to be exported. While a small
portion of Project exports will replace exports from CVRD's southern mining
operations (para. 3.44), the Project will be a sizeable net foreign exchange
earner for the country over at least the next 50 years (para. 3.03). Govern-
ment recognition of this importance, and of the Project's potential impact on
stimulating other resource developments in the Eastern Amazon, is discussed
below.
B.   The Mining Sector
2.05      In 1980, the mining sector contributed over 10% (about US$1.6
billion) to the value of the country's merchandise exports, about 1.3% to GDP,
and about 1% to total Government revenues.
2.06      Sector output is highly diversifed (some 70 mineral commodities
are produced) although dominated by iron ore, which in 1980 accounted for
26% of the value of mineral production and over 90% of the value of mineral
exports as shown in the table below. In addition to being one of the world's
principal producers of iron ore (Chapter III), Brazil is the leading producer
of pyrochlore (columbium), ferro colombium and natural quartz crystals. In
terms of value, other important minerals are crushed stone, limestone, coal,
marine salt, manganese, bauxite, gold and tin.

2.07      The enormity of BrazilJs known reserves in many of its important
minerals provides the country with a long-term economic base.  Recent dis-
coveries of large bauxite reserves in the Amazon have increased measured
bauxite reserve estimates to about 4.5 billion tons, ranking Brazil third
after Guinea and Australia. The recently discovered Serra Pelada gold deposit,
south of Carajas, is estimated to contain more than 100 tons of gold. Pub-
lished figures (1979) show that Brazil also has substantial measured reserves
of beryllium, chromium, copper, manganese, tin, titanium, tungsten, and
uranium. Particular gains in production in 1980 were achieved in gold,
bauxite and phosphate rock.
2.08      While it is widely felt by Government agencies and mining companies
that the country is not well explored, recent increases in reserve levels
indicate an upswing in exploration activity. It is estimated that US$48-50
million was spent on exploration in 1981, of which DOCEGEO, a subsidiary
of CVRD, accounts for US$22 million, primarily in the Amazon region. Between



1971 and 1980, DOCEGEO spent US$115 million. The Government provides fiscal
incentives for exploration by Brazilian firms and financing of exploration and
development through Banco National do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE) and
Companhia de Pesquisa e Recursos Mineracais (CPRM), a small exploration agency
created in the mid-1960s.
2.09      Brazil's mining sector is made up of about 670 companies, most of
which are privately held. Production, however, is concentrated in 50 major
companies which accounted for 61% of total output in 1979. Three of these are
state owned.
2.10      Companies operate under a mining code established in 1967 under
Decree Law No. 227 which provides a sound basis for the development of Brazil's
mineral wealth. 1/ The Departmento Nacional da Producao Mineral (DNPM) within
the Ministry of Mines and Energy is responsible for the implementation of
mining policy, enforcement of the mining code, and issuance of exploration
and mining licenses. In addition, the DNPM prepares the national mining
plans. There have been two such plans, the first covering the years, 1965-75,
and the second, 1981-90. While the first plan emphasized regional geological
mapping and exploration work, the second plan consists of general statements
of objectives in mine development. The second plan gives priority to the
production of copper to reduce the substantial import of this commodity
(estimated at US$494 million in 1980) and to other commodities in which Brazil
is deficient, namely lead, zinc, tin and aluminum. The development program
for the greater Carajas region is handled outside the second plan and is
discussed in Section D below.
2.11      The Government is actively promoting both domestic and especially
private participation in the mineral sector through the provision of tax,
financial, and customs incentives. The Government has given priority to
the Carajas Project, granting in late 1980 particular incentives for the
Project, as well as for the overall Grande Carajas Program.
C.   Steel Developments
2.12      Between 1960-80, Brazil's steel industry experienced rapid and
steady growth. While world steel output increased on average by 3.7% a year,
Brazilian production increased by 10.0% a year. By 1980 Brazil had become the
tenth largest steel producer in the world (15.3 million tons in crude steel
equivalent) and the largest in Latin America. 2/
2.13      Production by the state-owned SIDERBRAS group contributed 61%
(9.4 million tons) of the output in 1980, while private industry provided
1/   The code is a revision of the 1940 code and is considered to be clear,
concise and liberal.
2/   The leading steel producers by order of (million tons of) output were the
U.S.S.R. (150.5), Japan (111.4), U.S. (103.2), F.R. Germany (43.8), China
(34.0), Italy (26.5), France (23.1), Poland (18.0), Canada (15.9), Brazil
(15.3), and Czechoslovakia (15.0).

the balance (5.9 million tons). The three principal producers accounting
for over half of total output are CSN, COSIPA and USIMINAS for which the
Bank has made a total of five loans. 1/ The breakdown of production among
major producers is as follows:

2.14      The development of the steel sector in the late 1960s and early
1970s was part of national development plans to meet growth in domestic
consumption, with exports beginning only in the late 1970s. Domestic con-
sumption grew at an average rate of 9% p.a. between 1970 and 1980, reaching
15.2 million tons in equivalent ingots in 1980. Steel exports outstripped
Brazil's steel imports for the first time in 1979. Brazil had a positive
trade balance in steel of 1.1 and 1.2 million tons in 1979 and 1980,
respectively.
2.15      The steady expansion in the Brazilian steel industry was reversed
in 1981, when steel production and consumption contracted sharply, reflecting
general stagnation in the Brazilian economy. By 1985-86, however, it is
expected that domestic consumption will have surpassed that of 1981. Forecast
iron ore consumption by domestic steel producers is shown in the table in
para. 3.40.
1/   In 1972, the Bank made three loans to help finance the Stage II expansions
of CSN, COSIPA and USIMINAS (Loan Nos. 797-BR, 828-BR, and 812-BR respec-
tively). These were followed, in 1975, by loans to CSN and COSIPA
(1151-BR and 1152-BR) for their Stage III expansions.

D.   Regional Impact
2.16      The Project is located within tVe Eastern Amazon, in the Greater
Carajas region, an area of about 4,000 km , located north of the 8th parallel
and between the Amazon, Xingu and Parnaiba rivers, covering part of the
states of Para, Goias and Maranhao. The natural wealth of the Eastern
Amazon, is unique in mineral potential, and includes iron ore, manganese,
nickel, copper, tin, bauxite, gold and others. The conditions are also
favorable to agricultural, cattle raising and reforestation activities.
Most of the recent imineral discoveries have been in the Carajas region.
2.17      A Grande Carajas Program has been developed that outlines a broad
scheme for regional investments in the magnitude of some US$60 billion. The
objective is to develop the region into a highly productive center of basic
raw materials, semi-finished and finished products, mostly for export; however,
the precise scope and timing of specific projects still need to be defined. 1/
2.18      One of the preconditions to future major developments in the region
is the existence of basic infrastructure. In this respect, the Carajas
Project will contrilbute substantially to regional development through
installation of a major railroad line in West-East direction linking the
remote Serra dos Carajas area with the northern sea coast near Sao Luis and
through development of a bulk terminal capable of handling ships up to 280,000
dwt. The Project will round-out basic infrastructure requirements, since the
region is beginning to receive other large infrastructure investments. Among
these are (i) the Transamazonia highway running East to West and the Belem-
Brasilia highway running North to South, both of which are already constructed;
(ii) the Tucurui hydroelectric plant with an initial capacity of 4,000 MW,
scheduled for start-up in 1983; (iii) the Itaqui commercial port at Sao Luis
capable of handling vessels of up to 60,000 dwt, in operation; and (iv) the
Barcarena river port in Para State, capable of handling vessels of up to
50/60,000 dwt, under construction.
2.19      The major mining projects implemented in the region so far have
been located near commercial waterways or in coastal areas. These include
the Trombetas bauxite project which has access to the Amazon River, the
Alunorte and Albras alumina and aluminum projects in Barcarena near Belem,
and the Alcoa alumina and aluminum projects near Sao Luis (Map). The Carajas
infrastructure will open up the Serra dos Carajas area in the interior where
the potential for resource development is high.
2.20      There are several projects which are in early stages of development
and are likely to make use of the Carajas transportation network in the
medium term, including: (i) a copper concentrate project, for which CVRD has
completed exploration, and has prefeasibility work under contract; (ii) a
ferro-manganese project, for which CVRD is studying a possible joint-venture
development; (iii) several tin projects which Brazilian private firms are
implementing; (iv) a bauxite project at Paragominas, which is being studied by
1/   Copper concentrate, bauxite, ferro-manganese, tin and gold projects are
in early stages of development (para. 2.20).



- 7 -
foreign and local companies, including CVRD; and (iv) the mechanized exploita-
tion of gold at Serra Pelada, which has been mined so far superficially by
hand.
2.21      The Project will also spur indirectly, over the long term, develop-
ment of the more important towns and areas in the region into commercial and
industrial centers. The Grande Carajas Program envisages the development
of seven such centers: Carajas (production of iron ore), Sao Felix do Xingu
(production of tin concentrate), Maraba (central junction for railway,
waterway and highway systems), Tucurui (pig iron and sponge iron production),
Barcarena (already installed for production of alumina and aluminum), Para-
gominas (production of alumina and aluminum), and Sao Luis/Ponta da Madeira
(production center for semi-manufactured steel products, export sinter,
among others). While these developments are for the most part conceptual at
this stage, the Carajas Project, in addition to laying basic infrastructure,
will draw large numbers of persons into the region (with direct employment
alone to be close to 5,600 persons at full operation), stimulate growth of
supporting services and facilities, and accelerate the region's social and
economic transformation.
III. THE IRON ORE MARKET
A.   Background
3.01      The worldwide iron ore market has had surplus capacity since the
late 1970s, reflecting the sharp downturn in world steel demand in 1975
and the generally weak steel market thereafter. After a normal one to two-
year lag behind the contraction in steel output, iron ore consumption and
supply began to decline in 1976-77. Iron ore consumption turned up in
1979, following an increase in crude steel production in 1978, but began to
decline again in 1980. Large expansions in iron ore production capacities
were made when steel consumption in market economies was growing at
5.2% annually (1960 through 1974). By 1978-79, these capacity increases
could no longer be absorbed as steel consumption in market economies fell on
average by 0.9% annually (1974 through 1980). By 1980, iron ore production is
estimated to have been in the range of 15% below effective production
capacity. 1/
3.02      The market prospects for iron ore are inextricably linked to
the demand for steel which in turn depends in large part on GDP growth.
Demand for iron ore in the market economy countries 2/ has been projected
based on two alternative steel production growth scenarios that cover the
range of reasonable expectations. The two scenarios assume growth in steel
production in the market economies at 1.8% p.a. and 2.7% p.a., respectively.
1/   Effective capacity is defined here as the upper limit of sustainable
operating capacity or 90% of normal design capacity. The effective
operating rate is the extent to which effective capacity is used.
2/   Includes industrialized countries and developing countries as listed
in footnotes to the table in para. 3.04.



- 8 -
Growth is thereby expected to be more rapid in developing countries (4.9% to
6.3% p.a.) than in industrialized countries (1.0% to 1.8% p.a.) which still
account for over three quarters of total steel consumption. As discussed in
more detail below, the analysis of iron ore demand based on these two scenarios
indicates that by the second half of the 1980s the iron ore market will be
either approximately in balance (with a surplus of potential iron supply of
less than 2% of iron ore demand in the low steel-growth scenario) or, under
the high steel-growth scenario, face a growing supply deficit to reach over
10% of iron ore demand in 1990, unless new mining capacity beyond that under
implementation or presently planned were to come on stream, in addition to
increases in effective operating rates in existing mines. In any case, even
under the low steel-growth scenario, any iron ore surplus will have disappeared
by the late 1980s. Various iron ore market experts using differing assumptions
have made forecasts with similar findings (para. 3.25). While these experts
differ on the exact timing of iron ore market equilibrium, they concur in the
general expectation that the current iron ore overcapacity will work itself
out and might turn into a deficit as early as the mid-1980s.
3.03      The Carajas iron ore development has advantages over other potential
new developments which may or may not materialize in the 1980s, despite its
disadvantage of accessibility due to the remote location of the deposits in
the Eastern Amazon. These advantages are:
(a)  A high-grade ore with about 66.0% Fe, requiring no con-
centration, and having positive sintering and blast furnace
properties;
(b)  Large, easily mineable deposits with a long-term potential
of at least 50 years based on presently measured reserves
of 2.6 billion tons of ore;
(c)  Good marketability exemplified by already existing long-
term purchase contracts for 24.7 million tpy, i.e., 71%
of the initial 35 million tpy production target, with
provision of guaranteeing the off-take of at least 80%
of the contracted tonnage in each single year;
(d)  Relatively low estimated operating costs which together with
the expected long mine life, will help to defray the high
initial capital cost of the Project (para. 7.08); and
(e)  Ownership by an existing well-managed, experienced and
financially-sound iron ore operating company.
B.   International Iron Ore Market
1.   Historic Production, Consumption and Trade
3.04      World iron ore production increased on average at a swift 3.5%
p.a. between 1960 and 1975-76, but has remained fairly static thereafter. In
1979 there was an increase in output reflecting a temporary recovery in
steel consumption, but in 1980 iron ore output declined again due mainly to
steel production cutbacks in the industrialized countries. Apparent iron ore



consumption 1/ has followed the same pattern. The following table summarizes
production and apparent consumption growth of iron ore from 1960-80.

3.05            Over the two decades, there has been a shift in production away from
the industrialized countries, particularly the U.S. and EC countries, toward
the developing countries and Australia, with the developing countries account-
ing for about 46% of total iron ore production in market economies in 1980,
compared to 27% in 1960. Production from developing countries and new mining
areas, (i.e., Australia) accounted for over 60% in 1980.
3.06            The change in major sources of production has been accompanied
by a structural change in industrial ownership. Traditionally, most iron
ore production was captive to the steel industry. While this is still
largely the case in the U.S., Canada and Sweden, captive mining has diminished
substantially elsewhere in Europe. There is now greater reliance by the steel
industry on ore produced independently and from large-scale mines where
operating costs are lower than those of traditional suppliers. Often the ores
are imported under long-term purchase contracts. The Carajas Project is
typical of this market trend.
3.07            International trade in iron ore has developed significantly over
the past two decades, reflecting the shift in area of production (para. 3.05).
Between 1960 and 1980, total exports more than doubled, from 152 million tons
to 370 million tons, as shown below:
1/   There are no statistics in iron ore consumption published.  Apparent con-
sumption is estimated based on iron production plus country imports less
country exports.

a. Differences due to discrepancies in trade statistics and goods in transit.
"I Since 1961.
3.08                 Major importers continue to be the industrialized countries which
account for about 80% of total trade in iron ore. Japan has become
by far the largest importer (134 million tons in 1980), followed by the
Federal Republic of Germany (50 million tons), the U.S. (25 million tons) and
Belgium-Luxembourg (22 million tons).
3.09                 The two leading exporters are the new mining areas of Australia
(80 million tons in 1980) and Brazil (78 million tons), followed by Canada
(39 million tons) and India (22 million tons). In general, exports from the
European Community (EC) have been declining since 1960, as exports by new
major market entrants, including Liberia, India and South Africa have increased.
3.10                 Major new trade flows have developed in the Pacific and Atlantic
basins centering principally on the Japanese and EC markets. The Japanese
import about half of their ore from Australia and, to maintain diversity
in supply, the remainder from Brazil, India and others. The EC countries
import ore from other near-by European countries, Sweden and Norway, as
well as from Canada, Brazil and Liberia.

3.11      The centrally planned economies (CPEs) have steadily accounted for
about 10-12% of iron ore trade since 1960. While they have traditionally
confined their trade to themselves, since 1975 they have become net importers
of between 14 and 20 million tpy from market economies. The USSR is the major
producer (249 million tons in 1980 out of a total CPE production of 337
million tons), and is the largest CPE exporter of iron ore.
2.   Future Supply/Demand Balance and Quality Considerations
3.12      Iron ore market forecasts rely fundamentally on judgments about
(i) the future growth in steel production and underlying growth in GDP, and
(ii) the future potential iron ore supply. The forecasts of iron ore demand
and supply have been made excluding the CPE countries because information on
future iron ore requirements and production in CPEs is poor. The forecast
demand for iron ore in the market economies (paras. 3.21-3.24), however,
assumes that the CPEs will continue to be net importers of about 15 million
tpy from market economies through 1990. In view of the existing net import
position of the CPEs (para. 3.11) and the likelihood that net imports by the
CPEs from market economies will increase, the assumption is regarded as
conservative.
3.13      Supply.  The estimates of future potential iron ore supply in market
economy countries have been based on (i) an extensive review of potential iron
ore projects to determine those new mines and expansions of existing mines
most likely to be implemented within the decade; and (ii) the expected gradual
depletion or closing of certain existing iron ore mines. The supply estimates
are based on a gradual increase in effective operating rates in major existing
mines and on additional new capacity.
3.14      The production capacity forecasts during the 1980s by country are
shown on the following page. The maximum annual production and year that
production was actually achieved by country are also shown as a reference
point in the forecast.

3.15              The forecast increase in production in market economies of about 106
million tons annually between 1980 and 1990 (from 563 to 669 million tpy) is
due largely to the expected increase by 59 million tpy in Brazilian production
(para. 3.40). It also assumes sizeable increases in current effective opera-
ting rates of existing mines (35 million tpy), other new capacity (63 million
tpy), and depleted capacity (minus 51 million tpy). The table below shows the
forecast new capacity by project.

3.16      While the above iron ore production estimates have been based on the
realization of increases in operating rates of existing mines and likely new
projects, it is recognized that, if there were a major market upturn, addi-
tional discretionary capacity could come on stream with limited additional
investment and a lead time of one to three years. The total amount of such
discretionary capacity is estimated to be about 35 million tpy in 1986 through
1990. This discretionary capacity could also be regarded as potential replace-
ment for the currently-expected expansions, and new mines should then encounter
delays. The incremental discretionary tonnages are to be found mainly in
Australia, Canada, South Africa, the U.S., and Venezuela.
3.17      Quality.  There are various types of iron ore feed such as concen-
trates, sinter fines, lump ores, and pellets, for which market demand has
shifted in the last six to eight years. Until the mid-1970s, the demand for
pellets for blast furnace operations was strong. However, following the sharp
rise in oil prices and the ensuing recession in the industrialized economies,
the demand for pellets decreased more steeply than that for sinter feed

because the steel companies decided to operate their sinter plants at a
higher level of capacity utilization in preference to buying pellets.
3.18      Since coke and iron units (i.e., the Fe units contained in the iron
ore) constitute, on average, 75% to 80% of the production cost of iron-making,
a major concern of the iron and steel industry has been to optimize coke
consumption and general blast furnace productivity. In terms of iron units,
pellets, sinter fines and concentrates are normally of equally high grade, and
the economics associated with different types of burden are the deciding
factor. Compared with pellets, sinter produced from high-grade sinter feed
such as Carajas would provide cost savings due to (i) lower grinding costs and
the simpler beneficiating process required vs. pellet-feed making; (ii) smaller
initial capital expenditures for beneficiation; and (iii) the fact that sinter
can be self-fluxing or super self-fluxing at no extra cost and give overall
reduction in thermal requirements in the blast furnace.
3.19      The table on the following page shows the strong upward trend in
pellet production among market economies in the 1960s and early 1970B which
increased from 16 million to 133 million tons between 1960 and 1975/76, or by
an average of 14.6% p.a. This compares with an increase in sinter production
from 116 million tons to 310 million tons, or by an average of 6.5% p.a.
during the same period. Thereafter, production of both pellets and sinter
flattened as a result of the downturn in steel demand. The major producers of
pellets have been the U.S. (78 million tons in 1979) followed by Canada (31
million tons) and Australia (9 million tons). Since 1979, 23% (16 million
tpy) of export pellet capacity has been, in fact, shut down. Sinter production
has been concentrated in Europe (127 million tons in 1979), Japan (101 million
tons) and the U.S. (33 million tons).
3.20      For major blast furnace operations which account for about 75% of
steel production (the rest being accounted for by scrap and sponge iron-
based electric steel-making), Carajas ore offers the properties and charac-
teristics which iron-makers have most favored over the past several years
and which are expected to remain in premium demand. The ore is a high-grade
sinter feed containing 66.5% Fe which compares well to average ore grades in
other major iron ore-producing countries, such as Australia (64%), Canada
(62%), Sweden (62%), and the U.S. (61%).  Unlike the U.S. and Canadian ores
which generally require grinding, beneficiation and pelletizing, Carajas
ore requires no concentrating or energy-intensive beneficiation. Carajas
sinter feed thus has distinct cost advantages and will result in lower produc-
tion costs for iron than pellets.
3.21      Demand and Supply/Demand Balance.  As noted previously, demand
projections for iron ore between 1980 and 1990 in market economy countries
have been prepared under two steel growth scenarios that cover the range of
reasonable expectations: a high case and a low case, where steel production

a/   Based on 10.5 years from 1979/80 to 1990.
b/    The projections have not been related to GDP growth assumptions in developed and
developing countries as the Bank is presently revising the official forecast for
the coming 5-10 years. As a rule of thumb, steel demand is about 1.0-1.5 points
lower than GDP growth in the industrial countries, which are the principle con-
sumers of iron ore. Using the above assumption, the low case would thus relate
to a 2.0-2.5% average growth rate in these countries. This must be considered
very reasonable and establishes the low case as a likely demand floor.
c/  CPE nst import requirement from market economies  (para. 3.12),
d/ Actual production.
3.22               This forecast steel growth compares with an actual average annual
growth in steel production of 3.6% for 1960-80 and can be considered con-
servative. Under the high case, steel production is assumed to increase by
1.8% p.a. in industrial countries and by 6.3% in developing countries. Under
the low case, steel production would increase by 1.0% p.a. in industial
countries and by 4.9% p.a. in developing countries. Between 1960 and 1980,
the comparable per annum increases were 3.0% in industrial countries and 8.6%
in developing countries.
3.23               In determining the level of iron ore demand in the market economies
(excluding CPE import requirements), the ratio of iron ore requirements per
ton of crude steel production has been assumed to be 1.15 through 1990. This
ratio is based on 1981 data for market economies and is not expected to
change noticibly. While increased use of higher-grade ores in iron production
and improvements in ore treatment will reduce the iron ore requirement per
unit of crude steel output, this reduction is expected to be offset by: (i)
the increased use of primary iron in basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steel-making
as the scrap market tightens towards the mid-1980s; (ii) the slowdown in



- 17 -
scrap-based electric arc furnace steel-making (which is less iron-intensive
than BOF) in the mid-1980s as energy costs increase and scrap is less avail-
able; and (iii) the increase in developing countries share of steel-making
where the input-output ratio is higher (about 1.27).
3.24       The forecast scenarios establish a range between a market surplus of
about 7 million tons of iron ore and a market deficit of about 30 million
tons in 1986. Since both the potential surplus and deficit represent,
respectively, only 1.2% and 4.6% of expected iron ore demand and additional
discretionary capacity could be added when needed (para. 3.16), expectations
are that the market will be in reasonable balance by that time. The small
degree of risk of oversupply decreases in the next several years, and dis-
appears altogether in the late 1980s. In light of the conservative approach
taken in the above analysis, the market risk appears acceptable. On the other
hand, if the high-case scenario were to apply (or some scenario in between),
the supply deficits could rise quickly if no further iron ore capacity were
to become available in the second half of the 1980s.
3.25       Other recent iron ore forecasts have been made of market balance
in the mid-1980s with similar findings. Estimates of market surpluses and
deficits fall within a normal range of error that would have to be expected in
any such forecasts, as shown below:

has been assumed as 1.20. This is based on data for 1981, and compares
with 1.15 for market economies only (para. 3.23).
3.26       Market risk to Carajas is further minimized by the fact that the
Project will only reach full production in 1988, when market recovery should be
strengthening. CVRD has obtained long-term sales contracts for 24.7 million
tpy of iron ore, which seem to be adequate in assuring sales during its first

two years of production build-up when it is planning to produce 5 million tons
in 1985 and 20 million tons in 1986. 1/
3.27      Carajas ore has proven to be highly marketable (para. 3.45) belonging
to the segment of the iron ore market for sinter fines where demand is expected
to be comparatively stronger in the mid to late-1980s. This is due to the
cost advantages noted earlier (para. 3.18) that can be achieved by using
sinter in the blast furnace rather than pellets. As a result of this economy,
it is expected that as the market recovers and steel capacity utilization in-
creases to effective levels, new steel capacity will favor the BOF in place of
the more energy-intensive electric arc furnace. The expected tightening of
scrap availability (para. 3.23) by the mid-1980s should contribute to this
development, as the BOF uses a smaller amount of scrap than the predominant
type of electric arc furnace which is scrap-based, and in the future is likely
to consume an even greater proportion of primary iron to scrap.
3.28      Future sinter use by industrialized countries has been facilitated
by the development of a new production process by Japan, allowing the
transportation of sinter and thus the construction of sintering facilities
offshore rather than,, traditionally, as an integrated part of a steel plant.
Offshore construction meets the increasing concern with potential sinter plant
pollution in the industrialized countries while allowing steelmakers to have
the cost advantage of using sinter.
3.29      The demand for pellets for blast furnace charges is expected to
decline for cost reasons, while the demand for high-quality lump ores should
remain high for use in direct reduction and blast furnace operations. The
availability of this high-quality ore, however, is limited and is not expectd
to increase its share (about 10%) of the iron ore market.
3.   Iron Ore Prices
3.30      Past Trends.  From the 1950s to the mid-1970s, iron ore prices
declined sharply in real terms as a result of reductions in production costs
associated largely with large mine developments, economies of scale, and
improvements in materials handling and transportation. After a brief recovery
in 1975, iron ore prices continued to decline in real terms to 1979 reflecting
the softening in world iron ore demand. Small real increases in prices in
1979 and 1980 still left real 1980 prices well below the 1970-75 level. The
continuing weakness in steel consumption and the depressed condition of the
iron ore market resulted in a further sharp drop in real prices in 1981. Past
iron ore prices are given in the table below:

3.31      Although small real increases in prices were achieved in 1979 and
1980, current price levels over the past five years have generally been close
to production costs. Profitability has been squeezed in the industry, partic-
ularly among the pellet producers where almost one quarter of the export
pellet plant capacity has been shut down between 1978 and 1981 (para. 3.19).
3.32      Future Outlook.  Despite continuing depressed market conditions,
major real-price increases in 1982 have been achieved.  Agreement was reached
between CVRD and the German steel mills in February 1982 on a 10.3% price
increase (in US$ terms) to be applied during the first quarter of 1982 and a
17.4% increase over 1981 prices to be applied during the remaining three
quarters of 1982. The average annual price increase thus agreed with the
German mills for 1982 is 15.6%. Other European consumers have since concluded
the same pricing arrangements and matched the German price increases to CVRD.
In April 1982, CVRD reached agreement with the Japanese Steel Mills on a 13.6%
price increase to become effective for a full year beginning April 1. Based
on the recent European and Japanese agreements, the average iron ore price in
1982 will be 4.9% higher than that in 1981 in real terms, assuming international
inflation is no higher than the expected 7.8%. 1/
3.33      This significant real-price increase is widely regarded by consumers
and suppliers alike as necessary to prevent major mine closures and to promote
expansions and large-scale new mine developments to ensure the long-term
availability of sufficient ore of good quality at reasonable prices. Also,
it has been the Japanese approach to follow production costs closely and to
offer, over the medium term, sufficient remuneration to iron ore mines to
maintain operations. This policy is unlikely to change.
3.34      Nevertheless, in view of the jump in real prices (which is expected
to become more broadly accepted) and the continuing, although diminishing,
1/   IBRD Commodity Price Forecast Update, December 1981.



- 20 
oversupply of the matrket, during the next few years, further real price
increases through 1985 are forecast to be modest. While it is expected that
iron ore prices will at least keep pace with international inflation as
purchasers recognize the need for ore producers to cover production costs and
earn some profits (para. 3.33), market experts differ as to whether real
prices will also in the next few years increase by a range of up to 2% p.a.
For the financial analysis of the Project in this report, no further price
increases for 1983-85 have been assumed. As the market comes into balance and
continues to strengthen, prices are expected to increase again in real terms
by 1.5% p.a. from 1986 through 1990. In light of the analysis of market
balance in para. 3.21 above which indicates the possibility of a 22 million
ton market deficit by 1986, the price assumptions may be too conservative.
However, for purposes of this report, this approach is considered prudent.
3.35      The additional supply of iron ore on the market from the Carajas
Project, by itself, is not expected to have a significant detrimental effect
on iron ore prices since Carajas will constitute about 7.5% of estimated
world exports of iron ore when operating at its full initial capacity of 35
million tons in the late 1980s and since, as noted above, the overall demand!
supply situation for iron ore in the world at that time is expected to be
roughly in balance. Further, the recognition by ore buyers that the producers
must have fair prices, even in times of oversupply, makes any significant
negative effect on prices unlikely.
C.   Market and Marketing for CVRD Ore
1.   Past Production/Consumption of Brazilian Ore
3.36      In 1981, Brazil became the largest producer of iron ore among
market economy countries. The country is endowed with over 10% (estimated by
Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy at 34.2 billion tons) of world iron ore
reserves, exceeded only by the USSR with 42% and Canada with 14%. About 40%
of Brazil's reserves are located in the southern state of Minas Gerais in the
Quadrilatero Ferrifero. The remainder are located in the Amazon.
3.37      The Minas Gerais deposits were the first to be developed in Brazil
due to locational advantages for both the domestic market and sea terminal
access for export. The two major companies which are exploiting these
deposits have been CVRD and MBR, 1/ each company having built its own sea
terminal at Tubarao and Sepetiba Bay, respectively. In addition, there are
several smaller producers, of which the more important are Ferteco Mineracao,
S.A. (FERTECO) under German consortium ownership; and Samarco Mineracao,
S.A. (SAMARCO) under joint Brazilian/U.S. ownership; and S.A. Mineracao da
Trinidade (SAMITRI), under joint Brazilian/Arbed 2/ ownership. FERTECO and
SAMITRI are captive companies, producing between 4 and 8 million tons per
year. The other smaller producers typically sell their output to CVRD. There

supplied by CVRD.

consumption and export of Brazilian iron ore over the last 20 years.

3.39      Production increases have been sufficient for Brazil both to meet
increasing domestic demand in the 1970s from its own steel industry and
to increase its market share in the expanding international market. CVRD
is the largest producer of iron ore in Brazil and, in 1980, produced 63
million tons or 63% of total domestic production. MBR produced 15.7 million
tons in the same year, which together with CVRD accounted for almost 80% of
total domestic iron ore output.
2.   Future Outlook
3.40      The projected increase in Brazilian iron ore production and the
country's export capacity for this product depends almost entirely on the
production of CVRD and MBR, as shown in the table below:

Both companies are planning sizeable expansions. MBR envisages increasing
iron ore production from 16.0 million tons in 1981 to about 30 million tons
by 1990, based on mine expansions at the Agua Claras and Mutuca mines,
and maintenance of current operation levels at the Pico and Jangeda mines.
3.41      CVRb intends to increase its iron ore production by 43 million tpy,
or from 63 million tons in 1980 to 106 million tons in 1990, 1/ entailing (i)
mine expansions in its southern system necessary to prevent a more accelerated
decline in production levels and (ii) implementation of the Carajas Project.
CVRD's southern mines are becoming depleted of high-grade hematite ore. As a
result, Carajas production will not be a full net addition to CVRD's produc-
tion but be partly offset by a decline in production (6 million tpy) from the
southern system (para. 4.13).
3.42      Outside CVRD and MBR, the only planned major increase comes from
the new 8.5 million tpy CAPANEMA mine which is jointly owned by CVRD and a
Japanese consortium and is about to start operations. The other iron ore
producers (FERTECO, SAMARCO, SAMITRI) are expected to continue operating at
about present levels as captive producers. The pelletizing plants are also
expected to undergo little or no growth due largely to the generally poor
market prospects.

3.43      Including production by iron ore companies and pelletizing companies,
Brazilian iron ore production is expected to increase from 100 million
tons in 1980 to 159 million tons in 1990, or by almost 60%. Between 1980 and
1986, domestic consumption of ore is projected to increase by about 8 million
tpy based on CVRD and MBR contracted domestic sales programs through 1986, and
thereafter on the growth in consumption requirements by the state-owned steel
companies of which some are under construction and are to be completed prior
to 1985 (para. 2.15).
3.44      As a result of expansion plans and forecast domestic consumption,
it is expected that exports will increase by some 51 million tpy 1990. Of
this amount, CVRD is expected to contribute about 22 million tons, MBR about
11 million tons, CAPANEMA about 7 million tons, and other small mines about
13 million tons. 1/  Although CVRD plans for all Carajas ore to be exported, 9
million tons of the 35 million ton production will replace CVRD exports from
its southern mines (para. 3.46). CVRD plans to divert the 9 million tons from
the south to its domestic market which is reasonable based on domestic steel
production plans.
3.   Marketing of Carajas Iron Ore
3.45      The marketability of the Carajas ore as an important long-term
source is best exemplified by the advance contract commitments that CVRD
has been able to obtain from steel-producing countries during a period of
prolonged economic recession and depressed steel conditions in Europe and
elsewhere. CVRD began marketing the Carajas ore in 1980 and has success-
fully signed agreements for 24.7 million tpy as shown in the following table
which lists the sales contracts by steel company buyers and importing
countries.

3.46      The two largest iron ore-importing countries, Japan and F.R. Germany,
account for 65% of the contracted sales volumes, and France, Italy, Belgium-
Luxembourg and Korea for the remainder. As mentioned previously, of the total
amount of Carajas contracted sales (24.7 million tpy), 9.3 million tpy consti-
tute swaps with contracted export sales from CVRD's southern system. Net
additional exports for CVRD under the Carajas sales contracts are therefore
15.4 million tpy. CVRD's planned diversion of the 9.3 million tpy to the
domestic market is discussed earlier in para. 3.44. No further swaps in
future sales contracts for Carajas ore are planned to be made.
3.47      CVRD has sought to minimize market risk by obtaining contracts
from its traditional customers, and by including provisions in the above-
noted contracts to envisage full performance in offtake of ore.  The contract
provisions are (i) an incentive of a 3% reduction in price for full
offtake of contracted volumes by the customer, and (ii) a guarantee for
no less than 80% offtake of contracted volumes in any one year. Iron ore
prices are negotiated on an annual basis, taking into consideration trends in
the market and in production costs. In analyzing the economic and financial
risks to the Project of continuing soft market conditions, sensitivity tests
have been made of reduced offtake based on the contract terms and CVRD expe-
rience (paras. 8.37 and 9.04).
3.48      CVRD is planning to undertake a second-stage marketing effort within
the next two years which would provide sufficient lead time (three to four
years) prior to availability of the incremental ore (10 million tons) in 1987.
CVRD expects to be able to market the balance of Carajas production without
the price incentive provision noted in contracts already signed. In light of
the forecast strengthening of the market, it is reasonable to expect that CVRD
should market the-balance successfully.
IV. THE COMPANY
A.   Ownership
4.01      CVRD was established by decree in June 1942 as a majority state-owned
enterprise and operates according to corporate by-laws to develop mineral
deposits in Brazil and abroad by extraction, beneficiation, industrialization,
transportation, shipping and trade in mineral products. Until 1981, Company
ownership was 77% Government and 23% public. The Government neld all ordinary
voting shares, as well as about one quarter of preference shares in the
Company. 1/ In 1981, as part of a four-year plan to raise new equity for the
Project (para. 7.12), CVRD invited all shareholders to reinvest their dividends.
All CVRD dividends were reinvested, with the exception of a small proportion
of preferred stock held by specialized Government agencies for social agency
and federal savings. This latter proportion was sold to the public, thereby
reducing Government ownership to 73% and increasing private ownership to 27%.
1/   Preference shares have the same rights as ordinary shares, except as
regards voting to elect members of the Board of Administration. They
take priority in receiving a minimum annual dividend of 6%.

B.    Organization and Management
4.02        CVRD operates under the direction of a seven-member Administrative
Council and the management of an eight-member Board of Directors. The
President of CVRD is appointed by the President of the Republic and presides
as Chairman over both the Council and the Board. The remaining members of the
Administrative Council are elected for three-year terms by the General Assembly
from outside the Company. The Council meets once a month, providing overall
guidance and supervision to the Company-s operations. The Administrative
Council is responsible for election of CVRD's directors and for defining their
responsibilities.
4.03        The Board of Directors includes the seven managing directors of CVRD-s
functionally-organized operation. CVRD-s organization chart is shown below:

In November 1981, the number of managing directors was increased from five to
seven and their functions were redefined to meet CVRD's increasing responsi-
bilities. The main changes were the appointments of: (i) a commercial
director in charge of iron ore and non-iron ore sales; (ii) a Vice President
with specific responsibilities for planning, financial control, and information
systems as well as responsibility for the functions of the President in his
absence; (iii) a Strategic Planning Unit responsible for the reporting to the
Administrative Council on long-range policy planning and programming; and (iv)
three new superintendencies for budgeting, planning and studies, and forestry,
respectively.



- 26 -
4.04      The reorganization is timely and important in view of CVRD's growth
in both iron ore and other (para. 4.20) activities and thus the increased need
for strong management and control. The placement of planning and control
functions under the Vice President and the creation of a strategic planning
unit strengthens these functions considerably, and allows the Development
Director who previously had overall planning responsibility to focus more
on Carajas and other potential projects. It further gives formal recogni-
tion to the importance of CVRD's marketing activities which have been carried
out largely through two subsidiary companies--Rio Doce, Europa S.A. and Rio
Doce, America S.A.--located in Brussels and New York City, respectively.
4.05      The management of the Carajas Project is the responsibility of
two directors: the Development Director during the construction period and
the Production Director after start of operations. Following the incorporation
of AMZA into CVRD in 1981, the Superintendencia de Implantacao do Projeto
Carajas (SUCAR) was established to assume AMZA's function. One of the main
duties of the Development Director is to ensure coordination between SUCAR and
the Superintendencia de Pre-Operacao Norte (SUNOR) which will manage the
preoperation phase and constitute the nucleus of the organization that will
operate the Project.   The Production Department has the experience with which
to provide information on operating equipment and requirements and is actively
providing this support to SUCAR through SUNOR.  Other supporting inferfaces
have been established between SUCAR's own planning and control, engineering,
material supplies, civil works and administrative units directly to CVRD
superintendencies with respective functions.
4.06      On September 16, 1981, CVRD's Board of Directors decided on the
creation of a Steering Committee to (i) carry out periodic reviews of the
Carajas Project particularly with respect to implementation, costs and
difficulties encountered or expected; (ii) undertake periodic reviews of
operational targets and time limits established by SUCAR; and (iii) review and
take decisions on major issues regarding the Project. The Committee comprises
CVRD's Directors for Development, Finance and Production, the Superintendents
of SUCAR and SUNOR, and will possibly include one to two consultants experienced
in large-scale project execution. The proper composition and functioning of
this Committee is of critical importance to the Project. It has been agreed,
therefore, that CVRD will maintain the existence of the Steering Committee,
under the chairmanship of the Director-Vice President of CVRD and that the
Committee will meet at least once every three months and prepare minutes of
its meeting. CVRD will furnish minutes to the Bank within 30 days of any
Steering Committee meeting.
C.   Staffing and Training
4.07      CVRD is well managed and competently staffed and operated.  At end
March 1982, CVRD had a total of 20,938 employees, including about 600 trainees
and apprentices. The composition of the staff is as follows:
CVRD-Staffing, 1981

SUCAR has 746 employees, of which 320 are working on site at Carajas and
Sao Luis. Future staffing plans at Carajas are discussed in para. 5.58.
4.08      CVRD currently operates five training centers, located in Rio de
Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Porto Velho, Itabira and Tubarao, in total having
an area of 8,440 square meters. The 1981 training program in these centers
comprised 2,355 classes with 35,176 participants at a cost of about US$7.4
million equivalent. 1/ Curricula for the more than 100 courses are adequate,
and sufficient numbers of trained and qualified instructors are available.
D.   Operations
4.09      The Southern System consists of CVRD's mining operation in the "Iron
Quadrangle" in the State of Minas Gerais, the Vitoria-Minas railway linking
the mines to the port and the port facilities, including CVRD's pelletizing
plants at Tubarao, in the state of Espiritu Santo.
4410      The CVRD operational activities in the Southern System for 1979-80
are summarized in the table below:

4.11      The vast iron ore deposits in Minas Gerais were discovered in 1910,
but actual exploitation did not start until the mid-1940s after the foundation
of CVRD in 1942 (para. 4.01). At that time a railway connecting the Itabira
area with the Atlantic Seaboard was already in place and the initial objective
of the newly-created CVRD was to mine, transport and ship 1.5 million tpy
of iron ore. This goal was reached in 1952 and by 1967 ten million tons were
exported annually through the new deep-water port of Tubarao (outside Vitoria),
construction of which had started in 1962. Between 1967 and 1970, production
was doubled, triggering the construction of a second track, improvements in
railway curve radius and gradients as well as installation of modern signalling
and traffic control systems. These works were completed in 1978 and the
railway's annual capacity is now 100 million tons. In 1973, the construction
1/   US$1.00 = Cr$100.00.

of the first beneficiation plant for low-grade ore (itaberite) concentration
was completed and the second CVRD pelletizing plant at Tubarao started
production to meet the then increasing world demand for pellets.

4.13      The forecast production for these mines as a group is shown in para.
3.40. Due to limited mineable reserves of high-grade hematite, the Caue mine,
with a production capacity prior to 1981 of 38 million tpy will be cut back to
about 23 million tpy by 1987. This action will double the current 10-year
lifetime of the Caue mine. Partial replacement for these reductions in
production will be from Timbopeba which will reach 7.5 million tpy capacity in
1985, and from CVRD purchases of 8.5 million tpy from the Capanema mine
(start-up in 1982), a joint venture 1/ between CVRD (51%) and a Japanese
consortium (49%). 1/ The Capanema mine will have a capacity of about 8.5
million tpy of which 2.1 million tons (25%) will be sold to Siderbras Tubarao
steel-works. In March 1982, CVRD purchased several hematite deposits (Acesita)
lying between Caue and Capanema mines. The deposits are not presently being
mined, but will be used as strategic reserves.
4.14      Since 1973, CVRD has produced about 5 million tpy of pellets in
two of its three pelletizing plants at Tubarao (capacity 2.5 million tpy
each), and has purchased pellets from its jointly-owned pelletizing companies,
HISPANOBRAS, NIBRASCO and ITABRASCO, also at Tubarao (para. 4.21).
4.15      The transport volume on the Vitoria-Minas Railway has increased
rapidly not only because of increases in the handling of iron ore and pellets
but also increased volumes of other goods such as coal, linest:oii artid general
cargo. Other goods now constitute about 15% of total railway transport volume.

4.18       After 1976, when CVRD's net income was a healthy 24.8% of sales,
iron ore prices fell sharply in real terms, decreasing net income to 3.3% of
sales in 1979. CVRD's recovery in 1980 and 1981 to profit margins exceeding
20% was due to (i) a decrease in unit production costs by about one-third in
real terms from 1979-81 brought about by increased operating efficiency and
economies of scale, and (ii) a 35% "maxi-devaluation" of the Cruzeiro against
the US Dollar in December 1979, which was to CVRD-s advantage since its
revenues are largely foreign exchange and its costs local currency.



- 30 -
4.19      Between 1976 and 1981, CVRD invested a total of US$1,920 million:
for Carajas (US$623 million); expansions, replacements and modernization in
the southern mines, railroad and port (US$743 million); and subsidiaries
and associated companies (US$554 million). Throughout the period, the Company
maintained a low debt:equity ratio (which in 1981 was 32:68), using internally
generated funds to cover loan repayments, dividends, and about 45% of all
capital expenditures. CVRD's current ratio, however, has recently declined
from 1.7 in 1976 to 1.1 in 1981. This reflects CVRD's past use of short-term
borrowings and acceptance credits on ore shipments. In 1982, CVRD will reduce
its short-term credit liabilities by about US$162 million, in anticipation of
the availability of the longer-term finance for its major investments over the
next 5-6 years in Carajas. Its current ratio is therefore expected to improve
to 1.6 in 1982, and remain at a sound level thereafter (para. 8.23).
4.20      CVRD has a number of equity investments and holdings in subsidiaries
and associated companies which are shown in Annex 4-4. The investments,
totalling US$804 million, are in iron ore (33%), ocean transport (23%),
bauxite, alumina and aluminum (13%), phosphates and fertilizer (10%), foresta-
tion, lump pulp (9%), and other (12%).
4.21      In 1980, CVRDs major operating subsidiaries and associated companies
generated revenues totalling US$845 million, and profits totalling US$91
million, as shown below.

as the companies (several of which are newly started operations) enter into
full operations and the economy strengthens. The investments required by the
subsidiaries and companies are largely completed and no major cash outlays are
expected of CVRD.
4.23      CVRD accounts are audited annually by the international accounting
firm, Arthur Andersen & Co. Auditing arrangements and procedures are satis-
factory, and no problems are foreseen.

V. THE PROJECT
A.   Proiect Development
5.O1      The Carajas iron ore deposits are located about 550 km south of
Belem in the Greater Carajas region covering an area of about 4,000 square
km (1,560 square miles) at an average altitude of about 650 meters above sea
level. The climate is tropical with the annual temperature averaging 24 C
with small variations. There are two distinct seasons: a rainy season from
October to May and a dry season from June to September. The average annual
rainfall recorded over an 11-year period is 2,236 mm. The vegetation is char-
acterized as continuous equatorial rainforests except on top of the plateaus
where clearings occur, indicating outcropping iron formation.
5.02      Up to the mid-1960s, only sporadic geological surveys had been made
in the Carajas region. Mineral prospecting on a commercial basis began in
1966 triggered by discoveries of manganese deposits.  U.S. Steel, through its
Brazilian subsidiary, Companhia Meridional de Mineracao, initiated a manganese
exploration program and at the outset of this program, the immense iron ore
potential of the region was revealed.
5.03      In October 1966, the Department of National Mineral Production (DNPM)
granted survey rights to Meridional and CVRD, and the two companies entered
into an intensive two-year exploration program (para. 5.07) which during its
peak in 1971 employed 800 persons. In addition to the huge iron deposits, the
program resulted in discovery of deposits of manganese, copper, bauxite,
nickel, tin and gold.
5.04      On April 15, 1970, CVRD and U.S. Steel jointly founded AMZA (50.9%
CVRD, 49.1% U.S. Steel) to determine the feasibility of development and
exploitation of the deposit and to organize and operate the Carajas Project.
The partnership lasted until June 15, 1977, when U.S. Steel, considering thl
larger Project scope, magnitude of investments envisaged and the shift in
target markets from the U.S. to Europe and Japan, withdrew from the Project
allowing CVRD to purchase all its stock. CVRD acquired the AMZA shares held
by Meridional/U.S. Steel at a value equal to the exploration expenditures
incurred by the foreign group plus annual interest, amounting to approximately
US$50 million. On April 6, 1981, AMZA was merged with CVRD to strengthen CVRD
control over the Project.
5.05      The first feasibility study, initiated in May 1972 and done under
the responsibility of AMZA, contemplated an integrated mining project consist-
ing of a mine, beneficiation plant, transport system and a port. Market
analyses and preliminary studies for auxiliary installations and services were
prepared. Various alternatives related to mining plans, transport systems
and port locations were assessed (paras. 5.10, 5.19), particularly the possi-
bilities of transporting the iron ore by slurry pipeline, railroad or river
barge, using the Tocantin River, to the northern seaport of Belem. These
alternatives were rejected due to, inter alia, the lack of water depth at
Belem to permit port expansion for the large transoceanic ships used in the
iron ore trade (Project File). Comprehensive studies completed in May 1974 of
the northern Brazilian coastline proved that Ponta da Madeira in Sao Marcos
Bay, in the vicinity of Sao Luis, capital of the State of Maranhao was the
most favorable location for a deep-water port. AMZA was granted, in May 1976,
the concession to build and operate a railroad between the port site and Serra
dos Carajas.



- 32 -
5.06      Initially, AMZA contemplated an annual production of 20 million
tons, to be increased in stages to 50 million tpy. In view of the huge invest-
ments required for the 50 million tpy project, and as a result of continuous
studies of the iron ore market and its projected trends, CVRD, being the sole
owner of AMZA, directed AMZA in 1978 to undertake new technical and economic
studies to arrive at an optimal production level both economically and finan-
cially. These studies, completed in 1980, indicated an annual production
level of 35 million tons by 1987 with provision for future expansion once the
iron ore market could accept additional quantities. CVRD was assisted in the
final revision of the feasibility study for the Project by International
Engineering Services, S.A. (IESA), a majority Brazilian owned consulting firm,
and in the economic evaluation of the Project by Hill Samuel & Co. Limited
(UK). The project scope was substantially reduced during the final phase of
review, particularly the railroad component where reductions amounted to some
US$400 million.
B.   Project Description
1.   Mine Component
5.07      Ore Reserves.  Most of the iron ore reServes in the Carajas Region
are located in two sectors of the Serra dos Carajas--Serra Norte and Serra
Sul--which are about 35 km apart. These deposits were delineated as part
of the extensive exploration program in 1969 to 1972 (para. 5.03) which com-
prised: (i) 1,000 km of survey lines for detailed geological mapping, (ii)
560 km of geological reconnaissance lines of surrounding areas, (iii) 19,000
sq km of aerial magnetometer survey, (iv) 350 km of ground magnetometer
survey, (v) 15 adits totalling 3,400 m in length, (vi) 277 diamond drill
holes totalling 37,000 m and (vii) about 100,000 chemical tests.
5.08      The result of the program was an estimated 17.8 billion tons of
reserves of high-grade, low-phosphorous iron ore as shown in the table below:

The magnitude of the reserves, the geographical concentration and the high
quality of the ore make the Carajas region one of the most important iron
ore regions in the world.
5e09     The deposits are located on discontinuous ridges and plateaus that
rise abruptly 200-300 m above jungle-covered lowlands. Metasediments asso-
ciated with the iron formation are phyllite, mica schist, quartzite and
sandstones. The iron ore consists of friable, fine-grained hematite with a
granular or platy texture which, in most areas, is covered by a canga capping.
Hard hematite crops out on the crests of hills but also occurs embodied in the
soft friable ore. The main ore minerals are hematite and subordinated goethite.
5.10     Mining will start in the N4E deposit (Diagram 5-1) selected due to
its relatively low overburden ratio, easy access to the railroad and measured
reserves of 1,280 million tons of high-grade ore. The N4E orebody has been
thoroughly explored and sampled and the base data as well as methodology used
to calculate and classify the reserves are satisfactory. The deposit is "J"
shaped in configuration, 4.2 km long with an average width of 300 m and a
maximum depth of 285 m below the surface. The mining sequences and the
ultimate pit plan were accomplished by using CVRDVs own mine planning computer
program which has a proven record in the mines in the Southern System. Three
different ore types are defined, and detailed mine layout provides for suffi-
cient exposed ore to allow an even run-of-mine ore blend to be produced at all
times.

5.11      The mine will be a conventional open pit mine with a favorable
waste-to-ore ratio by weight of 1:2. Waste rock as well as ore will be
mined using a standard shovel/truck mining system employing nine 12 and 16
cu. yd. electrical shovels and twenty-three 154-ton off-the-highway diesel
electric trucks. Benches will be 15 m high and drilling will be done by two
9-7/8" rotary drills (to be transferred from the Southern System). It is
estimated that only 25% of the ore has to be blasted using ammonium nitrate-
based explosives. Secondary blasting and bench improvements will be done by
four airtrack drills. Haul-roads will be 25 m wide, and mine development work
and road maintenance will be performed by a fleet of wheel- and track-dozers,
road graders, wheel-loaders and 35-ton trucks.  In the dry season dusi-sup-
pression on roads and in working areas will be achieved by three 40-m water-
spraying units. Waste rock will be hauled to waste dumps where adequate
environmental measures to prevent pollution (mainly surface water run-offs
into adjacent streams) will be installed. The ore will be transported an
average of 1,000 m from the mining faces to the primary crusher.
5.12      Beneficiation.  Due to its high natural iron content, the ore
requires no actual concentration or treatment other than simple reduction in
size of the run-of-mine ore to sinter feed and natural pellets. A pilot
plant, in half industrial scale, has been in operation at the mine site since
early 1981 and about 350,000 tons of ore have been tested. These tests con-
firmed the original flowsheet which was based on tests of bulk samples in
CVRD's ore processing laboratories in Itabira and Belo Horizonte. In addition,
samples have been sent abroad to laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and the
good metallurgical properties of the products have been confirmed. Beneficia-
tion facilities will consist of three stages of crushing (including primary
crushing) and screening, one stage of rod-milling, a solids recovery stage
with screw classifiers and cyclones and a final dewatering stage of the
products. Tailings will be pumped to two tailings ponds. Due to the rela-
tively high moisture content and other particular characteristics of the
run-of-mine ore, wet screening has to be applied in order to prevent clogging
of the screen decks. Tailing thickeners will allow recirculation of some
process water. Make-up process water will be pumped to the plant from
the tailings ponds where effluents will be treated and spillway water will be
clean. Beneficiated products are to be transported via belt conveyors to
the stockpile area which will have a capacity of 1.6 million tons. Two
8,800-tph stackers will pile separately the sinter feed and the natural
pellets, and two 8,000-tph bucketwheel reclaimers will be used for reclaiming
and subsequent train loading from two 1,600-ton silos located directly over
the double railway track. For adequate quantity and quality control, all main
belt conveyors will be equipped with precision scales and five automatic
sampling stations are incorporated in the flowsheet.
5.13      All supporting facilities such as offices, laboratories, maintenance
workshops and warehouses will be common to the mine and the beneficiation
plants. The general layout of all installations will allow for easy capacity
expansion where and when required. The total electrical power consumption
is estimated to 164,000 MWh/year. There is one Amerindian reserve in the
vicinity of the mining complex. Plans for this and other reserves affected by
the Project are discussed in Section D.2.



- 35 -
5.14      Pre-operation, starting in 1982, entails removal of 5.2 million
tons of overburden (about 15 million tons of ore will then be exposed) consist-
ing mainly of canga which will be stockpiled in a separate area for possible
reclamation in the future. A limited amount of ore will be fed during 1982-83
to the pilot plant for additional beneficiation and equipment testing and
stockpi'le build-up.  Actual mining is scheduled to start in July 1985.
5J15     At this time, all excavation and earthmoving required for the
office/workshop/warehouse area as well as for the primary crusher have been
completed and construction has started. Landclearing for other industrial
areas has also commenced. The Southern tailings pond is almost complete. A
laboratory was completed in May 1981. Temporary workshop and warehouse for
the pre-operation phase have been erected. In September 1981, the total work
force at the mine site and on road improvement was about 4,150 personnel.
2.  Railroad Component
5.16      Fixed Installations.  The new railroad is being built to AAR
standards to carry the ore from the Carajas mine to the port at Ponta da
Madeira (Diagram 5-2). The total track length is 890 km with four stations
and 36 crossing loops, each 2,300 m long. The railroad will be single track
and 1.60-m gauge, and will use heat-treated rails weighing 68 kg/meter, with
1,850 treated wooden ties per km on a 0.30 m bed of crushed stone ballast.
Maximum grade for loaded trains will be 0.4% and for the unloaded trains 1.0%
with the minimum radius of curvature 860 m. A Central Traffic Control system
as well as an Automatic Train Control system will be installed to be operated
in the Sao Luis terminal including train radio control and radio links for
each crossing.

5.17      Route Location.  The principal towns passed by the railroad, or
adjacent thereto are Santa Ines, Imperatriz and Maraba on the Rio Tocantins,
which is served by an airport. From Km 0 (Ponta da Madeira) to Santa Ines
city (Km 200) the topography is low lying with many small rivers, swampy in
parts and with medium forest elsewhere. From Km 200 to Carajas (Km 890) the
route lies through jungle with large and dense timber and little civiliza-
tion. Besides the line, there are only small villages, Santa Cruz (Km 282),
Calis (Km 385), Pequia (Km 514), Cara (Km 634), Maraba on the Rio Tocantins
previously mentioned (Km 737) and Parauapuebas (Km 862). Only about 115 km
between Km 415 and Km 530 can be described as hilly with a maximum height of
324 m above sea level. The only major bridge which will cross the Tocantins
river at Maraba has a total length of about 2.3 km; other medium-sized bridges
(350-200 m long) are required to cross the Mosquitoes channel, Mearim river,
Paraquen river, Pindare river, Socorro river and Vermelho river. As might be
expected in that area, culverts totalling some 77 km in length will be required.
There will be 63 bridges in all along the route.
5.18      Two ballast quarries have been located adjacent tc the railroad
route, the Rosario quarry at Km 38 near Sao Luis and the Parauapuebas quarry
at Km 862 near Carajas. Both quarries have adequate quality and quantity
of stone.
5.19      Operation.  The train type to be operated and their schedules were
determined through extensive computer research of many alternatives. The
standard train will have 160 iron ore wagons with an ore load of 15,680 tons
(19,200 gross tons) hauled by three 3,000 H.P. diesel electric locomotives
with two additional locomotive pushers for the 115-km mountainous section.
The train schedule was developed using Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) and
Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems. Loaded trains are scheduled 21 hours
from Carajas to Sao Luis and empty return trains about 12-1/2 hours. There
will be eight ore trains per day in each direction and up to a maximum of
three service trains daily. Full-cycle turn-around time for each ore train
will be 2.16 days. Maximum speed of a loaded train is 65 km/hr whereas for
empty trains it is 80 km/hr. The line will operate 320 days per year. General
cargo operations are expected to start-up in the late 1980s. Agreement has
been reached with the Government and CVRD that, six months prior to introducing
general cargo and passenger services on the railway, CVRD will prepare a
tariff schedule, satisfactory to the Bank, for such services, which will be
sufficient to cover the costs of providing the services, and put the tariff
schedule into effect (with periodic modification to reflect any cost increases)
when the services are introduced.
5.20      The iron ore wagons will have a capacity of 98 tons and will be
fitted with air-brakes and swivel-type automatic couplings which permit the
cars to be tipped without disconnecting the train. The diesel electric
locomotives will have 3,000 HP, an axle load of 30 tons, and a maximum speed
of 90 km/hr. Details of the Carajas-Sao Luis railway are given in Annex 5-1.
5.21      Project Implementation.  CVRD started the construction works for
the railroad substructure-cuttings, bridges and viaducts, and culverts two
years ago, except for the Tocantins river bridge and the Carajas mine ter-
minal. The 890-km length was divided into 14 sections plus the terminal
at the port, with each section let out as a separate contract to cover all
required works in the section. The works are under the control of the Works
Superintendent at Sao Luis (para. 6.06), with a Brazilian consulting firm
appointed to each section for day-to-day supervision. The work completed to
date, expressed as a percentage of the overall total work required is:

5.22      A separate contract for the Tocantins river bridge was let August 8,
1981, and contracts for the track laying and ballasting are in process of
being let. The organization for management and control of the work on hand
and to be started is discussed in para. 6.06. The total number of contractor
personnel working at the railroad site was nearly 15,000 in late 1981.
5.23      Maintenance.  The Ponta da Madeira (Sao Luis) terminal will be the
main yard of the railroad and includes, inter alia, the following installa-
tions:
(a) Centralized maintenance workshop for all equipment,
rolling stock, motive power and fueling plant;
(b) Wooden ties treatment plant;
(c) Rail welding plant; and
(d) Warehouse for all necessary spares for the line.
A supplemental, medium-sized maintenance workshop will also be available at
Maraba station yard with fuel and oil shops.   Total personnel will be 763.
5.24      The track maintenance will be mechanized to the extent possible
and will be undertaken by four teams placed along the line at:
(a) Sao Luis--covering Km 0 - Km 212;
(b) Santa Ines--covering Km 212 - Km 450;
(c) Pequia--covering Km 450 - Km 650; and
(d) Maraba--covering Km 650 - Km 890.
Total personnel will be 728.
3.   Port Component
5.25      The new port is located in sheltered water, some 10 km southeast
of the city of Sao Luis in Sao Marcos bay (Diagram 5-3). It is about 1.5 km
North of the existing port of Itaqui. A natural and stable 88-km seaward
approach channel, 1.6 km wide, will permit simultaneous two-way traffic for
ships, up to 280,000 dwt. Adequate water depth is available at Low Water
Ordinary Spring Tides (LWOST). The tidal range is 7 m on spring tides and 5 m
on neap tides, resulting in both ebb and flood tide currents approaching a

speed of 5 knots, which are excessive for safe ship handling. Rock groins are
therefore under construction to the north and south of the berth, on alignments
determined in a hydraulic model; these will reduce the currents to an acceptable
maximum of three knots alongside the berth. The approach channel is adequately
demarcated for navigation.
5.26      Berth Construction.  Within the area enclosed by the groins and
on a north/south line, about 300 m offshore, four breasting dolphins will be
constructed where the ships will berth, with three mooring dolphins to the
north and three to the south. Depth of water alongside will be 23 m (LWOST).
The remaining maritime structures will be (i) a concrete runway platform, for
the shiploader arm support; (ii) the shiploader pivot block to the north of
the centre line behind the runway platform; (iii) connecting walkways between
dolphins and runway, and a service platform; (iv) an approach bridge for the
main feed conveyor to the shiploader; and (v) a tug berth, behind the northern
set of the mooring dolphins. All the marine structures will be reinforced
concrete construction, supported on tubular steel and reinforced concrete
composite piles. These are anchored into the underlying solid rock, through a
3-4 m layer of disintegrated/weak surface rock. Some 300 vertical and raker
piles are to be placed for all the maritime structures, of which about 200 are
1.30 m in diameter and the balance 0.80 m diameter.
5.27      The ship loader has a capacity of 16,000 tph.  It is of the linear
type, pivoting about the rear pivot block, with a telescopic loading arm which
travels on a rail mounted support along the concrete runway platform. Average
loading rate will be 10,650 tph.
5.28      Back-up facilities.  Included in the port complex are (i) the
railroad car dumpers which are located on the loop line from the Sao Luis
railroad terminal; as these can unload 8,000 tph, two dumpers are required
for a throughput of 35 million tpy; and (ii) the stockyard which has three
reserve ore stacks holding 3.3 million tons in total; two 8,500-tph stackers
place ore in the stacks from the car dumper conveyors and two 8,000-tph bucket
wheel reclaimers take ore from stack to the feed out conveyors, whence,
through appropriate transfer towers, it is fed to the main feed-out conveyor
to the ship loader. Ore can also be fed direct from the car dumpers to the
feed-out conveyor. Ancillary facilities include maintenance, and administra-
tion buildings, utilities, and an operations centre.
5.29      Port Capacity.  The complete system will enable 35 million tpy to be
received from the railroad wagons and loaded into ships of varying size, the
largest expected to be 280,000 dwt. The limiting factor on the port capacity
will be the number of ships which can be handled per annum at the single
berth. For 35 million tpy capacity, the berth occupancy will average 64%,
which is satisfactory.
5.30      Contracts for construction of the main berth, the groins, storage
yard and earthworks, and the shiploader have been let, and clearance and
diversionary works necessary for the site are practically completed. In
September 1981, 845 contractor personnel were working on site.

C.   Infrastructure
1.   Carajas Town Development
5.31      The Carajas townsite is on a plateau at an altitude of 640 m and
about 12 km from the mines. Located on the prevailing windward side away from
the mining operations, the site is free of dust and stack effluents yet close
enough for a convenient "journey to work." The townsite is on the road to
Maraba 170 km away, which is the largest municipality (70,000 urban popula-
tion) in the Greater Carajas region. The new town will occupy 255 out
of the total 508 ha that are suitable for town construction in the future.
5.32      By 1988 when the initial production level of 35 million tpy is
reached, the number of basic workers at Carajas will total an estimated 2,044
(2,033 in mining and 11 in railway operations). CVRD's initial estimates of
service workers have been low for a new town which is expecte1 to become a
separate municipality self sufficient in services by the end of the 1980s,
and CVRD has revised the estimates upwards. Based on an estimated requirement
of 0.7 service workers per basic worker which is consistent with the experience
of single-industry, free-standing towns in the Americas and Southeast Asia,
the Carajas town is likely to require about 1,430 service workers, or four
times the number for which CVRD had initially planned.
5.33      CVRD is presently revising its housing plans accordingly.  While
initially the Company planned on a requirement for 1,706 dwellings, the
number has increased to 2,720 on the following basis. The housing require-
ments for the service workers are based on an average 1.3 workers per house-
hold, and for basic workers an average 1.2 persons per household. The average
household size for service workers is 5.5 persons and for basic workers 5.0
persons.
5.34      Of the additional 1,014 dwellings which will be included in CVRD's
plans to house additional service workers and their families, 930 will be in
serviced lots, of which two-thirds should be of a minimum dimension (180 m )
to permit the construction of an economical "core" unit for the lower-income
service workers. All land required by the Project for urbanization has been
acquired. No additional land will be required to be purchased for the addi-
tional dwellings at Carajas town since the lot sizes would allow for increased
densities to be achieved within existing urban boundaries. CVRD has agreed to
reserve the additional lots for service workers, and since the additional
dwellings will be privately owned--rather than owned by CVRD--to make arrange-
ments with Banco Nacional de Habitacao (BNH), or other financial agencies
acceptable to the Bank, for financing the construction or purchase of the
houses, to enable the permanent settlement of the additional service workers
in the townsite over a period of about five years from Project Completion
(para. 7.23). The cost increase to CVRD is estimated to be marginal, consist-
ing mainly of additional house connections to utilities (Annex 5-2). CVRD
will include these additional costs in the project cost estimates (para.
7.01). In view of the importance of the revisions being made in the Carajas
town planning, CVRD has agreed that the final designs of the town plan and
site plans for all housing at Carajas be furnished to the Bank for review and
approval by no later than September 30, 1982.
5.35      In planning and designing the town, CVRD-s past experience with
Itabira township in the South has been well considered and local environment
and climatological factors taken adequately into account. A description



- 41 -
of the town, which will be fully self-contained in terms of community services
and facilities, is given in Annex 5-1. The grid network of roads and vehicular
circulation plans are generally satisfactory although CVRD is making modifica-
tions to restrict "through" traffic on tertiary streets. These and other such
modifications will be reviewed and approved by the Bank as part of its
review of the overall town plan (para. 5.34).
5.36      The Carajas town will continue to grow after 1988, particularly in
the service sector. It is important therefore that CVRD begin to develop
plans for the second-phase development of the town so that the later town
expansion can be controlled. CVRD has agreed to provide to the Bank for
review and approval an urban development plan for the second-phase development
(1988-2000) of the Carajas town no later than June 1, 1985.
2.   Other Town Developments
5.37      The Project will create employment for maintenance of the railway
distributed at eight locations along the 890 km of track. The first settlement
will be Parauapebas on the Parauapebas river, 27 km from the new town. The
municipal authorities of Maraba will be responsible for the management and
operation of the town. CVRD is preparing an appropriate urban development
plan that will be of lower specification than that for Carajas town. Under
the plan, accommodations will be provided for 98 railway maintenance staff
and service workers; and serviced lots will be provided to accommodate the
numerous persons that are likely to be drawn to the area seeking work in the
region, or working in other mining activities close by.
5.38      CVRD initially planned for a population of 5,000 at Parauapebas by
1988 but, in view of the numbers of outsiders likely to be attracted to the
area, is revising its plans for the accommodation of 10,000 by 1988. An
adjacent area could be used to accommodate further growth of the town (to
20,000 by the year 2000) if necessary. CVRD has agreed to furnish the com-
pleted plans to the Bank for review and approval no later than September 30,
1982.
5.39      The remaining seven locations where about 280 housing units and
community facilities to complement the existing local installations will be
provided for key railway operation personnel are listed below.

5.40      Sao Luis, at the port end of the railway and with an urban population
of 248,000, has a well-developed infrastructure that can absorb the additional
population from the new port and railway operations. Except for two residences
for senior management, no staff housing will be provided in Sao Luis. At the
port/terminal area, 21 housing units will be provided for key personnel. A
land-use and zoning plan for the area around the port/terminal should be
prepared in collaboration with the state and municipal authorities to ensure,
inter alia, that the area does not develop into a small company town and that
existing squatter groups near the port are resettled in a new location and
other squatter developments along the access highway to the port controlled.
CVRD has agreed to prepare jointly with the Government and appropriate state
and municipal authorities such a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, by December 31,
1982, and no later than June 30, 1983, to enter into an agreement with appro-
priate state and municipal authorities to carry out the plan according to
an implementation schedule satisfactory to the Bank.
3.   Urban Environmental Measures
5.41      CVRD's environmental management program for the Project is discussed
in paras. 5.48-5.57 below and detailed in Annex 5-3. In relation to this
program CVRD would be asked to provide to the Bank, following review by its
own environmental advisory group (GEAMAM, para. 5.50), (i) a planting scheme
for the protection of the forest edge cleared for the Carajas town, airport
and access highway, and (ii) the final grading plan for the reformed contours
and replanting programs for the first site where the strip mining will be
completed. CVRD intends to make use of ERTS satellite remote scanning to
measure periodically the impact of the mining and urban activities on the
natural environment with an overview of the region. At this macro level the
planned buffer zone surrounding the mining and urban areas and the reformed
finished contours of the mining sites (after extraction) should be reviewed by
GEAMAM, CVRD and the Bank every three to six months during Project construction.
4.   Other Infrastructure
5.42      Electric Power.  The Serra dos Carajas is surrounded by two major
river basins, the Tocantins/Araguaia basin and the Xingu basin, with a combined
hydroelectrical potential of about 16,000 MW 1/ firm energy. Eletronorte is
now implementing the Tucurui hydroelectric power plant in the Tocantins River.
Planned final installed capacity is about 8,000 MW. The first unit of 330 MW
will start up in 1983, and by 1985 installed capacity is planned to be 2,310
MW. The power plant will supply power to: (i) the Albras/Alunorte aluminium/
alumina complex currently under construction, (ii) the Belem area, (iii) parts
of the North-Northeast regions, and (iv) the Carajas iron ore project. The
Tucurui/Electronorte transmission system will be integrated In 1982 with the
CHESF system 2/ through a 1,856-km transmission line.
5.43      The Carajas Mine substation (2 X 90 MVA) will be connected through
a 180-km, 230-kV transmission line with the Eletronorte/CHESF substation
in Maraba. Land clearing and construction of this line has started. The line
is currently considiered part of the Project but will be sold to Eletronorte
upon completion of line construction. A 230-kV line will be built more or less
1/   Estimate by Eletrobras.

along the railway from Maraba to Sao Luis to supply communities along the
railway as well as Sao Luis and the port substation (2 X 33 MVA). The Govern-
ment has agreed to ensure that CVRD is provided with such permanent supply
of electric power as required for the efficient operation of the Project.
5.44      Water Supply. The South Tailings dam (which was completed in early
1982) will provide for all water requirements during construction, and initial
industrial requirements, as well as potable water, up to 1990. Thereafter,
industrial supply will be provided from the Northern Tailings pond. Future
potable water supply is expected to come from the Gelado Creek; however,
future study is required to confirm this. Ample water supply will not
constitute a problem in the mining area.
5.45      Water requirements for the port area (ore terminal, railroad yard,
rescreening plant, industrial buildings, ships) will be met by drilling seven
deep wells in the terminal area.
5.46      Roads/Airport.  The 170-km road between the Carajas townsite and
Maraba, where it interconnects with the Transamazonian Highway, is being
upgraded to a 7-m wide paved road. Along this road, about 10 km from the
Carajas townsite, a new airport has been completed. The runway measures 2,000
m by 45 m, and the airport can accommodate Boeing 727 aircraft for non-instru-
ment as well as instrument landings. The minesite will be connected to the
townsite via a 12-km paved access road running along the mountain ridges.
The existing roads to the Itaqui commercial port were relocated in 1980-82 to
make room for the railway yard and stockpile area.
5.47      Fuel Supply.  Fuel (diesel oil and gasoline mainly) is being brought
in by PETROBRAS in coastal tankers to the Itaqui port, in the vicinity of
which, PETROBRAS operates a major storage terminal. Seventy-cubic meter
railway tank cars will load at the terminal for distribution to tank farms
located in the port area, at shunting yards along the railway and at the
Carajas minesite. Tank storage capacity will be sufficient at the mine and at
railway yards for 20 days consumption and at the port for 10 days' consumption.
D.   Ecological Aspects
1.   Environmental Management
5.48      In 1972, CVRD assigned responsibility for the environmental manage-
ment of the Carajas Project to its Buildings and Projects Department (DEPEK)
within SUCAR (para. 4.05). Since then, DEPEK has commissioned over a dozen
environmentally-related studies completed over 1973-81, forming the basis for
environmental planning of the Project. A list of these studies is given in
the Project File.
5.49      In January 1981, CVRD created an independent environmental advisory
group--Grupo de Estudos e Assessoramento de Meio Ambiente (GEAMAM)--to
advise on all environmental aspects of the Company, and particularly to
oversee activities at Carajas. The Group is composed of nine senior scien-
tists/Amazon experts and chaired by an executive secretary who is technical
advisor to the President of CVRD. The Group, together with DEPEK, has prepared
an environmental management manual (Project File), containing guidelines
covering all aspects of contractors activities. In August 1981, GEAMAM met at
the Carajas mine-rail-port sites to inspect the Project, review the guidelines
with relevant personnel, and recommend appropriate environmental actions.



- 44 -
Since GEAMAM's role is extremely important in ensuring that environmental
precautionary measures are taken, the Group should be continued on a systematic
basis. CVRD has agreed, therefore, to maintain GEAMAM with staff, functions
and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank, and to cause GEAMAM to carry
out site inspections at least twice every year through 1985, and at least
once annually thereafter. Following each site visit, a report would be
prepared by GEAMAM and furnished by CVRD to the Bank for review, with comments
by CVRD on each recommendation and a description of any action to be taken as
a consequence of GEAMAM's recommendations.
5.50      In June 1981, CVRD established a permanent on-site Internal Environ-
mental Commission (CIMA) at the Carajas mine, composed of CVRD employees and
contractors, to monitor and control project operations with respect to Govern-
ment and CVRD environmental guidelines. A full-time environmental coordinator
for the Project and full-time environmental officer to the mine CIMA have been
appointed. A second CIMA is being established at the port site with responsi-
bility for monitoring port operations relating to the environment, and appoint-
ment of its environmental officer is expected by mid-1982. Located at both
ends of the Carajas railway, these CIMAs will have joint responsibility for
monitoring the railway component. The existing and planned environmental
staff and organizational arrangements are soundly based and vital to environ-
mental control of the Project. CVRD has agreed to maintain the organizational
arrangements and staffing presently in place or proposed to be established for
environmental control activities, with staff and functions satisfactory to the
Bank.
5.51      DEPEK and GEAMAM have been working closely with the Government's
environmentally-related agencies (SEMA, IBDF, IPHAN, SUDAM) 1/ to obtain
a technical and ecological evaluation of the Project and assistance in biotic
inventory, conservation and other environmental necessities. An envirormental
program of activities is being outlined with the respective government agencies.
The status of work has been detailed in a progress report CVRD furnished to
the Bank in January 1982 initiating routine reporting on environmental
activities to the Bank. 2/ CVRD has agreed to complete preparation with the
Government environmental agencies of its environmental work program for Bank
review and approval by not later than September 30, 1982, and to carry out the
work program, jointly or with the assistance of the environmental agencies, in
a manner and according to a timetable satisfactory to the Bank. Annex 5-3
contains a summary of CVRD's environmental management program organization and
activities.
5.52      CVRD is making direct use of its environmental experience from the
construction of Tubarao port, Itabira mines and 550 km of connecting railroad
in the south in planning pollution control for the Project.  In general,
pollution problems are expected to be less severe in the nort:h than south for
several reasons, among them: (i) Carajas ore is sinter feed, arnd less dusty

will be more humid (shipped wetter) than Itabira products; and (iii) the
prevailing winds at Sao Luis are from port to sea unlike Tubarao where winds
blow from the ore port towards the city. With respect to marine pollution,
especially with regard to flushing of oil holds by cargo ships, CVRD is
undertaking a three-year port study including a baseline marine study to
determine the optimum pollution prevention system. Due to the importance of
this and other pollution studies CVRD is planning, CVRD has agreed to prepare
not later than December 31, 1982, and thereafter carry out, according to a
timetable satisfactory to the Bank, a pollution control program satisfactory
to the Bank, and to exchange views with the Bank on the adequacy and progress
of all environmental, ecological and pollution control actions undertaken by
CVRD with regard to the execution and operation of the Project.
2.   Amerindian Protection
5.53      An estimated 4,535 Amerindians live in the area of influence of the
Carajas Project, i.e., in a radius of about 100 km from the mine and railway.
FUNAI, the government agency charged since 1967 with the implementation of
Amerindian policies and regulation of all contacts with Amerindians, maintains
14 reserves and associated Indian Posts within the area, with a total of 37
villages. FUNAI's second, sixth and seventh Regi6nal Delegacia, respectively,
are responsible for the Indian posts in the Carajas area. With the exception
of one group (the Guaja Indians), all Amerindian groups are in permanent or
intermittent contact with the surrounding society, and some are in advanced
stages of acculturation.
5.54      Four reserves are most immediately affected by the Project:  the
Xikrin-Kayapo (247 in population), in the vicinity of the mining complex;
and the Mae Maria (162 population), Caru (118 population) and Pindare (316
population) reserves in the vicinity of the railway. In addition, about 40-50
Guaja Indians live in the vicinity of the Carajas railway close to and within
the Caru reserve. There is no resettlement of Amerindians required as a
result of the Project.
5.55      In anticipation of an accelerated economic development as a con-
sequence of the Carajas Project, FUNAI has proposed a Carajas Amerindian
Sub-project to upgrade its services to the Carajas area. It is the Sub-
project's objective to minimize potential adverse impacts by undertaking
preventive measures and by creating more viable conditions within the Amerindian
reserves. The Sub-project which is shown in Annex 5-4, stresses measures to:
(i) protect Amerindian lands; (ii) provide health care; (iii) provide overall
FUNAI assistance in staff, communications, and transport at the Indian Posts;
(iv) provide technical assistance and the funding for economic development
projects, and (v) provide education. It further proposes measures to strengthen
the outreach operations of FUNAI-s second Regional Delegacia-s "Ajudancia" in
Maraba/Para and of its sixth Regional Delegacia in Sao Luis/Maranhao. In its
first year, the Sub-project will concentrate in particular on the four reserves
which are already being affected by the Carajas mining and railroad construction
works--Catete, Mae Maria, Caru and Pindare.
5.56      The Carajas Amerindian Sub-project--at a total cost over 1982-86 of
US$13.6 million--will be incremental to FUNAI's regular current budget and
will be financed by CVRD. CVRD and FUNAI have signed a "convenio' satisfactory
to the Bank, regarding the funding and execution of the Sub-project. In
addition to provisions under the Sub-project, FUNAI will also carry out any
further special measures necessary to provide protection and assistance in



- 46 -
compliance with the Indian Statute, and in particular with respect to the
protection of Amerindian lands. Inter alia, such measures will comprise
(i) the eviction of squatters and illegal trespassers from Indian lands;
(ii) safeguards against trespass, i.e., field-level demarcations, clear
marking of reserve borders and regular surveillance; (iii) the redefinition,
decree and demarcation of the lands of the Guaja and Parakana Indians; (iv)
the settlement of cases of contested reserve borders and pending lawsuits;
and (v) the register of all reserves with the Servico do Patrimonio da Uniao
(SPU).
5.57      CVRD has agreed to take all necessary action to assist FUNAI to
carry out the Carajas Amerindian Sub-project. The Bank has received assurances
with regard to the Government and CVRD's intention to enable Bank staff to
have reasonable access (accompanied at all times by FUNAI personnel) to the
indigenous Amerindian population in the Carajas Project Area and to any
information which the Bank may reasonably require with regard to the execution
of the Sub-project and to any further measures being taken for the protection
of the interests of such population. Agreement has been reached with the
Government to put into effect in a timely manner the actions included in the
Sub-project and to take all further measures necessary for protecting the
interests of the Amerindian population in the Carajas Project area. The
Government has ensured that FUNAI will furnish to the Bank periodic reports on
the status of the Amerindian population living in the Carajas Project area,
and that the Bank will have the opportunity to comment on FUNAI's program for
the Amerindian population in the Project area annually.
E.   Employment and Training
1.   Direct Employment
5.58      The total labor force requirement of the Project for different
production levels (15, 25 and 35 million tpy) is shown in table below:
Carajas Project: Labor Force Requirements
15            25               35

Total                                   3,743          4,607            5,567
CVRD will transfer to the Project, from its southern operations, a maximum
of 15% of the required labor force, or about 835 persons. Those trans-
ferred will be predominantly in the categories of skilled levels and above,
constituting about one fourth of these levels. The balance will mainly be
recruited from the states of Para and Maranhao. The proposed recruitment and
training programs are considered sufficient to prepare new employees to ensure
a smooth start-up of the operation and to be able to reach 35 million tpy
during the third year of operation. In addition, the transferred personnel
will be given refresher courses as required. The proposed training program,
outlined below, should be considered a maximum effort and, depending on the
level of education and past training of transferred and recruited personnel,
could possibly be reduced.



- 47 -
2.   Training Program
5.59      The proposed training program is based on CVRD's vast training expe-
rience. The program will mainly focus on: (i) basic training; (ii) improvement
courses (repetition and updating of existing skills); (iii) specialization
courses (deepening of existing skills); and (iv) special training with the
following breakdowns:
Carajas Project: Training Program
Category                 No. of Man-Courses
Basic training                1,655
Improvement                   4,428
Specialization                1,584
Special training                302
Total                    7,969
5.60      It is estimated that about 4,500 employees will participate in these
courses. In addition, apprenticeship will be provided for about 740 students
(from technical high schools, technical colleges and SENAI 1/ programs), and
about 670 scholarships will be awarded to students in the SENAI programs.
On-the-job training will be conducted during the construction phase in parallel
with classroom training whenever possible. In particular, the future benefic-
iation plant operators and maintenance personnel will be trained in the
existing pilot plant, the mining equipment operators and maintenance personnel
will be trained in the pre-production operation (ore to pilot plant and
stripping of overburden) and finally railway personnel will be able to train
during the handling/transport of construction material along the constructed
parts of the railway. In view of CVRD's training experience noted earlier in
Chapter IV, it is well suited to carry out the Project-s training program.
5.61      In addition to the five existing training centers (para. 4.08)
which will be partly used by the Project, two new centers--one in Carajas and
one in Sao Luis--will be established. An agreement was signed with SENAI in
October 1981 which outlines the support SENAI will give the Project. Maximum
use will be made of existing SENAI units in Belem, Maraba and Sao Luis, and
curricula, if not available, will be developed in cooperation with CVRD
specifically to meet the Project's demand. A new SENAI unit will also be
established in Carajas, according to the agreement, and CVRD will provide 50%
of the funds required. A preliminary study and assessment of technical and
professional educational institutions in the Maranhao and Para states will be
followed by a more detailed review. In all, the two states have about 4,300
students in technical schools, of which about 345 study mining and about 260
metallurgy.
5.62      The proposed training program (para. 5.59) is estimated to cost
US$25.2 million equivalent (all local costs), with the following break-down:
1/   SENAI is the National Service for Industrial Training with training
units in Belem, Maraba and Sao Luis.

VI.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Management and Organization
6.01               Project management will be carried out by CVRD assisted by manage-
ment contractors and technical specialists. The proposed management arrange-
ments are based on a three-month study (Project File) carried out for CVRD
in May 1981 by International Engineering, S.A., a Brazilian majority-owned
firm, and a subsequent detailed review by the Bank, and are considered to be
satisfactory. A project management organization chart is shown below.

6.02      Project Management.  The project management group is comprised of
CVRD personnel who staff all of the general management units of SUCAR (the
project superintendency, para. 4.05). The Project Director is supported by
individual managers for: (i) general engineering; (ii) planning and control;
(iii) construction engineering and contracts; (iv) general procurement; and
(v) administration, and by Construction Superintendents for two Construction
Offices located in Sao Luis and Serra Norte responsible for port and railroad
components, and mine and township components, respectively.
6.03      CVRD has approved a total of 746 positions for SUCAR which are
fully staffed and mobilized, including 131 persons in the Serra Norte Office
and 189 in the Sao Luis Office. At peak of construction activities, CVRD
envisages that the number of supervisory personnel and that of managerial
assistance by consultants and contractors will total 1,704. Over 60% of
persons in the top two levels of SUCAR management have worked together over
the last ten years on two previous and successfully-implemented projects
(Valefertil fertilizer and CENIBRA pulp and paper projects), giving past
personal contact and experience to the project team.
6.04      The SUCAR team has been managing the initial project works for a
period of about 2 years and has established appropriate lines of interface
with CVRD operations in the Southern System and with other CVRD superinten-
dencies (para. 4.05) in its control of Project work. Review of their reporting
and control systems indicates that detailed information of Project progress
and cost changes is being collected accurately and transmitted to headquarters
expeditiously. Monthly reports are being prepared and used to guide adjust-
ments in operations. The need for improved management reporting to highlight
any problem areas was discussed with CVRD and an understanding reached that
this should be one of the areas required for technical assistance to be
supplied under the Project (para. 6.07). Management planning and control will
also be strengthened through the work of the Steering Committee (para. 4.06).
6.05      Management Contracts.  CVRD has arranged for six large management
contracts--five to provide on-site management and supervision services in
the major construction areas, and one to provide general support in procure-
ment. 1/ CVRD received proposals from 26 Brazilian firms, and has awarded
contracts to six qualified and experienced firms. The management contracts
proposed by the firms were reviewed in the field prior to award and are
satisfactory to the Bank. These contracts are the following:
1/   Prior to this arrangement, the Project Director had obtained the services
of 19 local consulting firms, primarily to supervise construction of the
railroad infrastructure. These firms will be phased out when the works
for which they are responsible are completed.

Engineering S.A.
a!   Technical support only has been provided in the management plan to
the railway infrastructure (embankment construction) since it is
over two-thirds complete and under the supervision of a number of
local consulting firms.
6.06      The first three contracts above will be under the control of the
Superintendent of the Sao Luis Office; the fourth and fifth, the Superintendent
of the Serra Norte Office; and the sixth, the Manager of General Procurement in
Rio de Janeiro. More details of these management contracts are given in the
Project File. The interfaces between management contractors, superintendencies
and headquarters are illustrated in Annex 6 for the port component and the
interfacing of management contractors for the other components will be
similar. These management arrangements will materially assist in ensuring
timely completion of the works.
6.07      Technical Assistance.  In order to strengthen certain critical areas
of CVRD's Management team, CVRD and the Bank have reached an understanding on
the appointment of 16 technical specialist consultants to be recruited locally
and internationally. The assistance would comprise:
(a) 4 specialists in the Project Director's office--one each for the
mine, railway, port and townsite works to assist and counsel the
Project Director in his management, technical and procurement effort
for the implementation of that section of the Project. The special-
ists will be experienced Senior staff of consulting firms;
(b) 4 specialists in CVRD's Rio de Janeiro Headquarters--to assist the
departments concerned in procurement issues, contract letting and
administration, work planning and cost control;
(c) 4 specialists in the Sao Luis Construction Office--to assist the
Superintendent of Works, respectively, in the fields of port cons-
truction, railway infrastructure (road bed preparation), railway
superstructure (track laying), and planning and cost control, with
special attention to construction planning and methods, evaluation
of unforeseen deviations and the preparation of alternative plans,
methods and schedules to overcome any problems; and
(d) and 4 specialists in the Serra Norte Construction Office--with
similar duties to those in the Sao Luis Office, to assist the Works
Superintendent in mine and townsite construction, operation, plan-
ning and cost control, and security.



- 51 -
6.08      The Bank has reviewed and approved terms of reference for the
consultants. Two consultants--a port specialist from SOROS Associates (U.S.A.)
and a railroad specialist from CANAC (Canada)-have been hired by CVRD and are
well qualified and satisfactory to the Bank. Plans for employment of the
remaining consultants and respective timetables have been confirmed with CVRD,
and agreement reached that they be employed according to Bank guidelines. It
is envisaged that the Bank loan will finance 480 man-months of technical
assistance required at an average cost of US$16,000 per man-month, including
subsistence and travel. The type of assistance required can only be provided
by top-quality persons who have major experience with large-scale construction
projects. The cost of obtaining such services is relatively high; but CVRD
and the Bank consider that, in terms of related benefits in Project cost
savings, the expenditure is justified.
B.   Implementation Schedule
6.09      CVRD's Planning and Cost Control Department, reporting to the SUCAR
Project Director in Rio de Janeiro, has prepared fully-detailed "critical
path" diagrams for each of the mine, railroad, port and townsites components
of the Project. The diagrams cover all activities which are required to
complete the 15, 25 and 35 million tpy production/export phases of the Project
by June 30, 1985; December 31, 1985; and September 30, 1986, respectively.
6.10      The diagrams indicate the dates required to place the major equip-
ment supply and civil works contracts, as well as the equipment erection
commencement dates and testing periods. The interrelationship of the different
events is clearly established, and the necessity to complete a particular item
to enable others to commence is demonstrated. The available "float", or
excess time, available between the earliest possible completion date and the
latest acceptable completion date for particular activities is also estab-
lished. The diagrams have been carefully and thoroughly prepared and are in
all respects satisfactory. The critical activities, achievement of which is
essential for meeting the date for completion of each phase, as noted above,
are clearly defined.
6.11      Based upon the detailed diagrams, Chart 6-2 has been prepared which
indicates the implementation schedule for mine, railway and port construction.
Chart 6-3 indicates the critical path for commencement and completion of major
activities required for each of the 15, 25, and 35 million tpy production
levels.
6.12      The Bank is satisfied that, based upon the planning and preparation
for the Project and the compilation of the procurement schedule based thereon,
the assumed completion dates are realistic.

VII.  CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   CilCost
7.01      As summarized below, the total financing required for the Carajas
Iron Ore Project is estimated at US$4,527 million, of which US$1,490 million,
or 33% is in foreign exchange. Including allowances for physical contingen-
cies, US$680 million (19.5%) will be needed for the mine, US$1,872 million
(53%) for the railroad, US$251 million (7%) for the port, US$206 million (6%)
for the townsites in Carajas and Maraba, US$481 million (14%) for project
management, inspection services, engineering, and insurance, and US$14 million
(0.5%) for the Amerindian program, or a total of US$3.50 billion. Capital
expenditures made through 1981 were US$624 million, representing 20% of total
base cost. Expenditures in 1981 were US$354 million, and in 1978-80 were
US$270 million. A breakdown of the capital cost estimates by year from
1978-88 is given in Annex 7-1.
7.02      The capital cost estimates were prepared by CVRD with assistance
from International Engineering, S.A. that also provided project management
assistance (para. 6.01). The original estimate as of February 1981 was
updated by CVRD in detail during January and February 1982 and is expressed in
end-1981 terms. An extensive review, including: (i) recalculation of unit
costs for civil works; (ii) update of labor, fuel and construction material
costs; (iii) update of construction equipment operating costs; and (iv) review
of domestic transportation as well as sea freight costs, was carried out,
taking into account the experience available from the various construction
sites that were in operation during 1981.
7.03      The Project will be exempt from all import and customs duties during
construction, as provided for in Declaration No. 01/81 of August 4, 1981, by
the Executive Secretariat of the Grande Carajas Program.
7.04      Physical contingency allowances average 12.5% of total base cost for
1982-88: 12% for the mine, 13% for the railroad (including US$18.4 million
for 8 additional railway sidings above the 36 presently foreseen), 12% for the
port, 18% for the townsites and 10% for engineering, pre-operational expenses,
training and project management. Price escalation was calculated on the base
cost plus physical contingency estimates as follows:
Price Contingencies
(%)
Year             Local       Foreign
1982              80           8.0
1983              60           8.0
1984              50           7.5
1985              40           7.0
1986              40           6.0
1987              40           6.0
These local and foreign rates are in line with the latest Bank assumptions on
Brazilian and international inflationary trends. The US Dollar equivalent
of local price contingencies reflects a cumulative real depreciation of the
Cruzeiro against the US Dollar of 4.6% in 1982, 12.6% in 1983, and 14% in 1984
(para. 8.22).

7.05      Total project management costs, consisting of CVRD supervision,
management contracts and technical assistance, are estimated at US$389 million
or 12.2% of base cost which is appropriate in view of the relatively large
requirements of interfacing of components and contracting of work under the
Project. Training programs for all components total US$26 million. This
amount is lower than it would otherwise be, due to CVRD plans to use some of
its existing training facilities and experienced personnel from its southern
operations (requiring no training) for the Project and to share certain
training and costs with SENAI. Preoperational expenses are estimated to total
only US$37 million, mainly due to the limited amount of overburden removal
required at the mine.
7.06      The estimated working capital of US$225 million is based on financial
projections and pricing assumptions discussed in Chapter VIII and includes all
additional needs until the 35 million tpy capacity is reached in 1988.
Interest during construction on all long-term debt has been estimated at
US$560 million through June 30, 1985, of which US$322 million (57%) is for
foreign and US$238 million (43%) for local long-term debt. The total has been
calculated on the basis of the financing plan outlined in para 7.09.
7.07      The capital cost estimates were reviewed extensively in January/
February 1982 (para. 7.02) and are considered to be reliable, particularly
as a large number of contracts for civil works, goods and services had
been undertaken by that time (para. 7.25) and were taken into consideration
in the review. CVRD has established cost control procedures for the Project
which have been reviewed in detail and are considered sound (para. 6.04).
7.08      The total capital cost fcr the Project, including physical contin-
gencies but excluding price escalation, working capital, front-end fee, and
interest during construction, is about US$100 per annual ton capacity in
end-1981 terms, based on 35 million tpy. Estimates for other similar green-
field mining developments in the world indicate total capital costs in the
range of US$60-US$110 per annual ton capacity. However, the mine capital cost
of US$19/ton and the port capital cost of US$7/ton compare very favorably with
other developments, and the rather high total project cost is mainly attribu-
table to the heavy investment in the long railway of US$54/ton annual capacity.
This cost is acceptable, however, because the Carajas Iron Ore Project is only
the first step in the development not only of the mineral production capacity
of the greater Carajas, but also of the agricultural and other potential of
the region. An expansion of the Carajas iron ore capacity by 15 million tpy
to 50 million tpy, which is expected in the early 1990s as market demand
strengthens, would require capital investments of only US$26 per incre-
mental annual ton capacity and is favorable in comparison with other world-
wide incremental developments which are estimated to cost US$25-US$60 per
annual ton capacity. 1/ Based on 50 million tpy total capacity, the capital
cost per annual ton of iron ore is only US$78.
1/   The production expansion to 50 million tpy has been assumed in 1993 for
purposes of rate of return sensitivity tests in paras. 8.36-8.38, which
is reasonable in view of market expectations (para. 3.21).

foreign capital costs. Out of total debt financing of US$2,704 million, about
US$525 million or 19% is tied financing, and US$2,179 million or 81% is untied
financing.
7.10               In view of CVRD's low debt:equity ratio (32:68 in 1981), Project
financing on an overall debt:equity ratio of about 60:40 is acceptable. At
the same time, CVRD as a whole will maintain a ratio of not greater than 55:45
(para. 8.32).

a/  The interest rate for the IBRD loan will be the prevailing variable
interest rate plus guarantee fee of 1.2 percentage points. For the
purposes of financial projections, however, a constant rate of 11.6%
interest plus 1.2% guarantee fee has been applied.
b/ About 15%.
The weighted average of the financing terms is 10.8% p.a. interest for 14
years, including 4.7 years grace.
1.   Equity Financing
7.12      The financing plan stipulates that between 1982 and 1987
US$919 million be provided through internal cash generation from CVRD
averaging about US$153 million p.a., equivalent to 24% or less of CVRD's
projected annual internal cash generation (para. 8.23); these amounts are
well within CVRD's normal capacity. Provision for unexpected generating
shortfalls are discussed in para. 7.23.
7.13      New share capital from CVRD's shareholders totals US$257.2 million,
of which US$32.2 million has been provided in 1981 through reinvestment of
1980 dividends by both the Government (78%) and CVRD's private shareholders
(22%). Upon request by CVRD, the Government has further agreed to reinvest
its dividends over the next three years, which is estimated to increase
CVRD-s share capital by US$60 million in 1982, US$75 million in 1983, and
US$90 million in 1984.



- 59 -
7.14       In December 1981, CVRD successfully placed a first issue of converti-
ble debentures, equivalent to about US$77 million, in the Brazilian capital
market. Two more issues in similar amounts are planned for late 1982 and late
1983, raising the debenture total to US$250 million. Assurance has been
obtained from Government that CVRD will be permitted to issue debentures in
1982 and 1983. The 1981 debentures are each convertible into 65% common and
35% preferred shares, permitting private ownership of common (voting) shares
for the first time in CVRD history. As a result, private investors may hold
up to about 22% of CVRD's common (voting) shares by 1990, depending on the
percentage of debentures that wi'll be converted into shares. In the financing
plan, a conversion percentage of 50% has been assumed for each issue, with
conversion taking place on the due date. It was agreed the convertible
debentures would be subordinated to other indebtedness of CVRD and thus
treated as quasi-equity and excluded from the definition of debt for purposes
of the debt:equity ratio to be maintained by CVRD (para. 8.31).
2.   Debt Financing
7.15       Banco Nacional de Desinvolvimento Economico Social (BNDES) provides
untied financing of US$697 million equivalent, of which US$40.1 million was
disbursed in 1981. FINAME, a wholly-owned BNDES subsidiary, finances 70% of
the purchase price of Brazilian equipment according to a specific list of
items, agreed upon by FINAME and CVRD. FINAME financing for equipment is
equivalent to US$321.4 million. Banco da Amazonia (BAZA) will refinance 80%
of the FINA4E interest during construction up through 1986 estimated to total
US$75.2 million. The remaining 20% of FINAME interest will be refinanced by
other Brazilian banks, currently being identified by CVRD or by BAZA, which
has expressed its interest to refinance 100% of the FINAME interest.
7.16       Untied Japanese financing for the Project totals US$495 million, of
which US$270 million is from commercial banks and US$225 million from Govern-
ment institutions.  The package consists of four different financial
instruments:
(a)  The Japanese import loan of US$250 million will be made by the
Carajas Finance Company, which will be established by the seven
Japanese steel mills that are the buyers of Carajas iron ore.
The Company will borrow the funds from the Export-Import Bank of
Japan (70%) and Japanese commercial banks (30%) and will relend
the proceeds to CVRD;
(b)  In addition to its participation in the import credit scheme,
the Export-Import Bank of Japan will make a direct loan of
US$50 million to CVRD;
(c)  The Bank of Tokyo will syndicate a yen loan of US$150 million
equivalent, to be made available in 2-3 tranches with separate
terms and conditions as indicated in the table of para. 7.11; and
(d)  The fourth element in the Japanese financing package is the
private placement of yen bonds by CVRD, amounting to US$45.4
million equivalent.
7.17      The EC Commission has approved a credit line of up to US$600 million to
be raised by the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the European capital
markets and re-lent to CVRD at cost, with the requirement of a bank guarantee.
The financing is untied. CVRD has accepted Bank of America's offer to coordinate
a syndication for a stand-by letter of credit to guarantee up to US$150 million



- 60 -
(covering the first two expected draw-downs) for the first 5 years of the
15-year maturity at a cost of about 1.075% p.a. The Banco do Brasil may
participate in the syndication and provide its own guarantee of the loans from
years 6 to 15 at a cost of about 0.5% p.a. For purposes of the financing
plan, it is assumed that US$400 million of the ECSC line of credit will be
drawn down for project financing and US$200 million will constitute 50% of the
contingency reserve (para. 7.21). The US$400 million is assumed to be drawn
down in three tranches with separate terms and conditions as indicated in the
table of para. 7.11.
7.18      Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) has approved financing for the
Project of DM 300 million (US$130 million equivalent). KfW was the first of
the foreign co-lenders to make a commitment to the Project, however, such
commitment is contingent on the availability of financing from other potential
co-lenders and on the receipt of loan guarantee by the German Government. KfW
expects to receive such guarantee for between 80% and 90% of its loan, and
possibly an additional 10% from German commercial banks.
7.19      In addition to the above loans, CVRD intends to seek export finan-
cing of US$129 million equivalent for equipment to be procured from the U.S.,
Europe, and Japan. The Export-Import Bank of the U.S. has already extended to
CVRD a commitment of US$58 million.  Export credits from Europe and Japan,
totalling US$70.5 million, will be sought-during tendering. Considering the
type of procurement items (crawler tractors, shovels, bucketwheel reclaimers,
railroad signaling equipment), availability of export financing should pose no
problems.
7.20      The proposed Bank loan to CVRD would total US$304.5 million equivalent,
carry the prevailing variable interest rate plus a guarantee fee of 1.2 percent-
age points, include the 1.5% up-front fee, and have standard country terms, i.e.,
3 years of grace and 12 years of repayment. For the purposes of financial pro-
jections, an effective rate of 12.8% has been assumed. Based on present forecasts
of interest rate trends, this assumption appears reasonable and is not likely to
distort the financial projections. The effectiveness of (i) the Japanese import
loan; (ii) the direct loan from the Japanese Exim Bank; (iii) the Bank of Tokyo
syndicated loan; (iv) the ECSC loan; and (v) the KfW loan will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed IBRD loan.
7.21      CVRD hds agreed to bring total contracted contingency financing to a
level of US$400 million or 10% of the Project cost. CVRD will obtain US$200
million over and above the ECSC contingency financing (US$200 million) from
commercial banks under co-financing arrangements with the Bank. Accordingly,
CVRD has agreed to obtain and have ready for draw-down at least US$100 million
of the commercial bank contingency financing by year-end 1982 and the balance
by year-end 1983.
7.22      CVRD has a Morgan guaranty syndicated loan of US$300 million on
deposit at the Central Bank which it has not yet used due to Government
restrictions on its withdrawal and its relatively high cost (less than 10
years maturity implying, as a consequence of taxes, an effective interest rate
of about 21%). Should CVRD need to use such funds to meet project expenditures,
particularly during the period up to availability of additional commercial
bank contingency financing, the Government has agreed and taken all steps
necessary to "unfreeze", i.e. remove restrictions, on US$200 million of the
loan which is now available for CVRD draw-down.
3.   Cost Overruns
7.23      Agreement has been reached with the Government that, in case of cost
overruns or shortfalls in CVRD's internal cash generation or any other funding,
the Government will make available or cause to be made available to CVRD



- 61 -
the funds required to complete the proposed Project, and do so without delay
and in a form satisfactory to the Bank. For purposes of this covenant,
Project Completion is defined as: (i) completion of the physical construction
of all the facilities included in the Project; and (ii) operation of mine,
railroad and port during a consecutive period of 12 months at a production and
export level of no less than 31 million tpy, during which time CVRD will
maintain a current ratio of at least 1.1 and, on the basis of consolidation
with its majority-owned operating subsidiaries, a current ratio of at least
1.2.
7.24      As a modus operandi, CVRD and Government have agreed that at least
60% of the additional funds required would be provided by Government in form
of equity contributions. The remaining funds required would be provided through
new borrowing, secured by a Government guarantee, if necessary (para. 8.31).
C.   Procurement
7.25      Under the Project 1/ (i) works of a total value of about US$1,550
million equivalent; (ii) goods at a total value of about US$1,400 million
equivalent; (iii) management services for US$240 million equivalent; and
(iv) inspection services for about US$50 million equivalent will be procured.
Procurement started in 1978 when the first earthmoving contract for a diffi-
cult section of the railway near Sao Luis was let. Procurement status as of
December 31, 1981, is shown below.

Inspection Services             22.3            77.7             0
The above expenditures have been financed by debt and equity in a ratio of
11:89.  So far, contracts have been let through local competitive bidding
procedures which were found at appraisal to be satisfactory. Procurement of
services also used prequalification procedures. All contracts for works on the
critical path have been awarded.
7.26      Goods, mainly components for partly Brazilian-manufactured equipment,
with an estimated value of US$68 million will be financed by the U.S. Exim Bank
and procured accordingly. Other equipment components, estimated at US$48
million equivalent, will be procured through limited international competitive
bidding in Europe. Electrical mining shovels and preheated rails, estimated
at US$33 million equivalent, will be procured in the Japanese market through
local competitive bidding. These procurement arrangements were reviewed at
appraisal and found satisfactory.
7.27      Bank-financed equipment, machinery and erection services, totalling
an estimated US$265.4 million including contingencies, will be procured through
ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines and consist mainly of railway track
material, mobile equipment, fenders and steelcord conveyor belt for the mine and
the port. These goods are grouped in 31 bidding packages (ranging from US$0.1
to US$36.7 million each). Limited international tendering will be used for
1/   The values given for works, goods, management services, and inspection
services include physical and price contingencies.



- 62 -
equipment and machinery packages of US$300,000 or less. At present, only
one such package is envisaged. Bidding documents for railway cross-ties and
fenders have been reviewed by the Bank, and invitation to bid for the first 2
packages--consisting of 290,000 ties each--has been issued. Qualifying
domestic suppliers/manufacturers would be afforded a preference in bid-evalua-
tion of 15% or the import tax whichever is lower. Approval by CACEX has been
obtained for all Bank-financed items.   The list of goods to be financed by the
Bank is shown in Annex 7-2 and the procurement schedule for those goods in
Annex 7-3.
7.28      Partly Bank-financed civil works, comprising the construction of
major mine service facilities, residential buildings in the Carajas townsite,
and community service facilities (hotel, supermarkets, hospital, cinema/theater,
bus station and church) and totalling US$75 million equivalent including
contingencies, are divided into four packages (ranging from US$15.1 to US$22.1
million each) and will be procured through ICB in accordance with Bank's
guidelines. Under this category, the Bank will finance US$22.5 million, which
is the estimated foreign component of these works. The tender documents have
been reviewed and approved by the Bank. In addition, the Bank will finance
US$12.1 million in technical assistance and the consultants will be employed
according to Bank guidelines for the use of consultants (August 1981) (paras.
6.07-6.08).
7.29      All remaining uncommitted works (estimated at about US$477 million
equivalent) and goods (estimated cost US$1,230 equivalent) will be procured
through local competitive bidding procedures, which were found to be satis-
factory.
' ^ ,     Contract Review for Bank-financed Goods.  Nineteen packages for
goods over US$5.0 million equivalent (para. 7.31) and all four bidding packages
for civil works (para. 7.32) will be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation, resulting in a coverage of about 93% of the total
estimated value of goods contracts procured through ICB. The balance of ICB
goods contracts would be subject to random post review by the Bank after
contract award.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of the Bank Loan
7.31      The Bank loan of US$304.5 million will finance goods and services
and front-end fee as shown in the table below:

The percentage of equipment expenditures to be financed by the Bank relates to
the ex-factory costs of local goods and cif costs of imported goods. It is
expected that for those items to be financed by the Bank, about US$110 million
(or 37% of the Bank loan) will be for contracts awarded to local suppliers,
following ICB. All disbursements would be made against fully documented
withdrawal applications.
7.32      The Project disbursement profile (Annex 7-4) deviates from the
historical country industrial sector profiles as well as the historical
mining sector profile. The reasons are (i) physical implementation of the
Project started more than two years ago; (ii) 68% of the Bank loan will
finance material for the railway superstructure, construction of which peaks
in 1983 and 1984; and (iii) items at an estimated value of US$21.2 million are
out for bid and procurement of goods at an estimated value of US$51.1 million
will be initiated in May 1982. The Bank is now reviewing the tender documents.
The Project as a whole is expected to be completed in December 1986, with
physical completion of the port in July 1985, the townsite in December 1986,
the mine and beneficiation plant in October 1986 and the railroad in October
1986. The Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 1986.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   CVRD
1.   Carajas
8.01      The financial projections for CVRD have been made in current US
dollars based on (i) capital and operating cost estimates updated in December
1981 cruzeiro terms and converted into US dollars at the prevailing exchange
rate (Cr$ 125.04); (ii) iron ore revenues in 1982 terms so as to incorporate
important real price increases agreed between CVRD and its major clients in
the first quarter of CY1982; and (iii) other revenues in end 1981 terms. The
projections assume inflationary and exchange rate changes shown and discussed
in para. 8.22.
8.02      Production, Ore Stocks and Sales Volume.  Production at Carajas is
expected to start on July 1, 1985, with 5.7 million tons in 1985, and reach
full design capacity of 35 million tpy in 1988. Prior to actual production
startup, the pilot plant at the mine (para. 5.12) is plannned to produce about
1.4 million tons for stockpile build-up. Sales are forecast to start in the
second half of 1985 with 5 million tons and reach 35 million tons in 1988.
Projected production, ore stocks and sales from 1985-88 are summarized in the
table below:
Carajas Production, Ore Stocks and Sales, 1984-88

- 64 -
8.03      Product and Sales Mix.  Based on extensive laboratory and pilot
plant tests, 20% of the run-of-mine ore will be natural pellets and 80%
sinter feed. Natural pellets average 66.5% Fe and 2% moisture, sinter feed
also 66.5% Fe but 7% moisture. Natural pellets represent 20% of the projected
sales volume and sinter feed 80%. Accordingly, the Carajas sales mix is
projected as follows:
Projected Carajas Sales Mix
(million tons)

1985    1986    1987    1988
Lumpy Ore                1.0     4.0      6.3      7.0

Total               5.0    20.0    31.5    35.0
8.04      Operating Costs.  Operating costs for Carajas were developed by
CVRD based on comparable cost data from the Minas Gerais mines.  The initial
estimate of February 1981 was updated by CVRD to December 1981 terms and
reviewed by a Bank mission in March 1982. The detailed update took into
account (i) recent salary and wage increases; (ii) an increase in the con-
sumption power tariff; (iii) increased prices for diesel fuel and lubricants;
and (iv) 1981 operating costs of the Minas Gerais mines.
8.05      The table below gives estimated operating costs for the Project
until 1990.

a/  Assumes a 3.5% p.a. real wage increase up to 1985 and 2.0% p.a.
from 1985-90, based on CVRD analysis of its experience from
1979-82 and expectations on continued dampening in inflation and
gradual moderation in policies on real wage increases.
Both in terms of scale of operation and technical applications the Project is,
in most respects, similar to CVRD's current operations in the South. In view
of this, the 40 years of operating experience and the cost data available
in the South constitute a good and rather unique base for the projected
operating cost estimates which are found to be satisfactory. The Project is



- 65 -
not overly complex from a technical/operating point of view and, in comparison
with operating costs of other similar large scale mining ventures worldwide,
the estimated costs compare favorably.
8.06      At full production in 1988, the cost per ton of iron ore is estimated
at US$18.64 in real end-1981 terms, including US$7.30 for operating costs and
Mineral Extraction Tax (IUM), and US$11.34 for depreciation/amortization of
fixed assets, preproduction expenses, and interest during construction.
8.07      Iron Ore Prices.  Carajas iron ore prices are based on the 1982
prices that CVRD obtains for its ores from the Minas Gerais mines, adjusted
for the specific Fe and moisture contents of the Carajas ore. Accordingly,
natural pellets are priced at USJ39.45 per dry metric Fe unit, equivalent to
US$25.71 per natural metric ton. In addition to the specific Fe and moisture
content of Carajas, the sinter feed price of US$20.17 per natural metric
ton also reflects (i) 60% of sinter feed sales to Europe and 40% to Japan;
(ii) a Carajas quality premium of US41 per dry Fe unit; (iii) a premium
freight differential of USU1.5 per dry Fe unit for deliveries to Europe and a
penalty freight differential of USi1 for deliveries to Japan, and (iv) a 3%
discount on 24.7 million tons already contracted (para. 3.47). Carajas prices
are projected to remain constant in real terms through 1985, and increase by
1.5% p.a. in real terms from 1986 through 1990.
2.   Existing Operations
8.08      Production Volume.  Production in CVRD's Minas Gerais Mines, includ-
ing pellet feed for CVRD's own pelletizing plants, is projected to decrease
from 61.4 million tpy in 1982 to 56.7 million tpy in 1990. The decrease by
4.7 million tons is a result of reductions in the Caue and Conceicao mines
(9.7 million tpy), which are only partially replaced by an increase in the
Timbopeba mine (5.0 million tpy). During 1983-87, CVRD plans to produce 18.5
million tpy in the recently acquired Chacrinha and Piriquito mines to partially
substitute Carajas production, which has been contracted for, based on start-
up in January 1985 and full production from 1987, but will not materialize
since start-up of Carajas is now scheduled for July 1985 and full annual
production from 1988 onward. CVRD-s ore purchases from other mines are
projected to increase from 5.6 million tons in 1982 to 13.9 million tons in
1990, mostly from Capanema (para. 3.42). CVRD-s projected own production and
ore purchases from other mines are shown in the table below.

a/   Pellet feed sales to CVRD joint venture pellet companies are included
in iron ore exports in the table on Brazilian iron ore supply and demand
forecasts in para. 3.40.
During the critical project implementation years 1982-84, the projected sales
volume represents only 78% of contracted volume sn ' 2^R3 and 82% in 1984.
8.10      Commercial Transport Volume.  Commerc-.  transDort of goods on CVRD's
Minas Gerais railroad is projected to increase 'r-m 4.2 bilLion ton-km in 1982
to 9.1 billion ton-km in 1990, equivalent to 10.'J' growth p.a.  This compares
to the past average growth rate of about 15% p.a, between 1976 and 1981.
8.11      Transport and Shipping Volume of FERTECO, and SAMITRI Ores and
Pellets. Ores and pellets from these producers (para. 3.37) are transported
and shipped from Tubarao port by CVRD. Their volume is expected to be 10.4
million tons in 1982, and projected to increase to 11.9 million tons in 1990.
8.12      Operating Costs.  Operating costs of CVRD's existing operations are
projected to increase from US$542.5 million in 1982 to US$715.1 million in
1990 (all in end 1981 real terms), in line with projected volumes of ore and
pellet production, ore and pellet purchases, and commercial railroad transport
of goods and passengers (paras. 8.08-8.09). At the same time CVRD's operating
cost structure will change, as shown in the table below, reflecting (i) pro-
jected production decreases in CVRD's own mines; (ii) the increase of purchases
from joint ventures and others; and (iii) the increase of commercial transports
volumes on the Minas Gerais railroad.

8.13      Iron Ore Pricing and Revenue Projections.  For 1982, CVRD has
obtained significant real price increases in both the export and domestic
markets (para. 3.32). Iron ore prices are assumed to remain constant in real
terms from 1983-85, and increase by 1.5% p.a. from 1986 through 1990 (para.
3.34), remaining constant in real terms thereafter. Nevertheless, since price
increases for exports to Japan became effective only in April 1, 1982, real
export prices in 1983 will be about 2.5% higher than in 1982. CVRD's 1982
iron ore prices are shown in the table below:
CVRD Iron Ore Prices, 1982 a/
(US$ per ton)
Export Market        Domestic Market
Lumpy Ore                    20.56                   13.38
Sinter Feed                  19.52                   11.64
Pellet Feed                  16.85                   15.16
Pellets                      33.03                   29.29
a/ Fob prices.
Domestic iron ore prices are controlled by the Price Control Authority CIP, a
government agency, which revises prices twice per year based on cost schedules
presented by CVRD. Domestic prices for pellet feed and pellets, which repre-
sent 73% of the expected 1982 sales volume, are in line with export prices.
Domestic prices for lumpy ore and sinter feed are 35-40% below the export
prices, but cover production cost including depreciation, and overhead. The
pricing policies for domestic iron ore have been discussed with the Government
which will undertake an analysis of the prices and their economic effects.
The study is to be completed and furnished to the Bank by June 30, 1983.
Based on the projected iron ore prices and sales volume, CVRD's mineral
revenues from its existing operations are projected to total, in 1982 real
terms, US$1,268 million in 1982 and US$1,478 million in 1990, of which export
revenues are US$989 million or 78% in 1982 and US$1,036 million or 70% in 1990.
8.14      CVRD-s projected other sales revenues, mostly from railroad transport
and port charges, are based on present tariffs, which are assumed to remain
constant in real terms, growing according to increased transport and handling
volumes (para. 8.09-8.10). Revenues, in 1982 real terms, are projected at



- 68 -
US$166 million in 1982 and US$240 million in 1990, equivalent to 12% and 14%
of total revenues in 1982 and 1990, respectively.
8.15      Capital Expenditures.  Capital expenditures from 1982-90, excluding
Carajas and subsidiaries, are projected to total US$1,224.5 million in current
terms. The investment program, which was reviewed in detail during appraisal,
is sound. About 55% of the total is allocated towards expansions and replace-
ments that are necessary to achieve the projected production targets. About
27% will be spent on reforestation of the mined areas, and 20% on a coal pier
at Tubarao port. A breakdown of the program is shown below.

8.16      Equity Contributions to Subsidiaries and Associated Companies.
Equity contributions from 1982-90 are projected to total US$664.9 million in
current terms. Their allocation is shown in the table below:

8.17      Contributions to Valesul, an aluminum smelter project financed by
the Bank (Loan 1660-BR) and completed in May 1982 will cover project cost in
1982 as well as cash shortfalls during start-up in 1982-83, which are expected
as a result of the prevailing very low aluminum prices. Contributions cease
after 1983, as it is estimated that aluminum prices will have recovered
sufficiently.
8.18      Contributions to Valenorte, Albras and Alunorte (para. 4.20) will
help to finance an alumina/aluminum complex near Belem in the state of Para.
Valenorte, Albras and Alunorte are joint venture companies with Nippon Amazon
Aluminum Co. (NAAC), a Japanese consortium. Alunorte is scheduled to start
production in 1984 and will produce 800,000 tons of alumina per year at full



- 69 -
capacity. The bauxite will be supplied by Mineracao Rio do Norte (para.
8.19). Albras will produce 320,000 tpy of primary aluminum, with start-up of
the first potline of 80,000 tons scheduled for 1985 and the fourth for 1988.
Total financing required is estimated at about US$2.6 billion in current
terms. In addition to providing equity (i) CVRD guarantees the BNDE loans for
Albras and Alunorte, totalling US$654 million; and (ii) in case BNDE disburse-
ments are not forthcoming as stipulated, CVRD has to pay the difference in
financial charges between substitute financing and BNDE-s financing at 7.5%.
No specific provision has been made for this in the financial projections
because BNDE's disbursements will take place mainly over the period 1985-88,
by which time BNDE's liquidity constraints are expected to be relieved (para.
8.25).
8.19      Contributions to Mineracao Rio do Norte a joint venture with 9
Brazilian and foreign partners, will help to finance the expansion of the
Trombetas Bauxite Development in the state of Para from about 3 million tons
production in 1981 to about 10 million tons in 1986. Total financing required
for the project is estimated at about US$500 million in current terms.
8.20      Contributions to Flonibra would finance a pulp plant to be con-
structed during the second half of the eighties. -Contrary to the projected
equity outlays for the bauxite/alumina/aluminum projects mentioned above,
which reflect contractual commitments by CVRD, projected outlays for Flonibra
are tentative in timing as well as amounts.
B.   Financial Projections
8.21      Detailed financial projections have been prepared for (i) CVRD
consolidated with the Carajas Project; and (ii) the Carajas Project alone,
based on assumptions given in Annex 8-1 and the following paragraph.
8.22      The projections have been prepared in current US-Dollar terms and
assume the following inflation and exchange rates:
Inflation and Exchange Rate Assumptions

(Cr$/US$)
International Inflator          1.04    1.12    1.21    1.30    1.38        1.55      1.75
Domestic Inflator               1.00    1.00    1.07    1.15    1.22        1.37      1.54
(in US$ terms)
The projected exchange rates assume that the presently overvalued cruzeiro
will be gradually devalued in real terms against the US Dollar by about 14%
from end-1981 through mid-1983, equivalent to its average value for 1980 which
is considered its long-term equilibrium value. To correct the over-valuation
of the cruzeiro, which began in 1980 and continued at increasing levels during
the first three quarters of 1981, the Government, since the fourth quarter of
1981, has been following a policy of a crawling-peg devaluation equal to
domestic inflation, thus leading to a progressive real devaluation of the
Cruzeiro. After reaching the average real 1980 level in mid-1983, the Cruzeiro
is assumed to be devalued to maintain its purchase power parity with the US
Dollar.

8.24             CVRD Consolidated. 1/  The financial projections indicate that CVRD
may be expected to maintain its present sound financial position throughout
the Carajas construction and start-up period. The main factors contributing
to CVRD's satisfactory financial prospects through 1987 are:
(a)  the substantial price increases obtained in 1982
(para. 3.32);
(b)  sales volume increases from 66.7 to 79.9 million tpy between
1982 and 1984, which are based on realistic off-take percent-
ages of contracted volumes (para. 8.09); and
(c)  during the Carajas start-up period from 1985-87, the additional
sale of 18.5 million tons of Minas Gerais ores, which will
supplement the Carajas sales of 56.5 million tons during
these years, so as to ensure full delivery of 75 million tons
of Carajas contracts already committed or to be committed
between 1985 and 1987 (paras. 3.46 and 3.48).
From 1988 on, the projections assume that Carajas will be fully on stream
with 35 million tpy, compensating the reduction of sales volume from CVRD's
existing operations to 72.7 million tpy, which is 9% above the 1982 volume.
1/   Consolidated with the Carajas Project.



- 71 -
8.25       The financial projections also indicate that even small relative
differences between actual and projected figures could potentially be quite
large in absolute terms, and therefore the projections anticipate certain
contingencies. First, BNDE's projected disbursement in 1983 and 1984 are US$50
and US$100 million lower respectively than originally estimated, in view of
BNDE-s expected liquidity constraints during that period. Second, FINAME's
disbursements in 1982 have been assumed at only US$49 million as budgeted by
FINAME, whereas CVRD would have been eligible for US$93 million, or US$44
million more, according to the agreed equipment list.
8.26       The financing plan contains another US$400 million of contingency
financing (paras. 7.17 and 7.21) which are not included in the financial
projections. Together with forecast cash surpluses of US$560 million through
1985, the critical Carajas construction years, these would be sufficient to
absorb the combined events of (i) a 5% drop in sales revenues from 1982-85
(about US$375 million); (ii) a 10% increase in Carajas capital expenditures
predicted for the same period (about US$340 million); and (iii) a 7% real
devaluation instead of the expected 14% (about US$175 million), providing a
reasonable safety margin against adverse developments.
8.27       CVRD-s financial ratios remain satisfactory throughout the forecast
period. The debt/equity ratio is not projected to become greater than 49:51
nor the debt service coverage to drop below 2.8. The current ratio, excluding
surplus cash, is projected to be 1.3 or higher. The exceptionally low current
ratio of 1.0 in 1981 resulted from the use of Banker's acceptances on ore
shipments and the use by CVRD of its majority-owned offshore subsidiary Rio Doce
International Finance for short-term cash management. In anticipation of
long-term financing for Carajas becoming available in 1982, the financial
projections assume that outstanding short-term borrowings will be reduced by
about US$162 million in 1982. To allow CVRD some flexibility in arranging
pre-export financing and in maintaining the bulk of its liquidity off-shore,
which have been financially advantageous practices for the Company, agreement
has been reached that CVRD will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.1, and
on a consolidated basis with its majority-owned subsidiaries a ratio of at
least 1.2. 1/
8.28       Carajas.  Separate financial projections have been established
for the Carajas Project (Annex 8-3). The projections indicate book losses
of US$257 million, US$318 million and US$39 million for 1985, 1986 and 1987,
respectively, as a result of the high depreciation (above US$400 million
p.a.); however, only a small cash loss of about US$41 million is projected for
1985, whereas in 1986 and 1987 Carajas- internal cash generation is projected
at US$88 million and US$391 million, respectively. In 1988, the first year at
full capacity, Carajas' net income is projected at 11% of sales revenue and
in 1990 at 21% of sales revenue. The latter is in line with the profit-
ability of CVRD-s Minas Gerais mines in good years such as 1976 and 1980
(para. 4.17), indicating that Carajas' low operating cost and high-quality ore
(price premium) will compensate the relatively high capital costs of the
Project.
8.29       The financial projections also indicate that Carajas would still
break even in net income terms in 1988 if revenues were 11% lower than projec-
ted. Internal cash generation in 1987-88 would remain sufficient to cover
1/   CVRD consolidated financial statements, which are audited by Arthur
Andersen, include 14 operating subsidiaries of which the four largest,
after merger of AMZA with CVRD (para. 5.04), are Florestas Rio Doce
(forestry), DOCENAVE (ocean transport), Rio Doce International Finance,
and DOCEGEO (geological research).

projected funds applications, i.e. replacements, working capital and debt
service, if revenues were 10% lower than projected in 1987, and 16% in 1988.
8.30      With respect to funds flow, the financial projections assume that
Carajas will be financed with debt and equity in a proportion of approximately
60:40 through the construction period, with 50% of the convertible debentures
taken as debt and 50% as equity. This is considered acceptable in view
of CVRD-s corporate debt to equity ratio, which is projected not to exceed
49:51 through 1990 (para. 8.23). In order to ensure that debt financing of
the Project is maintained within reasonable limits at all times, CVRD has
agreed that, on the basis of cumulative expenditures for the Project, the
proportion of debt to equity financing not exceed 70:30.
C.   Financial Covenants
8.31      To ensure the necessary financing for the Project and its completion
in a sound manner, agreement has been reached on the following financial
covenants: that
(a) Government will take all necessary action to enable CVRD to issue
convertible debentures in the Brazilian capital market in both
1982 and 1983;
(b) CVRD will issue subordinated convertible debentures in the Brazilian
capital market in the aggregate amount of at least US$172 million
equivalent, of which about US$86 million will be issued in 1982
and the remainder in 1983;
(c) Government will make equity contributions to CVRD by reinvesting
the Government portion of dividends from 1982-84;
(d) until project completion (para. 7.23), CVRD will prepare annually
five-year forecasts of the Company's sources and uses of funds for
review with the Government and the Bank by August 31 each year, and
will consult with the Bank on the uses of funds as well as any
additional financing requirements by no later than September 30
each year;
(e) CVRD will provide timely and sufficient funds to cover the
expenditures required for the Project, including the necessary
local and foreign funds to complete the Project as defined in
para. 7.23, and to cover any possible cost overruns;
(f) Government will equally ensure, by way of a back-up guarantee to
CVRD's obligation, timely and sufficient funds to cover the
expenditures required for the Project, including the necessary
local and foreign funds to complete the Project as defined in
para. 7.23, and to cover any possible cost overrun the necessity
for and amounts of such funds being determined in the annual
review mentioned in (d) above;
(g) in the case of cost overrun financing, Government will provide that
not less than 60% of additional resources will be in the form
of Government equity contributions; and
(h) CVRD will ensure that, on the basis of cumulative expenditures
for the Project, the proportion of debt to equity financing of
the Project will not exceed 70:30.



- 73 -
8.32      To ensure maintenance of a sound financial position during project
implementation and thereafter, CVRD has agreed that
(a) CVRD's non-Carajas investments and equity contributions to sub-
sidiaries and associated companies will together not exceed the
agreed-upon investment program (paras. 8.15-8.16) by an amount
equivalent to US$30 million in any one year through 1985 and by
US$50 million equivalent from 1986 through project completion (para.
7.23), without prior Bank approval. Investments included the
agreed program but deferred for physical and financial reasons
from one year to the following years would be considered to be
included in the agreed investment program;
(b) CVRD will maintain a debt/equity ratio not greater than 55:45, with
the ratios to be calculated excluding the current portion of
long-term debt;
(c) CVRD will maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.1:1, and
1.2:1 on the basis of consolidation with its majoritiy-owned
subsidiaries (para. 8.27);
(d) CVRD will not incur any debt maturing by its terms more than one
year after the date on which it is originally incurred, unless
financial projections prepared by CVRD and acceptable to the Bank
show that the debt service coverage will be at least 1.5 including
the debt to be contracted; and
(e) CVRD will furnish to the Bank financial statements and accounts for
CVRD and for CVRD consolidated with its wholly owned subsidiaries,
audited by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank, within
four months after the end of each fiscal year.
D.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
8.33      The financial rate of return for the Project has been calculated
in real terms. Since CVRD owns and operates two major mines (Caue, Conceicao)
and two small mines (Picarrao, Caraca), is commencing operations at two major
mines (Timbopeba and, in a joint venture, Capanema), and has recently added to
its reserves two additional, largely undepleted mines (Chacrinha, Piriquito),
its options are not limited to implementing Carajas or doing nothing at all.
CVRD without Carajas could pursue other alternatives such as increase, maintain,
or reduce production in existing mines, bring Chacrinha and Piriquito on stream,
or do various combinations of these principal possibilities. To establish
that Carajas is the superior investment choice for CVRD and to estimate its
net return, it is necessary to determine its financial benefits to CVRD over
and above those generated by other alternatives. Hence, the financial rate of
return of the Project has been calculated on an incremental basis.
8.34      To arrive at incremental streams, two scenarios have been defined
for CVRD as a whole, one "with" Carajas and another one "without", both of
which are described in detail in Annex 8-4. The "without" case stipulates,
that CVRD will increase its production in the Minas Gerais mines from 67
million tons in 1982 to about 80 million tons in 1986, a level that can be
maintained through 2002, before gradually dropping to 49 million tons in 2007.
The "with" case stipulates that (i) Carajas will come on stream, and (ii) CVRD
will bring on stream new capacity in the South as permitted by the market and
beneficiation capacity.



- 74 -
8.35      Other important assumptions underlying the calculations are the
following:
(a)  the Carajas sales volume increases to 35 million tpy in 1988
and is maintained at that level through the year 2015;
(b)  a 3% price discount on the presently contracted 24.7 million
tpy (para. 3.47) has been applied from 1985-99;
(c)  a devaluation of the Cruzeiro by 14% in real terms has been
taken into account (para. 8.22); and
(d)  no financial benefits have been quantified for future non-
Carajas railroad transport.
Further detailed assumptions as well as revenue and cost streams are given
in Annex 8-4.
8.36      Based on these assumptions, the incremental financial rate of
return of the Project is about 11%.
8.37      Sensitivity Tests.  These tests which are summarized below show that
the rate of return is most sensitive to changes in sales revenue, project
delays, capital costs, and exchange rate variations. If one assumes that the
sales volume increases to 50 million tpy by 1993 which is reasonable given (i)
expectations on increasing market strength in the 1990s and the good market-
ability of Carajas ore (para. 3.03), and (ii) CVRD plans and Carajas Project
engineering design which allows for the production expansion with a relatively
small additional outlay (about US$360 million or 11% of the original base cost
estimate) in capital costs, the base case return increases to about 12%.

8.38      Of the various factors used in the sensitivity tests, market (sales
revenues) and exchange rates are more exogeneous to CVRD than capital and
operating costs and implementation schedule which are within the Company's



75 -
domain of control. The likelihood of lower revenues is primarily related to
the possibility of a small global market oversupply by the time Carajas comes
on stream (para. 3.24). While oversupply, as was mentioned there, may continue
to exist for one-to-two years beyond the Carajas start-up in 1985, realistic
forecasts by the Bank and various experts expect equilibrium by the second
half of the 1980s, and therefore, the probability of persisting oversupply
during the 5 years after start-up is considered to be low. Should the 1.5%
p.a. real increase in prices assumed for the years 1986-90 (para. 8.13) be
deferred until 1991-95, the return falls to 10.2%.
8.39       While it is possible that only a portion of the assumed devaluation
will materialize, or that it will take place at a slower pace over a longer
time period, it is unlikely that there will be no devaluation at all. However,
if one assumes that instead of a cruzeiro devaluation a 5% revaluation over
the December 1981 exchange rate occurs, the return drops to 9.2%.
8.40      A 10% increase of operating costs is unlikely, given CVRDIs extensive
experience in its existing operation, from which the base operating cost
parameters have been derived. A 10% increase in capital cost cannot be
excluded, but is noc expected, because capital cost estimates have been
carefully prepared and in light of the sizeable amount of expenditures and
contract commitments made as of end-1981 (paras. 7.07 and 7.24).
8.41       Project delays of a full year or more are also unlikely in view of
(i) the high degree of completion of the major and more difficult earth works,
(ii) CVRD-s current implementation plans which allow for a reduction in
activities during the rainy seasons, (iii) the elaborate planning and control
procedures that are applied, and (iv) the well-staffed and experienced project
management organization.
8.42       The rate of return has also been calculated in the case of Carajas
as an independent entity, entirely separate from CVRD's other operations.
Under this assumption Carajas is credited with the benefit of its total
production, because it does not have to compete with other benefit yielding
investment alternatives. The resulting rate of return is 11.3% based on 35
million tpy and 12.8% based on 50 million tpy starting in 1993.
E.   Major Risks
8.43       The technical risks to the Project are small.  Each component--
mine, railroad and port--is relatively straightforward in terms of technical
design, construction and operation, and the interfaces between components have
been taken adequately into account in project management and on-going operating
arrangements (Chapter VI).
8.44       As discussed in Chapter III, the current oversupply of the iron ore
market is of concern, and while there is reasonable expectation by the Bank
and various experts that the market should be in equilibrium by-the time
Carajas comes on stream (para. 3.25), it cannot be excluded that some oversupply
may persist a year or two beyond Carajas initial production build-up in 1985.
Under the circumstance, it must be considered possible that prices may not
rise in real terms beginning in 1986 as has been assumed in this report (no
real price increases are assumed until 1986, but from 1986-90 real prices are
expected to increase by 1.5% p.a.) and that there may be reductions in CVRD
sales volumes in individual years, posing financial risk to the Project.
However, most market experts tend to expect price increases of up to 2% p.a.
through 1985, and of greater percentages thereafter as the market strengthens



- 76 -
(para. 3.34). Carajas is not expected to depress the general level of iron
ore prices when the Project comes fully on stream in 1988, as the Project
production will comprise about 7.5% of estimated international market
supply (para. 3.35) and is not expected to create a market surplus. Should
Carajas or any one of the other 8 envisaged new projects not go forward for
any reason, it is expected that replacement would be made from capacity
increases in certain existing mines where, with limited capital investment and
1-3 years lead time, production increases could be obtained (paras. 3.15-3.16).
8.45      As indicated above, the principal financial risk facing the Project
is the possibility of insufficient or untimely availability of internally
generated cash for equity financing to complete the Project. Internally
generated cash may not be available, because (i) it has not materialized;
or (ii) Carajas requirements cannot be met because of competing other CVRD
investments. To reduce the risk of the first case, equity contributions from
internally generated cash have been kept at a minimum during the crucial years
1982-84. They total US$460 million from 1982-84, representing 10% of projected
internal cash generation in 1982, 25% in 1983, and 18% in 1-984. Other measures
taken to help CVRD cope with insufficient cash generation are (i) the contract-
ing of US$400 million of contingency financing, which is a condition of effec-
tiveness (para. 7.20); (ii) the annual review of expenditures and revenues
through Project completion, which would permit early identification of cash
shortfalls (para. 8.31); and (iii) the Government cost overrun guarantee (para.
8.31). To reduce the risk of the second case, i.e. competition with other
investments, Bank approval has been agreed if non-Carajas investments in any
year are more than US$30 million higher through 1985 and US$50 million higher
from 1986 through Project Completion than the agreed amounts (para. 8.32).
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
9.01      The Project is an important element in the Government-s policy
objective to improve Brazils balance of payments through increased exports
and foreign exchange earnings. The Project would contribute directly to
foreign exchange earnings by financing the development, exploitation, and
sale of iron ore abroad, and would also give support through provision of
basic infrastructure to subsequent resource developments in the region which
would largely also be for export (para. 2.19). Several projects already
in early stages of development which would be facilitated by the Carajas
transportation network include bauxite, ferro-manganese, gold, copper and
tin projects. Over the longer term, developments are envisaged in other
minerals in the region, as well as in agriculture, and in production of
semi-finished and finished products.
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.02      The economic rate of return of the Project has been calculated in
real terms, based on the streams given in Annex 9-1. The return has been
calculated on an incremental basis as in the financial return (para. 8.34) and
the economic cost and benefit streams have been based on the same assumptions
used for the financial rate of return, except for (i) exclusion of all identi-
fiable taxes; and (ii) application of a standard conversion factor of 0.83 to
foreign exchange costs and benefits to reflect foreign trade distortions
caused by import tariffs, export taxes and subsidies, as well as other forms
of trade restrictions and incentives. The economic rate of return is 13%,



- 77 -
which is satisfactory for new mining projects where large capital investments
and long lead times to development are required. The return includes as
project costs all capital expenditures made by CVRD since 1977.
9.03       The return can be viewed as conservative in view of (i) the inclusion
of all transport, housing and social infrastructure costs without accounting
for the economic and social benefits to the population involved; and (ii)
pricing assumptions (para. 3.34) where no real increase is assumed through
1985.
9.04       Sensitivity Tests.  If evaluation is made of the Project at a
production and sales level of 50 million tpy starting in 1993 as can be
reasonably assumed (para. 8.37), the return increases to 15%.  This test, as
well as a series of tests made of 35 million tpy base case are shown below:

through 1979 (US$136 million)
18.   Excluding Project Expenditures  16.4  18.0
through 1981 (US$620 million)
9.05       In respect to any one particular change, the return is most sensitive
to changes in sales revenues. A variation of sales revenues by 10% results in
a return variation of 1.5%. The rate of return is also very sensitive to
project delays; in case of a one-year delay, the return would drop by 1.4%.
These tests show the importance of the recent price increases (para. 3.31)
agreed by CVRD with the German and Japanese mills, and of maintaining the
Project on schedule (para. 8.38).
9.06       Two sunk cost alternatives have also been tested.  The streams for
case 16 exclude all capital costs through 1979 (US$136 million), increasing
the rate of return by about 0.8%. This case treats project costs as sunk
roughly through the feasibility and design engineering stage. The streams
for case 17 exclude all capital costs through 1981 (US$620 million), increasing
the rate of return by about 3.3% to 16.4% for 35 million tpy.



- 78 -
9.07       Evaluation was also made of the Carajas Project as a separate
entity in terms only of the costs and benefits associated with it, rather
than as incremental to CVRD (para. 3.46). Under these circumstances, the
economic rate of return is 13.9% based on 35 million tpy and 15.4% based on
50 million tpy starting in 1993.
B.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
9.08      The foreign exchange benefits of the 35 million tpy Project are high
since the Project generates 100% foreign exchange from export sales of iron
ore, and its costs other than the service of foreign debt are largely in local
currency. The Project, therefore, will contribute strongly to the improvement
of Brazils balance of payments situation and has been given high priority by
the Government.
9.09      Incremental foreign exchange benefits have been calculated based
on the streams for the incremental financial rate of return plus debt service
on foreign financing for Carajas. Revenues have been calculated as 100%
foreign exchange, as all incremental production will be exported. The
foreign exchange portions of operations, capital and replacement costs are
based on a detailed study prepared by consultants for CVRD, and include the
direct as well as indirect foreign exchange costs. Built up item by item, the
total foreign exchange portions for operating, capital and replacement costs
over the life of the Project are about 20%, 27% and 30%, respectively.
9.10      The resulting incremental foreign exchange benefits of the Project
are considerable, averaging annually US$632 million in real 1982 terms from
1985-2015. The annual foreign exchange balance will become positive in
1985 and the cumulative balance in 1988. The cumulative foreign exchange
benefit of the Project over 30 years (up to the year 2015) is about US$20
billion, which increases to US$27 billion assuming a i')duction and sales
expansion to 50 million tpy in 1993. The table below summarizes the expected
incremental foreign exchange benefits of the Project and Project Expansion
(Annex 9-2):

C.   Other Benefits
9.11      As noted in Chapter II, D and para. 9.01 above, the Project provides
major regional benefits in opening up a remote but resource-rich area of the
Amazon. The Project will generate economic activity directly at Carajas,
along the rail-line and at the port city of Sao Luis, and indirectly through-
out the region.
9.12      The Project will provide direct employment for about 6,000 employees,
and about 2,500 service workers up through 1988, and lead to additional
employment opportunities thereafter as basic workers are drawn by a variety of
expected mining developments and other economic opportunities in the region.
9.13      Urban development in the region will be accelerated by the Project
through the development of the new town of Carajas as well as expansion of
existing towns particularly along the railway line where maintenance and other
railway personnel will be housed (para. 5.39) and where outsiders are likely
to be drawn and at Sao Luis, which is already an established port city.
9.14      In the above respects, the Project is expected to play a key role
in spurring the economic growth of the region, and importantly to begin the
process of planning and controlling the growth of a territory with both vast
economic potential and unique environmental features.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following agreements have been reached:
(a)  With the Government:
(i)  that, six months prior to introducing passenger services
on the railway, CVRD will prepare a tariff schedule, satis-
factory to the Bank, for such services, which will be suffi-
cient to cover the costs of providing the services, and put the
tariff schedule into effect (with periodic modification to
reflect any cost increases) when the services are introduced

CARAJAS IRON PROJECT
The Carajas-Sao Luis Railway
General
1.        The new railroad line is being built in order to link the mines at
Carajas with the sea port at Sao Luis de Maranhon City.
2.        The basic technical characteristics of the rail line will be as
follows:
-    890 km of the main line with the safety standard of US Federal
Railroads, with two terminals (mine and port), four stations along
the line and 36 crossing loops.
-    single track, 1.60 meter gauge, 68 km/meter rails; 1,800 per km
treated wooden ties; 0.30 meter of ballast stone; standard switches.
-    63 bridges as a total of 11.3 km.
-    CTC (and ATC) signalling system (Centralized Control trains).
-    A main maintenance workshop at Sao Luis de Maranhon for locomotives,
wagons and permanent way equipment; and a medium size maintenance
workshop for the same purpose at Maraba City.
-    Diesel Electric locomotives (84 nos) 3000 HP, truck cc., weight
180 tons
-    Iron-ore wagons (2878 nos), standard design, with 98-ton capacity
and 120 tons of gross weight.
3.        The basic charcteristics of the operation of the line are as follows:
-    Iron-ore trains with 160 wagons and three diesel-electric locomo-
tives plus two helpers in the mountainous area (about 80 km).
-    Maximum speed of loaded train 65 km/hour.
-    Maximum speed of unloaded train 80 km/hour.
-    Gross weight of loaded train 19,200 tons.
-    Number of trains daily (two ways): eight plus three service trains.
-    Loaded trains from Carajas to Sao Luis Port:  20.77 hours
-    Unloaded trains from Port to the Mine:  12.36 hours.
-    Train loading at the Mine:  4 hours.
-    Train unloading at the Port:  5 hours.
-    Turn-around per train:  2.16 days.
-    Working days: 320 per year.
-    The personnel for the line operation will be 594 for train operations,
763 for maintenance of rolling stock, locomotives and equipment,
and 728 for maintenance of permanent way and infrastructure.
Status of Project at Appraisal
4.        Engineering design for the Railway has been done in great detail.
CVRD began the construction works two years ago in order to make as a first
stage the required embankment, bridges and viaducts, drains and headquarter
installation at Sao Luis de Maranhon. The total length of the line was divided
into 14 portions plus two terminals at the Mine and the Port. Each portion is



- 87 -
ANNEX 5-1
Page 2 of 6
being built by a contractor which is in charge of the required earthmoving,
bridges, culverts, drain improvements, and concrete protection walls. As a
result, along the total length of the line, the required infrastructure is
being made and the average of works already done is as follows:
-    Earthmoving along the line:  46%
-    Earthmoving at Sao Luis Port Terminal:  84%
-    Earthmoving at Carajas Mine Terminal:  0%
-    Bridges along the line:  35%
-    Tocantins Bridge (2.5 km):  10%
-    Culverts tubes along the line:  56%
-    Concrete protection walls along the line:  40%
-    Number of personnel involved as contractors, CVRD Inspectors
and Consultants: 15,682.
5.        The Tocantins Bridge construction has advanced considerably since
appraisal and inspection of designs and construction work by a Bank mission
confirmed the soundness of design and construction procedures.
6.        (a)  CVRD is controlling the construction works through a technical
team placed at Sao Luis de Maranhon and supported by the CVRD headquarter at
Rio de Janeiro and the technical team of the existing (Minas Gerais-Vitoria)
line. The CVRD construction team is supported by several consultant firms
specialized in each one of items included in the project, such as earthmoving,
bridges, drains, geologic study, topographic surveys, railroad project design,
signalling and telecommunications.
(b) The design of each section of the line is being reviewed during
the execution of the works in order to improve specific points as is being
done by consultant firms, which are at the same time supervising the contractors
together with the CVRD representative in the field.
(c) As a result of the above CVRD policy for the construction works,
several design improvements have been made as a result of experience, and in
general terms, all contractors are working on schedule and it is expected that
the goal of completing all the construction works according to the schedule
will be achieved.
Railway Construction Costs
7.        Details of Railway Construction and Investment Costs are given in
the table on the following page. The organization and procedures for the
identification and control of railway construction costs appear appropriate
and sound. The organization is such that work territories are realistic,
considering the environment. The assignment of headquarters and field respon-
sibilities enables a quick response and reaction to the needs of on-going
field activities as well as constant and accurate feed-back to support resources,
thus enabling a current evaluation of costs and design alternatives. Communica-
tions between headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and construction field coordinators
offices is by direct dial phone with practically 100% availability. Radio
communication is available and highly dependable between the field offices and
work locations. These facilities enable daily and frequent discussions of
plans, work schedules, possible alternatives and such other issues that might
affect the progress or costs of the work.

8.        Field Resident Engineers can authorize expenditures for special
work, e.g., landslide repairs, up to a specific level (about US$40,000) then
they must apply to the Field Construction Coordinators and they, in turn, to
headquarters when it exceeds their level of authority. All authorizations for
extra work or changes in work or volumes must be quickly communicated to
headquarers in any case. A rolling 3-month work program is maintained,
incorporating the changes brought about, plus experience which would affect
the costs, timing, design, etc.
9.        Evidence of control being exercised can be found throughout the
documentation examined by the mission. Three out of 15 contractors have been
penalized for delays in carrying out their work (up to December 31, 1981). In
1981 earthwork was reduced by approximately 10 million cubic meters with price
adjustments occurring in 14 of the 16 contracts (12 lower 2 higher). Physical
examination, on the ground at 6 locations and low fly-over by plane and
helicopter over the entire project revealed no obvious construction faults in
either the design or the work.
10.       The mission reviewed the main items of the capital cost estimate for
the railroad by examining unit costs for civil works, which are well researched
and reasonable in the Brazilian context, and by comparing equipment costs with
international levels. CVRD has already signed all required contracts for the
railway embankments, cuttings and bridges, and contractors have already completed
about 40% of the total scope of works to be done. These works have withstood
two rainy seasons and this year's record floods with clear safety margins.
Estimates for signalling and telecommunications are based on similar contracts
executed during the last five years on CVRDs Vitoria-Minas line. Traction
and rolling stock requirements have been estimated from traffic forecasts, and
operations, utilization and availability data based on performance on the
Vitoria-Minas line. Total estimates have been revised periodically to take
into account on-the-job experience, and since 1980 these revisions have
resulted in significant decreases in total costs. In sum, cost estimates
including physical contingencies are satisfactory. However, given the cost
overruns which have been encountered in major projects world-wide, it would be
prudent to include sensitivity analyses for 10% and 20% increases in total
costs.
11.       A detailed breakdown of the operating costs is given in the table on
the following page. Methods and procedures of the identification, recording
and preparation of CVRD railway operating costs were examined and found to be
reasonable and typical of practices used on other railways. Similar methods
and procedures will be used on the Carajas Line. Operating costs, without

Carajas Townsite Description
1.       CVRD is presently revising its housing plans for Carajas town to
accommodate an estimated 14,200 population, or about 4,000 more persons than
originally planned. This is due to an increase in estimated service workers
required by the town, based on an estimated requirement of 0.7 service workers
per basic worker which is consistent with the experience of single-industry,
free-standing towns in the Americas and Southeast Asia. While initially the
Company planned on a requirement for 1,706 dwellings, the number has increased
to 2,720 as shown in the following distribution by housing type. Housing
requirements for service workers are based on an average 1.3 workers per
household, and for basic workers 1.2 workers per household. The average
household size for service workers is 5.5 persons and for basic workers 5.0
persons.

b/  Financed in part by BNH.
2.       Of the additional 1,014 dwellings which CVRD is now including in its
plans to house additional service workers and their families, 930 yill be in
serviced lots, of which half will be of a minimum dimension (180 m ) to permit
the construction of an economical "core" unit for the lower-income service
workers. No additional land will need to be purchased because the lot sizes
will allow for increased densities to be achieved within existing urban
boundaries. The incremental cost is estimated to be marginal, consisting
mainly of additional utilities hook-ups. In planning and designing the town,
CVRD made use of its past experience with the Itabira township in the south.
3.       The Carajas town will be fully self-contained 2in terms of community
services and facilities. An Slementary school (3,740 m ) for 1,080 students
and secondary school (2,500 m ) will be built in accordance with agreements
with Brazilian school authorities. 1/ A modern hospital with a 100-bed
1/  Sites for three additional schools have been provided for the gradual
increase in school age population.

capacity will provide clinical, surgical, and emergency and general health care
services. Two supermarkets will be built to provide food and household
hardware. Twenty shops (88 m each) will be built for local enterprises, such
as bakeries, butchers, and clothing stores. Two social/recreational clubs are
planned (one is already completed), as well as a 40-room hotel and 500-seat
cinema/theater. The open space to be provided is being increased beyond the 2
ha per 1,000 population originally planned to provide more effective recreation
areas, especially for the teenage population. The network of parks and play-
grounds linked together by greenways will have bicycle and pedestrian pathways
so that children will be able to travel safely through the town. An industrial
service center of about 5.6 ha with expansion to 10 ha has been provided on
the southeast side of the town towards the airport. Maintenance and repair
shops as well as warehousing and storage areas will be provided.
4.        The town has been laid out on a grid network of roads--primary,
secondary and tertiary. CVRD is preparing a one-way traffic system on the
tertiary streets that will restrict "through" traffic. This one-way system
will provide a better definition to the hierarchy ,of superblocks and facilitate
vehicular circulation.
5.        Systems for potable water, sanitary sewage, storm drainage,
electricity, communications, public transportation, and garbage collection
will be installed and operating by the end of 1984. Guidelines have been
prepared for the treatment of the sanitary sewage with oxidation ponds,
velocity check-dams for the storm drainage, and a sanitary land fill for solid
waste disposal. For the first five years, CVRD will operate and maintain the
town services; thereafter, the Maraba municipal authorities, or a separate
municipal corporation, will take over responsibility in a phased manner. An
adequate tax base will be established to cover the cost of repairs, maintenance
and replacement of the municipal services and facilities.
6.        The Carajas town will continue to grow after 1988, particularly in
the service sector. Since free-standing new industrial towns in developing
countries experience a basic to service worker ratio of 1:2.5, Carajas can
expect to achieve at least a 1:1 ratio for the second-phase town development
up to the year 2000 and a population increase--of up to 4,000 people--related
to a modest increase in basic workers drawn by the development of other mining
activities in the area.
7.        The additional 6,000 population could be accommodated on the 80 ha
available to the town and through redensification of the apartment building
sites adjacent to the town center. The major portion of housing would be the
minimum standard "embryo" unit.
9.        In view of the importance of the planning and designing of the
town to meet the requirements of the expected growth in population, CVRD will
be asked to furnish its plans for the first and second-phase developments
(up to the year 2000) to the Bank for review and approval by no later than
September 30, 1982, and June 1, 1985, respectively.

CVRD's Environmental Management Program: Organization and Activities
Environmental Management Organization
1.        From the outset of preparation of the Carajas iron ore Project,
CVRD recognized and addressed environmental considerations relating to the
Project. In May 1972, CVRD assigned responsibility to its Buildings and
Projects Department (DEPEK) 1/ for environmental management of the Project;
and from 1972-81, more than a dozen environmentally-related studies 2/ were
commissioned by DEPEK, providing a foundation for environmental planning.
2.        As project preparation progressed and the scope of environmental
issues was better defined, greater emphasis was placed on environmental
management. In January 1981, CVRD created an environmental advisory group--
Grupo de Estudos e Assessoramento de Meio Ambiente (GEAMAM)--comprised
of eight senior independent experts 3/, to advise CVRD on all enviromental
aspects of the Company, and particularly the Carajas Project. The Executive
Secretary of the Group is CVRD's Technical Advisor, who reports directly to
GVRD's President and oversees DEPEK-s environmental activities.
3.        In June 1981, CVRD created an internal environmental commission
(Comissao Interna de Meio Ambiente (CIMA) lo aL.d at the mine site, staffed
by an experienced environmental management/Amazonian-applied ecology expert.
A second CIMA is being established at the port site with responsibility for
monitoring port operations, and appointment of its environmental officer is
expected by mid-1982. Located at both end3 of the Carajas railway, these
CIMAs will have joint responsibility for monitoring environmental aspects of
the railway component and will supervised by a senior environmental specialist
headquartered in Rio de Janeiro reporting to DEPEK.
1/   DEPEK (Departamento do Edificios e Projetos) is the Building and Projects
Department of SUCAR (Superintendencia de Implantacao do Projeto Carajas),
the Carajas Project Implementation Superintendency (para. 4.05).
2/   A list of these studies is available in the Project File.
3/   These experts are specialist in:  the Amazon, Amazon biology (2 spe-
cialists), climatology, conservation, geomorphology, soil science,
and tropical agronomy.

is responsible for advising on overall environmental policy and under its
terms of reference is charged with:
(a)  studying, discussing and proposing measures concerning the
rational use of natural resources and their conservation in
CVRD's areas;

6.        GEAMAM has prepared an "Environmental Management Manual" for all
of CVRD-s operations--including the Carajas Project and all future CVRD
projects in the Amazon region. This comprehensive manuals which is available
in the Project File, has been reviewed by the Bank and is satisfactory. GEAMAM
is also responsible for reviewing the project-specific activities of DEPEK and
the CIMAs, as well as advising on CVRD coordination with environmentally-
related government agencies. To date CVRD has worked closely with several of
these agencies at the national level and has made preliminary contacts with
others at the regional level. 1/
7.        DEPEK, at the supervisory level, has prepared detailed procedures
for environmental protection and management--including minimization of pol-
lution, dust, water and noise--which will be binding on all contractors for
the Project. The CIMAs, at the operational level, are responsible for over-
seeing the proper implementation of these procedures.
Environmental Activities
8.        In addition to its planned long-term cooperation with environment-
ally-related environmental agencies in areas summarized in para. 5, CVRD has
4 priority activities which it plans to complete by mid-1982. These are sum-
marized below and described in greater detail in the Project File.
9         Environmental Zoning.  The Ministry of Mines and Energy (DNPM)
undertook a resource survey resulting in a detailed map (1:250,000 scale)
of the Carajas region. Based on this survey and other data, CVRD is preparing
a 1:100,000 scale base map showing mineralized deposits, IBDF tracts, INCRA
areas, FUNAI reserves and other Amerindian-occupied areas. This zoning will
facilitate planning for appropriate land use, reduce the incidence of incompa-
tible activities and allow for systematic conservation of special tracts.
10.       Conservation Tracts and Biotic Inventories.  Based on the results of
the environmental zoning, CVRD plans to review the forest areas in the
concession and along the railway track in order to set aside conservation
1/   At the national level, these agencies include:  (i) the Federal Environ-
mental Secretariat (Secretaria Especial do Meio Ambiente: SEMA) respon-
sible for coordinating and supervising environmental aspects of all major
projects/activities in Brazil; (ii) the Brazilian Forestry Development
Institute (Instituto Brasileiro de Desenvolvimento Florestal: IBDF)
responsible for forestry and endangered species and which, together with
SEMA has undertaken an environmental reconnaissance of the Carajas region;
(iii) the National Research Council (Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas:
CNPq) which is undertaking biotic inventory of the Amazon region and the
Carajas area in particulr; (iv) the National Institute of Historic and
Artistic Patrimony (Instituto de Patrimonio Historico e Artistico
Nacional: IPHAN) which plans to undertake a five-year archeological
salvage and preservation project in the Carajas area; and (v) the National
Foundation for Indigenous Populations, Ministry of the Interior (Fundacao
Nacional do Indio: FUNAI) which is implementing protective measures for
the Amerindian communities impacted by the Project (Annex 5-4).

tracts where appropriate. CVRD has already acquired 20,000 ha for this
purpose. Biotic inventories are being carried out by the National Research
Council in areas where forest clearing is presently envisaged to allow pre-
servation where appropriate.
11.       Greenbelt Bufferzone.  GEAMAM has strongly recommended the creation
of a bufferzone to minimize the negative impact of the Project on the surround-
ing areas. As iron ore mineralization extends to the concession-s perimeter,
CVRD has requested expansion of the concession area to allow the establishment
of a bufferzone around the mining area. A similar bufferzone is planned along
the railway and at the port.
12.       Ecological Stations.  CVRD is eager to prevent unlawful exploitation
of the flora and fauna in the Project area and plans with the assistance of
IBDF, to establish guard posts in the bufferzone, to ensure adequate sur-
veillance of the area.

Brazil--Carajas Iron Ore Project
Carajas Amerindian Sub-Project 1/
A.   General
1.        Under Brazilian law, Amerindians are entitled to assistance and
protection aimed at ensuring their survival and gradual acculturation. 2/
It is part of this policy that the protection provided duly recognizes the
cultural distinctness of the Amerindians and their need, given their existing
economic system, for large areas of land. The most important parts of the
legislation are: (i) the guarantees regarding Amerindian land rights, and
(ii) the protection of native lands from squatters and other illegal trespass.
A more complete description of Brazilian Amerindian policies and the Amerindian
Sub-project (summarized below) is in the Project File.
2.        All Amerindians areas in the Carajas Project vicinity receive FUNAI 3/
assistance but experience budgetary constraints and problems related to the
recruitment, training, and retaining of staff, and to a lack of transport and
communication equipment. The large area size of some reserves and the numerous
outlying villages under the responsibility of individual Indian Posts make
adequate coverage almost impossible. All Indian lands, a total of 2,203,588
ha, have been defined by decrees and portarias. However, most lack field-level
demarcation and register in the "Servicio do Patrimonio da Uniao" (SPU). At
present, illicit intrusions on the lands are becoming more frequtI11L.  C;-!I.
in the region's natural environment and away :rom more nomadic to sedentary
ways of tribal life are causing health problems in connection with inadequate
water supply, nutrition and the poor quality of health care. 4/
3.        The objective of the Sub-project is to minimize immediate and
longer-term adverse impacts of accelerated regional development on Amerindians
in the area of influence of the Carajas Project. The Amerindian reserves
within this area are shown in the following table.
1/   "Projeto Ferro Carajas, Apoio as Comunidades Indigenas, Janeiro 1982"
prepared by FUNAI in January 1982 forms the basis for the Sub-project.
(Project File).
2/   The indigenous population of Brazil has its status and rights defined
in a body of legislation comprised of Article 198 of the Constitution
of 1969, the Indian Statute of 1973 (Law No. 6,001), and a series of
laws and decrees enacted between 1967 and 1980 which established and now
govern FUNAI.
3/   FUNAI, the National Indian Foundation and a government agency, was created
in 1967 and charged with the implementation of Amerindian policies and
regulation of all contacts with Amerindians.
4/   Amerindians in the Carajas area belong to nine different tribes, who have
traditionally lived fractured into small groups. The Carajas project
area spans the vast region in a radius of 100 km from the approximately
800 km long Carajas railway line and comprises very distinct ecological
zones. The culture, subsistence base, contact history and current degree
of acculturation of its Amerindian groups vary considerably.

4.                 The Sub-project will combine emergency and preventive action
programs, in response to possible threats to the physical and cultural survival
of the Amerindians posed by the construction of the railway line; by increases
in spontaneous settlement, mining and other extractive activities; and in
anticipation of future requirements to ensure viable and independent forms of
subsistence for the Amerindians. The Sub-project reflects FUNAI's philosophy
that the longer-term minimization of adverse impacts can be achieved through
substantial social and economic assistance to (i) create self-sustaining
living conditions inside the reserves now that would later compare favorably
to alternative lifestyles of the outside world, and (ii) provide Amerindians
with the education required to eventually deal on an equal basis with the
surrounding society.

6.             Amerindian Land Protection.  This is the responsibility of FUNAI-s
"Departamento Geral do Patrimonio Indigena" (DGPI), whose activities are
funded under FUNAI's regular budget. 1/ In conjunction with the Sub-project,
DGPI would be obliged to carry out any measures necessary to protect Amerindian
lands, such as (i) eviction of squatters and illegal trepassers from Indian
lands; (ii) safeguards against trepass, i.e., field-level demarcations, clear
marking of reserve borders and regular surveillance; (iii) redefinition,
decree and demarcation of the lands of the Guaja and Parakana Indians; (iv)
settlement of contested reserve borders and pending lawsuits; and (v) regis-
tration of all reserves with the SPU.
1/   Under the Bank-financed "Northwest Region Development Program's BR.364
Amerindian Protection Project, land activities are also funded out of
FUNAI's regular budget.

ANNEX 5-4
Page 4 of 6
7.        At present, the definition and protection of Amerindian lands
constitutes a major problem only in the cases of the unacculturated Guaja
Indians who are being attracted into the Caru Reserve; the Parakana Indians
who are currently being removed from their traditional lands, which will be
flooded for the Tucurui power dam, to a new area which is still under defini-
tion and lacks reserve status; and the Xikrin-Kayapo Indians whose Catete
Reserve is invaded by a large livestock and woodlogging enterprise.
8.        Under the Sub-project itself, the protection and surveillance of
Amerindian lands would be supported through:
(a) funding minor demarcation works inside the Catete, Parakana,
Sororo, Arariboia, Governador and Alto Turiacu reserves
(2% of total sub-project cost);
(b) substantial increases in the transportation and communication
facilities;
(c) increases in FUNAI staff and the establishment of observation
posts under the administration and Guaja "Protection" components;
and
(d) the acquisition of chain saws and other agricultural equipment
which might be used to maintain reserve border markings, under
the economic development component.
9.        For the future, however, increasing pressure on Amerindian lands
remains a matter of great concern. For the effective protection of Amerindian
lands, preventive action and early detection are essential.
10.       Health.  Expenditures for health, water supply, and (to a lesser
extent) housing and other social infrastructure works account for the largest
single share (28%) of total Sub-project cost. The Sub-project will:
(a) improve FUNAI's mobile health services, to provide better
immunization, curative and emergency services and dental
care. A new Mobile Health Unit (Equipe Volante de Saude, EVS)
will be staffed and equipped at the Maraba "Ajudancia", and the
operations of the existing Mobile Health Unit in Sao Luis will
be substantially upgraded by better equipment and operating
funds;
(b) establish "Casas do Indio" in Maraba and Sao Luis, to
accommodate Amerindians in need of prolonged treatment
together with caretaking family members;
(c) fund FUNAI contracts with local hospitals in Maraba and Sao
Luis for health services to Amerindians;
(d) upgrade health services at all 14 Indian Posts and their
outlying villages according to need, by the construction of



- 102 -
ANNEX 5-4
Page 5 of 6
infirmaries, the contracting of health attendants, special
budgetary allocations for drugs not supplied under the
government's "CEME" system, and by training courses extended
to paramedical staff; and
(e) provide potable water and upgrade hygiene and housing con-
ditions in large communities.
11.       FUNAI Administration.  The presence of knowledgeable and motivated
FUNAI staff at the Indian Posts is indispensable to protecting and assist-
ing Amerindian communities, and to the early detection and correction of
problems. In order to retain staff at isolated Indian Posts, it is necessary
to provide them with the means essential to the effective execution of their
work and with simple but acceptable living quarters. Both aspects are addressed
under the Sub-project: transport, communication and housing facilities will
be upgraded and field-level staff will be increased (24.5% of total Sub-project
cost).
12.       Economic Development Projects.  These projects (23% of total Sub-
project cost), together with accompanying investments in physical infrastruc-
ture and vehicles, are part of the long-term strategy to assist the Amerindians
in adding modern cultivation practices to their traditional subsistence activi-
ties, and in becoming economically independent. With modern agricultural
techniques, the large tracts of reserve lands would allow the Amerindians to
become self-sufficient in food production and to produce enough marketable
excess to finance the purchase of certain goods they have come to depend on
(e.g., firearms for hunting, metal tools, salt, sugar, kerosene, etc.). These
economic development projects will be carefully adapted to each community's
needs, cultural characteristics and environmental conditions, and, in the
cases of larger production schemes, to market conditions, and provide equip-
ment, inputs and technical assistance for agriculture, livestock, fruit and
other food production projects, or support to extractive activities (e.g.,
Brazil and-Babacu nut collection and processing), etc.
13.       Education.  The Sub-project will finance the construction and
staffing of additional schools in outlying villages and the development
of bilingual teaching programs (9.5% of total Sub-project cost).
14.       Guaja Indian Protection.  This protection is a major immediate
effort sponsored under the Sub-project (13% of total Sub-project cost). The
Guaja Indians live in very small bands in and around the Caru and the Alto
Turiacu reserves. For their subsistence, they depend mostly on hunting and
gathering. They are estimated to have a total remaining population of 40-60
individuals, not all of whom are yet in contact with the civilized world.
Health hazards, through common contagious diseases, contractable in uncon-
trolled contact with non-Indian populations, may threaten their survival.
FUNAI will therefore seek to contact and immunize the unknown Guaja bands,
whose movements have been reported by residents of the area, and to improve
the situation of the 26 Guaja Indians who were already contacted and attracted
into the Caru reserve in 1981. The latter, first contact with the Guaja has
had unfortunate preliminary results: the 26 Guaja are now grouped in small



- 103 -
ANNEX 5-4
Page 6 of 6
settlements along the southern border of the Caru reserve, immediately opposite
a major railway construction camp and next to a densely populated small town
area, while their contacts and health situation go uncontrolled by FUNAI
agents. FUNAI has begun to implement an emergency program, which will be
funded under the Sub-project, consisting of:
(a) the creation of a mobile team to assist the Guajas presently
in the vicinity of the railway project;
(b) designation of a "sertanista" (expert in the attraction of new
tribes), who could coordinate the entire Guaja protection
initiative;
(c) establishment and staffing of five temporary watchposts for
purposes of attracting the uncontacted bands; and
(d) creation of a new, permanent Indian Post for the Guaja, in
the very interior of the Caru reserve.
15.       Sub-project implementation would involve an annual iterative
planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation process. The Sub-project
was prepared with the active participation of the Amerindian communities and
of local FUNAI staff, but will require substantial fine tuning on the basis of
further anthropological studies, an analysis of potential changes in the
external environment, and--with regard to economic and infrastructure invest-
ment projects--further technical analysis and careful evaluations of first
results. Priorities in implementation--the protection of the physical survival
of Amerindians and of Amerindian lands--must be pursued consistently and will
be acceptable grounds for adjustments of the Sub-project as needed. The Bank
will receive semi-annual reports on Sub-project implementation and will be
able to comment on annual plans prior to their approval. In addition, Bank
staff will be entitled to supervise Sub-project implementation in the field,
always accompanied by a FUNAI agent.

Brazil--Carajas Iron Ore Project
Assumptions for Financial Projections
A.   CVRD Existing Operations
1.        Escalation.  To apply the appropriate escalator, the foreign and
local percentage of each projection item was estimated based on historic data
as well as the general results of the detailed study that was carried out for
Carajas (para. 10). The foreign/local split for the major items is shown
below.
Foreign and Local Portion of Selected Projection Items
Foreign           Local
Mineral Exports                         100                -
Domestic Mineral Sales                   -               100
Other Sales                             50                50
Operating Costs Minerals                 15               85
Operating Costs Services                 19               81
Investments in Fixed Assets             25                75
Contributions to Subsidiaries           35                65
Selling Expenses                        50                50
Administrative Expenses                  -               100
2.        Operating Cost.  All operating costs are based on 1981 data from
existing operations and take into account the projected physical volumes of
production and services. Operating costs for CVRD's own production of ore
and pellets, as well as the cost of services, have been increased by 1% p.a.
in real terms during the projection period, to reflect expected real cost
increases of electricity (1982-85) and fuel (1986-90). Purchase costs of ores
and pellets are assumed to increase in real terms in line with the price of
iron ore. Accordingly, they take into account the 1982 price increase, and
have been increased by 1.5% p.a. in real terms from 1986-90.
3.        Other Expenses.  Depreciation and amortization on revalued fixed
assets, interest during construction, and pre-production expenses are based on
the depreciation schedules applicable under Brazilian fiscal regulations.
Mineral extraction tax (IUM) has been calculated based on the applicable
rates, i.e. (i) for exports, 7.5% on 60% of the fob export price of the
previous year; and (ii) for domestic sales, 15% on 60% of the domestic fob
price.
4.        Debt Service.  Financial charges and principal repayment include
CVRD's existing long-term debt plus US$180.8 million of new non-Carajas debt
in 1982, of which US$79 million is from Banco Central for purchase of the
Chacrinha/Piriquito mines from Acesita. For calculation of the financial
charges on the some 50 loans, LIBOR, where applicable, has been assumed



- 110 -
Annex 8-1
Page 2 of 6
at 13%, 12%, 11%, and 10%, for 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985-90, respectively.
With respect to the revaluation of local long-term debt, it has been assumed
that the applicable ORTN index (the index according to which the Brazilian
Readjustable Treasury Bonds are revalued) will follow the exchange rate index,
in line with current Bank expectations. As a result, the US Dollar equivalent
of local long-term debt remains unchanged.
5.        Financial Income.  Projected financial income consists of (i) dividends
from subsidiaries (88%), and (ii) interest payments of subsidiaries on loans from
CVRD (12%), as shown in the table below.
Projected Financial Income, 1982-90
(US$ million--end-1981 constant terms)
1982-85      1986-90     Total       %
Dividends from Subsidiaries       20.8         182.5      203.3      88
Interest from Subsidiaries        23.3           4.8       28.1      12
Total                        44.1         187.3     231.4      100
Dividends from 1982-85 are expected to come mainly from DOCENAVE. The in-
creased dividends after 1985 are expected to come from CVRD's bauxite, alumina/
aluminum investments mainly from 1988 on (para. 8.15). Loans outstanding from
subsidiaries totalled about US$73 million at the end of 1981. Since CVRD does
not intend to make loans to its subsidiaries after 1981, interest payments by
the latter are projected to decrease from US$8.4 million in 1982 to US$0.3
million in 1990.
6.        Taxable Income.  Tax allowances include (i) depletion allowances,
equivalent to 20% of the IUM base (60% of the fob price) on CVRD's own produc-
tion (excluding purchases), according to Law-Decrees 1096/70 and 1779/80; (ii)
ore processing allowances for exports of pellets and exports of upgraded
itabirite ore according to Law-Decree 1240/72; and (iii) a "special exchange
variation" allowance related to the maxi-devaluation of December 1979, which
permits to deduct, over a period of five years, the exchange variations in
respect of assets and liabilities in foreign currency which exceeded the
variation of the nominal value of Brazilian Treasury Readjustable Bonds
(ORTN), according to Law-Decree 1733/79 of December 20, 1979. The taxable
income is further adjusted for (i) adding gains on investments in subsidiaries
and associated companies, (ii) adding exchange gains without billing, and (iii)
deducting monetary restatement on long-term loans.
7.        Income Tax.  Income tax has been calculated at 35% of taxable
income. Since actual payment of income taxes takes place about 6 months after
the end of the fiscal year and income tax is not subject to monetary restate-
ment during that period, the US Dollar equivalent of the income tax paid is



- 111 -
Annex 8-1
Page 3 oY 6
reduced in line with the nominal devaluation of the cruzeiro. Therefore, the
amount of income tax shown in the projected income statement and balance sheet
is higher than the amount shown in the funds flow statement. The difference
is credited to reserves.
8.        Dividends.  Dividends have been calculated at the minimum level
required by Brazilian Corporate Law, i.e. 25% on 95% of net income after tax
(5% is mandatory legal reserve). Like income tax, dividends are paid during
the following year and are not subject to monetary restatement. Accordingly,
the US Dollar equivalent of dividends shown in the projected balance sheet
is higher than that in the funds flow statement, and the difference is credited
to reserves.
9.        Working Capital.  CVRD's working capital requirements are based on
forecast current assets and liabilities as follows: (i) cash at 3% of operat-
ing costs; (ii) inventories at 37% of operating costs; (iii) accounts receiv-
able at 21% of sales revenues in 1982 (phasing in of 1982 price increase and
22% from 1983; and (iv) accounts payable at 25% of operating cost.
B.   Carajas
10.       Escalation.  To determine the foreign exchange content of materials
and equipment used for construction and operation of Carajas, CVRD had consult-
ants undertake a detailed study which was reviewed and found satisfactory by
Bank staff. Subsequently, foreign and local portions of capital, operating and
replacement costs were built up from the specific factors for individual
materials and equipment. The table below shows the local and foreign portions
of operating, capital and replacement cost items, according to which local and
foreign escalation have been calculated.

11.       Operating Costs.  Projected operating costs are based on the produc-
tion build-up given in para. 8.04 and assume (i) real price increases for fuel
of 2.9% p.a. from 1986-90, in line with current expectations; and (ii) real
price increases for electricity of 3% in 1982 and 5% p.a. from 1983-85,
reflecting the Brazilian policy objective to achieve a return of 10% on net
fixed assets in the power sector. These costs are expected to develop as
shown in the table below:

12.       Selling Expenses.  Carajas selling expenses have been calculated
at 1% of sales revenues.
13.       Taxes.  The projections include IUM tax at 7.5% of 60% of sales
revenues obtained by applying the price of the previous year. A IUM rebate
from the State of Para which receives 70% of the tax, has been taken into
account from 1985-89. The rebate totals US$74.7 million, and reimburses CVRD
for the estimated current capital cost of the road from Maraba to Carajas.
The projections also include social 1ax (PIS) at 0.75% of sales revenues.
Income taxes have not been calculated because Carajas enjoys a 10-year tax
exemption, as established by the Inter-Ministerial Council for the Greater
Carajas Program with Decree 01/81 of August 4, 1981.
14.       Depreciation.  The following depreciation periods have been applied:

ANNEX o-4
Page 1 of 7
Brazil--Carajas Iron Ore Project
Financial Rate of Return--Assumptions and Calculations
1.        The rate of return, both for the financial and economic return, have
been calculated on an incremental basis. The analysis compares cost/benefit
streams for a scenario "with" Project with the cost/benefit streams that would
have occurred "without" Project. The streams have been calculated in real
1982 terms through 2015.
2.        Real Devaluation of Cruzeiro.  Both scenarios take into account the
projected real devaluation of the Cruzeiro against the US Dollar, as described
in para. 8.22. Accordingly, local streams have been adjusted by the following
factors: 0.956 in 1982, 0.888 in 1983, and 0.877 from 1984 on. The breakdown
in foreign and local sub-streams is shown in the table below, in line with
para. 9 of Annex 8-1:
Foreign and Local Breakdown of Rate of Return Streams
Foreign             Local
Capital Costs                28                72
Working Capital              20                80
Replacements                 20                80
Operating Costs              30                70
3.        Cost Adjustment to 1982 Terms.  Since revenue streams are based on
1982 iron ore prices, whereas the original cost streams reflect end-1981 terms
the latter have been inflated to 1982 terms for the rate of return analysis.
A.   Scenario "With Project"
1.   Carajas
4.        Replacements.  The rate of return streams includes replacement
expenditures of US$1,093 million in 1982 real terms as follows: US$4 million
in 1989, US$339 million in each of 1990-99, US$613 million in each of 2000-09,
and US$137 million in each of 2010-15. The annual replacement expenditures
are based on detailed replacement schedules for equipments and works, that
were prepared by CVRD and reviewed by Bank staff during appraisal.
5.        Carajas Discount.  The Carajas discount has been applied for 24.7
million tpy of sinter feed from 1985-99, in line with the duration of the
contracts benefitting from the discount.

6.          Mineral Extraction Tax (IUM) Rebate.   The IUM rebate by the State of
Para for the cost of the road from Maraba to Carajas (para. 13 of Annex 8-1)
has been taken into account, totalling US$74 million from 1985-89.
7.          Expansion to 50 million tpy.   The expected timing, costs and
benefits of increasing the sales volume to 50 million tpy are shown in the
table below:

Capital Costs of Expansion                   7        114        153          97         -
Additional Working Capital                   2           1        -           10         38
Operating Costs                            225        228        228        238        302
Capital and operating costs of the expansion are based on detailed CVRD
estimates. Working capital is based on the assumptions given in para. 15 of
Annex 8-1. Sales revenues are based on (i) in 1992, 3.3 million tons of
pellet feed; (ii) from 1993, a product mix of 7 million of lumpy ore; 39.7
million of sinter feed; and 3.3 million of pellet feed, reflecting physical
production conditions; (iii) Carajas' prices without discount for the
additional sales volume; and (iv) pellet feed priced at 80% of sinter feed.
II. CVRD's Southern Operations
8.          Production Volume.   With Carajas coming on stream in 1985, the
following production schedules have been assumed for CVRD's southern
operations:        Production Schedule of CVRD's Southern Operations 'With" Project

a/  Mainly Piriquito and Chacrinha.

9.        The production pattern for the Caue mine reflects the decreasing
reserves and availability of hematite that have to be mixed with the itabirite
to produce the desired product mix of sinter fines and pellet feed in the Caue
concentrator. Remaining mineable hematite reserves in the Caue mines, about
90 million tons, will be depleted by 1994 if the hematite/itabirite mining
ratio is kept at an acceptable level (about 0.4:1). During 1983-87, the
Acesita deposits (mainly the Piriquito/Chacrinha mines), CVRD-s main strategic
hematite reserves in the South, will produce 18.5 million tons to enable CVRD
to meet the Caajas contractual obligations between 1985 and 1987 (para. 8.08).
It is further assumed that the Acesita deposits will continue to produce at
highest possible rate allowed for by the market and the physical constraints
in the Acesita mines as well as the maximum throughput possible in the Caue
beneficiation plant (32.5 million tpy). Thus, output from 1988 through 1993
from the Acesita deposits is 6 million tpy, the limiting factor for this
period being the market and that CVRD will not be able to increase its market
share. In 1993-94, production from the Acesita deposits will increase to 15.3
million tpy (i) to compensate the ceased hematite production from the Caue
mine and (ii) to reach maximum throughput of 32.5 million tpy in the Caue
beneficiation plant. CVRD's production in the Southern State will then peak
at about 80 million tpy during 1995 to 2002 and then gradualy drop to 48.6
million tpy by 2007 and onwards due to the depletion of the Acesita (year
2003), Timpopeba (year 2002) and Capanema (year 2006) deposits.
10.       Cost Streams.  Incremental capital costs for the production increases
at the already developed Piriquito/Chacrinha mines (Acesita deposits) have
been taken into account at US$87 million. Based on expected Minas Gerais
replacements in 1982, replacement costs have been calculated at US$0.64 per
annual production ton. Based on 1981 data from the Minas Gerais mines,
operating costs have been calculated at US$5.49 per ton. The streams include
IUM and income tax, calculated in line with the applicable Brazilian regula-
tions. Working capital has been calculated at US$3 per additional ton, in
line with the Carajas assumption.
11.       Revenue Stream.  Sales revenues have been calculated based on (i)
the projected real term prices for CVRD's Minas Gerais mines; (ii) a product
mix of 80% sinter feed and 20% lumpy ore; and (iii) applying the 3% Carajas
discount to the 18.5 million tons from the Piriquito/Chacrinha mines (Acesita
deposits) (para. 9). Out of these 18.5 million tons, 10 million tons are
assumed to be sold in 1985, 5 million in 1986 and 3.5 million in 1987, as
required by the Carajas start-up curve.
B.   Scenario "Without Project"
12.       Production Volume.  The following production schedules have been
assumed for CVRD's southern operations in the event that there would be no
Carajas:

a/   Acesita production in 1983-84 is assumed to be stockpiled and sold only in
1985 as the market strengthens.
13.        The "without" scenario assumes that the Acesita deposits are phased
into production at the highest possible rate allowed for by the market and the
physical constraints in the mining areas and the Caue beneficiation plant.
The market forecast (para. 3.21) indicates that an iron ore surplus on the
market will remain through the first half of the 1980s. Thus, it is assumed
that production from the Acesita deposits will be sold only from 1985 onwards.
In 1977, the hematite/itabirite mining ratio in the Caue mine was 0.35:1. The
1980 mining plan showed a decreased ratio, 0.31:1, for the remaining hematite
reserves. The 1981 plan indicated that Caue would have to produce at a ratio
of 0.43:1 in order to maintain the product mix which would imply that by the
mid-1980s an unacceptable ratio 0.23:1 would be at hand thereafter. To remedy
the latter situation the Caue mine will produce at an acceptable ratio up to
1985 when the hematite ores in the Acesita deposits will be phased in, at a
rate of 9.3 million tpy in 1986 to compensate for the low Caue ratio as well
as operating the Caue beneficiation plant at the maximum output of 32.5 million
tpy. The remaining hematite reserves in Caue, about 90 million tons at the
end of 1981, will be depleted by 1993, compensation for which will come from
additional production, 6 million tpy, in the Acesita deposits. Production from



- 125 -
ANNEX 8-4
Page 5 of 7
Conceicao mine as well as other small CVRD mines and purchases are expected to
remain constant throughout the period. For about 17 years, CVRD will be able
to sustain a production of about 80 million tpy. However, during the years
2003 to 2006 the Timbopeba, Acesita, and Capanema deposits will be depleted
and CVRD production in the South will drop to 48.6 million tpy in 2007 and
thereafter. The throughput of the Caue beneficiation plant cannot be increased
over the assumed 17.2 million tpy due to quality reasons (sinter feed) and
excess production of non-marketable pellet feed.
14.       Cost Streams.  The same assumptions as in the "with" case have been
applied.
15.       Revenue Streams.  The same prices as in the "with" case have been
applied, except for the Carajas discount, which has not been taken into
account.
C.   Rate of Return Streams
16.       In the process of calculating the incremental rate of return, those
portions of CVRD's southern operations that remain the same "with" and "without"
the Project, are eventually netted out. Consequently, the streams have been
calculated for (i) the costs and benefits resulting from the Acesita deposits
(mainly Piriquito/Chacrinha mines), which have very different production
profiles in the "with" and "without" case, and (ii) the production differences
between the "with" and "without" scenarios mainly in the Caue and Conceicao
mines from 1983-85.
17.       The financial cost/benefit streams "with" and "without" Project are
presented on the next two pages.
