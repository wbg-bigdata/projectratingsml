MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire for SDR 13.5 million, the equivalent of
US$20 million, on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, to help finance the Railway
Rehabilitation Project comprising rehabilitation of railway rolling stock and infrastructure,
which is part of a joint Railway Rehabilitation Progran with Burkina Faso. The proceeds of
the credit would be onlent to the Railway Patrimony Corporation, Socie'td Ivoirienne de
Gestion du Patrinoine Ferroviaire (SIPF), at 7.8 percent interest per annum, with 15 years
maturity including three years of grace period for equipment rehabilitation and grant terms for
infrastructure rehabilitation. Parallel co-financing of the project is expected in the amount of
US$20.8 million and the Concessionaire is contributing US$7.2 million to the project.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Cote d'Ivoire is one of the principal countries in the
CFA zone. Endowed with a good natural resource base, the country had a population of about
13 million and a GDP of US$9.3 billion in 1993. A rapid build-up of external debt in the
second half of the 1970s when prices for the country's main exports - coffee and cocoa -
peaked, saddled Cote d'Ivoire with the highest per capita debt in West Africa: in 1993, when
prices for these two commodities had fallen to half their earlier level, the country's public
external debt stood at about US$15 billion. High population growth, coupled with economic
decline, has reduced per capita GNP from more than US$1,000 equivalent in the early 1980s
to about US$515 equivalent in 1994. Due to mounting neglect of basic social services, social
indicators have been deteriorating significantly along with the decline in standards of living
over the past decade: recent estimates indicate that more than 60 percent of the population live
below the poverty line, compared to about 30 percent in the mid-1980s. A series of sector and
structural adjustment programs supported by the IMF, the Bank and IDA from 1989 onward
did not produce expected results, and GDP per capita contracted by a cumulative 18 percent
over the 1990-1993 period. In January 1994, Cote d'Ivoire, along with its partner countries in
the CFA zone, decided to complement its internal adjustment efforts with external adjustment
measures by realigning the parity of the CFA franc from 50 to 100 CFA francs to 1 FF.
3.    Results for 1994 were encouraging: compared to other CFA countries, Cote d'Ivoire
has managed the devaluation relatively well and registered its first positive growth (1.3
percent) in years. Government succeeded in bringing back inflation (0.3 percent/month in the
last quarter of 1994) to pre-devaluation levels within eight months following devaluation. This
was largely due to a restrictive wage policy (+ 10 percent of base wages on average) adopted
by Government and followed by the private sector. As regards fiscal policy, Government has
been able to meet revenue and expenditure targets set out in its Policy Framework Paper
(PFP), producing a primary surplus of about 1.5 percent of GDP. Preliminary data indicate
that export volumes increased by about 1 percent, while import volumes fell by some 11
percent. As a result, the trade surplus improved by some US$365 million. Production data
for the first three quarters of 1994 suggest a positive supply response following devaluation:
industrial production increased by about 3 percent overall, with significantly larger increases
for textiles and wood. But while Government succeeded in rapidly stabilizing the economy in
1994, it still needs to deepen structural reforms, especially in the areas of agriculture,
transport, the social sectors, and private sector development, all being addressed in IDA's
country assistance strategy for Cote d'Ivoire. The project addresses the dual objectives of
improved transport and private sector development.



-2-
4.     C6te d'Ivoire's transport sector absorbed massive investments during the mid-1970s
and the 1980s, not all of them economically justified. The country now has a road network of
some 68,000 km, of which 5,300 km are paved; two deep water ports in Abidjan and San
Pedro; three international airports (Abidjan, Bouake and Yamoussoukro) and 22 smaller
airfields serving regional centers; and a single-track international railway line connecting
Abidjan to Ouagadougou and Kaya (630/1,260 km in Cote d'Ivoire). A National Transport
Plan study was carried out in 1990, followed by a Bank sector review in 1991, which
identified major problems in investment planning, in the financing of infrastructure
maintenance, in the operation and management of the main public enterprises active in the
sector, and in the existing regulatory framework for transport activities. A proposed Transport
Sector Loan designed to address some of these problems was stalled over disagreements on the
scope of proposed reforms; preparation of a subsequently proposed Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Project has been slow, and the continued absence of decisive transport sector
reform has been increasingly damaging to Cote d'lvoire's competitiveness in external markets,
as well as to the efficient functioning of internal markets and to delivery of social services.
5.    Developments in the Railway Subsector. The railway, a 1,260 km single track metric
line constructed between 1904 and 1954 and connecting Abidjan and Ouagadougou, functioned
from 1960-1986 as a public corporation jointly owned and managed by Burkina Faso and Cote
d'Ivoire (Regie des Chemins de Fer Abidjan-Niger, RAN). Initially the favored mode for all
bulk transport between the coast and the Sahelian hinterland, the railways attained their
operational peak in the mid-seventies, when RAN transported close to a million tons of freight
and some 4 million passengers annually. In the late 1970s, operational and commercial
performance of RAN declined, while the road networks in the region improved and the port of
Lome emerged as a competitor to Abidjan for the Burkina traffic. With increasing competition
from a rapidly developing trucking industry, the share of traffic carried from the coast to
Burkina by rail and road re pectively reversed from two-thirds/one-third in the mid-1970s to
one-third/two-thirds in the late 1980s, turning an initially profitable railway into a loss-making
one.
6.    A 1982 Diagnostic Study of RAN (financed under a C6te d'Ivoire Technical Assistance
Loan) identified the company's major problems and proposed a detailed financial rehabilitation
plan. This was to be implemented over the 1984-1990 period, with the help of experienced
expatriate management, and supported by an IDA Railway Rehabilitation Project.
Disagreements between the two co-owners prevented adoption of this plan and led, in 1986, to
a decision to separate the railways into two national companies, Societe ivoirienne des chemins
defer (SICF) and Socidte des chemins defer du Burkina (SCFB); the two companies became
fully operational in 1989.  As was easily foreseeable, the separation exacerbated the
inefficiencies in the provision of rail transport services and led to more shifts of long distance
traffic to road transport. In an effort to stem and, if possible, reverse a trend that had reduced
international tonnage transported to less than 300,000 tons per year, the railway component of
the Burkina Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Program (Credit 2332-BUR), approved
by IDA in early 1992, required the establishment of a joint SCFB/SICF Office (Bureau de
Trafic International, BTI) responsible for handling all international freight traffic. Although
BTI had some initial success, traffic and revenue losses continued and it became clear that only
drastic restructuring could prevent the financial collapse of the two railway companies and
their subsequent liquidation.
7.     Consequently, in July 1992, the Governments of Burkina and Cote d'Ivoire announced
their decision in principle to reunify and privatize railway operations on the Abidjan-
Ouagadougou-Kaya axis, through a concession agreement to be signed with a private operator.
A commission comprising representatives of the Privatization Commissions of Cote d'Ivoire



-3-
and Burkina, the two ministries of transport, and of SICF and SCFB was set up to launch the
process.  The process was strongly supported by IDA both through the Cote d'Ivoire
Privatization Support Project and the Burkina Transport Sector Adjustment Program. Advice
and comments provided by IDA and co-donors' staff at the various stages of the process were
substantially taken into account and significantly improved the design of the concession. Bids
were launched in February 1993; bid award (to a consortium led by major freight-forwarders
operating in Western Africa) was made in July 1993; but it took seven negotiating sessions
over a one-and-a-half year period before a Concession Agreement acceptable to all partners
was signed on December 12, 1994. Effective take-over of operations by the Concessionaire
took place on August 21, 1995; by that time SCFB and SICF had been put into liquidation and
two new 'patrimony corporations' that hold the property of existing railway equipment and
manage railway infrastructure on behalf of the States had been created.
8.    The main features of the Concession Agreement are as follows: the concession is a
"rolling concession" covering 15 years initially, with successive five-year extensions possible
thereafter.  The concessionaire (SITARAIL) operates commercial freight and passenger
services in a fully-deregulated environment. SITARAIL maintains infrastructure and leased
motive power and rolling stock, the ownership of which remains with the two "patrimony
corporations",   SIPF and Societe de Gestion du Patrimoine Ferroviaire du Burkina
(SOPAFER). The concessionaire has rehired the personnel required (1,815) from among
existing railway staff (3,470, of which 1,370 in SCFB and 2,100 in SICF).  The two
Governments have paid severance payments to surplus staff not rehired by the private operator.
Rehabilitation investments are proposed by the concessionaire.   The two "patrimony
corporations" handle borrowing on behalf of the two Governments who, although responsible
for servicing the debt incurred both for infrastructure renewal and upgrading, and for
equipment rehabilitation and acquisition, will recover these debt service payments fully from
the concessionaire: the concession fee payable by the concessionaire to the Governments
comprises: (i) a percentage of the revenue earned by the concessionaire; (ii) equipment lease
payments; and (iii) debt service coverage on the railway rehabilitation investments. Third-
party rail service operators can be authorized after a 7-year exclusivity period.
9.     Project Rationale. The rationale for proceeding with the project is that substantial
reforms, fully consistent with IDA's country assistance strategy, have been decided on, and are
being implemented, in the railway subsector. Acceptable institutional arrangements, necessary
for re-establishing competitive and efficient rail services in the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor,
have been agreed upon by the two Governments and formally spelled out in the Concession
Agreement that was signed with a private operator in December 1994, the first such
arrangement in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of the necessary restructuring and reform
actions, earlier proposed projects were abandoned.  But within the framework of the
Concession Agreement, both the Burkina and the Cote d'Ivoire Governments have now agreed
to the essential preconditions for efficient railway operations in a manner satisfactory to IDA
and co-donors.
10.   Program and Project Objectives. The project constitutes part of the Ivorian component
of a larger program for the rehabilitation of the Abidjan/Ouagadougou/Kaya railway. The
Burkina part of the program, which has been appraised concurrently with the project, is also
fully financed (see para. 12 below). The main program and project objective is to contribute
to the revitalization of a major transport service and promoting competitiveness and regional
integration, by providing the financing necessary to carry out the long overdue emergency
rehabilitation of the publicly-owned railway assets. These will be managed and operated by
the private concessionaire, who needs the rehabilitation investments to enable it to provide
efficient quality service.



-4-
11.    Program and Project Description. The overall rehabilitation program, of which the
proposed project forms a part, is the first cross-country operation undertaken by the West
Central Africa Department, and the first in support of a railway to be operated by a private
concessionaire in Sub-Saharan Africa. The program will have two parts:
•  one in Cote d'lvoire (59 percent of program cost), for the rehabilitation of railway
equipment (motive power and rolling stock) owned by SIPF, and of railway
infrastructure situated on Ivorian territory, for which financing will be channeled
through SIPF, under the project, and
*  one in Burkina (41 percent of program cost), for the rehabilitation of railway
equipment (motive power and rolling stock) owned by SOPAFER, and of railway
infrastructure situated on the Burkinabe territory, for which financing will be
channeled through SOPAFER, under similar arrangements.
12.   Program and Project Financing. Besides IDA, the program will be co-financed by
Caisse Fran,aise de De'veloppement (CFD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the West
African Development Bank (BOAD) and the Administration G&dnrale pour la Cooperation et
le Developpement (AGCD, Belgium). The program has been appraised by all co-financiers in
April/May 1995. The financing plan envisages that CFD, EIB, BOAD and AGCD finance
around US$44 million equivalent, with some US$23 million going to the Burkina part of the
program and some US$21 million to the Cote d'Ivoire part. IDA would finance some US$26
million equivalent, with some US$6 million for the Burkina part and some US$20 million for
the Cote d'lvoire part. The concessionaire's contribution to the program amounts to some
US$11 million equivalent and will cover part of the local cost of civil works (labor, transport,
insurance, etc.). Estimated program and project costs and the plan for financing them are
summarized in SCHEDULE A. The IDA portion of the C6te d'Ivoire part of the program is
financed by the project. IDA funds will be onlent to the patrimony corporation SIPF at 7.8
percent interest per annum and 15 years maturity including a 3-year grace period for the
motive power, rolling stock and telecommunication components, and at grant terms for
infrastructure rehabilitation. Procurement arrangements and the estimated disbursement
schedule for the proposed Credit are shown in SCHEDULE C. The IDA portion of the
Burkina part of the program will be financed through a reallocation of funds already available
under the Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Credit (Cr. 2332-BUR). The respective
amendment of the Credit Agreement has been made in July 1995; a Subsidiary Financing
Agreement will be concluded between Government and the patrimony corporation (SOPAFER)
for the amounts onlent, with terms and conditions the same as those for SIPF. Reimbursement
of all loan/credit funds will be the responsibility of the patrimony corporations on behalf of
Government, but will be fully recovered from SITARAIL through its payments of the
dedicated part of the concession fee (see para. 7 above) to both SIPF and SOPAFER.
13.   Program and Project Implementation. The project will be implemented, over a four-
year period, by the concessionary company SITARAIL (acting as a "maitre d'oeuvre d'legue")
on behalf of the two patrimony corporations SOPAFER and SIPF.  The bulk of the
rehabilitation investments will be made within the first 24 months of the program period.
Project implementation will be supervised by a Monitoring Committee set up by the conceding
parties. A Project Implementation Manual specifying performance indicators to be monitored
during project execution was discussed during negotiations.
14.   Program and Project Sustainability. Prospects for project sustainability are good.
Based on conservative traffic and financial projections, the private operator would start making



-5-
a modest profit from year 5 of operation, when the rehabilitation program is expected to be
fully implemented. The Concession Agreement covers a period of 15 years initially, and is
extendible thereafter for five-year intervals. The private concessionaire will have the freedom
to adapt to changing economic circumstances rapidly and decisively, while the owners maintain
basic oversight rights to ensure fair competition between rail and road transport services.
15.   Lessons from Previous Bank/lIDA Involvement.  Although IDA, between 1968 and
1985, financed some eight loans and credits in the road subsector and one loan in the rail
subsector in Cote d'Ivoire, there has been a ten-year hiatus in lending due mainly to slow
progress on sectoral reforms needed to make proposed investments sustainable. The proposed
project is therefore IDA's first operation in the transport sector since the Second Highway
Sector Loan, approved in 1985 and closed in 1990. Over the past two years, substantial
reforms have been agreed to and implemented in the railway subsector (see paras. 6-7 above):
institutional arrangements necessary for re-establishing competitive and efficient rail services in
the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor have been agreed upon by the Governments of C6te
d'Ivoire and Burkina, and these arrangements have been formalized in a Concession
Agreement signed with the private operator in December 1994, which became effective on
August 20, 1995.
16.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed arrangement for the operation of rail
transport services is fully consistent with the private sector development objectives of IDA's
country' assistance strategy (CAS) for both Cote d'Ivoire (discussed by the Board on June 7,
1994) and Burkina (discussed by the Board on May 31, 1994):  the two Governments
disengage from a major economic activity, which will henceforth be carried out by a private
operator. Financing of the rehabilitation investments through the publicly owned patrimony
corporations, but with debt service payments fully recovered from the concessionary company,
is considered an acceptable arrangement, since the private sector is not willing, in the
prevailing context, to take all investment risks. As indicated in paras. 5-8 above, IDA has
been promoting reform and rehabilitation of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou railway for well over a
decade, since rail has a demonstrable competitive advantage over road transport for certain
types of traffic and can therefore play an important role in making the economies of both
Burkina and of Cote d'Ivoire more efficient. However, in the absence of the necessary
restructuring and reform actions, earlier proposed projects were abandoned.  Within the
framework of the present Concession Agreement, the Governments of both Burkina and Cote
d'Ivoire have now agreed to the essential preconditions for efficient railway operations in a
manner satisfactory to IDA and co-donors. Efficient rail services for freight transport will
improve the competitiveness of the economies of C6te d'Ivoire and Burkina, and regional
integration between Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina will be significantly strengthened. In addition,
operating deficits of SICF and SCFB, which were borne by Government budgets, will be
eliminated.
17.   Agreed Actions. Rules for review by SIPF of procurement decisions prepared by
SITARAIL were agreed during appraisal. The two Governments have made available, as
agreed, sufficient budgetary resources for covering compensation payments which have been
paid to redundant staff. Credit effectiveness will be conditioned by the publication of the
Decree approving the agreement between the State and SIPF on arrangements for management
of railway assets by SIPF, the adoption of the Implementation Manual specifying procurement,
monitoring and reporting procedures, the selection of an independent auditor for the project,
by authorization or ratification of the Project Agreement by SIPF of the Subsidiary Financing
Agreement between the State and SIPF, and of the SITARAIL Implementation Agreement, and
by effectiveness of the CFD and EIB loans.



-6-
18.    Environmental Aspects. The bulk of the operations of the project concern rehabilitation
of rolling stock and of existing rail infrastructure (replacement of rail and sleepers on portions
of the existing track, reballasting, and repair of some bridges and culverts).   These
rehabilitation works are unlikely to impact negatively on the environment; they will, however,
be monitored by the Ministry in charge of the Environment. Workshop rehabilitation will
introduce environmentally acceptable methods of industrial waste disposal. The Concessionaire
agreed during negotiations to have some of its staff trained in environmental assessment and
auditing to avoid negative environmental impacts during rehabilitation and future operation.
19.    Poverty Category. Not applicable.
20.    Participatory Approach. The project is the result of a three-year process leading from
the decision in principle by the Governments of Burkina and C6te d'lvoire to privatize railway
operations on the Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Kaya line, through fifteen negotiation sessions with
the designated private operator, to effectiveness of the Concession Agreement and
establishment of the two patrimony corporations. Throughout this essentially country-driven
process, IDA and other co-financiers of the program participated in bringing the privatization
initiative to fruition through a series of joint working sessions including examination of
privatization experiences elsewhere, through regular exchanges with personnel of the existing
rail companies, through regular review of draft contractual documents, and finally through
mobilization of financing for the rehabilitation program.
21.    Project Benefits. Main quantified project benefits are reduced transport costs on long
distance bulk and container traffic, for which efficiently operated rail services have an
economic advantage over road transport and can offer cheaper and reliable service. Based on
these expected benefits, the most likely economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is
estimated at 23 percent. (Results of the sensitivity analysis are in SCHEDULE B; they show
that the ERR would still attain 15 percent if only 75 percent of the conservative traffic
forecasts were realized).  Additional, although non-quantified, benefits will result from
expected development of the mining sector in Burkina (manganese, zinc), which will be helped
substantially by the existence of reliable rail service; from more efficient handling of
international traffic by the private operator, and from improved regional integration through
joint operation of the two countries' railway assets. Also, implementation of the Concession
Agreement preserves an important infrastructural asset and is expected to return rail transport
from a heavily subsidized activity to a commercially profitable one.
22.    Risks. Project risks are manageable and would result mainly from delays in attracting
back traffic from road transport. However, the concessionaire has competent personnel and
managerial independence in carrying out the program on behalf of the patrimony companies,
and has a financial interest in doing so rapidly and thoroughly. An efficiently run railway
should have no difficulty to attract back from road transport in the competing corridors the
heavy, long-distance traffic its predecessors have lost due to poor operational and commercial
performance. Traffic forecasts underlying the proposed investment program are conservative
(500,000 tpy of "base" freight traffic by the end of the first three-year period, compared to
RAN traffic of 600,000 tpy in the mid-eighties when service levels were already deteriorating).
This reflects the assumption that road transport services, that have been underpriced due to the
excess road transport capacity built through indirect subsidization in the 1980 drought years,
will only gradually be priced at their correct level, as existing equipment attains the end of its
useful life and equipment renewal at current prices becomes necessary.

23.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Internal Rate of Return                       23%                       12%
Main Assumptions:
Private operation of railway activity by private concessionaire SITARAIL in a deregulated
environment
*   Discount rate: 12%
*   Real exchange rate constant
*   For SITARAIL costs equal to equity participation plus concession fee. Benefits equal to Net
operating Result + Concession Fee.
Note: Financial projections presented by the private concessionaire, SITARAIL, were a basis for financial
negotiations with the Government and are considered very conservative.
Sensitivity Analysis:
Economic Rate of return reduced to
*   16% if projected traffic increase delayed by two years
*   15 % if traffic is only 75 % of projected traffic
*   17% if new traffic (clinker, manganese) does not materialize
*   16% if investment costs increase by 25 %.
Nature of Benefits
Reduction of freight transport costs through switch from road to rail (low costs of rail is largely due to
private operation of the railway).
Main Beneficiaries
Freight shippers, mainly for international shipments between CMte d'lvoire and Burkina
Indirectly, all of society (mostly in Burkina), through lower costs of transport for imports and exports

Cote d'Ivoire - Implementation Issues
Portfolio
During FY95, four IDA credits were approved by the Board, totaling US$303.4 million. They
included the Economic Recovery Credit (US$100 million completed by a supplemental credit
of US$77.9 million under the Fifth Dimension program), the Municipal Support credit (US$40
million), the Export Promotion and Diversification credit (US$5.8 million) and the Private
Sector Energy (US$79.7 million).
During FY95, two IBRD investment projects (Municipal Development and Pilot Women in
Development) and three IDA adjustment credits were closed (Economic Recovery, Human
Resources Adjustment, and Regulatory Reform). By the end of FY95, the active portfolio
consisted of nine IDA credits and two IBRD loans with an undisbursed balance of US$283.8
million.
Project implementation
A Country Portfolio Performance Review was organized in December 1994. In close
collaboration with the Ivorian authorities, an action plan was agreed upon to improve project
implementation. In this context, more time was allocated by Bank staff for supervision of
investment projects (19.4 staffweeks in FY95 compared to 17.0 staffweeks in FY94). In
addition, the Resident Mission is increasing its participation in project supervision.
