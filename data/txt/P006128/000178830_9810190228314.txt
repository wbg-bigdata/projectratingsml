2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum on Bolivia" (1546-BO) dated
March 23, 1977, was distributed to the Executive Directors. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Despite the increasing importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains one of the
poorest countries in South America. The majority of its population is engaged
in traditional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force is employed
in the modern sectors. The infrastructure is primitive and the road and rail
networks cover only a fraction of the country. The combination of strong tra-
ditional ties within the indigenous communities and geographic, health and
educational obstacles to population mobility has perpetuated the demographic
concentration on the inhospitable 3-4 thousand meter plateau, the Altiplano.
About half of Bolivia's population lives a physically, culturally and econo-
mically isolated subsistence existence in this region, which is rich in
mineral deposits but limited in agricultural potential.
4.        The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual structure
which had characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times and to deprive
the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This objective was
only partially achieved. Progress was made in eradicating feudal relations,
distributing the land and eliminating obstacles to social mobility. The

Introduction
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum on Bolivia" (1546-BO) dated
March 23, 1977, was distributed to the Executive Directors. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Despite the increasing importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains one of the
poorest countries in South America. The majority of its population is engaged
in traditional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force is employed

-3-
as a result of substantially higher loan disbursements to the public sector
and increased foreign investment associated with hydrocarbon exploration.
As a result, foreign exchange reserves rose by a record US$124 million.
7.        The extreme dependence of the Bolivian economy on its foreign sector
was once more brought into focus in 1975 and early 1976 as, with world eco-
nomic recession, the country's terms of trade deteriorated and export volumes
declined. Itineral exports fell by well over 20% as the weighted average of
mineral prices declined by approximately 13%, and shipments of most minerals
fell as a direct result of the recession and the unloading of speculative
stock on international markets. The situation was exacerbated by the fact
that exportable surpluses of crude petroleum were significantly reduced for
the second year in a row due to falling production and rapidly rising domestic
consumption of hydrocarbon derivatives. While the export picture was helped
by a significant price increase for natural gas exports to Argentina, this
could not compensate for the overall decline in export earnings. On the
whole, merchandise exports in 1975 declined by 16%. On the other hand, growth
of GDP and investment continued unabated as imports rose by about 36% in the
wake of the start-up of new public investment projects and the liberalization
of imports for consumer durables and motor cars earlier in the year. As a
result, the balance-of-payments current account shifted from a surplus of
US$150 million in 1974 to a deficit of US$190 million in 1975. Despite
further substantial increases in disbursements of medium-term loans to the
public sector, net foreign exchange reserves fell by US$54 million to US$134
million, or about 2.5 months of imports. The weakening of the balance of
payments was accompanied by a deterioration of the fiscal situation. The
Central Government's current surplus decreased to just about 1.7% of GDP,
after reaching 2.6% in 1974, and increased borrowing from external resources
and the domestic banking system was necessary to finance growing public invest-
ment. However, some public utilities strengthened their financial situation
due to increased rates.
8.        The authorities, reacting to the weakening of the external accounts,
took action late in 1975 to tighten trade restrictions. This resulted in a
significant reduction of import growth to only 2.0% during 1976. This, toge-
ther with a recovery in mineral prices and overall merchandise exports, helped
reduce the current account deficit by about US$50 million. At the same time,
Bolivia continued to attract substantial external capital inflows which
enabled it to finance the current account deficit and recoup the foreign
exchange reserves lost the preceding year. Conservative incomes policies
applied since 1974 have resulted in a reduction of inflation to an annual
rate of about 14%.
9.        Economic growth prospects over the medium- to longer-term depend
on the Government's ability to increase savings and stimulate investments
particularly those for developing hydrocarbon, mineral and agricultural
resources. Investment in minLng and hydrocarbons is accelerating. Inten-
sified exploration for hydrocarbons by the state-owned petroleum company and
private foreign companies is underway and may lead to significantly increased



-4-
production and exports of crude petroleum and natural gas, which could permit
an acceleration of economic growth towards the end of the decade. Recent
exploration results have been fairly positive, i.e. a new oil field with
immediate commercial potential was discovered at Montecristo near Santa Cruz
and a private foreign concern made a gas strike in the Abapo-Izozog region in
the southeast of the country. Fiscal performance has remained weak during
the last two years, with the Central Government performance being adversely
affected by the deficits of decentralized agencies and state-owned enterprises.
However, the authorities are beginning to implement mining and income tax
reforms so as to improve the yields, efficiency and equity of the tax system.
Debt Service and Creditworthiness
10.       Bolivia's external debt outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1976
amounted to US$1.0 billion. Service on external debt amounted to 18.8% of
exports of goods and non-factor services net of investment income abroad.
Average terms of external debt have worsened as 46% of the newly contracted
public debt over the last two years has been from commercial banks.    Between
1971 and 1976, average maturity has declined from 24 years to 14 years while
the average interest rate has increased from about 4.4% to 7% and the grant
element has fallen from 36% to 17%.   Because of the heavy investment require-
ments associated with development of the mining and hydrocarbon sectors and
the large import content of these investments, Bolivia's trade gap and current
account deficit can be expected to rise for the remainder of this decade.
As a consequence, the debt service ratio is expected to increase to about 24%
by 1980. However, as investments in these sectors come to fruition, exports
will accelerate and import requirements of investment will decline. A gradual
fall in the debt service ratio is therefore likely in the 1980s. In view of
the nature and growing size of Bolivia's debt, prudence in selecting and
utilizing external capital will have to be an essential element of debt
management.
11.       Bolivia enjoys a substantial resource base in agriculture, minerals
and hydrocarbons, which has to be developed to sustain rapid economic growth
and, in particular, to achieve a rapid expansion of export earnings in the
foreseeable future. If production in the export sectors, particularly mining
and hydrocarbons, can be increased and prices for major export products remain
adequate, Bolivia can be considered creditworthy for moderate amounts of
external lending on conventional terms. Nevertheless, some additional lending
on soft terms (available from the Inter-American Development Bank's Fund for
Special Operations and the USAID) is justified by Bolivia's poverty and its
large and continuing external capital requirements. The country will require
substantial external financing of investment to supplement the domestic
savings effort at least until the early 1980s. The Government, in pursuing
its progressive development policies, is making a serious effort to mobilize
domestic resources and has prepared its first five-year economic plan. Imple-
mentation of the underlying investment program will rcquire external assis-
tance for high priority projects in excess of the foreign exchange component.
Although substantially increased suppliers' a.d financial credits will prob-
ably become available, prudent debt management requires that they should cover



- 5 -
not more than about a third of the public capital inflows needed during
1977-80 for meeting a GDP growth target of 6% annually. The remainder
should be obtained on softer terms from bilateral and international develop-
ment financing agencies, including the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
12.       Although Bolivia is an original member of the Bank, it did not
obtain any Bank Group funds until 1964. Bolivia's tight budget constraints
and restricted capacity to service external debt had limited Bank Group
assistance until recently. Apart from a US$23.3 million Bank loan for a gas
pipeline, Bank Group operations until FY75 were exclusively through IDA.
Following Bolivia's emergence as a natural gas and petroleum exporter, albeit
on a limited scale, IDA's lending was phased out with the Agricultural Credit
I Project in June, 1975. By February 28, 1977, the Bank Group had approved
18 operations for Bolivia amounting to US$184.9 million, of which eight
have been fully disbursed. Net of undisbursed balances, Bolivia's debt to the
Bank and IDA in 1975/76 represented 7.9% of its public debt. The Bank's share
of the service on this debt is about 4%. Both figures are expected to increase
marginally by 1980.
13.       Bank Group lending to Bolivia has assisted in the development of
various sectors. US$27.2 million have been for agriculture where our lending
has helped the Government to initiate long term progress for the development
of a viable livestock industry, to increase agricultural production and to
improve living conditions on the Altiplano, as well as to strengthen the Banco
Agricola as a development institution. The five loans for power projects,
totalling US$53.4 million, have been instrumental in modernizing the sector,
expanding electricity services, stabilizing the electricity supply and setting
up a regulatory agency. Also, a public power company was set up which has
been operated in an efficient and financially sound manner. Two railway loans
totalling US$40.0 million, of which US$3.3 million were cancelled when ENFE
obtained funds from bilateral sources to purchase locomotives, have helped to
improve the quality of management, efficiency of operations and financial
condition of the national railways. Three operations, for a total of US$28.2
million, for medium- and small-size mining aim at increased production and
improved sectoral coordination. A loan for a water supply and sewerage
project of US$11.5 million is expected to improve services in the main mining
cities and 70 rural communities. A recently approved loan of US$15 million
for an education and vocational training project would assist Bolivia to
develop its human resources in a more effective and rational way. Finally,
the proposed project and an aviation development project, also being con-
sidered by the Executive Directors, will assist Bolivia's efforts to develop
agriculture in hitherto isolated areas and to provide efficient freight and
passenger transportation.



-6-
14.       Because of the narrow scope for private investment, IFC became
active in Bolivia only in 1973 through an investment of US$400,000 in a
firm producing cables and plastic products. With expanding opportunities
for private investment, however, IFC has most recently agreed to take an
equity participation of up to US$550,000 in Banco Industrial S.A. (BISA) in
conjunction with a Bank loan of US$10.0 million for the same institution to
assist in financing medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises, and
US$337,500 in Banco Hipotecario Nacional to assist in the development of
mortgage banking. The two IFC investments aim at contributing to the esta-
blishment of a local market for long-term securities. Annex II contains a
summary statement of the status of Bank Group operations in Bolivia as of
March 31, 1977, and notes on the status of ongoing projects.
15.       Remarkable progress has been made in achieving the goals set for
Bank lending to Bolivia. On the macro-economic level, the Government has made
important strides towards formulating a coherent and consistent set of overall
economic policies. On the sector and project level, public services have been
improved and the institutions strengthened. The financial positions of the
railroads and power sectors compare favorably with that of similar entities
in otlher developing countries. Also, during the last two years, the Govern-
ment has established an excellent record in providing the required counterpart
funds for Bank financed projects. Future Bank lending will continue to support
Government efforts to establish infrastructure necessary for sustained economic
development while simultaneously improving the distribution of the benefits of
economic growth. In this context, Bank activities will focus on the less
developed regions and the lower income strata of the population. At present
two projects are at an advanced stage of processing:    an urban project to
finance urban upgrading, sites and services, employment generation schemes and
supporting social infrastructure; and an agricultural project for the develop-
ment of alpaca/llama husbandry to assist subsistence farmers in the Altiplano
and improve their living standards. For the more distant future, further Bank
projects in irrigation, agroindustries, highway maintenance, railways, electric
energy, forestry, industry and mining are under consideration.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
16.       Bolivia has an area of 1.1 million km2, which can be roughly divided
into the barren highlands "Altiplano" in the western part of the country,
where most of the country's population lives, the central valleys in the mid-
west, and the sparsely populated lowlands to the east and north. High trans-
port infrastructure costs, caused by difficult topography and sparse popu-
lation distribution, make it necessary to use special care in determining the
most appropriate modes of transportation and in selecting investment projects.



-7-
Transport Modes
17.       Bolivia's transportation infrastructure is relatively under-developed.
The major transport modes have played, by and large, complementary roles to
meet particular requirements:   railroads, to haul most of Bolivia's export
trade of bulky mineral products; domestic aviation, to transport passengers
and perishable goods, in particular beef; highways, to carry mostly domestic
freight and passengers; and waterways, to provide access to otherwise isolated
towns and villages.   The main features of the transport modes are discussed
below, except for railways which are treated separately in paragraphs 24-28.
18.       Highways.  The present road system consists of about 37,600 km of
highways of which 1,170 km (3%) are paved; 6,560 km (17%) are gravel and the
remainder, 29,830 km (80%), are unimproved earth roads. The most important
part of the network is located in the western and southern highlands and
valleys, which occupy one-third of the country and are inhabited by 84% of
the population. In contrast, the lowlands of the northern and eastern regions
are serviced only by a few low standard roads.
19.       Waterways.   The river transport system is made up of an extensive
network of inland waterways located in the eastern and northern parts of
Bolivia, measuring about 1,-600 km. Minimum channel depths vary from 1.0 to
3.5 m, with seasonal variations of up to 9.0 m. The system consists of five
main waterways and represents the only available transport mode in vast areas
of the sparsely populated northeastern part of the country.    Lake transport is
limited to Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world, which
provides an alternative transport corridor to the Pacific Ocean through the
Peruvian lake port of Puno, and from there by rail and road to the seaports of
Matarani and Mollendo. In terms of ton-km of freight traffic, lake traffic is
more important than river traffic.
20.       Aviation.   Air transport is a vital means of communication, despite
its relatively high cost, and is likely to remain so for a long time, due
to the topography and low population density of the country.    There are approxi-
mately 300 airports in the country, but only 30 have scheduled service provided
by Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), the almost totally government-owned airline.
Airports at the four major cities--La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Trinidad--
account for more than 80% of the regular passenger and 70% of the cargo traffic.
Demand for air transport has increased rapidly during the recent past. Annual
growth rates of 14.5% of domestic passenger traffic over the last five years,
made possible through the introduction of new aircraft, has been concentrated
in the four major airports. One of the main objectives of the proposed aviation
project would be to facilitate further growth in domestic air transport by
adding two airports for jet aircraft and two smaller all-weather airports for
turbo-prop aircraft.
21.       Pipelines.  The state oil company operates 2,462 km of oil pipelines
and 754 km of gas pipelines. The oil pipelines connect the major production
fields near Santa Cruz to the Pacific seaport of Arica and to the Argentine
border. The Bank-financed natural gas pipeline (Loan 635-BO) conveys gas to



-8-
Argentina.  Depending on the success of intensive exiloration 6ff6tts now
underway and the confirmation of identified reserves; significanit new pipe-
line construction, especially to Brazil, may be undertaken.
Transport Planning and Coordinatinii
22.       Transport planning anid co6tdination in Bolivia have historically
been weak. In recognition of this deficiency and the substantial invest-
ments required to upgrade the transport system in line with Bolivia's economic
development, a National Transport Survey for Bolivia, financed by UNDP with
the Bank acting as Executing Agency, was completed in 1969. It proposed a
program for integrated transport development over the following ten years and
among other things recommended the creation of a Directorate of Planning and
Coordination which is now in the Mlinistry of Transportatidni, Communication ahd
Civil Aviation (MTCCA). In 1972, the Bank assisted in the preparation of
terms of reference for a UNDP-financed technical assistance program to streng-
theh the Direct6rate. The ptogram 'was cancelled in 1976, after partial imple-
metitation, due to lack of UNDP funds.  In order to obtain better information
on transport facilities and equipment, the Government decided to update the
National Transport Survey and has requested financial and technical support
from the Bank. The proposed loan includes the financing for the foreign
exchange cost of consultant services for the Survey and the implementation of
its policy recommendations (paragraph 36).
23.       The Government's main transport strategy underlying its five-year
(1976-1980) developmen't plat are as fdllows:  continued rehabilitation and
mfiddetri{zation of the -raiiway, syste-m, idirbveinent and expansion of the road
netiwok to serve high priority sectors in the economy; modernization of air
transport through improvement and re-equipment of infrastructure, parti-
cularly in the north and northeast; and expansion of the river and lake
fleet and improvement of river navigation and port facilities on Lake
Titicaca. The five-year development plan calls for investments totalling
US$475 million in projects already started and consists of US$266 million for
highways, US$107 million for railways and US$102 million for aviation. The
foreign exchange component is estimated to be about 62% of the total cost.
Additional projects with a total cost of US$439 million are under study. A
separate plan is being prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons for
the development of pipelines for the transport of natural gas and petroleum.
The Government is currently reviewing these and other investment programs to
ensure that they are within its financial capabilities and implementing capac-
ity. The Government is considering, in this context, the eventual construc-
tion of a highway, estimated to cost about US$125 million, between Santa Cruz
and Corumba on the Brazilian border, practically parallel to the existing
railway line between these cities.   In view of the possible uneconomic dupli-
cation of investments, the Government would refrain from constructing this
highway until it had carried out an adequate study to determine its economic
justification and the Bank had had the opportunity to comment on the study
(Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).



-9-
Railway Subsector
24.       Except for petroleum and natural gas, most of Bolivia's freight for
external trade, as well as a significant part of its domestic freight and
passenger traffic, is transported by the railways. The railway system
consists of about 3,500 km of meter-gauge railway lines (see Map) operated by
ENFE except for the line from Machacamarca to Uncia (105 km) which is operated
by COMIIBOL, the Government mining enterprise. The railways consist of two
separate systems, the Western and the Eastern Systems, which are linked only
by a long indirect route through Argentina. Railway traffic increased substan-
tially between 1966 and 1976. Passenger traffic increased from 205 million
passenger-km in 1966 to 370 million passenger-km in 1976 (6.1% per year),
while freight traffic increased from 265 million ton-km in 1966 to 520 million
ton-km in 1976 (7.0% per year). Because of the newness of the system and the
rapid economic growth of the region that it serves, traffic on the Eastern
System has increased between 1966 and 1976 at a remarkable pace of 15% per
year for passengers and 27% per year for freight. Through 1981, freight
traffic is projected to increase at about 3.7% per year on the Western System
and 9.0% per year on the Eastern System; passenger traffic would increase by
3.6% per year on the Western System and 10% per year on the Eastern System.
25.       The IJestern System was built between 1870 and 1920, largely to
serve the needs of the mining industry to transport mineral products to the
ports on the Pacific coast. The system consists of about 2,100 km of rail-
way lines, linking the miain towns in the southwestern part of the country and
providing access to the ports of Matarani in Peru, Arica and Antofagasta in
Chile, and (via Villazon) to the ports in Argentina. About 63% of the freight
traffic on the Western System consists of traffic for external trade.
26.       The Eastern System which was built during the 1950s consists of two
major lines totalling about 1,180 km.    The Santa Cruz-Corumba line (643 km)
connects with the Brazilian system, and the Santa Cruz-Yacuiba line (539 km)
connects with the Argentine system. The railways are the only significant
mode of surface transport in Eastern Bolivia, where most of the agricultural
exports such as cotton, timber and sugar originate. About 85% of the traffic
on the Eastern System consists of traffic for external trade.
27.       In accordance with a 1967 agreement between the Governments of
Argentina and Bolivia, an extension to the Eastern System, from Santa Cruz to
the north, is being built by an Argentine-Bolivian Joint Commission. To
date, a stretch of 104 km between Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa has been built and
transferred to ENIFE. The two Governments recently decided to phase out the
Joint Commission in the next few months, when the line reaches Yapacani. The
Government would not start construction of any further extension of the line
beyond Yapacani before carefully studying its economic justification. The
Bank would comment on the selection of the consultants for the economic study
and would also review and como.ent on its results (Section 3.04(a) and (b) of
the draft Guarantee Agreement).



- 10 -
28.       An ongoing preliminary feasibility study, carried out by Brazilian
and Bolivian experts, for the inter-connection of the Eastern and Western
Systems, is expected to be ready by mid-1977. The Government would refrain
from making investments in this inter-connection before carrying out an
adequate study demponstrating its economic justification and the Bank had had
an opportunity to comment on the study (Section 3.05 of the draft Guarantee
Agreement).
Past Bank and IDA Projects
29.       Following its creation in 1964, ENFE suffered from many managerial,
financial and technical problems caused by badly maintained and overage
equipment, inexperienced management, inadequate staff training, excess
staff and an inadequate tariff structure. The technical assistance program
financed by UNDP, which began in 1969, sought to solve these problems. The
program, administered by the Bank, retained a team of French consultants
(SOFRERAIL) which prepared a five-year (1973-77) investment and rehabilitation
program which provided the basis for the First Railway Project in 1972. An
IDA credit of US$8 million (Credit 346-BO) financed the foreign exchange
component of the project, consisting of rolling stock, diesel shunting locomo-
tives, spare parts, machine tools and materials for track rehabilitation.
However, due to a sharp increase in international prices, the investment
program could not be fully implemented.
30.       In 1974, ENFE updated and extended the five-year investment plan to
coyer the period 1975-79. The Secon4 Railway Project, financed by the Bank
(Loan 1121-BO) with a loan of US$32 m'lNlion, consisted of the first two years
of this program.   In addition to the procurement deferred from the first
project, the second project sought to improve the quality of ENFE's operations
through track rehabilitation, related civil works, procurement and installa-
tion of telecommunications equipment, and the purchase of cars and locomotives.
The loan was later reduced to US$28.7 million when ENFE obtained a loan of
US$3.3 million from a bilateral source for the procurement of diesel locomotives.
31.       The first two railway projects also included measures to improve the
financial condition of ENFE and to introduce modern engineering, commercial
and managerial methods to its operations. As a result, ENFE's operations have
improved significantly. Initial difficulties in executing the investment
program (longer than expected lead time for deliveries, disastrous effects of
a flood in January 1974, scarcity of financial and material reserves) have
been overcome and good progress is being achieved. Except for track rehab-
ilitation, the financial and operational targets of the second loan, included
in ENFE's Action Program for 1975 and 1976, have been reached or surpassed.
For example, actual working ratio for 1976 was 79% compared with the target of
85% and the actual average daily run of diesel locomotives reached 423 km
compared with the target of 410 km.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Bolivia
in October/November 1976. A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Railway
Project," No. 1466b-BO dated April 29, 1977 is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is presented in Annex
III. Negotiations were held in Washington on April 7-8, 1977. The Government
delegation was headed by Ing. Mario Antezana, Undersecretary of Transport,
MTCCA, and the ENFE delegation was headed by Ing. Armando Murillo, Investment
Manager.
Project Description
33.       ENFE's third investment plan covering the period 1977-1981 comple-
ments the investments under the two previous plans with its emphasis on track
rehabilitation. Investments in each category of the plan are well balanced
and justified.    ENFE would not make any major changes in the plan without the
agreement of the Government and the Bank (Section 4.05(c) of the draft Loan
Agreement). The main part of the proposed project consists of investments in
the above plan to be committed in 1977 and 1978 and technical assistance to
ENFE mostly at the operational level. Also, in order to provide timely
assistance to Government in its efforts to improve transport planning and
coordination and to make effective use of scarce resources in the transport
sector, the project includes the updating of the National Transport Survey,
the implementation of its policy recomendations, and technical assistance for
highway maintenance.
34.       The proposed Bank loan would finance equipment and tools for
rehabilitation of the track including earth moving equipment, telecommunica-
tions equipment, equipment and materials for marshalling yards, freight cars,
parts and repair units for locomotives, ferrobuses, freight and passenger cars
and equipment and machine tools for workshops. Technical assistance to ENFE
includes experts to train ENFE's personnel in modern operational and adminis-
trative railway procedures. Consultant services would also be provided for
the updating of the National Transport Survey and its implementation and for
the technical assistance for highway maintenance; loan funds of US$2.0 million
allocated for these services would be transferred from ENFE to Government
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.02 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
35.       Because of the importance of the institution building aspect of the
National Transport Survey, the disbursement of the loan funds allocated for
the Survey would be contingent upon the Government's assigning counterparts on
a full-time basis to the consultants (Section 2.03(d) (i) of the draft Loan
Agreement and Schedule 1, paragraph 4(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). The
Government would also make arrangements so that at least five of these counter-
parts would remain in the Directorate of Planning and Coordination of tITCCA
after the completion of the survey (Section 2.03(d) (ii) of the draft Guarantee
Agreement). There is a possibility that UNDP may be able to finance part of
the updating of the National Transport Survey and all of the implementation
phase, in which case these items would be carried out as a Bank-executed UNDP
project.

Project Cost and Financing
36.       Based on March 1977 prices, the cost of the proposed project is
estimated to be US$55.7 million with a foreign exchange component of US$35.0
million.  ENFE's investments and technical assistance, net of contingencies,
are estimated to cost US$44.6 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$28.7 million. The consultant services for the transport survey, its
implementation, and the highway maintenance program are estimated to cost
US$2.6 million with a foreign exchange component of US$2.0 million. To these
estimates are added physical contingencies calculated at 5% for local cost
items and 1% for foreign cost items, and price contingencies calculated as
follows: for local costs, 8.4% for 1977, 8.0% for 1978, 7.4% for 1979 and
7.0% thereafter; for foreign costs, 7.5% for 1977 through 1979 and 7.0%
thereafter. Details of project cost items are shown in Annex III. The
cost of consultant services for ENFE (200 man-months) has been estimated at
about US$9,000 per man-month and is based on the cost of consultants
currently retained by ENFE; those for the transport survey and its implemen-
tation (200 man-months) and the highway maintenance program (72 man-months)
have been estimated at a rate of about US$8,000 per man-month. The proposed
Bank loan of US$35 million would finance the foreign expenditures for imported
goods and technical assistance, while funds for local expenditure would derive
from ENFE's internal cash generation and from Government contributions. It
is noted that during the period 1977-1981, ENFE would require financial
resources of US$145.1 million, of which 78% would be for investments and the
remainder mostly for debt service. The needed funds for the period 1977-1981
would derive 35% from INFE's internal cash generation, 19% from the proposed
Bank,loan, 11% from the ongoing Bank loan (1121-BO), 7% from Government, 13%
from bilateral sources already contracted and the remaining 15% from foreign
sources yet to be arranged.
The Borrower
37.       ENFE was founded in 1964 to take over the main trunk lines of the
Western System formerly owned by the Bolivian Railway Company (owned by
British shareholders), and the branch lines owned by the Government. In 1967,
the Eastern lines were also transferred to ENFE's ownership. In 1974, as part
of an agreement with Peru, ENFE took over the Guaaui-La Paz line (96 km).     In
March 1976, the Santa Cruz-Santa Rosa line (104 km), built by the Argentine-
Bolivian Joint Commission, was handed over to ENFE.
38.       ENFE is governed by a Board of Directors chaired by the Minister
of Transport, Communications and Civil Aviation. The other six members of
the Board are representatives of the Ministries of Transport (1), Industry
and Commerce and Ifining and Metallurgy (1), National Planning Council (1),
Labor (2) and the General Manager (non-voting). The General Manager is
appointed by the President of the Republic and acts as chief executive and
refers most policy decisions to the Board.
39.       Until the end of 1974, EIFE went through a difficult period arising
from consolidation, management reorganization and mounting financial prob-
lems. In January 1975, the Government took important measures to strengthen



- 13 -
ENFE by appointing a new and energetic General Manager, giving him unprece-
dented backing, reducing union participation in the management and authorizing
a series of cost reduction measures.
40.       While the Western System has achieved good progress in operations
due to the various measures initiated under the previous project, the Eastern
System has not progressed as much, notably in track rehabilitation, due to the
lack of effectiveness of the eastern management. The Government recently
provided the Bank with a realistic plan of action for improving the management
of the Eastern System.
41.       In accordance with Bank loan conditions for the Second Railway Proj-
ect, ENFE has undertaken a staff reduction program, mainly through attrition.
The number of ENFE's total employees decreased from 6,401 in 1973 to 6,047 in
1976 and is expected to decrease further to 5,740 by 1981. The main problem
with ENFE's staff now is not that of quantity, however, but of quality. The
salary levels did not permit ENFE to adequately recruit and retain its engi-
neers and technicians, especially in the context of an acute shortage of
skilled personnel in Bolivia. The Government recently authorized ENFE to
improve wages for engineers and technicians and to recruit young engineers by
offering them the possibility of a career in the railways. ENFE will also
utilize the training facilities of the National Manpower Development Service
(FOMO), an agency supported by a recent Bank loan, for the training of its
employees, especially the technicians and mechanics.
42.       Substantial tariff increases combined with higher volumes of traffic
in recent years have increased ENFE's revenues significantly. Since 1975,
ENFE has been able to generate net revenues, to pay all debt service charges
and even to reduce Government contributions for investments. ENFE's operating
ratio has surpassed the target for 1975 set at the time of appraisal of the
Second Railway Project (Loan 1121-BO). In order to maintain its present sound
financial condition, ENFE would not incur any debt with a term of over one year
without the Bank's agreement unless net cash generated from operations in
the year when such debt was incurred was at least 1.5 times debt service
requirements (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). The Government would
provide ENFE with additional funds, should the need arise, to carry out the
project (Section 2.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). In order to protect
ENFE's financial condition, the finances of the Santa Cruz-Yapacani railway
and any addition to it (paragraph 27) would be kept separately and Government
would reimburse ENFE for any losses from the operation of the line. Any
additional cost for upgrading this line to ENFE's operational standards would
be financed by the Government (Section 3.04(c), (d) and (e) of the draft
Guarantee Agreement).
43.       ENFE's current accounting system is satisfactory.   As agreed in the
Second Railway Project, ENFE would have its accounts and financial statements
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and furnish certified
copies not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year starting
from 1977 (Section 5.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). ENFE would also revalue
its fixed assets at least once every three years and thereafter provide promptly
to the Bank a full report prepared by independent auditors (Section 5.04 of the
draft Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
Tariffs
44.       The present rate policy is to relate tariffs to operating costs.
Whenever there is a need to increase tariffs, ENFE submits the proposal to
MTCCA for approval. In 1975, freight rates covered full costs while passenger
fares covered marginal costs fully on the Eastern System but only about 95% of
marginal costs on the Western System. In February 1977, Government approved
ENFE's request to raise passenger fares by an average of 10%. ENFE also
started, in 1976, sales promotion activities to attract more traffic by
providing discounts for higher volumes of freight traffic. The results of
this approach has been fruitful.
45.       The present tariff structure would provide a rate of return on net
fixed assets of 1.3% on revalued assets in 1977 and 2.1% in 1981. These
rates are considered satisfactory because (a) they show that ENFE is able to
transfer the cost of railway service to the users on a sound commercial basis;
(b) they enable ENFE to meet most of its financial needs; and (c) they de-
crease the burden on the national budget. These rates of return are based on
expected reduction in ENFE's operating costs by about 17%.    Whenever there is
reasonable cause to believe that, because of rising costs, ENFE would not be
able to meet the financial goals specified in the revised Action Program
(paragraph 46), ENFE would promptly take all actions, including tariff increases,
necessary to attain such goals (Section 5.06 of the draft Loan Agreement and
Section 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement.)
Project Execution
46.       ENFE would carry out the project, except for the items to be carried
out by Government consisting of the updating of the National Transport Survey
and its implementation phase and the technical assistance for highway main-
tenance. ENFE would carry out the civil works for the Western System under
force account while the civil works for the Eastern System is expected to be
carried out by local contractors under ENFE's supervision. The progress
achieved by ENFE's management and staff in the execution of the First and
Second Railway Projects indicates that ENFE is well qualified to execute this
project. Based on the good result achieved under the earlier Action Program
(paragraph 31), a revised Action Program for the period 1977-1981, designed to
expand and improve on the earlier one, has been prepared. For example, under
the revised Program, working ratio would gradually improve from 78% in 1977 to
73% in 1981, operating ratio from 95% to 91%, freight car availability from
86% to 92% and the average daily run of diesel locomotives would reach the
maximum distance of 450 km as early as 1978. It is expected that during the
implementation of the proposed project, ENFE, with the assistance of consult-
ants, would be able to achieve the targets of the revised Action Program and
thereby achieve the objectives of the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
47.       ENFE would award contracts for goods estimated to cost less than the
equivalent of US$50,000 but more than US$5,000, after soliciting quotations
from at least three suppliers, up to a total of US$500,000. Coods estimated



- 15 -
to cost less than US$5,000 could be purchased under local procurement proce-
dures. Also, with the Bank's approval, ENFE would procure certain critical
spare parts on the basis of direct purchase from the original equipment
manufacturers (Schedule 4, paragraph B of the draft Loan Agreement). All
other goods financed under the proposed loan would be procured under inter-
national competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Local
bidders would be granted a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable
customs duties, whichever is lower.
48.       Disbursement from the Bank loan would be made against appropriate
documentation for 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods and for
technical assistance. As shown in Annex III, most of the disbursement would
take place during Bank FY78 and FY79. The loan is scheduled to be fully
disbursed during the second quarter of FY81.
Project Benefits and Risks
49.       ENFE's Investment Plan (1977-1981) is a coordinated program of rehab-
ilitation and modernization designed to enable the railways to efficiently carry
the traffic which has been forecast for the period. If the Investment Plan
were not implemented, declining quality of service and diminishing capability
to move traffic would result in diversions to more expensive road transport
and, in areas where roads do not exist, in the failure of traffic to move
at all. The main benefits of the Investment Plan are the avoidance of (a)
higher railroad operating costs for traffic that would remain on the railroad;
(b) higher costs of transporting by road the freight and passenger traffic
diverted from railroads; and (c) losses to the economy where the railway is
the only means of transportation. Benefits not quantified in the economic
evaluation include: reduced accident costs, reduced inventory costs for goods
in transit, reduced breakage and spoilage of cargo, and savings from elimina-
tion of railway closures due to bad weather; the evaluation performed is there-
fore conservative. The economic rate of return for the Investment Plan as a
whole, based on the costs, including physical contingencies and replacement
costs, and on quantified benefits, would be 18%.
50.       ENFE is well qualified to implement the project and the risks of
the project from the technical point of view are no greater than those normal
for projects of this type. Although significant delays in project implemen-
tation were encountered during the execution of the First Railway Project,
these were partly beyond the control of ENFE's management or the Government.
The delays were relatively quickly overcome and considerable progress has been
achieved under the Second Railway Project. Careful preparation of the scope
of the present project and the new Action Program which takes into account
ENFE's capacity for project execution are expected to minimize any potential
causes of delays in project execution. The project is not expected to have
any adverse environmental effects.
51.       The justification for the investments in the Western System depends
on the continued flow of traffic on the Arica-La Paz line. In the recent
past, the Chilean section (Arica-Charana) has not been adequately maintained
and there is a risk that the traffic on the line would be impeded if the



- 16 -
line were not kept in an adequate operating condition. Hence, failure to keep
the line in an adequate operating condition would be an event of suspension
regarding the loan funds allocated for the Western System (Section 6.01(b) of
the draft Loan Agreement). The Bolivian authorities recently informed the
Bank that their negotiations with the Chilean National Railways for the ade-
quate maintenance and operation of the Arica-Charana Section were progressing
smoothly and that they hoped to reach agreement by mid-1977. We have been
assured by ENFE that it would use its best efforts to conclude such an arrange-
ment expeditiously.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and ENFE, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Features of
the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special interest are referred to in
paragraphs 23, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35, 42, 43, 45, 47 and 51 of this report.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of March 31, 1977)
Credit 261-BO - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million,
June 25, 1971; Effective Date: September 15, 1971; Closing Date: June 30,
1977
After implementation slowed down in 1974, the project is now pro-
ceeding as scheduled and the credit should be fully disbursed by the Closing
Date.
Credit 433-BO - Third ENDE Power Project, US$6 million, October 17, 1973;
Effective Date: December 11, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project was initially delayed due to unexpectedly long delivery
time for the gas turbines originally planned to be installed at Santa Cruz.
Cost overruns are estimated at about 34% over the original estimates, but this
does not significantly affect the economic justification of the project. ENDE
will finance the overruns with its own funds.
Credit 455-BO - Mining Credit Project, US$6.2 million, January 18, 1974;
Effective Date: June 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is proceeding as scheduled and the credit should be
fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Credit 561-BO - Agricultural Credit I, US$7.5 million, June 20, 1975;
Effective Date: December 15, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is proceeding as scheduled.
Loan 1121-BO - Second Railway Project, US$28.7 million, June 5, 1975;
Effective Date: August 6, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The Borrower has arranged bilateral financing for locomotives in
the project and in accordance with the understanding reached with the Bank,
the loan amount has been reduced from $32 million to $28.7 million. Project
progress has been satisfactory with performance targets either having been
attained or exceeded.
Loan 1211-BO - Ingavi Rural Development Project, US$9.5 million, March 8,
1976; Effective Date: October 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is proceeding as scheduled.

Effective Date: August 23, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project is proceeding as scheduled.
Loan 1290-BO - Banco Industrial Mining and Industrial Credit Project,
US$10 million, October 15, 1976; Effective Date: April 14, 1977; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
The project is proceeding as scheduled.
Loan 1324-BO - Urban and Rural Communities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$11.5 million, October 15, 1976; Effective Date: December 20, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
The project is proceeding as scheduled.
Loan 1331-BO - Small-Scale Mining Development Project, US$12 million, October
15, 1976; Effective Date:                  ; Closing Date:  December 31, 1980
The terminal date-for the effectiveness of this loan, originally
January 13, 1977, has been postponed to May 16, 1977 to allow additional time
for the Borrower to select consultants for the technical assistance component
of the project. The loan is expected to become effective soon.

SECTION III - Special Conditions
1.   Government would refrain from constructing the highway linking
Santa Cruz with Corumba until it had carried out an adequate
study to determine its economic justification and the Bank had
had an opportunity to comment on the study (paragraph 23).
2.   Government would not start construction of any further extension
of the Santa Cruz-Yapacani railway line beyond Yapacani before
carefully studying its economic justification. The Bank would
comment on the selection of the consultants for the economic
study and would also review and comment on its results
(paragraph 27).
3.   Government would refrain from making investments in the inter-
connection of the Eastern and Western Systems before carrying
out an adequate study demonstrating its economic justification
and the Bank had had an opportunity to comment on the study
(paragraph 28).
1/   This project has been prepared as a follow-up project to the
Second Railway Project (Loan 1121-BO) of June 5, 1975.



ANNEX IV
Page 2
4.   ENFE would not make any major changes in the Investment
Plan (1977-1981) without the agreement of the Government
and the Bank (paragraph 33).
5.   Government would assign counterparts on a full-time
basis to the consultants employed to assist in the carrying
out of the updating of the National Transport Survey
(Condition of disbursement of funds for the updating of
the National Transport Survey - paragraph 35).
6.   Government would make arrangements so that at least
five of the counterparts referred to in 5. above, would
remain in the Directorate of Planning and Coordination of
MTCCA after the completion of the survey (paragraph 35).
7.   The finances of the Santa Cruz-Yapacani railway and any
addition to it would be kept separately and Government
would reimburse ENFE for any losses from the operation
of the line. Any additional cost for upgrading this
line to ENFE's operational standards would be financed
by the Government-(paragraph 42).
8.   ENFE would revalue its fixed assets at least once every
three years and thereafter provide promptly to the Bank
a full report prepared by independent auditors (paragraph 43).
9.   Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that, because
of rising costs, ENFE would not be able to meet the financial
goals specified in the Action Program, ENFE would promptly
take all actions, including tariff increases, necessary
to attain such goals (paragraph 45).
10.   Failure to keep the Ariza-La Paz line in an adequate
operating condition would be an event of suspension
regarding the loan funds allocated for the Western System
(paragraph 51).
