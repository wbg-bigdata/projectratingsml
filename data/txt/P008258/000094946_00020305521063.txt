3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
(a) Assist the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) and transport organizations to adopt
market based transport policies, (b) accommodate the expected growth of road traffic by rehabilitating and
completing/extending main roads and by improving their maintenance and safety, (c) develop the domestic
contracting industry and increase employment, (d) improve operations, finances, and safety at the main port
of Durres, and (e) determine the future role of Albanian railways. (*) Cofinancing - Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development finances (100%) the Port of Durres civil works and equipment (US$6.4m eq. under
appraisal, increased to US$8.7 m eq. October 1993).
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
(a) Rehabilitation (64 Im), completion and construction (19 Icm) of main roads; (b) improvement of road
maintenance in the Tirana District through provision of equipment and spare parts; (c) repair of quays and
port surfaces, provision of equipment and spare parts for the Port of Durres; (d) technical assistance and
training for (i) National Roads Department (NRD, later General Roads Directorate, GRD) to implement
the project, (ii) MTC to make investment decisions on the basis of economic criteria, to further privatize the
road transport and construction industries, to reorganize MTC, and to adopt market-based regulations,
taxes and user charges, and (iii) Port of Durres Authority (PDA) to improve operations, productivity and
safety, establish an autonomous port authority, improve port finances, and develop a manpower plan; and
(e) studies to (i) improve road safety, (ii) prepare a master Plan for the Port of Durres, and (iii) determine
the future role of the Albanian railways.
3.3 Revised Components:
Component (a) was modified as follows: one planned road rehabilitation contract was deleted
because of engineering design problems and higher costs than anticipated at appraisal. This reduced
the road length to be rehabilitated to 36 1am; the scope of rehabilitation of Librazhd - Qafe Thane
road was changed to include the construction of 10 bridges instead of paving the road and
transferred the paving to the National Roads project (Cr. 2888-AL); rehabilitation of the Kashar-
Tirana railway section was added in 1996 in order to complete the rehabilitation of the main
Tirana - Durres railway link, initiated and funded by Italy, for modem
and safe (at 80 lmph) operation using the savings from the road rehabilitation works and a
favorable US$/SDR exchange rate. The choice of this link was consistent with the priorities
identified in the railway study.

3.4 Quality at Entry:
Satisfactory
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The objectives of the project were achieved. The qualifications that follow must be viewed against the
perspective that this was the Bank's first transport project in democratic Albania after long isolation,
centralized governance and management, and rudimentary institutions.
Through technical assistance, ministries responsible for transport matters, their administrative departments,
and service delivery organizations are being modernized. In the road sector, NRD was changed from a
government department to a directorate (GRD) with some autonomy. GRD is responsible for planning and
supervision, and, for the time being, routine maintenance, while the private consulting and construction
industry are slowly taking over the service delivery functions. Previously, policy formulation, planning and
design, management, and implementation of works were in five separate, state-owned, poorly funded
departments or companies. There now is a functioning ministry responsible for policy and regulation, and a
road directorate responsible for planning and management. Five private consulting companies and twelve
private construction companies have emerged, initially in cooperation with foreign companies. Mechanized
road maintenance was begun in the province of Tirana under the project. It included a study of required
equipment, especially for emergency and winter maintenance, training of staff, and a laboratory.
GRD staff were trained in the economic and financial evaluation of projects, procurement, modem asphalt
techniques, and pavement and bridge design. There also was a six month training course, in Tirana, on
preparation and appraisal of projects for transport sector professionals.
Technical assistance helped MTC, later combined and transformed to Ministry of Industry, Transport and
Trade (MITT), then to Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), and recently again divided into
Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Public Works (MPW), refocus its mission from production
to policy and regulation. A comprehensive road safety study was completed with a cooperative
implementation plan defined for MOT and the Ministry of Interior.
A railways study articulated the future role of Albanian railways and provided a framework for politically,
technically, and financially feasible investments and course of action. Similarly, the master plan for the
Port of Durres articulated alternatives and proposed a stepwise process of change from a 'service port' to a
'landlord port' via a 'tool port'. Proposals are being implemented under the follow-up Durres Port Project
(Cr. 3068-ALB).
Many of these processes followed an agreed upon time table; however, moving road maintenance to the
private sector, implementing the road safety program, taking the road maintenance equipment into full use,
adopting a plan for the Albanian railways, and concessioning the port operations at Durres are taking place
slower than anticipated.
With the exception of one contract, the physical products were successfully completed--roads, railway link
and the quays at the port. The contracts enabled a budding domestic construction industry to emerge, partly
through joint ventures, and the new equipment and infrastructure improved port operations, safety and
environment. Domestic construction companies are bidding and winning some contracts; and in the
follow-on port project the 'working ratio' and 'operating ratid targets at midterm are met.
-3-



The uncompleted processes or contracts are being followed through in current projects. The Borrower also
complied with the covenants of the credit.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Thirty-six km of main roads (Tirana - Tapiza; Librazhd - Qafe Thana) and 7 km of railway track (Tirana -
Kashar) were rehabilitated, and 12 km of road (Mamurasi - Miloti) was constructed. Eight of the planned
10 bridges on the Librazhd - Qafe Thana road were completed. The two remaining bridges are planned to
be completedunder a follow-on project. One road contract (Fushe Kruja - Mamurasi), app. 12 km, was also
completed partially. The contract was terminated due to the poor performance of the contractor. A new
contract was signed in October 1999 to complete the project with financing from the Bank supported
National Roads project (Cr. 2888-ALB). Quays and port surfaces were repaired in the Port of Durres.
Road maintenance equipment and spare parts were procured for the Tirana road district, and equipment
and spare parts were procured for the Durres port. Equipment for a construction laboratory was acquired,
and two laboratory experts were trained to use it.
Technical assistance to the GRD, the Ministry, and the PDA were successful. Road user charges were
raised, regulations improved, private consulting, construction and transport companies were fostered, and
the concepts of how to organize and operate transport organizations in market economy were articulated
and absorbed. None of these time-consuming and complex processes is complete, and are being continued
under existing projects.
All the studies were completed and results incorporated in retooling the transport organizations and their
services.
The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, a cofinancier in the project, funded the Port of Durres
component in its entirety. The Kuwait Fund operated independently and followed its own procurement
practices for port equipment and spare parts, and for the repairs of the equipment, quays and port surfaces.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic re-evaluation is done only for the two road rehabilitation projects. At appraisal the ERR for the
road rehabilitation component was estimated to be 43 percent. At project completion the ERR is estimated
to be 26.6 percent. This is lower than at appraisal for two reasons: (i) the rehabilitation costs were 90
percent higher than at appraisal for the Librazhd - Qafe Thane road on account of the replacement of the 8
bridges; and (ii) the benefit calculations are conservative, the savings in vehicle operating costs calculated
by HDM were reduced by 50 % because of lack of local data, and the bridge costs were amortized over the
same 10 year life time as the road works. No economic re-evaluation is done for completing the two road
construction projects because while complete, they have not yet received the planned diverted traffic as an
important access road and a bridge, funded by another donor, are delayed and will be opened only in the
spring of 2000. Undoubtedly, however, the ex-post ERR-32 percent at appraisal--for these projects is well
above 12 percent. Similarly, economic evaluation of the rail track rehabilitation is not undertaken because
it was a rail section which was included when donor funding fell short to complete the rehabilitation of the
important but unsafe Tirana-Durres rail link. Given the sunk cost nature of this investment, the ERR for
the rehabilitation is estimated to be over 12%.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not calculated
- 4-



4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact achieved in the project is substantial. However, the work is by no
means completed. Institutional development is broadened and continued under the ongoing projects for
rural roads (Cr. 2732-ALB), for the national roads (Cr. 2888-ALB), and for the Durres port (Cr.
3068-ALB).
At project completion the organization of the transport sector has changed. Initially, the MTC controlled all
transport infrastructure and transport services through its four modal directorates which each had
departments for service delivery. Ministry of Construction (MOC) was the executing organization
responsible for infrastructure construction and maintenance. During the project, MTC and MOC evolved
into a Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) with policy and regulatory responsibilities. Road
transport services (trucking) was privatized, but privatization of port stevedoring was met with resistance
and delays. Rail service remains in the government fold. For ports and road adrninistration and
management, new organizational and managerial models are being adopted. For the railways no definite
concept has been adopted; however, the (much curtailed) physical altemative focusing on Tirana - Durres
corridor is being implemented. For the port, the gradual implementation of the landlord port concept
through 'tool port' was adopted. And, for the roads the concept of an autonomous road administration with
a designated income source is being gradually implemented. Thus, while much remains to be done, the
basic framework is in place.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
The collapse of the pyramid scheme in late 1966 triggered civil unrest, rioting and near anarchy that the
Government was unable to control. The project's technical assistance personnel left Albania for about four
months. The road projects were halted for nearly a year and suffered damage that resulted in claims. The
laboratory and construction equipment were also damaged in the riots; the former has been re-equipped, but
contractors' claimns, not covered by insurance, are still unsettled. Some construction sites were occupied in
order to force the government to improve road right-of-way acquisition processes and provide employment.
Transition toward market economy also brought about unforeseen pressures on civil society. All this
affected the government's ability to finance its share of the civil works, make timely decisions, and control
the factors affecting project implementation.
Another factor was the influx of multilateral and bilateral donors after Albania ended its 'closed door'
policy. In the beginning there was no donor coordination and some of the 'foreign' advice was conflicting
and slowed down decisionmaking. Some Europe wide plans had sirilar effect. For example, Albania's
east-west rail line is a designated part of a European rail corridor (to Macedonia) promoting false hopes for
a speedy rehabilitation of the highly uneconomic and little used rail line.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The most undesirable factor was the continuous change in government officials responsible for the project.
There were numerous ministerial changes during the project. Functions were transferred from organization
to another without obvious benefits. Albania's political economy was unsettled and decisionmaking was
slow, sometimes very slow. Intermittently, confrontational attitudes required Bank staff to 'arbitrate' (there
was, in fact, a successful 'arbitration' mission). Also this delayed decisions. However, on the whole, the
government pursued sensible sector policies. Inplementation capacity was absent, in part because there
was (and is) no permanent, professional civil service. Nonetheless, administrative procedures were
- 5-



improved, staff appointments were made, and counterpart funds were provided. In general, the government
demonstrated commitment to improving the transport sector, the institutional framework, the
decisionmaking processes, and the physical infrastructure.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The primary implementing agency, GRD, had limited freedom to make timely decisions, but was
conditioned by the political bodies sponsoring it and there were turf issues which slowed down
decisionmaking. Confrontational attitudes, the transfer of GRD, to MOC while the project management
unit (PMIU) remained at MTC, and frequent changes in personnel made achievement of the project's
development objectives more difficult. The lack of a permanent civil service and modest implementation
capacity both affected project implementation. However, the PMU and MTC (later MPWT and now MOT)
did make good use of technical assistance. Staff was gradually trained--also on the job, and project
management did improve during the implementation period. The delays were mostly due to the newness of
things: neither the political nor technical managers nor the workers were capable of absorbing the changes
that were taking place. Finally, costs were not really within the control of the implementing agency. In sum,
the implementing agency and the PMU muddled through the project admirably, though slowly, under the
circumstances.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The engineering design of the road projects was based on insufficient geotechnical studies and limited
knowledge of the possible complications involved in the acquisition of right-of-way (ROW). Both of these
increased costs and caused delays. At the same time, both were unavoidable parts of the societys transition
to new political and market environment. Furthermore, it is not clear if geotechnical studies would not have
cost more than what was experienced in the project and they would have delayed project start-up; in some
cases it is best do a likely design and modify it during construction. The ROW acquisition was a new
problem. There is no evidence that new 'eminent domain' laws were enacted, and the old ones, if they
existed, were probably totally unsuited in the changing circumstances. The third source of cost overruns,
the factor prices and shortage of factors of production, were unpredictable because no markets previously
existed. In sum, given the circumstances, the cost changes-around 30% and as high as 90% if there were
content and design changes-are not unusual and pose no long-term concern.
Availability of counterpart funds was problematic toward the end of the project when near anarchy
prevailed for several months. When the civil order returned, funding was restored.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the project is likely. This is because the private sector has emerged as a provider of
transport services, consulting, construction of civil works, and to a lesser extent maintenance. The new
sector organization framework has gained acceptance, and the new management concepts are being adopted
and absorbed. Sustainability is also helped through the ongoing projects, prepared with this project's funds,
that continue technical assistance and training to sector officials and the construction and consulting
industries, and provide business and employment opportunities for the new firms. In sum, continued
cooperation between the Bank, other development organizations and the Albanian govermnent and private
sector organizations is needed for continued sustainability.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
It will still be many years before transition to regular operations is complete. In part this is because of the
new organizations, lack of a permanent civil service, and weak managerial skills, and lack of experience in
a market economy. Contributing to the lengthy transition period is conversion to new technologies, and
-6 -



learning new models of working, cooperation and competition. Finally, the transport sector cannot proceed
at transition speeds much different from the rest of the society and economy. In short, it is too early to
begin transition to regular operations.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank staff appraised the project thoroughly. The project objectives were concrete and development-stage
appropriate. The components supported the project objectives and addressed the most timely topics.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision of the physical project components was professional. There was needed but not too close
oversight of civil works implementation (especially with some troublesome road design issues), and
flexibility in component specification and use of "saved" funds. Consultant studies were integrated well into
the practical issues that emerged in project implementation, and, later, there was coordination with other
development agencies. Examples include, the addition of the rehabilitation of Tirana-Kashar rail link to the
project using savings realized in road rehabilitation projects. This rail link was a component in the "Future
of the Albanian Railways" study and complemented--and completed--the Italian funded rehabilitation of the
Tirana-Durres rail corridor. Another example is the thoughtful port evolution study which was integrated
with training and the follow-on port project. In the road sector technical assistance enabled the GRD to
adopt new maintenance procedures and concepts embodied in the FIDIC-type contracting. Finally, the
Bank played a major role in helping the project recover quickly from the near anarchy conditions that
prevailed for a year after the collapse of the pyramid schemes.
The Bank supervision team and the consultants could, however, have paid more attention on occasion to the
processes to phase in new institutional and management concepts. On occasion, there was too much hurry
to reach the final stage (e.g. a 'landlord' port) before the necessary preceding stages had been experienced
and mastered.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Bank performance was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation was Bank-led. It took place under the most difficult circumstances: there was no clearly
identifiable institution with responsibility for the project, practically no trained staff, and very limited
funds. On the other hand, this was to be expected given the decades of isolation, lack of experience with
project approach, thinness of domestic capacity and so on, that all contributed to the long preparation of a
small project. Nonetheless, cooperation was satisfactory and there was willingness to learn.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's implementation performance was mixed as discussed in Section 5, Major Factors
Affecting Implementation and Outcome. Unclear lines of authority and responsibility, frequent staff
changes, and modest implementation capacity contributed to delays in awarding contracts and maldng
decisions. The counterpart funds were short of target when the pyramid schemes caused political and
macroeconomic difficulties. These were connected with the economic decline in 1996, and particularly the
political, social and economic instability in 1997 (and even in 1998) when the pyramid scheme collapsed
and triggered widespread civil unrest causing halting of the civil works, departure of consultants and
foreign contractors, and some damage at the project sites. On the other hand, slow as it was, the
-7 -



government did make decisions, supported the project--if only in principle in difficult times--and adopted
market oriented policies.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The implementing agency was MTC, where the PMU Board took the decisions and ran the day-to-day
operation which was later partly transferred to the Executive Secretary at the request of the Bank.
Unfortunately, from the project implementation viewpoint, this delegation was insufficient. There was
turf-fighting, especially after GRD was transferred to MOC from MTC, because the PMU chairmanship
rotated between high level managers from MTC and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) which delayed
decisions. Delegation improved after MTC and MOC were merged, and the executing agency, GRD, was
able to complete the project satisfactorily. Other factors contributing to delays was the PMU's lack of
experience in Bank policies regarding procurement, inexperience of the contractors, and the lack of market
for the factors of production.
7.7 Overall Borroer performnance:
Overall, given that this was the first transport project in Albania, Borrower performance is assessed to be
satisfactory. There is a need, however, to consider carefully, in future projects, the designation of the
implementing agency, and the organization and authority of the unit that is responsible for day-to-day
management of the project. The PMUs of all subsequent projects were reorganized on a contractual basis
to increase their autonomy and improve project implementation.
8. Lessons Learned
There are three lessons:
*   Pay more attention to the institutional components than the physical components. Institutional
components received the most attention in this project with good results. Most reasons for slow
decision making and cost overruns were of institutional origin. Trained professionals using modem
equipment are needed for good engineering design; good cost estimation and record keeping, require
cost accounting systems; timely right-of-way acquisition and road planning require an up-to-date legal
framework; good road management needs data and management systems; transparent procurement
processes are necessary for market competition, and so on. None of these existed in Albania and had to
be either initiated or problerns solved 'ad hoc'. Both approaches were used so that short term road, rail,
or port maintenance issues--which also are important--were not favored over sustainable, long term
policy frameworks. However, broad institutional development requires much time and more extensive
management and staff training, including on the job, than was possible during this or any single project.
* Help solve immediate problems by listening to the client, and then help institutionalize the
solution. There were many slowdowns and 'hiccoughs' in this project. In all cases, be it slowness to
shortlist, procure, evaluate bids, acquire the right-of-way, knowledge to relocate utilities and to time
decisions and investments correctly, implement a traffic safety program, or whatever, the mode of
supervision was to ask, assess and discuss, advise and request a decision. This approach had limited
success. Involving the client in problem definition and finding a solution is a good way to find
sustainable answers. But, that is not sufficient. Data systems, laws, planning and procurement
processes, and decisionmaking practices must be codified and systematized -- institutionalized -- so that
the problems do not repeat themselves. In this project a very good start has been made to be advanced
further in the ongoing projects.
*   Professional civil service is important. Frequent changes in personnel, and the lack of a permanent
civil service, made the achievement of development objectives more difficult. The project would have

benefited from a parallel project to improve the civil service by progressive restructuring to reinforce
merit increase, compensation, reduce staffing, and improve accountability. Admittedly, such an
endeavor would be one whose results could not be seen during the project itself
