REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the equiva-
lent of US$13.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second rail-
way project. The proceeds of the IDA credit would be on-lent to RNCFM for
20 years including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 8 percent per
annum.  The project would be cofinanced on a parallel basis with a loan from
the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique - CCCE (US$20.5 million,
for 17 years including a 5-1/2 year grace period, at 6 percent per annum).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A Bank Group economic mission visited Madagascar in July 1978.  Its
report is expected to be distributed to the Executive Directors in June. A
summary of its findings is set out below. Country data sheets are provided
in Annex 1.
3.        With a GNP per capita estimated at US$210 in 1977, Madage-seer 4S ene
of the poorest countries in the world. It is predominantly an agricultural
country and 85 percent of its 9.4 million 1/ people live in rural areas with
a per capita income of about US$120 per annum. In many areas the standard
of living is close to subsistence level. Although the country is sparsely
populated (an average of 16 inhabitants per square kilometer), there is great
pressure on cultivable land in some regions. Owing mainly to different eco-
logical conditions, the highlands are more advanced than the coastal areas,
and the south is particularly poor with a harsh, arid climate and infertile
soils. The east coast is rich agriculturally, but crops are frequently
devastated by cyclones. Internal migration is common and has accelerated as
improved roads have provided access to new areas. However, poor roads remain
a major constraint to development; many of the main highways are not passable
during the rainy season in a country where production centers may be as far
as 800 kilometers from main points of consumption. Many areas are cut off
from the rest of the country for several months each year.
4.        Over the past few years the growth of the economy continued to be
slow and uneven. Having risen but marginally in the preceding year real GDP
fell in 1976 by 2.9 percent owing co a slight decline in agricultural produc-
tion and a steep drop of about 14 percent in manufacturing output. GDP is
Note: Part I is identical to the Part I in the Madagascar Mangoky Agricultural
Development project, P-2372-MAG, dated February 22, 1979.
1/ According to the latest available census data, mid-year population in 1977
is estimated to be only 8.0 million, which would raise the GNP per capita
to US$240. New population figures will be used on revision of Social
Indicators Data Sheet.



- 2 -
estimated to have increased by 3.9 percent in 1977; even so, output of goods
and services showed only a slight increase over the period since 1974; and,
with population increasing by about 2.5 percent annually, per capita GDP
fell by about 5 percent. Budgetary investment outlays were stepped tup con-
siderably after 1975; but the investment rate remained practically unchanged
at about 14 percent as the sharp rise in Government capital expenditures was
largely offset by a substantial decline in private investment. The savings
rate also continued to be fairly stable and fluctuated around 10-11 percent.
The resource gap as a consequence has been maintained at a low level.
5.        Agricultural production has not recorded any marked growth over
the last three or four years.  Even over the longer period since 1970 it has
increased at an annual rate of only about 1 percent. Despite periodic good
crops, paddy production did not keep pace with demand; and production in 1977,
estimated at 2.0 million tons, was only about 7 percent higher than in 1970.
Groundnut production, after rising significantly in 1976, fell again to
47,000 tons in 1977, while meat production did not register any significant
rise. Imports of rice and edible oils have been increasing; at 105,000 tons
and 16,000 tons, respectively, they were about three to four times as large
in 1977 as in 1970-71. Sugarcane production continued to stagnate as there
has been no addition to the refinery capacity for several years. Among other
cash and export crops, coffee production, except for a 6 percent drop in 1976,
has been rising steadily, reaching some 89,000 tons in 1977. However, raw
cotton production, which had been increasing fairly fast, levelled off after
1975 due to shortages of fertilizers and pesticides; vanilla output declined,
while pepper showed no noticeable increase.
6.        Fostered by fiscal incentives, protection against competition from
imports and provision of institutional term financing, manufacturinig normally
accounts for about 14 percent of GDP. Industrial output, which still consists
mainly of textiles and processed foods, declined in 1975 and 1976; and despite
some recovery in 1977, remained below the level attained in 1974. However,
while output of processed foods and textiles has followed a stagnant or a
downward trend, some of the minor industries - chemicals, tobacco manufactures,
rubber, paper products - maintained fairly steady growth. The setback to
industrial growth in recent years was caused by a number of factors: capacity
bottlenecks and aging equipment, owing partly to declining private investment,
uncertain and inadequate availability of agricultural materials for processing
industries, shortages of imported inputs, and, in some cases, even deficient
demand. These factors reflect to some extent the effects of uncertainty
accompanying the shift through greater Government control from a predominantly
free market system to a mixed economy. In particular, private investment in
industry was discouraged and maintenance of industrial plant suffered.
7.        With sudden and sharp rise in current budget expenditure and Govern-
ment spending on capital development, the fiscal situation deteriorated con-
siderably after 1975. Current expenditures rose steeply with the rising wage
bill of the Government and increasing outlay on maintenance; and the current
budget surplus, which used to be substantial, dwindled as revenues failed to



keep pace with the growth of expenditures. Furthermore, as Government intensi-
fied its efforts to raise investment levels and stimulate the economy, public
investment expenditure rose from 11.2 billion FMC in 1975 to 20.5 billion FMG
in 1977. The outlays on the consuimer rice subsidy, althouglh they declined
in 1976, rose again to 3.6 billion FMG in the subsequent year.  The overall
Treasury deficit, which more than doubled to 20 billion FMG between 1975 and
1977, was financed increasingly through recourse to Central Bank advances.
The budget for 1978 envisaged a 26 percent increase in total outlay as com-
pared to the estimated actual expenditures in 1977, while capital spending was
proposed to be raised by nearly 80 percent to 36.4 billion FMG.  Revenues also
were expected to go up sharply, partly as a result of tax reform measures.
The overall deficit, however, migtht turn out to be somewhat larger than the
projected 16.1 billion FMG owing to underestimation of expenditure on per-
soninel and the settlement of payments deferred from 1977, on the onle hand,
and shortfalls in revenues on the other. Even so, the overall fiscal situation
Js likely to have shown some improvement in 1978 as compared to the preceding
year.  The Government is contemplating econtomies in current expeniditure,
particularly by paring consumer subsidies, so as to minimize the burden of
unproductive outlays in the future.
8.        Monetary and credit developments since 1975 have been influenced
mainly by the Government's deficit financing needs.  Outstanding domestic
credit went up by more than 50 percent to 126 billion FMG during 1975-77, due,
for the most part, to the steep and continued rise in net claims on Government.
As a result, money supply, which had been increasing moderately, rose by 15
percent in 1976 and as much as 25 percent in 1977.  Despite this monetary
expansion and little growth in the output of goods and services, the anntual
inflation rate has been moderate -- about 9-10 percent during 1976-77, largely
because of increasing demand for cash balances and the consequent accumulation
of idle funds.
9.        The balance of payments situation which had been deteriorating
showed a substantial improvement in 1976, when a surplus of 2 billion FMG was
recorded; but the payments surplus in 1977 is now estimated to have been much
smaller. The turnaround in the balance of payments situation occurring in
1976 is attributable more to exogenous factors than to any significant im-
provement in the structure of the balance of payments. Trade surpluses were
recorded in 1976 and 1977 as a result of (a) a sharp rise in prices of exports,
particularly coffee, which reversed the continuing deterioration in the terms
of trade, and (b) the imposition of more strict quantitative restrictions on
imports in 1976. There was a substantial decline in the availability of
imports after 1975. On the other hand, the volume of exports dropped sharply
in 1976, and continued to fall in 1977, while there was no lasting reduction
in the services deficit, nor any sustained rise in capital inflows.
10.       The growth and development of the Malagasy economy have over a
fairly long period been affected by constraints resulting from shortage of
savings, slow growth in markets for major primary exports and low productivity
of traditional agriculture. The country, however, is relatively well-endowed
with natural resources and has a well-established administrative set-up. With



- 4 -
appropriate policies and adequate external capital assistance, medium and
long-term prospects for the economy should be favorable. There is consider-
able scope for the expansion of agriculture and livestock production. Only
about a fifth of the arable land is at present being cultivated, while fer-
tilizer consumption, estimated to be some 14,000 tons in 1976, is still rather
smiall. The irrigation potential has as yet been only partially exploited.
The outlo)k for further development of manufacturing based on locally avail-
able matenials is promising.  On the vhole, sustained growth at an average
arnlnual rate of 4-5 percent appears to be feasible.
11.       The Government has been taking far-reachinig steps to str.:ngthen
national -ontrol of the economy. As E part of this process, economnic and
financial institutions, productive sectors, foreign trade and inte-nal market-
ing have andergone extensive reorgani2ation.  Inspired by the basic needs
approach, the Government has also fornulated long-term development objectives
which envisage a more egalitarian inccme distribution and satisfac,ion of
specified minimum consumption requirenents of the population by th,; end of
the century. The Government also strEsses national self-sufficien,y and the
eventual 2stablishment of an industrial base large and diversified enough to
mneet the antire domestic demand for equipment and other manufactur as.
12.       A Three-Year Plan, which is to be the first of a series )f medium-
term investment programs designed to zttain these long-run developinent objec-
tives, wag launched this year. The Plan envisages overall expansion of the
economy at an average annual rate of '.5 percent during 1978-80. The rate of
investment is projected to rise to 17.1 percent of GDP by 1980 from the Plan
estimate of 11.5 percent in 1977. The savings rate is to be stepped up,
partly through the mobilization of additional budgetary resources for capital
development. But about a quarter of the investment outlays during the Plan
period is expected to be financed through external loans and grants. Greater
emphasis will be placed on the development of food crops; and household con-
sumption is targeted to rise, in real terms, by 3.6 percent per year. The
Plan also accords high priority to manufacturing, particularly basic industry
anid processing of agricultural raw materials.
13.       Madagascar's external public debt, outstanding and disbursed,
amounted to US$202.8 million at the end of 1977. Slightly over half of it
(US$102.3 million) was owed to the Bank Group, and as much as 37.8 percent to
IDA alone. Bank group share of debt service in 1977 was 20.8 percent. Among
bilateral donors France and the Federal Republic of Germany are the most
prominent, each holding about 14 percent of the disbursed debt. Japan and the
People's Republic of China rank next in importance (about 5 percent each)
followed by the USA (3 percent) and Italy (1.1 percent). Suppliers' credits
and commercial borrowing (4.6 percent of the disbursed debt) lhave been rela-
tively unimportant. The Government, in fact, has been generally prudent with
regard to external indebtedness; the outstanding disbursed debt at the end of
1976 thus amounted to nearly 11 percent of GNP as compared to the average of
21 percent for low income countries. Because of relatively limited reliance
on external assistance and concessionary terms of most loans and credits, debt
service payments have remained small. The estimated debt service ratio of 3.5
percent in 1976 was only marginally higher than in 1970.



-5-
14.       The Bank Group should be prepared, in appropriate cases, to~ provide-
some local cost financing. Inr terms of performance, Madagascar appears to
have performed about as well as other countries at the same ievel of develop-
ment encountering similar constraints. Its current domestic savings rate of
10 - 11 percent compares favorably with the average of 8 percent for countries
in the low income group, indicating that Madagascar has made a reasonable
effort to mobilize domestic savings; but its savings fall far short of the
country's requirements. The Government's policy of emphasizing self-reliance
has contributed further to scarcity of external resources. Despite consid-
erable restrictions on imports, the country's balance of payments and reserve
position have continued to be weak.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MADAGASCAR
15.       Madagascar has received fourteen IDA credits amounting to US$158.2
million and five Bank loans totaling US$32.6 million. About 48 percent
of Bank Group lending has been for transport, 21 percent for electric
power, 22 percent for agriculture and 9 percent fcr education. LFC's first
investment was made in March 1977 with an equity investment of US$290,000
and a loan of US$11.0 million for the expansion of a textile mill; other
projects in sugar, leather and ferrochronme are under active consideration.
Annex 11 contains a summary statement of bank loans and IDA credits, and of
IFC investments as of March 31, 1979, as well as notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. The priority given to transport investment recognizes
that improvement in communications is a precondition for Madagascar's
development. Four projects have been for the construction of all-weather
links between the island's different regions, one for improvements to
Madagascar's main port of Toamasina and one for the modernization of the
railway line between Toamasina and the capital, Antananarivo. Bank Group
lending for agriculture consists of two livestock development projects,
three irrigation projects and a forestry project. An agricultural develop-
ment project in the Mangoky delta was approved by the Executive Directors
on March 6, 1979. A study on the problem of agricultural marketing and
meat pricing is being executed with the assistance of an international con-
sultancy firm.
16.       In the past, problems have arisen in the course of execution of sev-
eral projects. There were delays in execution, cost overruns and deficiencies
in institution building, especially in agriculture. The Morondava Project,
which was reduced in scope in 1974, continues to encounter problems, but the
Government has prepared a plan of action to deal with them; the plan includes
a redefinition of the implementing agency's (SODEMO) responsibilities and
financial structures, completion and audit of overdue accounts, and prepara-
tion of an investment program and budget for development of the Morondava
area. Implementation of the plan of action has started and is being clbs ly
monitored by the Government and the Association.  Implementation of the V.'-
lage Livestock Project has improved substantially. The highway projects are
also proceeding satisfactorily.



-6-
17.       In our future lending to Madagascar, we intend to continue focusing
on infrastructure development, but we expect agriculture to absorb an increas-
ingly larger share of total Bank Group lending. A water and sanitation project
in Antananarivo and a fifth highway project, concerned mainly with improving
highway maintenance, have been appraised and will be negotiated shortly. We
are assisting the Government in preparing an agricultural credit project, a
DFC project, which will include assistance to handicraft industries, a rural
development project based on local communities, and a second forestry project.
We expect the Government to seek co-financing from other external lenders for
some of these projects.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Transport Planning, Policy and Coordination
18.       The country's rugged topography, its tropical climate and the lack
of suitable construction materials in some parts of the island have made
road construction and maintenance relatively costly; this has contributed
towards the isolation of some of the regions. Uneven population distribu-
tion has also affected the development of the sector.
19.       Government policy towards transport development, stated in the
"hartar :of the RCvol'u-tic-i", alms at connect4ng reg4""-'l c-ital  9 1- p11-
weather roads, improving road maintenance, and developing the transport
organization and services.
20.       Since February 1975, transport matters have fallen under the
responsibility of two different ministries: the Ministry of Transport,
Supplies and Tourism, which sets transport regulations, supervises the
state-owned firms of the transport sector, and is responsible for modal
coordination, and the Ministry of Public Works, which is responsible
for infrastructure construction and development. In addition, the Ministry
of Planning prepares a National Plan for all sectors, including transport.
Due to communication problems between the ministries and to the lack of
adequately qualified staff, there has been little coordination in the sector.
From 1974 to August 1978, a team of transport specialists had been made
available to the Ministry of Transport under IDA financing (Credit 488-HLAG).
This team, however, did not fully achieve its major objectives, which were
to improve the level and quality of transport planning in Madagascar, par-
ticularly in the highway subsector.  Its work was impeded by the lack of
cooperation between MTRT and MTP, by changes in its work program, and by
the shortage of competent staff as counterparts to the expatriate experts.
A local group trained as counterparts and attached to the MTRT is now respon-
sible for the transport planning and coordination function, and their efforts
are being strengthened with the increasing coordination that is being achieved
through the intervention of the Directorate of Planning of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning.       The need to coordinate the investments in the dif-
ferent transport modes is now clearly perceived in the Directorate of Planning.



-7-
In the past, the only objective was to provide a very basic transportation
network. The need for a global strategy in the transport sector and for
intermodal planning has become more acute as the network developed. Close
coordination will be needed in the future to optimize use of the transport
system in this corridor (see para 22 below).
The Transiort Network
21.       Madagascar's transport network consists of about 27,500 km of roads
of which only 4,500 km are paved; 2 unconnected railway systems totalling
860 km; 4 alongside ports and 11 lighterage ports of some significance; and
56 airfields of which 17 are all-weatl,er standard.
Roads
22.       The paved highway network consists of a main north-south artery,
connecting Mahajanga, Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa, an east-west road link-
Jng Moramanga, Antananarivo, and Tsiroannmandidy, and several short stretches
around the major coastal towns. A road being built with the assistance of
the People's Republic of China will link Toarnasina to M4oramanga in the early
1980s and will compete with the railway for traffic on the Toamasina-Antanarivo
corridor.  The standards applicable to this road would be:  (i) 2.5 X minimum
rndi-tn; 1.4'- ?% =-=-='i grad4-nt; (4ii4) 6 !5 p-rerne- -ilt (-tvu) lA trn~
load; and (v) 25 tons bridge capacity. This road is not expected to attract
bulk traffic. Roads are generally of low standard, often in poor condition,
and frequently impassable during the rainy season in the north and part of the
west.  Mainitenance remains a major problem for the road network due to insuf-
ficient funds and deficient organization. Road maintenance will be improved
under a proposed Fifth Highway Project appraised in September/October 1978.
In 1976, the vehicle fleet consisted of 104,000 vehicles, of which 53 percent
are automobiles and 47 percent commercial vehicles.  Rates for the trucking
industry are established by provincial authorities. Passenger transport is
regulated by the Ministry of Transport and by the provincial authorities.
Railways
23.       The Reseau National des Chemins de Fer Malagasy (RNCFM) operates
860 km of main line, and 175 km of branch lines and private sidings.  It
has so far provided the main meanis of transportation between the east coast
and the high plateau wqhere most of the population and economic activities
are concentrated.  In 1977, it carried a total of 823,300 tons of freight
(with an average haul of 334 km) and 3.9 million passengers (with an average
journey of 69 kn).

Air Transport
24.       Madagascar has 56 airfields, 17 of which are built to all-weather
standards. Only two airports can handle large aircraft of the Boeing-707 type.
Wide bodied aircrafts such as the Boeing-747 can only land at Antananarivo's
airport. The national airline, Air Madagascar, is owned 70 percent by the
Government and 30 percent by Air France. It owns 18 aircraft including one
B-707 and two B-737s. It has recently purchased a Boeing 747 whichi will be
operated jointly with Air France.
Ports
25.       Among the four major ports, Toamasina handles about two thirds of
the total national traffic, Majunga on the west coast, 11 percent; Antomboka
(ex-Diego Suarez) in the north and Toliari in the south, about 4 percent each.
The other ports handle mainly coastal shippiiig, which is important because of
the inadequate inland transport infrastructure.
Bank Group Role
26.       The Bank Group is assisting the Government in restoring and improving
transport infrastructure and institutions, in training staff, and in planning
for the future development of the sector. Bank Group lending to the transport
sector has amounted to some US$93 million, about 80 percent of which has been
for the highway subsector.
27.       Beginning in 1966, the Bank Group has financed four highway projects
in Madagascar, amounting to US$75.6 million. A proposed Fifth Highway Project
was appraised in September/October 1978. An IDA credit of US$9.6 million for
extension and improvement of the Port of Toamasina was approved in 1970,
followed in 1973 by an additional credit of US$1.8 million.
28.       The First Railway Project in Madagascar (US$6.0 million; Credit
488-MAG) was approved in January 1974; it was designed as a "holding operation"
to assist the railway in replacing outdated equipment and to determine its
long-term prospects and requirements, as well as the needs of the transport
sector as a whole.
29.       The Bank Group-financed items originally included 60 km of track
renewal, 50 freight wagons, 20 passenger coaches, miscellaneous equipment,
consulting services and the provision of a transport planning team for the
Government. The physical execution of the project has generally been satis-
factory, though somewhat behind schedule.  Cost increases have made it
necessary to reduce the numbers of rolling stock to be purchased (freight
wagons from 50 to 35 and pas6enger coaches from 20 to 15).  Because of
proposed changes in the constitution of public bodies, including that of the
railway, implementation of technical assistance to the railway in some areas
has been postponed and the proceeds of the credit thus released have been
used to purchase 12 ballast wagons. The project is virtually completed.
The railway's performance in respect to financial targets, on the other hand,
has been disappointing, due partly to lower than expected traffic volume and
delays in introducing necessary tariff increases. The 3 percent rate of
return target has not yet been achieved (see paragraphs 45-47 below).



-9 -
30.       The railway has played, and is still playing, a fundamental role
in the transportation sector of the country and in the economy as a whole.
Its long-term prospects are good, mainly because a large pottion of the
railway's present and future traffic consists of bulky and.heavy commodi-
ties, such as petroleum products, ore, timber and wood, not suitable for
transport by road.   The outlook for the future is favorable providing the
railway's overall efficiency and productivity can be maintained, and appro-
priate tariff increases are introduced when required.
31.       The Government has repeatedly stressed that it will continue
to support the railway in maintaining its important role and that the rail-
way's current and future investment plans will be accorded high priority in
the Government's'development plans. The railway has been managing its oper-
ations in a commendable manner-under very difficult circumstances as, for
example, poor track resulting in frequent derailments, outmoded equipment,
and shortages of spare parts, etc. However, there is scope for improving
the railway's overall efficiency and productivity by providing essential
replacements of its worn out track and equipment. Although the railway's
general management is capable, its financial management will have to be
strenpgthened.  The introduction of appropriate tariffs and timely reimburse-
ments of accounts receivable from the Government and its agencies are also
crucial to the railway's financial well-being.
32.       Container traffic, though still modest in Madagascar, has recently
hppin inr'rPiinP.  At- nrp-Pnt. it is limited to the main line from Toamasina
to Antananarivo. The Toamasina Port Authority is responsible for handling
containers in that area while RNCFM is responsible for this activity in
Antananarivo. Since existing facilities in Antananarivo are seriously
congested, the Chamber of Commerce has agreed to create a new container
terminal which is expected to be completed in 1982. RNCFM would be respon-
sible for the laying of track. Periodic exchanges of views will take place
between the Government and the Association with respect to the development
of these facilities (section 4.03, draft Development Credit Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
33.       A report entitled "Madagascar - Second Railway Project - Staff
Appraisal Report", dated April 19, 1979, is being distributed separately.
A Credit and Project Summary appears at the beginning of this report and
a Supplementary Project Data Sheet is given in Annex III. The Project was
prepared by RNCFM with the assistance of consultants, and appraised by an
IDA mission in April 1978. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from
December 14 to 19, 1978. The Malagasy delegation was headed by Mr. Leon
Rajaobelina, Governor of the Central Bank.

Project Objectives and Description
34.       The proposed project, which is a continuation of the program started
under the First Railway Project (Credit 488-MAG) of 1974, aims at ruriiier
improving RNCFM's line capacity with increased safety and reliability in
traffic operation to meet traffic demands up to 1982, and to improve overall
efficiency. It includes the following components:
(a)  renewal of 160 km of track, improvement of another 124 km,
renewal of points and crossings, and procurement of track
maintenance equipment and tools;
(b) replacement of seven line locomotives;
(c) replacement and new acquisitions of a railcar, coaches
and wagons;
(d) improvement of telecommunications;
(e) replacement of workshop equipment; and
(f) improvement of the railway's financial management
and accounting system, implementation of its new
Transport Plan, and carrying out of studies of the
long-term viability of the Antsirabe-Antananarivo
and the Manakara-Fianarantsoa lines.
35.       Details of the project are as follows:
(i) The poor condition of the track is reducing the capacity of
the line due to a great number of speed restrictions and
frequent derailments. Increasing axle loads and traffic
density call for heavier track, which the railway has started
introducing. This track renewal program will continue under
the proposed project which provides for renewal of 160 km of
track, improvement of another 124 km, replacement of 136
points and crossings, and procurement of 47 ballast wagons,
maintenance equipment and tools.
(ii) The four oldest shunting locomotives must be retired but can
be replaced by four downgraded line locomotives. Seven line
locomotives will be required to replace the downgraded units,
and to cope with the expected increase in traffic. Spare
parts for the locomotives are included in the project.
(iii) The short distance commuter traffic has been increasing
steadily over the last few years. The new railcar will
replace two old ones which are being scrapped, and the 10
new coaches will replace the 14 wooden body old coaches.
The reduction in numbers of the new units is made possible
by their higher capacity and the expected increase in their
availability.



- 11 -
(iv)  The traffic on the northern system will increase from 268
million ton-km in 1976 to 328 million ton-km in 1982. It
has been estimated that 76 new wagons will be needed to meet
transport needs, taking into account larger pay-loads of the
new wagons and expected improvements in productivity.
(v)  The 14 km track section between Ambila and Brickaville
requires realignment and levelling to reduce the frequency
of derailments and to eliminate the need for additional loco-
motives for heavy trains, which cannot otherwise negotiate
the steep grades. The first phase of the realignment
(originally financed by USAID, and now continued by the
railway on its own) is expected to be completed during the
first half of 1979, and is therefore not included in the
project. The project provides for the completion of the
work as well as the rebuilding of the Brickaville yard at
the end of the realigned track. Also included are minor
improvements of other yards, upgrading of the telecommuni-
cations system, replacement of workshop equipment, and
repair of embankments and bridge foundations damaged by
floods.
(vi)  Technical assistance is provided in the following areas:
(i) implementation of a unified financial planning,
accounting and information system; (ii) supetvibiUii of
the implementation of the railway's Transport Plan; and
(iii) participation in the studies on the long-term
viability of Antsirabe-Antananarivo and Manakara-
Fianarantsoa lines. The technical assistance is esti-
mated to involve some 50 man-months at an average for-
eign cost of US$8,000 per man-month.
Cost Estimates
36.       The project cost is estimated at US$43.7 million equivalent, of
which US$33.5 million equivalent, or 77.0 percent, is in foreign exchange,
and US$10.2 million equivalent in local costs.  The items included in the
Project will be exempt from local taxes and customs duties. Detailed cost
estimates are given in the Credit and Project Summary.
37.       The cost estimates are based on recent quotations and bids for
similar equipment, obtained in 1978. Physical contingencies of 10% have
been provided for realignment of the Brickaville-Ambila section and for
rebuilding of Brickaville yard only, as the quantities for the other items
can be considered as fixed. Price contingencies have been as follows: -
for imported items at the rate of 7.5% for the year 1979 and 7.0% for the
years 1980 to 1983; and for local costs at the rate of 10.0% for the years
1979 to 1983.



- 12 -
Financing and Procurement
38.       Of the total cost of the project amounting to US$43.7 million equiv-
alent, the foreign cost of US$33.5 million is expected to be met from external
borrowings, and the local cost of US$10.2 million equivalent is expected to be
financed from the railway's internally generated funds. It is proposed that
the Bank Group provide a credit of US$13 million. CCCE of France is expected
to finance the equivalent of some US$20.5 million. The IDA credit will be
onlent by the Government to RNCFM at an annual interest rate of 8 percent
for 20 years, including 5 years grace, and these conditions will be reflected
in a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered into between the Government and
RNCFM, the execution of which would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit (Section 6.01(a), draft Development Credit Agreement). The
CCCE loan will be made directly to the RNCFM. The CCCE loan is expected to
carry an interest rate of 6 percent per annum and to be for 17 years including
5-1/2 years grace. Fulfillment of all conditions precedent to initial dis-
bursement of the CCCE loan would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA
credit (Section 6.01(b), draft Development Credit Agreement).
39.       Equipment and material financed by the Bank Group will be obtained
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guide-
lines except for small orders of under US$25,000 each. These small orders
are not expected to exceed US$250,000 in total. These items will be procured
abroad or locally through local purchase procedures which are acceptable to
the Bank Group. The Bank Group is expected to finance track materials, points
and crossing, aerial ropeway and technical assistance; while CCCE will finance
ballast wagons, locomotives, motorized railcars, coaches, and realignment works.
Disbursements
40.       Disbursements from the credit will, for imported equipment and
materials, be on the basis of 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 75
percent of local expenditures if purchased locally. For consultants' and
experts' services, disbursements will be on the basis of 100 percent of
foreign expenditures. All disbursements will be fully documented.
Implementation
41.       The project will be carried out by RNCFM, which has the capability
to do so. Until 1965, RNCFM operated as a "Regie Autonome" under the Ministry
of Transport with a substantial degree of autonomy. Since then, the railway
passed through various forms of state control from functioning as a government
department to its present form (under a Decree of May 10, 1974) as a state-
owned industrial and commercial establishment with operational and financial
autonomy.
42.       RNCFM's general and operational management is capable, but in the
financial area, a satisfactory integration has not been achieved between the
accounting activities performed by the railway staff for the Agent Comptable
acting as representative of the Ministry of Finance on the one hand, and the
financial controls and accounting information needs of the railway as an



- 13 -
autonomous organization on the other. Under the project RNCFM will set up
a unified accounting system (Schedule 2, F, draft Development Credit Agree-
ment), along the lines of the solution recently adopted for the Port of
Toamasina Authority which had encountered similar problems. Consultants
will be employed to assist in implementing this system.  (Section 2.02, draft
Project Agreement).  RNCFM shall employ a financial manager whose qualifica-
tions and experience are acceptable to IDA (Section 3.03, draft Project
Agreement).
43.       The impact of the expected application of the Charte des Enter-
prises Socialistes (a law dated December 27, 1976 embodying general principles
emphasizing the socialist pattern of the Malagasy economy and the participa-
tory nature of the management and administration of its institutions) to the
railway still remains to be determined. The Government will exchange views
with IDA on any proposal for a material change in the present statutes or
organization of RNCFM (Section 4.02, draft Development Credit Agreement).
Uneconomic Lines and Services
44.       Two lines of the railway system (the Antsirabe-Antananarivo and the
Manakara-Fianarantsoa lines) have light traffic density and have limited pros-
pects for growth. During negotiations it was agreed that their long term
viability would be studied during the proposed project implementation period,
and that the findings of the study to be carried out with the assistance of a
consultant will be discussed with the Association. Agreement was also reached
that the Government would compensate the RNCFM through appropriate measures,
including the provision of funds, for any services found to be uneconomical,
but retained on other grounds (Section 3.02, draft Development Credit Agreement).
Financial Situation
45.       Financially, RNCFM's operating results have been less satisfactory
than anticipated. At a time when traffic has remained stagnant, other
factors added to its difficulties, namely: (i) adequate and timely tariff
increases have not been made; (ii) personnel costs, which constitute some 50
percent of the total operating costs, have been rising steeply in recent
years; (iii) large amounts of accounts receivable have been outstanding from
various government agencies; and (iv) Government did not reimburse the
railway for amounts foregone on account of concessionary fares. Thus the
railway has not been able to achieve the financial objectives agreed under
the previous credit, including, in particular, a 3 percent annual return on
net fixed assets.
46.       The financial situation of the Railways, as shown in the projections,
should improve substantially in the future if RNCFM is managed on a commer-
cial basis. To this end, the Government has recently decided to implement a
new tariff increase of 25% effective April 23, 1979. It has reimbursed RNCFM
two-thirds of all the amounts outstanding for more than 90 days due by
Government departments and agencies as of October 31, 1978; and it has agreed
to reimburse the remaining third before the end of 1979. During negotiations,
it was agreed that all such accounts will be collected in the future within a



- 14 -
credit period not exceeding 90 days (Section 4.04, draft Project Agree-
ment and Section 4.01, draft Development Credit Aereement) and that
the Government will reimburse RNCFM the amounts foregone on account
of concessionary passenger fares (Section 4.04, draft Development Credit
Agreement). RNCFM has agreed that (a) its tariff structure and levels be
established in accordance with appropriate economic and commercial principles
for railway operations; and (b) the tariff structure and levels cover the
economic cost of individual services and the individual carriage of goods but,
taken as a whole: (i) cover the full costs of services, and (ii) generate
internal funds sufficient to service debt, provide adequate working capital
and make a reasonable contribution towards investment needs including replace-
ments (Section 4.05, draft Project Agreement). During negotiations, agreement
was reached that RNCFM will revalue its fixed assets on the basis of replace-
ment costs every year beginning in 1980 and that the annual and accumulated
depreciation will be adjusted to reflect the revised valuation (Section 4.03,
draft Project Agreement).
47.       The agreements for the first Project require RNCFM to earn an annual
rate of return of 3 percent on its net fixed assets beginning in 1977. In
present circumstances, these targets are not realistic. It is proposed in-
stead that iNCFM earn an annual return of not less than 1.3 percent in 13979,
2.5 percent in 1980, 1981 and 1982, and 3.0 percent thereafter based on the
historical value of existing fixed assets and current values of new additions
(Section 4.07, draft Project Agreement). These are considered adequate to
assure the railway's financial viability. However, it was agreed that in
lignt ot tnte revaluation of fixed assets in respect of year i9OU as eluvisdgeu
in para 46 above, the Government, the railway and the Association shall agree
on revised rates of return for the purpose of maintaining the railway's
financial viability (Section 4.07(c), draft Project Agreement). Furthermore,
RNCFM shall not, without prior consultation with the Association, undertake
any additional capital investment except for small items not exceeding FMG 50
million, and in the aggregate not exceeding FMG 200 million per annum, during
the project period (Section 4.06, draft Project Agreement).
48.       To ensure that adequate debt service coverage will be maintained,
RNCFMt will require the Association's approval before incurring new long-term
debt if the debt service ratio falls below 1.5 (Section 4.08, draft Project
Agreement).
49.       RNCFM's accounts are and shall continue to be audited by a firm of
public accountants acceptable to IDA and carried out according to generally
accepted auditing practices (Section 4.02, draft Project Agreement).
Economic Evaluation
50.       The project as a whole is designed to maintain RNCFM transport
capacity to its present level and to provide some extra capacity for general
freight transport to meet the 1983 projected traffic level of some 300 mil-
lion ton-km. Without the project, some 137 million ton-km of general freight
and some 30 million passenger km yearly would have to travel by road at higher
economic costs by 1983, yielding an economic return on the overall project of



- 15 -
17% at the present exchange rate, I/ over the 1979-1990 period.  The additional
freight transport capacity would be met: (i) for 71 million ton-kin, fromn the
track upgrading program, yielding an ecornomic return of 21% on this component
( 49% of the total project costs); (ii) for 50 million ton-km, from addi-
tional locomotives and wagons, yielding a return of 24% (   21% of the total
project costs); (iii) for 4 million ton-kin, from the provision of workshop
equipment, yielding a return of 17% (   3% of the total project costs); (iv)
for 12 million toni-km, from the realignment works on the Ambila-Brickaville
section, yielding a return of 11% (   8% of the total project costs).  The
passenger coaches to be procured under the project will be used for commuter
and short distance traffic and are needed to replace existing coaches which
have to be scrapped. Compared to the transport by bus, rhe economic return
on this component (10% of the total project costs) is 10%.
51.       The utajor uncertainty of the proposed project is whether the expected
traffic will rmaterialize.  It could fail co do so either because the economy
may fail to recover within the projection period, or because road competition
muay be stronger than forecast. These two uncertainties, however, were to
some extent already taken into account in the previous analysis. Most of
the investments are needed even if rail  traffic does not increase at all
throughout the projected rcriod.  Much of the cr.-ick upgrading program corre-
sponds to deferred maintenance ar,d che purchas s  of locomotives and wagonls is
also partly justified on replacement considerjtlons.  Assum-ing nio traffic
expanision at all, whitch is an extre,ce. case since the railway is no; even
abLe to carry the present trattic, ttle return on the wno:,.e project wouje De
10% at both shadow and official exchange rates.
52.       Assuming the road competition is stronger than forecast (a 50--50%,
split for non-bulk Items by 1985), the rail, traffic would still amount to
300 miallion ton-km yearly by 1985, whlichi is tthe capacity the project provides
for, because most of the traffic consists of bulk produicts. The extent of the
road competition, however, will need to be closely analy-zed when evaluating
tthe additional investments required by the railway to meet the projected
traffic after 1983. Another risk facing the proposed project is whether the
expected efficiency improvements will be achieved. In this case, however, in
view of the railway's relatively hiigh technviical and operatioual capabilities,
it should have little difficulty in reaching the proposed operatitng targets.
In addition, its financial viability will depend on tiraely tariff increases
and such steps as the Government sha:Ll undertake to compensate the railways
for uneconomnic services.
53.        The long-term viability of the raiLway has also been analyzed.  In
the event of exclusive reliance on road transport for all transport needs in
the catclinent area of the northern system over the next 15 year period, the
economic return on all investments needed (from this project arid from thle
additional investments needed after 1983) would be 22%, at both shadow and
official exchange rates, showing tlhLat such a reliance would be uneconomical.
1/   Shadow pricing of foreign exchange would not significantly affect rate
of return calculations.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 322-MAG:      Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Pro ject;
US$15.3 million credit of June 30, 1972; Date of
Effectiveness:  April 30, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
Initially, the project was to rehabilitate andl extend, in the
Morondava area, existing irrigation systems, and develop 9,300 ha (4,700 ha
for smallholder rice, 2,700 ha for a tobacco state farm and 1,900 ha for a
cotton state farm); village development, roads, schools and health facilities
were included. The project as revised and substantially reduced in February
1976 will complete major civil works envisaged at appraisal, implement on-
farm development works on 2,500 ha of rice areas, establish an applied
research station, and provide agricultural support services, roads and health
facilities.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Major civil works (including construction of a diversion weir at
Dabara, rehabilitation of the Dabara Canal and the North Canal, construction
of secondary irrigation and drainage canals, and construction of the 8.1 km
road between Mahabo and Ankilivalo) are almost completed and work has been
satisfactory. However, SODEMO, the agency responsible for on-farm development
and agricultural services, faces serious management and financial problems and
as a result, on-farm development works have lagged behind schedule and agricul-
tural production is poorly organized, with a small area cultivated and very
low yields. The Government and IDA have agreed on a plan of action to clarify
SODEMO's responsibilities and financial plan and to improve overall management,
but this will require careful monitoring in the coming months.
Credit No. 488-MAG:      Railway Project:  US$6.0 million credit of June 27,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1974;
Closing Date: July 31, 1979.
The project comprises relaying of 60 km of track, extension of
yards and sidings, acquisition of fifty freight wagons, passenger coaches and
miscellaneous equipment; and provision of technical assistance to the railway
in management, financial and operational areas, and to Government for transport
planning and coordination studies. Because of cost overruns the Association
is financing only 35 out of the 50 freight wagons and 5 out of the 20 passenger
coaches originally included in the project; the Caisse Centrale of France is
financing 10 out of the remaining 15. Procurement of items in the credit has
been substantially completed.
The review phase of technical assistance to the railway has been
concluded. However, implementation has only been partially carried out,
and it is now expected that this will be included in a future Second Railway
Project. Technical assistance to the Government in the transport planning
and coordination areas has also been completed. The closing date was ex-
tended to July 31, 1979 to allow completion of procurement.
Credit No. 506-MAG:      Village Livestock and Rural Development Project:
US$9.6 million credit of August 21, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: June 17, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project encountered serious problems in the three years follow-
ing credit signature, and, principally because of legal and organizational
difficulties, little progress was made. Following significant changes in
institutional and management arrangements, the Credit Agreement was exten-
sively amended; the Amended Agreement became effective September 1, 1977.
The project's situation is much improved. FAFIFAMA, the principal
project implementing agency, is now well-established and operational, with
a full staff complement. Implementation of the project's most important
component - the development of veterinary and livestock services for village

producers - is proceeding well. Pasture improvement is also being undertaken,
but better monitoring of results is required. Schools and health centers are
being constructed, albeit behind schedule. The development'of water points
and road improvement began this dry season and results are fully satisfactory.
Cooperation with fokonolona institutions in all aspects of FAFIFAMA's work is
excellent. In the middle west, OMBY continues to provide extension services
to villages surrounding the ranches- established under the IBRD-financed Beef
Cattle Development Project. The pilot pig program and ODE09O cattle share
fattening programs have barely begun, with action limited to construction of
some buildings. Financing and administration arrangements have been worked out
however, and the share fattening program should get underway shortly. The pig
program has encountered two new problems; the fivondronam concerned has arrears
to the BTM and is therefore ineligible for new loans. Secondly, breeding stock
urgently required renewal. The Government is working to resolve these problems.
The Government has selected consultants for a study of cattle marketing and
meat prices, and field work for the study is underway; preliminary work has
progressed well. The Government has also retained consultants to evaluate the
results of the current program and to prepare a second phase project for the
Majunga faritany.
Loan No. 1065-MAG:       Mangoro Forestry Project; US$6.75 million loan and
Credit No. 525-MAG       US$6.75 million credit both of December 23, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: July 8, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
Tthe project assists in the planting of 35,000 ha of pine plantations
as part of an overall planting program of 96,000 ha, which it is proposed will
eventually supply a future pulp mill to provide pulp for export. The planting
program is progressing according to the schedule and cost estimates are likely
to be in line with forecasts, despite a reorganization of the project which
entails more building and infrastructure than originally estimated, and
the need for more intensive soil preparation than foreseen at appraisal.
Technical difficulties which occurred at the early stages of the project now
appear to be resolved.
Credit No. 641-MAG:      Fourth Highways Project; US$22.0 million credit of
.June 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 19,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government in the construction of two major
roads with a view to reducing transport costs and providing access to areas
with a high agricultural potential. It also includes training and strengthen-
ing of the country's road maintenance organization. Project implementation
is satisfactory. However, start of the training program for personnel in the
Ministry of Public Works on highway maintenance has been delayed.

Credit No. 663-MAG:      Second Education Project; US$14.0 million credit of
December 10, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 15,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is designed to assist the Government in decentralizing
educational control and to improve the quality of basic education. It in-
cludes five Regional Education Centres and vehicles for school inspectorate,
one Teaching Materials Production Centre and funds for textbook development,
technical assistance and fellowships.
Architectural design work on all project institutions is now com-
plete. Detailed operational planning for the Teaching Materials Production
Centre is being carried out. The two key technical advisors for this Centre,
provided by ORT (Organisation for Rehabilitation through Training) arrived in
Madagascar during September 1977. Architectural work has generally been well
executed although this has taken much longer than expected. Work on the major
project components, the Regional Education Centres, was completed about 14
months behind the appraisal schedule, although with ORT assistance, the plan-
ning schedule for the Teaching Materials Production Centre has been maintained.
The project is presently about one year behind schedule due to cum-
bersome Government approval/decision procedures, and the Government's recent
proposals for the "socialisation" of the construction industry has introduced
a further element of uncertainty which may adversely affect project imple-
mentation. Serious delays have also been encountered on: the preparation
of an educational sector survey; the establishment of a task force for educa-
tion evaluation; proposals for decentralization of education; and textbook
production.
Norway requested 50 percent participation in the project, and an
agreement to that effect was signed on December 16, 1977. The US$7.0 million
of IDA monies thus saved is available for future projects in Madagascar.
Credit No. 817-MAG:      Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project; US$33.0 million
credit of June 19, 1978; Terminal Date of Effec-
tiveness: May 31, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
The project would meet the growth in electricity demand until
1992 in the Antananarivo area and provide for the strengthening of JIRAMA,
Madagascar's national electricity and water corporation. It includes a
concrete diversion dam and an intake structure; a 4-km tunnel, underground
power house, tailrace and access tunnels; two turbines and two generators;
electrical and mechanical equipment; a transmission line to Antananarivo;
engineering services; preliminary investigation and design for a storage
reservoir; and technical assistance and training for JIRAIIA Staff.

The credit has not yet become effective. Additional conditions of
effectiveness are: (a) execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Government and JIRAMA and (b) signing of the external loans providing
the balance of external funds to be obtained by Madagascar and fulfillment
of conditions precedent to disbursement of such funds.
Tenders have been received for civil works, gates, turbines,
generators and switchyards. Total project costs are expected to be substan-
tially higher than estimated at appraisal.
