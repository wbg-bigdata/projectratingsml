MADAGASCAR
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Background
2
1.01      Madagascar has an area of some 590,000 km , and a population esti-
mated at only 9 million. Ninety percent of the population is working in the
agricultural sector, which accounts for 40% of the Gross Domestic Product.
Industry accounts for only 14% of GDP. With a per capita income of about
US$200, Madagascar is thus at an early stage of development.
B. The Transport Sector
1.02      Development of the transport sector has been influenced by:  (i) the
rugged topography and a tropical climate with heavy rains; (ii) an unevenly
distributed population, concentrated in a few isolated regional centers; and
(iii) the lack of suitable construction materials in some parts of the island.
These characteristics result in high costs for road construction and road
maintenance, which in turn sustain the relative isolation of the less popu-
lated regions. Transport needs are relatively well served on the central
plateau where half of the population is concentrated, but other regions rely
mainly on coastal shipping or poor roads.
1.03      Government policy towards transport development is stated in the
"Charter of the Revolution" of August 1975. The aims pertaining to transport
development are to: (i) connect regional capitals by all-weather roads;
(ii) construct the Antananarivo-Moramanga-Toamasina road; (iii) improve road
maintenance and; (iv) improve the transport organization and services.
1.04      Formerly in charge of transport coordination and infrastructure
development, the Ministry of Works (MAT) was split into three ministries in
1975: the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications; the Ministry of Public
Works (MTP), mainly responsible for infrastructure construction and mainte-
nance; and the Ministry of Transport, Supplies and Tourism (MTRT) responsible
for road transport regulations, the railway, the sea ports and air transport.
Both MTP and MTRT prepare transport plans and submit them to the Directorate
of Planning in the Ministry of Finance and Planning which is responsible for
coordination. In fact, there has been little coordination, due to the lack of
clearly defined programs in any sector, to the shortage of qualified transport
experts to deal with the increasingly complex issues involved, and to the
rivalry between the Ministries. MTRT was given assistance by the IDA-financed
team of transport planning consultants (Credit 488-MAG), who finished their



-2-
assignment in August 1978. This team, however, did not fully achieve its
major objectives, which were to improve the level and quality of transport
planning in Madagascar, particularly in the highway subsector. Its work was
impeded by the lack of cooperation between MTRT and MTP, by changes in its
work program, and by the shortage of competent staff as counterparts to the
expatriate experts. A local group trained as counterparts and attached to the
MTRT is now responsible for the transport planning and coordination function,
and their efforts are being strengthened with the increasing coordination that
is being achieved through the intervention of the Directorate of Planning of
the Ministry of Finance and Planning.
1.05      If in the past, the need to coordinate the investments in the
different transport modes was not clearly perceived since the only objective
was to provide a very basic transportation network, the need for a global
strategy in the transport sector and of intermodal planning will become more
acute as the network develops. The new road being built between Toamasina and
Antananarivo for instance is likely to compete with the rail for non-bulk
traffic. Although it is not expected to materially affect this project, a
close coordination will be needed in the future to optimize use of the trans-
port system in this corridor. Intermodal coordination on the country scale
would also help designing investment priorities based on complementarity
between the different modes and avoid duplication of investments.
C. The Transport Network
1.06      Madagascar's transport network consists of about 27,500 km of roads
of which only 4,500 km are paved; two unconnected railway systems totalling
860 km; 4 alongside ports and 11 lighterage ports of some significance; and
56 air fields of which 17 are all-weather standard.
1.07      The paved highway network (4,500 km) consists of a main north-south
artery connecting Mahajanga, Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa, an east-west road
linking Moramanga, Antananarivo, Tsiroanomandidy, and several short stretches
around the major coastal towns. A paved road linking Toamasina (ex Tamatave)
to Moromanga is being built with the help of the People's Republic of China,
work on which has recently been started. This road is expected to be com-
pleted in early 1980's and will compete with the railway for traffic on the
Toamasina-Antananarivo corridor. Its standards will be: (i) 2.5 m minimum
raidus; (ii) 8% maximum gradients; (iii) 6 m pavement width; (iv) 10 tons axle
loads; and (v) 25 tons bridge capacity.  It is not expected to attract bulk
traffic.
1.08      Most roads are generally of low standard, narrow, badly aligned,
and often in poor condition. Except in the southern region which has a dry
climate, heavy rains make many roads impassable, and for half the year the
north and part of the west have little or no road connections to the rest of
the island.



1.09      Poor maintenance remains a major problem for the road network.
MTP's Department of Infrastructure and Maintenance is responsible for the
maintenance of both primary and secondary roads, but lacks the funds and
organization to carry out its responsibilities efficiently. The recently
appraised (October 1978) Fifth Highway Project has concentrated on road
maintenance in order to improve the level and quality of maintenance
standards.
1.10      In 1976, the vehicle fleet consisted of 104,000 vehicles, of which
53% are automobiles, and 47% commercial vehicles. In the period 1961-70 the
automobile fleet grew at the rate of 9.0% p.a. and the commecial vehicles such
as trucks at the rate of 6.0% p.a. Since then, however, the vehicle fleet
growth has slowed down as indicated by the stagnation in oil consumption and
in new vehicle registration.
1.11      The trucking industry is generally competitive, although rates are
set by provincial authorities within a minimum-maximum rate system established
by Government. The official rates are enforced for goods transported for the
Government. These rates are somewhat lagging behind cost inflation, and
truckers generally charge higher rates for privately-owned goods.
1.12      Passenger transport is also regulated by the Ministry of Transport
and provincial authorities. Service is provided by cooperatives and indivi-
dual carriers. Entry to the industry is nominally screened by the Govern-
ment on the basis of supply and demand, but in practice all applicants are
admitted, although they are required to join a cooperative in their second
year of activity.
1.13      The Madagascar Railway dates back to 1913 when the main line between
Toamasina and Antananarivo was completed as a means of transportation between
the East Coast and the central plateau, where most of the population and
economic activities are located. In 1977, it carried a total of 823,300 tons
of freight over an average of 334 km, and 3.9 million of passengers over an
average journey of 69 km. The main freight commodities are chromite ore,
petroleum products and rice.
1.14      Madagascar has developed a very dense network of air transport as
a means to cope with long distances and poor surface transport infrastructures.
There are 56 airfields, 17 of which are built to all weather-standards. Two
airports are capable of handling large jets of the Boeing 707 type, eight can
handle Boeing 737 types, and the others handle DC-4's or smaller aircraft.
Wide-bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 747 can land only at Ivato,
Antananarivo's international airport.
1.15      Air Madagascar (owned 70% by the Government and 30% by Air France)
has a virtual monopoly over scheduled air services. It owns 18 aircraft,
including one B-707 for long distance services; two B-737's for domestic and
regional use; six twin otters and nine other light aircraft. Air Madagascar
has a cooperation agreement with Air France, and the two airlines will operate
jointly the Boeing 747 which has recently been purchased.

1.16      Madagascar's major ports are Toamasina, with two-thirds of total
national traffic, Mahajanga with 11%; Antomboka (ex Diego Suarez) in the north
and Toliari in the south, with about 4% each. They are used for both coastal
shipping and foreign trade. Coastal shipping is important for local transport
since the surface transport infrastructure is still inadequate.
D. Present and Future Role of the Railway
1.17      To date, the railway has played a fundamental role in the trans-
portation sector of the country and in the economy as a whole. Enjoying
almost a monopoly, the railway is by far the most significant transport mode
for carrying freight and passengers between the two eastern ports and the
chief population centers of the central plateau.
1.18      With the completion of the Toamasina to Moramanga road in the early
1980's, the railway's quasi-monopoly will cease, and an all-weather, fully
paved road will be available from Toamasina to Antananarivo and Antsirabe.
1.19      In spite of this new competition, the long term prospects of the
railway remain good. Consultants who have looked at the future total trans-
port situation in Madagascar, have found that the railway has a continuing
important role to play. First, a large proportion of the railway's present
and expected traffic consists of bulky and heavy commodities - petroleum
products, ores, timber, wood, etc. - transportation of which by road would be
uneconomical. Second, the traffic on the new road will be constrained by the
very difficult terrain between Brickaville and Antananarivo. The road will
have steep gradients, and narrow curves which will be difficult to negotiate
by heavily loaded trucks. Finally, if the railway were to close, the traffic
density on the new road would be such that either the road would have to be
rebuilt to higher standards than those presently considered, or its mainte-
nance costs would be prohibitive. As discussed in the economic chapter, the
railway will still provide the most economical transport means between the
East Coast and the central plateau.
1.20      In the early 1980's, the southern line (from Manakara to Fianarantsoa)
will also face some competition from a new road between the coast and the
plateau.  This competition should remain limited, however, because of the road
alignment selected and of the longer distance involved (263 km versus 163 km).
The light density of traffic is and will probably remain the southern line's
major problem; however, a study of this line's long-term prospects will be
carried out by the railway as part of the project.
1.21      The Government has been repeatedly stressing that it will continue
to support the railway in maintaining its important role and that the rail-
way's current and future investment plans will be accorded high priority in
the Government's development plans. The railway's management is in good
hands, the high calibre of the Director General being particularly noteworthy.
The railway has been managing its operations in a commendable manner under



- 5 -
very difficult circumstances as for example, poor track resulting in frequent
derailments, outmoded equipment, and shortages of spare parts, etc. However,
there is scope for improving the railway's overall efficiency and productivity
by providing essential replacements of its worn out track and equipment.
Although the railway's general management is capable, its financial management
needs to be strengthened. The introduction of appropriate tariffs and timely
reimbursements of accounts receivable from the Government and its agencies are
also crucial to the railway's financial well-being.
E. Past Bank Group Role in Transport
1.22      Bank Group lending to date in Madagascar has amounted to US$190.8
million of which the transport sector accounts for about US$93.0 million.
The highway subsector has received about 80% of this latter amount.
1.23      Involvement in Madagascar's  transport sector began in 1966 with
a highway project to help improve the trunk network in conformity with the
Government's policy of linking all the provincial capitals to Antananarivo,
the national capital. Accordingly, the First Highway Project (Credit 90-MAG;
US$10 million; 1966) provided for construction to paved standards of two
sections of the Antananarivo-Mahajanga road, totalling 145 km. A Project
Performance Audit Report (No. 1409) dated January 3, 1977 found that, because
the cost of the road construction was far below original estimates, the
project's expected economic return was exceeded. The remaining portion of the
Credit was used to finance supplementary works and studies which necessitated
a delay in formal project completion.
1.24      The Second Highway Project (Credit 134-MAG/Loan 570-MAG; US$8 mil-
lion; 1968) helped finance the construction of 146 km of road and the provi-
sion of three major bridges. A Project Performance Audit Report (No. 811),
dated July 18, 1975, found that the original economic justification of one of
the roads in the project, Ambilobe-Ambanja, which accounted for 54% of the
total investment, was doubtful in view of its low expected economic return
(8%) and the risk associated with the project. The other major component of
the project Fanjakamandroso-Tsiroanomandidy road (28% of the total investment)
had an economic rate of return of 21% at audit against 13% at appraisal. The
actual cost of the project was US$15.2 million in contrast to the estimate of
US$11.5 million. This represents an overrun of some 30%, of which about half
was due to price increases and half to quantity overruns. The overrun was
financed in large part by Government, but savings under the First Highway
Project also contributed some financing.
1.25      The Third Highway Project (Credit 351-MAG/Loan 876-MAG; US$30 mil-
lion; 1973) provided for construction of 417 km of primary roads, detailed
engineering of the Antsohihy-Ambanja road and a review of the traffic counting
system. In 1975, the project was modified due to substantial cost increases



and currency realignments, and a supplementary credit of US$5.6 million was
provided while construction was reduced by 67 km. This project is now
completed.
1.26      The Fourth Highway Project (Credit 641-MAG; US$22 million; 1976 and
cofinancing by the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa US$5.0 million)
is currently helping to finance construction of the 67 km of primary roads
deleted from the Third Highway Project and construction of 370 km of secondary
roads between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano. The primary road construction
is 90% complete, while the secondary road construction is expected to start in
the spring of 1979. Construction of bridges along the latter route is well
under way. A road maintenance component is also included, with consulting
services and funds for equipment procurement to improve highway maintenance.
1.27      A Fifth Highway Project has recently been appraised in October 1978.
The proposed objectives are the improvement of the country's capacity to
rehabilitate and maintain its road network. The project components are:
(i) rehabilitation and resurfacing of some 500 km of paved roads; (ii) con-
struction of bridges; (iii) improvement of road maintenance operations; and
(iv) provision of technical assistance and training. It is estimated to cost
the equivalent of US$42 million of which about US$34.0 million equivalent will
be in foreign currencies. The Association will contribute for US$24.0 million.
1.28      Lending to other transport subsectors began with a credit (200-MAG;
US$9.6 million; 1970) for extension and improvement of the port of Toamasina
(Tamatave) by providing for the addition of two deep-water berths, (making a
total of seven), a corresponding lengthening of the breakwater, a tanker
terminal, transit sheds, warehouses, open storage, cargo handling equipment,
as well as the establishment of an autonomous port authority and financing of
technical assistance in the form of consultants' services and expatriate port
management personnel. In 1973, the credit was increased by US$1.8 million to
cover shortage of funds resulting from currency realignments. The tanker
terminal was deleted from the project due to the high cost of its construction
resulting from delays in processing bids. Construction was completed in 1974;
and the project is virtually completed. The Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 2299 dated December 22, 1978) has drawn attention to the importance of a
cautious approach in requiring Borrowers to introduce untried institutional
reforms, and to the exercise of care in the selection of individual consultants
under technical assistance programs. Its conclusions are (i) the physical
objectives of the project have been satisfactorily realized; (ii) lower
revised economic return at 7.0% has been due to lack of traffic growth result-
ing from adverse local and international political and economic conditions
that could not have been foreseen at the time of appraisal; and (iii) although
the technical assistance towards institution building purposes did not produce
the expected results initially because of the low calibre of expatriate
experts, signs are now appearing that autonomy and better management are being
achieved by the port authority.



1.29      Government proposals for a major modernization program for the
railway have been under discussion since the early 1970's. In 1971, a Bank
mission identified a possible project consisting of the 1972-74 portion of
Reseau National des Chemins de Fer's (RNCFM) proposed 1972-76 Investment Plan,
which called for a total investment of about US$16 million. The plan was
subsequently changed several times and the version presented at th- time of
appraisal of the first railway project in 1973 covered the period 1973-77,
total investments having been increased to about US$43 million. Many of the
investment proposals, which included the construction of new lines and major
acquisitions of rolling stock were not, however, accompanied by sufficient
technical and economic data. Moreover, these investments were considered
premature, given the uncertainties of the role to be played by the railway in
the future, if the competing road between Antananarivo and Toamasina were to
be built. The Government and the railway agreed that the time span and com-
position of the Investment Plan should be limited to immediate needs for the
period 1973-75 and that the major investments originally envisaged should be
deferred until the completion of the railway modernization and rationalization
study proposed for inclusion in the project. The agreed Investment Plan for
1973-75 included completion of the ongoing realignment of the Ambila-Bricka-
ville section of the main line financed by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID); provision of seven locomotives financed by
the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and a minimum of
rolling stock, track renewal and track maintenance equipment to enable the
railway to carry projected traffic through 1976; and services of consultants
to improve the railway's management, investment planning and operational
efficiency.
1.30      The Bank-Group-financed first railway project in Madagascar (Credit
488-MAG; US$6.0 million; 1974) was designed as a "holding operation" to
assist the railway in replacing outdated equipment and to determine its
long-term prospects and requirements, as well as the needs in the transport
sector as a whole. It included that portion of the railway's 1973-75 Invest-
ment Plan for which financing had not been arranged, and technical assistance
to the Government in transport planning and coordination. The Bank-Group-
financed items included 60 km of track renewal, 50 freight wagons, 20 passenger
coaches, miscellaneous equipment, consultants' services for the railway and
provision of a transport planning team for the Government.
1.31      The physical execution of the project has generally been satisfactory,
though somewhat behind schedule. Cost increases have made it necessary to
reduce the number of wagons to be purchased (freight wagons from 50 to 35 and
passenger coaches from 20 to 15). Because of proposed changes in the constitu-
tion of public bodies, including that of the railway, implementation of
technical assistance to the railway in the administration and accounting areas
has been postponed and the proceeds of the credit released thereby have been
used to purchase 12 urgently needed ballast wagons. The project is virtually
completed except for a minor portion of technical assistance, the delivery of
the ballast wagons and some track work. The latter items are expected to be
completed in 1979.



1.32      The Bank Group's experience with the railway's ability to implement
the project has in general been satisfactory though its performance in achiev-
ing the financial targets has been disappointing because of the effects of
the recent economic recession and the delays in introducing tariff increases
required to achieve the 3% annual rate of return on net fixed assets required
under the credit. This rate of return has not yet been achieved. The
railway's operating performance indicators show that its efficiency has
generally improved over the years from 1975, though further improvements are
required in the administration and accounting areas of activity. The benefits
of this project are just beginning to materialize as the project is nearing
completion, but due to delays in the track renewal progrm, and to the poor
traffic growth, the full impact will only be felt in the future. The outlook
for the future can be promising, provided the railway's overall efficiency and
productivity can be maintained and appropriate tariff increases are introduced.
1.33      Generally speaking, while some projects have not been completed on
time, all have had satisfactory results from the point of view of their
physical objectives, in spite of the problems that have beset the country in
recent years. Institution building efforts towards developing financial
discipline have not met with the results originally intended, although of
late, the Tamatave Port Authority is showing signs of progress towards achiev-
ing financial stability.
II. RESEAU NATIONAL DES CHEMIN DE FER MALAGASY (RNCFM)
A. Introduction
2.01      Until 1965 RNCFM operated as a "Regie Autonome" under the old
Ministry of Transport with a substantial degree of autonomy. Since then the
railway passed through various forms of state control, from functioning as
a Government department to its present form as a state-owned public industrial
and commercial establishment (effective January 1, 1974) under Decree No.
74-154 of 1974. The Government reconstituted the various Ministries in 1972
and 1975, as a result, responsibility for overseeing the railway has also
been changing, and since 1975 it has been with the newly formed Ministry of
Transport, Supplies and Tourism.
2.02      The reasoning behind the re-establishment of the railway as a public
industrial and commercial establishment in 1974 was the intention on the part
of the Government to grant the railway a legal personality with operational
and financial autonomy at the urging of the Bank Group. The railway now has
the necessary powers to carry out its operations, but in the financial area,
the satisfactory integration has not been achieved between the accounting
activities of the railway currently being performed by the railway staff for
the Agent Comptable acting as representative of the Ministry of Finance on the
one hand, and the financial controls and accounting information needs of the

railway as an autonomous organization on the other. This has been repeatedly
urged by the Bank Group as a requirement under the previous project. Also,
the impact of the Charte des Enterprises Socialistes on the railway still
remains to be determined. Under this Charter, a policy making Orientation
Council would be established and made up of representatives of the State, the
Management Committee, the railway employees, and the National Assembly. The
Management Committee consisting of the General Manager, and representatives of
the State and the railway employees, would be the executive arm of the Orienta-
tion Council. The General Manager would be accountable to the Management
Committee. Further, the employees would elect a Workers Committee which would
look after their interests and which would be consulted on all reforms affect-
ing them. Also, a commission would be set up to look after various issues
affecting personnel matters. It is not known when the Charter would be made
applicable to the railway. During negotiations agreement was reached that the
Government and the railway would consult with the Bank Group before making
material changes in the statutes relating to the railway's present organization
and constitution.
B. Track
2.03      RNCFM operates an 860 km main line single track railway and some 175
km industrial branch lines and private sidings, in total 1,035 km of track.
The gauge is one meter. The railway is made up of two separate unconnected
systems, the northern system, with about 700 km of track, connecting the
capital, Antananarivo, to the industrial areas in the plateau region and to
the port of Toamasina on the Indian Ocean, and the southern system with about
160 km of track, connecting the semi-industrial town of Fianarantsoa and the
agricultural areas in the southern plateau region to the port of Manakara,
also on the Indian Ocean (map).
Northern System
Antananarivo - Toamasina (TCE)          -  374.8 km
Moramanga - Lake Alaotra (MLA)          -  167.4 km
Antananarivo - Antsirabe (TA)           -  154.1 km
696.3 km
Southern System
Fianarantsoa - Manakara (FCE)           -  163.3 km
2.04      The plateau regions are at an altitude of 1,200 to 1,500 m and the
railway has to cross very rugged terrain on its way to the coast. Gradients
of 2.5% are frequent and some are even as high as 3.5%. Curve radii are
small, down to 50 m. The difficult terrain has required a large number
of bridges and tunnels. The system has 362 bridges and viaducts totaling
8,046 m and 94 tunnels totalling 9,625 m.



- 10 -
2.05      There are 86 stations with an average distance of 10 km between
them, and a large number of other halts near large towns used for suburban
passenger traffic. The maximum distance between stations, which determines
the line capacity, is:
-    17.3 km on the TCE
-    19.4 km on the TA
-    18.4 km on the FCE
2.06      Marshalling yards are located at Toamasina, Antananarivo and
Moramanga on the northern system and at Fianarantsoa and Manakara on the
southern system.
2.07      The track is in poor condition throughout the entire system; only
40 km of track has been replaced with new rail in the last ten years. The
rail is badly worn, the sleepers, fasteners and fishplates are in poor con-
dition and the ballast is inadequate. About 50% of the points and crossings
are also worn beyond repair. Derailments, average two a week, of which more
than 50% are due to poor track conditions. To reduce derailments, speed
restrictions have been introduced to a degree that the line capacity is
affected. In 1977, the track on TCE was closed for 26 days because of derail-
ments, and train delays of 45 to 60 minutes each due to speed restrictions,
are frequent.
2.08      The track has 25, 26 and 30 kg/m rail and has both timber and steel
sleepers. It is adequate for sections carrying light traffic but not for the
heavy traffic sections on the MLA and TCE which need at least 36 kg/m rail,
reduced sleeper spacing and more ballast. RNCFM has already started this
track upgrading program. TCE has 40 km rail less than 5 years old and 335 km
rail between 25 and 40 years old. MLA has 19 km rail between 40 and 60 years
old, and 149 km rail over 60 years old (Chart 1).
2.09      The bridges, viaducts and tunnels are generally in good condition
in spite of recurrent torrential rains and cyclones which damage embankments,
erode subgrades and undermine subbases of bridges to the point where urgent
repairs are required frequently.

C. Signalling and Telecommunications
2.10      A train order system is used for directing the trains.  Signals
exist only at the approach to Antananarivo. All trains are controlled by
telecommunications to the stations from Antananarivo on the northern system
and from Fianarantsoa on the southern system.
2.11      The telecommunications system on the TCE line was modernized re-
cently by laying a new cable along the line and providing all stations except
Antananarivo with new equipment. On the other lines the system, including
cable, is old, in poor condition and obsolete, spare parts for which are no
longer made. Repair and selective renewal of this system are required.
Repair can be accomplished by using serviceable spare parts from the old
equipment released as a result of the recent and the proposed renewals.
D. Motive Power and Rolling Stock
2.12      RNCFM is fully dieselized and has 32 line locomotives, 24 shunters
and 13 motorized railcars. Eighteen line locomotives and 22 shunters are 24
years or older. Four shunters are 35 years old. The availability of line
locomotives is 87% which is surprisingly high. The horse power of the line
locomotives are as follows: two 260 HP ; four 625 HP; twelve 750 HP; six
1,000 HP; seven 1,200 HP; and one 3,600 HP. The 3,600 HP four bogie loco-
motive is mostly out of service because it requires specific tools and
specific spare parts, which are too expensive to store for one single unit.
It should usefully be replaced by one RNCFM standard locomotive. Although the
line locomotives still have a high availability, some of them are not powerful
enough for future traffic and have therefore to be replaced.
2.13      The oldest shunting locomotives will be ready for retirement within
the next few years; but some of the old line locomotives can however be
downgraded, when replacements are available, to shunters thus eliminating the
need for new shunters.
2.14      Most of the 13 motorized and 42 non-motorized railcars are in
good condition except two of each which are over 35 years old and should be
scrapped. The railcars are used for short distance movements, part of which
is commuter traffic in the vicinities of the larger cities. The railway has
also 43 specifically built coaches which can be used for both long distance
and short distance traffic; 14 of which, used exclusively for short distance
traffic, are over 40 years and will soon be scrapped. For long distance
traffic the fleet is adequate since 15 new steel coaches acquired under
the previous project are now in service.
2.15      The total stock of freight wagons numbers 1,052 units, 79 of which
are privately owned (77 tank wagons and 2 refrigerated wagons). Of the other



- 13 -
973 units 895 are allocated to the northern system and 78 to the southern
system. Their average availability is also remarkably high (95%) and the
fleet is in good condition, although about 250 units are more than 35 years
old. The turnaround times for different kind of wagons are also fairly good
as shown in table on page 29. About 160 of the wagons are more than 50-year
old, 10-ton, 2-axle types. These wagons are causing derailments when mixed in
trains with heavier bogie wagons which tend to lift the lighter ones off the
track. RNCFM is, therefore, planning to replace these wagons before 1982.
E. Workshops and Depots
2.16      RNCFM has a workshop for locomotives, coaches and wagons in
Antananarivo, depots for diesel service in Antananarivo, Moramanga, Manangareza
and Fianarantsoa, and sub-depots at Antsirabe, Mororano and Anivoramo. The
workshop in Antananarivo is old and does not lend itself to modular mainte-
nance methods. Furthermore, it is too small and working at its capacity
limit. Its restructuring is being considered for implementation in mid 1980's
and a preliminary plan is being prepared. Other depots will also need some
restructuring by the mid 1980's, in particular the Manangareza depot which
needs to be enlarged.
F. Container Handling Facilities
2.17      Container traffic is relatively new to the railway (starting
around 1971), and is limited to the main line from Toamasina to Antananarivo.
Container traffic is increasing; exact statistics, however, are not available
because until lately they have not been maintained separately. In Toamasina
the Port Authority is responsible for handling containers. In Antananarivo
the railway is responsible for handling containers which is done in the yard
area in the vicinity of the railway station using one fixed crane and one
mobile crane, and also at another yard nearby which is used as a bonded area.
Both yards are already congested and the increasing container traffic, which
is a valuable development for the railway, requires new and improved facil-
ities, which the Chamber of Commerce and the railway have agreed to provide.
The Chamber of Commerce will be responsible for the planning of facilities,
the building of warehouses, and the provision of loading and unloading facil-
ities, while the railway will be responsible for the laying of track. An area
close to a branch line of the TA line outside Antananarivo has been selected,
and the new container terminal is expected to be completed in 1982. During
negotiations agreement was reached that the Government and RNCFM will exchange
views with Bank Group on the development of the proposed new container handling
facility in Anatananarivo.

G. Organization, Management and Staff
2.18      Under the general supervision of the Ministry of Transport, Supplies
and Tourism and a Board of Directors, the railway is managed by its Director
General, who is competent. The Board is presided over by the Minister of
Transport, Supplies and Tourism, and has 12 other members mainly from other
Ministries. Its chief function is to approve the annual budgets of the
railway.
2.19      Under the previous Credit 488-MAG, provision was made for the
appointment of management consultants for effecting improvements to the
railway in two phases. Phase I was concerned with a review of the existing
situation and the making of recommendations, and Phase II was to be concerned
with the implementation of new and improved methods. SOFRERAIL (France) was
appointed as the consultants, and they commenced work in 1974. The areas
covered in Phase I included:
-    Organization;
-    Operations (including a study of the railway investment
needs based on a review of its operational transport plan);
-    Financial management, accounting and budgets;
-    Costs, tariffs and marketing;
-    Statistics;
-    Selection and training of personnel; and
-    Internal information.
2.20      SOFRERAIL submitted their report in August 1975.  Their recommenda-
tions were generally sound. However, questions as regards railway autonomy
and its practices in the personnel, organizational, financial control and
accounting methods were raised by the Bank Group and solutions sought from the
Government and the railway. Because of the uncertainties surrounding the
railway's autonomy, particularly in the light of the Charte des Enterprises
Socialistes, it was decided with the agreement of the Bank Group to postpone
in the ongoing Project the implementation of the consultants' recommendations
regarding organizational and procedural improvements in the financial planning,
management and cost accounting, data processing and information systems, until
the railway had the flexibility to benefit from the introduction of new and
improved methods. This flexibility is still lacking. The railway's financial
and accounting systems continue to operate within the framework of routine
bookkeeping concepts. The proposed project includes continuation of the
technical assistance for implementing a unified financial planning, management
and cost accounting and information system based on the recommendations of the



- 15 -
previous consultants. New personnel regulations for the railway as recom-
mended by the consultants were introduced in 1977. As a result it is expected
that the railway will be able to attract and retain competent staff in the
various cadres.
2.21      RNCFM's functional activities are adequately organized uader various
technical divisions and support services as shown in Chart 2. Management of
the day-to-day operations of the railway is carried out effectively by
competent staff. The planning activity as a regular exercise is limited to
annual investment and operating budgets. Long-term investment plans were
prepared in 1977 by the consultants under the previous project.
2.22      The railway currently employs about 4,500 people which is an optimum
number for a railway of this size. Relations with employees appear to be
satisfactory, although there was a partial strike lasting 21 days in July-
August 1977. This strike related to the personnel regulations introduced
effective July 1977, which the employees wanted to be made retroactive to
January 1977. Finally, the railway and the Government agreed to the strikers'
demands.
H. Training
2.23      RNCFM presently operates a training center in Antananarivo at the
railway headquarters. The center has been in existence for some time and is
essentially designed to familiarize new recruits and employees at lower levels
in the technical, operational and administrative aspects of railway operations.
The center's estimated capacity of some 100 places has not been fully utilized
in recent times, the annual output in the last two years being no more than
five trainees. This low figure has been due to the reorganization of the
training centre and the limited demand for formal training courses in addition
to the ongoing on-the-job training programs. Correspondence courses are given
for employees outside Antananarivo. In any case the railway is well-equipped
to provide most of the training for employees at lower levels. It is expected
that 15 new students will enroll for the 1978-79 courses. As regards training
for high cadre staff, the consultants, SOFRERAIL, have investigated and made
recommendations for the appropriate utilization of resources available in
Madagascar, especially at the technical schools and the university, as well as
for the training of a few in France. Three trainees have recently returned
from France after receiving training with the French Railways. Two more are
under training there now. These technicians will also help with the running
of the training center, as they were also trained to be instructors as well.
I. Traffic - Actual
2.24      Since 1962, the railway's freight traffic went through four phases:
a small decline in total tonnage (by 2.3% per year) from 1962 to 1966, the
years following independence; extremely fast growth (almost 12% per year) from
1966 to 1971; a sudden slump in 1972 due to the political disturbances;

followed by a slow recovery (about 0.7% per year) during 1973-77. Traffic in
ton-km followed the same trends, but with fewer fluctuations, because increases
in average haul distance have partly compensated by the decreases in tonnage.
The low 0.7% yearly average increase in freight traffic in the years 1973-77
has been due to the policies adopted by the Government which have had a
depressing effect on economic growth and which in turn have affected traffic
growth. It does not, however, reflect the long term potential for sustained
growth of the Madagascar economy and its transport sector. Passenger traffic
has steadily increased both in numbers and in passenger-km over the 15-year
period (by an annual average of about 4.5%). Since 1972, however, the growth
pace has considerably increased (8.7% in numbers of passengers, and 7.2% in
passenger-km). Suburban passenger traffic is growing faster than long-
distance traffic, resulting in the slower growth of passenger-km, shorter
average trips, and higher costs per passenger-km.
2.25      An analysis of traffic by commodities shows wide tonnage fluctua-
tions of tonnage over the past four years, particularly for cement, metal
products, textiles and industrial oils. These resulted from a variety of
causes: the lack of foreign exchange led to drastic cuts in imports of non-
essential commodities; the depressed level of economic activity in Madagascar
led to erratic imports; and finally the low productivity and labor unrest at
Toamasina port resulted in some traffic being rerouted through Mahajanga,
which is not connected to the rail network. Three commodities - chromite,
petroleum products and rice - accounted for 47% of total tonnage in 1977.
The decrease in chromite traffic between 1976 and 1977 - from 185,300 tons to
134,700 tons - was caused by difficulties encountered in marketing the ore.
2.26      Stations located on the TCE line account for 55% of the railway's
total ton-km, while those on the MLA, TA and FCE lines account for 36%, 6% and
3% respectively. With only 51,900 tons of traffic, the southern line FCE has
the lowest traffic density. On the TCE, TA and FCE lines, the traffic is
generally well-balanced in both directions, but on the MLA line, 92% of the
ton-km transported are going from Lac Aloatra to Moramanga.
J. Budgets, Accounts, Audit and Insurance
Budgets
2.27      RNCFM's operating and investment budgets are prepared annually
and approved by the Board of Directors initially, and then by the Ministry
of Finance before final approval by the Council of Ministers. The budgets
serve as approval mechanisms of the monetary limits within which the railway
is allowed to operate, they are not, however, used as management tools since
there is no regular feedback. Absence of specialists in this field has also
resulted in heavy reliance on consultants for long-term planning and the
preparation of investment plans. Thus the railway's proposed Investment Plan
for 1978-1985 was prepared by the consultants (SOFRERAIL, France) under the
previous railway project. In preparing the 1979-1983 Investment Plan which
forms the basis for the proposed project, the consultants' proposals for the
1978-1985 plan period served as a useful guide.



- 20 -
Accounts
2.28      RNCFM's accounting organization and activities are not clearly
delineated. The financial accounting is administered by the Agent Comptable
who is an official appointed by and responsible to the Ministry of Finance.
His responsibilities include those of a cashier and partly that of a con-
troller. As a cashier he takes care of payments and collections, and as
controller he examines the cash transactions for their propriety and authen-
ticity. Although working with the railway staff, he is responsible to the
Ministry of Finance and not to the railway management. The railway has its
own Chief of Financial Services, whose task is to monitor the transactions
from the budgetary control point of view. However, no budget control reports
are prepared on a regular basis, say monthly or quarterly, indicating the
status of operating and investment budgets, compared with actual performance.
Monthly reports showing operating results are not prepared. Financial accounts
are not maintained on a current basis and a reliable cost accounting system is
not in operation. Satisfactory solutions should be found for the unification
of the responsibilities exercised by the Agent Comptable on behalf of the
Ministry of Finance on the one hand, and by the railway's Chief of Financial
Services on the other. The consultants under the previous project studied
the problem, but their recommendations for improvements were not implemented
pending resolution of the question regarding the railway's autonomy and the
application of the Charte des Enterprises Socialistes to the railway referred
to previously in para. 2.02.
2.29      In order to overcome the above financial and accounting problems
it is essential that a unified financial and cost accounting system should be
set up and that it should be maintained on a current and commercial basis. It
is also essential that a finance manager with qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Bank Group be appointed to head the accounting and financial
activities in the railway. He should be responsible to the railway management
for the financial and accounting functions which should be responsive to the
needs of the railway as a viable and autonomous organization. The system
should naturally protect the interests of the Government as the owner of the
railway, but the Government should not be involved as its financial operator.
A similar problem in the financial organization and management had existed in
the case of the Toamasina Port Authority (Credit 200-MAG) and was corrected
with the help of a capable local consulting firm. During negotiations the
Government and the railway have agreed that a new financial manager for the
railway would be appointed before December 31, 1979, and that new consultants
would be employed also before December 31, 1979 to implement during 1980 the
unified accounting system and its organization, as recommended by the consul-
tants under the previous project. The cost of consultants' services is
included in the proposed project. Under the new system the Agent Comptable's
functions in the railway would be limited to carrying out post audit work for
the purpose of confirming compliance with public accounting rules. The
proposed project also includes provision for training of the financial manager
in advanced management accounting methods as applied to railway operations.

Audit
2.30      RNCFM's audit is conducted by a firm of public accountants and
carried out according to generally accepted auditing practices.
Insurance
2.31      RNCFM provides insurance coverage of its fixed assets and its
liabilities as a public carrier through self-insurance and follows the
practice of writing off all claims, damages, and losses against current
operations.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives of the Proposed Project
3.01      The proposed project is a continuation of the previous project under
Credit 488-MAG, which included track renewal, provision of wagons, coaches
and technical assistance. As part of the technical assistance, the railway
engaged consultants, SOFRERAIL (France), in 1977 to prepare an Investment Plan
for the period 1978-1985. The Government and the railway have basically
accepted the consultants' recommendations, and the proposed project is a
modified version of these recommendations for the shortened period of 1979-83.
3.02      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to help the
railway to continue to:
(a)  renew and modernize its fixed installations, motive
power, rolling stock, telecommunications, and
container handling facilities;
(b)  improve its operations and make them more reliable
and efficient through increased productivity and
capacity; and
(c)  improve the railway's management, operations,
documentation and information systems.
B. Scope of the Project
3.03      The proposed project is expected to achieve the above objectives
by including in its scope the following components:



- 22 -
(a) renewal of 160 km of worn-out track, improvement
of another 124 km, renewal of points, crossings and
procurement of track maintenance equipment and tools;
(b) replacement of seven line locomotives;
(c) replacement and new acquisitions of railcars, coaches and
wagons;
(d) improvement of telecommunications;
(e) replacement of workshop equipment; and
(f)  improvement of the railway's financial management and
accounting system, implementation of its new Transport
Plan, and carrying out of studies concerning the long-term
viability of Antsirabe-Antananarivo and Manakara-Fianarantsoa
lines, with the help of consultants.
C. Details of the Project
Track
3.04      The poor condition of the track is reducing the capacity of the
line due to a great number of speed restrictions and frequent derailments.
Increasing axle loads and traffic density call for heavier track, which
the railway has started introducing on the recently renewed sections by
changing 25-30 kg/m rail to 36 kgAm rail, reducing thS sleeper spacing, and
increasing the ballast from 0.2 m per meter to 0.8 m per meter. This track
renewal program will continue under the proposed project which provides for
renewal of 160 km of track, improvement of another 124 km, replacement of
136 points and crossings, and procurement of 47 ballast wagons, maintenance
equipment and tools.
3.05      Local wooden sleepers will mostly be used, but imported steel
sleepers have to be procured for the most steeply curved sections of the
track, particularly where there are also high gradients. The average life
of wooden sleepers will be increased from six to nine years to about fifteen
years by improved treatment with a new boiler included in the proposed project.
The present inadequate capacity for transporting logs from the forest to the
sleeper production and treatment plant will be increased by the construction
of an aerial ropeway also included in the proposed project. The present
quarry is exhausted, so a new site is being developed. Existing quarry
equipment will not have sufficient capacity fo5 the enlarged track renewal
and upgrading program, requiring some 55,000 m of ballast per year. The
proposed project, therefore, provides for an additional crusher.

Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.06      The four oldest shunting locomotives must be retired but can be
replaced by four downgraded line locomotives. Seven line locomotives will
be required to replace the downgraded units, and to cope with the 'oxpected
increase in traffic.   No line locomotives will be retired during the period.
Spare parts for the locomotives are included.
3.07      The short distance commuter traffic has been increasing steadily
over the last few years. The new railcar will replace two old ones which are
being scrapped, and the 10 new coaches will replace the 14 wooden body old
coaches.  The reduction in numbers of the new units is made possible by their
higher capacity and the expected increase in their availability.
3.08      The increased traffic on the northern system from 268 million
ton-km in 1976 to 328 million ton-km in 1982 (traffic statistics on pages 17
and 31) requires more wagons as shown below:

Total - All Types          1,417                1,052            365
The track improvement program and the implementation of the railway's Trans-
port Plan are expected to reduce wagon needs by 307, leaving a gap of 58.
The oldest (50 to 65 years old) two-axle wagons numbering 160 units will be
scrapped and replaced by wagons of 30 to 35 tons capacity. Because of the
larger pay-loads of the replacements, and of the expected improvements in
productivity, 76 new wagons instead of the 218 should suffice to meet trans-
port needs.
Infrastructure
3.09      The 14 km track section between Ambila and Brickaville requires
realignment and levelling to reduce the frequency of derailments and to
eliminate the need for additional locomotives for heavy trains, which cannot
otherwise negotiate the steep grades. The first phase of the realignment
(originally financed by USAID, and now continued by the railway on its
own) is expected to be completed during the first half of 1979, and is there-
fore not included in the project. The project provides for the completion
of the work as well as the rebuilding of the Brickaville yard at the end of



- 24 -
the realigned track. Also included are minor improvements of other yards,
upgrading of the telecommunications system, replacement of workshop equipment,
and repair of embankments and bridge foundations damaged by floods.
Technical Assistance
3.10      Technical assistance is provided in the following areas:  (i) imple-
mentation of a unified financial planning, accounting and information system
(paras. 2.20-2.29); (ii) supervision of the implementation of the railway's
Transport Plan (para. 3.18); and (iii) participation in the studies on the
long-term viability of Antsirabe-Antananarivo and Manakara-Fianarantsoa lines
(para. 4.31). The technical assistance is estimated to involve some 50 man-
months at an average foreign cost of US$8,000 per man-month.
D. Cost Estimates
3.11      The project cost is estimated at FMG 9,606 million (US$43.7) million
equivalent). Of this FMG 7,360 million (US$33.5 million equivalent) is in
foreign exchange, and FMG 2,246 million (US$10.2 million equivalent) in local
costs. Local taxes and customs duties are not included in the project cost,
and are estimated to amount to FMG 2,477 million (US$11.3 million equivalent).
During negotiations it was ascertained that the items included in the project
will be exempt from local taxes and customs duties. Details of cost estimates
are given in the attached table entitled "Project Cost Estimate 1979-1983" on
page 25. These cost estimates are summarized below:

considered as fixed. Price contingencies have been as follows: - for
imported items at the rate of 7.5% for the year 1979 and 7.0% for the years
1980 to 1983; and for local costs at the rate of 10.0% for the years 1979 to
1983.
E. Financing and Procurement
3.13      Of the total cost of the project amounting to US$43.7 million
equivalent, the foreign cost of US$33.5 million is expected to be met from
external borrowings, and the local cost of US$10.2 million, equivalent, is
expected to be financed from the railway internally generated funds. It is
proposed that the Bank Group provide a credit of US$13 million. CCCE of
France is expected to finance the equivalent of some US$20.5 million. The
above cofinancing arrangements were confirmed during negotiations. Fulfill-
ment of all conditions precedent to initial disbursement of the CCCE loan
would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit.
3.14      Equipment and material financed by the Bank Group will be obtained
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guide-
lines except for small orders of under US$25,000 each. These small orders are
not expected to exceed US$250,000 in total. These items will be procured
abroad or locally through local purchase procedures which are acceptable to
the Bank Group. The Bank Group is expected to finance track materials, points
and crossing, aerial ropeway and technical assistance; while CCCE will finance
ballast wagons, locomotives, motorized railcars, coaches and realignment
works.

F. Disbursements
3.15      Disbursements from the Credit will be made on the following basis:
(a) 100% of the foreign cost of imported materials and equipment
or 75% of local expenditures when procured locally;
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of technical assistance.
All disbursements will be fully documented.

Any savings on items to be financed by the Bank Group should be used to
finance the foreign exchange cost of similar additional items, should these
be found necessary in subsequent review of the projet and subject to a
request to that effect from the Government and RNCFM and approval by the
Association.

G. Project Execution, Environment and Employment
3.16      RNCFM, which will have direct responsibility for execution of the
project, is competent to execute the project. The Implementation Schedule
(page 30) was discussed and agreed to during negotiations.
3.17      The project will have no adverse effect on the environment, or on
employment.
H. Operational Objectives
3.18      In spite of the limitations in track capacity due to derailments and
speed restrictions, the railway is operating quite efficiently as evidenced by
the standard performance indicators shown on page 29. However, it will be
possible to achieve further improvements particularly in the utilization of
locomotives and wagons because the proposed project is designed to remove some
of the physical obstacles which the railway is contending with such as poor
track conditions. This in turn will make it possible to apply the new oper-
ational Transport Plan in full to railway operations by the time the project
is completed, and to rationalize train operations. Since improvements in
efficiency are expected to take place only towards the end of the project
period, no attempt has been made to establish intermediate targets. The
proposed operational objectives (page 29) below were discussed and agreed
to during negotiations.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Forecast of Future Traffic
4.01      Since 1972, Madagascar has been going through a period ot economic
and political difficulties which have resulted in almost stagnant rail
traffic growth. However in view of Madagascar's diversified and substantial
human and physical resources, and of the economic performance of the 1966-1972
period, a recovery is on balance considered likely.
4.02      Two factors make traffic projections for the railway particularly
difficult: (i) present abnormally low traffic levels do not provide a reliable
projection base; (ii) rail/road competition will begin to develop on the
Toamasina - Antananarivo corridor when the road from Toamasina to Moramanga is
completed (in the early 1980's) and, to a relatively minor extent, on the
southern corridor from Manakara to Fiananratsoa, beginning in 1985 when another
proposed road is completed. The planned Toamasina - Antananarivo road however
is of limited standards with steep gradients, sharp curves, and one lane
bridges. In the Manakara - Finanarantsoa corridor, the rail line is much
shorter than the proposed road (163 km versus 270 km).
4.03      Traffic forecasts were prepared using a three-pronged strategy:
(i) a sectoral analysis of Madagascar was carried out to identify the main
traffic flows for each commodity by origin and destination; (ii) a modal
allocation of these traffic flows was then made based on road/rail transport
cost differentials, quality of service and likelihood of cargo damage or
theft, and cargo value; (iii) these traffic allocations were finally compared
with information gathered on rail/ road competition on the Antananarivo-
Antsirabe line.
4.04      Based on this methodology and assuming a reasonable economic re-
covery starting in 1979 rail traffic in 1985 would represent some 82% of
total surface traffic in the catchment area of the northern system, excluding
traffic relating to new economic development projects to be implemented over
the next ten-year period. Rail traffic is expected to grow by some 3.4%
yearly, and total surface traffic by some 7.3%. The table on page 32 shows
the percentage of total surface traffic by commodity which is expected to go
by rail in 1985.  The tables on pages 33 and 34 show rail traffic projections
for the northern system until 1987, and the table on page 35 for the southern
system.
4.05      The railway's northern system should carry some 1,080,000 tons
of traffic by 1985, increased from some 768,000 tons in 1976.  This projected
growth is much slower than in the period 1966-1971, when traffic tonnages
increased by almost 12% annually. Some 58% of the estimated traffic -- rice,
ores, petroleum products, industrial oils, wood, etc. -- representing some
600,000 tons, is most unlikely to shift to the road because of the bulk nature
and the quantities involved.

4.06      The traffic forecasts do not include the Government development
projects to be implemented over the next ten years in view of the uncertainty
of their timing. These projects alone would ensure the long term viability of
the railways by generating some 900,000 tons of additional traffic yearly.
This is a conservative assumption since some of these projects are in an
advanced stage if preparation and would rely heavily on rail transportation,
such as a flour mill and a cement plant in Antsirabe, a ferrochrome plant and
a pulp mill in Moramanga, and fertilizer plants at Toamasina and Maintirano.
4.07      Passenger traffic which is still expanding in spite of the economic
slowdown, is expected to grow in the period 1978-1987 by 4.4% yearly in
numbers and by 1.7% in passenger-km. These assumptions are very conservative
compared to the 1972-77 period, when the growth rate was 7.6% for numbers of
passengers and 7.2% for passenger-km. The average trip length is expected to
decrease from 69 km in 1977 to 53 km in 1987 because of the increasing pro-
portion of commuters among the railway passengers. Passenger traffic growth
will slow down on all lines, but the largest reduction in the rate of growth
will be faced by the TCE (on the Antananarivo-Toamasina route) and the FCE
(from Manakara to Fianarantsoa) because of road competition and decreases in
the average distances travelled reflecting the higher proportion of suburban
traffic in total passenger traffic expected in the future. The respective
average yearly growth rates for passenger-km over the period 1972-77 when
compared to the period 1980-87 are expected to show sharp reductions from 6.1%
to 0.4% on the TCE and from 6.8% to 0.3% on the FCE. On the MLA and the TA
they will decline from 9.5% to 2.9% and from 8.0% to 3.5%, respectively.
Passenger traffic estimates are shown in the table on page 36.
B. Project Benefits and Economic Return
4.08      The only transport alternative to the railway between Antananarivo
and Toamasina is an earth road which is scheduled to be paved by 1981 at the
earliest. The benefits from all the project components have thus been com-
pared to the road alternative in order to have a standard basis to evaluate
the overall return. This project is limited to the investments needed to meet
the 1982-83 traffic level of some 300 million net ton km yearly.
Track Improvements
4.09      Most of the proposed track improvements and the track renewal pro-
gram correspond to deferred maintenance and the principal benefits will be
derived from better utilization of existing locomotives and rolling stock.
Due to the limited capacity of its maintenance equipment, until recently, the
railway has not been able to carry out all the required track maintenance, as
a result of which track condition has deteriorated to the point where renewal
is required.
4.10      On the northern system, the number of derailments due to poor track
was 28 in 1975 or 38% of the total number of derailments. Following the
introduction of speed restrictions it declined to 20 in 1976, but again



- 38 -
increased to 39 in 1977 due to worsening track conditions. The time lost
because of derailments, however, has increased steadily; 468 and 90 hours for
TCE and MLA respectively in 1975, 520 and 65 hours respectively in 1976, and
629 and 136 hours respectively in 1977. To these periods, during which the
line was closed, should be added the time lost because of speed restrictions.
Failing to renew and/or improve track at this stage would result in an exponen-
tial deterioration of the track which in turn would result in a rapid decrease
in the railway's operating efficiency. Speed would also have to be limited
further on a number of line sections to reduce the risk of accidents, each
limitation causing an estimated loss of 2.5 minutes per train, or 7 days per
year. With the present train schedule the number of speed restrictions could
easily triple over the next five years. The frequency of derailments, however,
is likely to increase despite speed restrictions. Assuming 10 additional
derailments per year due to poor track, each resulting in 12 hours of line
closure, the line closures would increase by 120 hours yearly. Speed restric-
tions and line closures would thus result in a substantial increase in turn-
around time for wagons and locomotives, by two days or more. With the longer
turnaround times, the existing fleet could only provide 204 million net ton-km
by 1982, as against the 240 million it provided in 1976, and the expected 295
million net ton-km traffic requirements of 1982. In addition, without the
proposed track upgrading program, it will be impossible for the railways to
implement the new operational transport plan proposed by the consultants, which
should also result in substantial turnaround time improvements.
4.11      With the track upgrading program and the new transport plan, the
present fleet could carry 275 million net ton-km by 1982. Therefore, if the
track upgrading program were not implemented, about 70 million net ton-km
traffic will have to be transported by road by 1982 at higher economic oper-
ating costs (US$0.10 per ton-km before the road is paved and US$0.05 per
ton-km after, versus US$0.025 for the rail). Assuming truck productivity to
be one million ton-km per year (20 ton trucks; 75% load; 65,000 km yearly),
this traffic diversion would require the purchase of 70 trucks at US$40,000
per unit, with an economic life of five years. In the subsequent years, ten
additional trucks would have to be purchased yearly to carry the 10 million
net ton-km additional traffic diverted from the railway due to the worsening
of the track, assuming only a linear depreciation of the tracks. Based on
these benefits, and allowing for the residual value of the trucks, the return
on the track upgrading program (49% of total project costs) over the 1979-
1980 period is 22% when shadow-pricing the foreign component and 21% at the
official exchange rate.  Without including the indirect benefits resulting
from the new transport operational plan, the return on the track upgrading
program would be 16%.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
4.12      Of the seven line locomotives included in the project, four will
replace the same number of old, less powerful line locomotives which are due
for retirement from line service, and the other three will increase the
railway's motive power to the level required by expected traffic. The four



- 39 -
locomotives to be retired will be downgraded to shunting service. This will
allow the retirement of two shunters which are over 30 years old, and provide
some additional capacity to cope with traffic increases in the yards.
4.13      Assuming there is no improvement in the railway's efficiency, wagon
requirements in 1982 would be an additional 365 units to the existing fleet
of 1,052. As mentioned earlier in para 3.08 the track improvement program and
the implementation of the railway's operational Transport Plan are expected to
reduce needs by 307 wagons, leaving a gap of 58 wagons of all types. General
freight wagons will mainly be in short supply while the productivity increases
are expected to result in a surplus of ore wagons. In addition, 225 general
freight wagons are over 40 years of age, of which at least 160 need to be
scrapped. To keep them in service would not only increase maintenance costs
but would also need high repair costs for a relatively short economic life.
Because of the larger payloads of the new wagons, however, no more than 76
should suffice to meet transport needs for general freight traffic if the
expected productivity increases materialize.
4.14      The benefits of this component stem from:
(i)  the increased transport capacity.  Even with the track
upgrading program and the implementation of the operational
transport plan, there is a gap of 20 million net ton-km to
reach the 1982 traffic level;
(ii)  the replacement capacity.  To maintain the traffic level
even with the productivity increases, the railways have
to replace four locomotives and some 160 wagons, which
would otherwise result in an additional traffic deficit
of 30 million net ton-km;
(iii)  the residual value of the new investments; since their
economic life is 30 years versus 5 years for trucks. The
scrap value of the old wagons and locomotives has been
deducted.
4.15      The economic return from the locomotives and the freight rolling
stock (21% of the total project costs) versus road transportation is thus
24% at both shadow and official exchange rates.
4.16      The railcar and the 10 coaches to be procured under the project
will be needed to replace 2 railcars and 14 wooden body coaches which have
largely exceeded their normal economic life (over 40 years life). The pres-
ent passenger fleet capacity for short distance and commuter traffic is
fully utilized and does not cope with the transport demand during the peak
periods. The 14 coaches are in such bad condition that they must now be
scrapped. If they are not replaced, an estimated 30 million passenger-km
a year would have to travel by road at higher operating cost (US$0.018 per
passenger-km, versus US$0.015 by rail). Their transport would also require
the acquisition of 40 buses costing US$35,000 per unit, with a six year



- 40 -
economic life.  The economic cost of the new railcar and coaches amounts to
US$3.8 million (10% of the total project cost), with a 30 year life period.
Based on the above savings, the economic rate of return is 10% at both offi-
cial and shadow prices. These investments are not proposed for Bank Group
financing.
Workshop Equipment
4.17       Without the proposed investments in this equipment, the presently
high availability of locomotives and wagons would not be maintained. It is
estimated that the availability would decrease by at least 1% by 1982; this
would imply a traffic loss of some four million net ton-km which would have
to be transported by road. The economic rate of return on these investments
is 18% at shadow prices and 17% at official foreign exchange rates (on 3% of
the total project cost). If the traffic were to be carried by rail, the alter-
native for the workshop would be to buy one locomotive at US$700,000 and 12
wagons at US$40,000 per unit by 1983. Allowing for the residual value of the
locomotive and wagons, this would give a return on the workshop equipment of
24% at the official exchange rate and of 17% at shadow rate.
Ambila Brickaville Realignment
4.18       Completion of realignment of Ambila Brickaville will eliminate the
most difficult portion of the track where the sharp curves result in frequent
derailments (10 derailments in 1977), and the steep gradients make necessary
additional banking locomotive assistance resulting in speed restrictions. The
total time lost due to derailments and speed restrictions on this portion was
estimated at 12 days in 1977. The proposed investments will thus result in a
better turnaround time which would give an additional capacity of 12 million
net ton-km a year to the railways. Without the project, the number of speed
restrictions and derailments will increase, although it is difficult to know to
what extent since the time lost in 1977 was already very high and renewal of the
track is at least needed if this portion is to be kept in service. Compared
to the road alternative, the return on this component is at least 12% at shadow
and 11% at official foreign exchange rates (on 8% of the total project costs).
Other Project Components
4.19       The benefits attributable to other items to be provided under the
project - telecommunication, repair of bridges and structures, improvement of
yards and crossings and technical assistance - accounting for about 9% of the
total project cost, could not be specifically quantified although their
benefits in terms of turnaround time improvement could be substantial.
However, these investments are essential to improve the general level of the
railway's operational efficiency, and have been included in the cost of the
project in estimating the overall economic return.



- 41 -
Overall Economic Return
4.20      On the basis of the benefits and costs described above, the economic
return for the overall project over the 1979-1990 period is at least 18% at
shadow prices and 17% at the official exchange rate. The project is designed
to provide some 137 million ton-km additional freight capacity yearly to the
railway (around 71 from the track upgrading programs; 20 from increased roll-
ing stock capacity and 30 from replacement capacity; 4 from the provision of
workshops equipment; and 12 from the Amaila Brickaville realignment works);
and some 30 million passenger-km yearly for commuter and short distance
traffic. This additional capacity should enable RNCFM to meet the 1982/83
projected traffic level of some 300 million ton-km of freight per year.
C. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
4.21      The major uncertainty of the proposed project is whether the expected
traffic will materialize. It could fail to do so either because the economy
may fail to recover within the projection period, or because road competition
may be stronger than forecast. These two uncertainties, however, were to some
extent already taken into account in the previous analysis.
4.22      Most of the investments are in fact needed even if rail traffic did
not increase at all throughout the projected period. Much of the proposed
program of track renewal and improvement corresponds to deferred maintenance
and should be carried out even without traffic growth. Since the railway has
no excess capacity above the actual level of traffic, failure to renew
the track at this stage will result in a decline in capacity. Without any
traffic increase, the return on the track upgrading program will be 10% at
both official and shadow exchange rates.
4.23      The purchase of locomotives and wagons is also partly justified on
replacement considerations.  If the traffic does not increase at all while
the projected productivity improvements resulting from the track upgrading
program and the new operational transport plan do materialize, there will
still be a deficit of some 60 wagons for general freight traffic if all wagons
over 40 years of age are to be retired. Because of the heavier payload of
the new wagons, this would justify the purchase of some 20 new wagons.  As
already explained in para 4.12, four out of the seven locomotives are needed
to replace four line locomotives to be downgraded to shunting service. One
additional locomotive would also be justified by the retirement of two 180 HP
locomotives too weak to be of much use besides yard services, and the sale to
a foreign railway of the 3,600 HP locomotive which performs poorly in the
RNCFM network. This strategy, advised by the consultants and approved by the
World Bank Group, will allow the railway to reorganize its fleet around a
1200 HP standard locomotive, and thus result in lower maintenance costs. The
benefits from this component will thus be to maintain the capacity to carry
some 35 million net ton-km of traffic by 1983, which would otherwise have
to be transported by road. This gives a return of 17% at both shadow and
official exchange rates on this component.



- 42 -
4.24      There would still be justification for the workshop equipment, the
passenger railcar and coaches, and the Ambila Brickaville realignment even if
traffic were to stagnate. Assuming no traffic expansion at all, which is an
extreme case since the railway is not even able to carry the present traffic,
the return on the whole project would be 10% at both shadow and official
exchange rates.
4.25      Assuming the forecast traffic increases do materialize, but the
road competition is stronger than forecast, i.e., a 50-50% split between rail
and road in 1985 for non-bulk items, the rail traffic would still not be
expected to decline below 300 million ton-'km after 1985, which is the capacity
the project provides for, because most of the traffic consists of bulk products.
In any case, road competition is not likely to materially affect this project
since the road is expected to be completed in 1981 at the earliest. The
increased road competition over the non-bulk traffic would be compensated by
the bulk traffic growth, in which the railway has a comparative greater
advantage, resulting in an overall traffic stagnation at about 300 million
ton-km carried by rail after 1985. The extent of the road competition will
however need to be closely analyzed when evaluating the additional investments
required by the railway after 1983.
4.26      A complete stagnation of the traffic or strong competition from the
road resulting in a 50% diversion of the non bulk traffic two or three years
after the road is completed are both unlikely. It must be emphasized that
the Government's major projects have not been taken into account in the
forecasts although their impact on rail traffic is expected to be substantial.
In addition, the new Antananarivo-Toamasina road crosses difficult mountainous
terrain; the operating conditions on such a road are thus expected to be
higher than the conservative operating conditions taken into account in the
calculations, increasing the rail economic advantage on this major line.
Finally the risk of a stagnation in traffic is much less important than that
of failing to provide sufficient capacity for the expected increases.
4.27      Another risk facing the proposed project is whether the expected
efficiency improvements will be achieved. In view of the railway's relatively
high standards of technical and operational capabilities, RNCFM should have
little difficulty in reaching the proposed targets.
D. Long Term Prospects of the Railway
4.28      The analysis of para. 4.08 through para. 4.20 showed that the pro-
posed project is economically justified taking into consideration costs and
benefits over the 1979-1990 period. The longer term prospects of the railway,
however, also warrant analysis. Accordingly, the economic viability of the
railway is considered by analyzing the consequences of its abandonment and



- 43 -
relying fully on road transport, particularly in the area served by the
principal (northern) part of the rail system. In the event of exclusive
reliance on road transport for all transport needs in the catchment area of
the northern system from 1979 to 1993, Madagascar would need to:
(a)  import some 350 20-ton trucks at a unit cost of US$40,000
because the available truck fleet is inadequate to cope
with additional traffic. Total traffic to be carried by
road is estimated at 350 million tons-km yearly from 1987
onwards;
(b)  meet higher operating costs.  A very conservative assumption
of US$0.050 per ton-km for trucks when the road is paved
versus US$0.025 for rail would generate additional costs of
some US$8.75 million yearly; and
(c)  replace the trucks every 5 years rather than after 30 years
for the rolling stock. No residual value for the tracks
and other infrastructure investments has been taken into
account.
4.29      To carry on its rehabilitation program beyond the scope of the pro-
posed project and cope with the expected rail traffic beyond 1983, the railway
will probably require an additional investment of some FMG 5,700 million
(US$25.9 million) between 1983 and 1986. About half of the investment is
expected to consist of acquisition of additional rolling stock (96 wagons,
6 non-motorized railcars, 3 motorized railcars and 6 locomotives), and the
other half of various infrastructure and track improvements.
4.30      Based on these assumptions and excluding passenger traffic and in-
vestments, the economic return from continuing railway operations versus the
road alternative over a 15 year period is 22% at both shadow and official
foreign exchange rates. This clearly shows that exclusive reliance on the
road for all freight transport needs in the catchment area of the northern
system would be uneconomical. Such reliance would also be difficult because
some 50% of projected traffic consists of bulk products such as minerals,
petroleum products, timber and to a lesser extent rice, which would require
the use of specialized road vehicles.
E. Uneconomic Lines and Services
4.31      Two lines of the railway system (the Antsirabe-Antananarivo and the
Manakara-Fianarantsoa lines) have light traffic density and have limited
prospects for growth. During negotiations it was agreed that their long term
viability would be studied during the proposed project implementation period,
and that the findings of the study will be discussed with the Association.
Agreement was also reached that the Government would compensate RNCFM through
appropriate measures, including the provision of funds, for any services found
to be uneconomical, but retained on other grounds.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past Performance
5.01      Financially, RNCFM's operating results have not come up to the
levels forecast at appraisal of the previous project (Credit 488-MAG).
The reasons are: (i) reduced traffic growth; (ii) higher operating costs;
(iii) inadequate tariff increases; and (iv) unavailability of income from
two sources previously forecast. First, as explained earlier in para. 2.24,
traffic has been growing at a reduced scale in the years 1973-77. Secondly,
personnel costs which constitute some 50% of the total operating costs,
have been rising somewhat steeply since 1976 at the rate of 17% in 1976, 15%
in 1977 and 25% in 1978. The railway claims that these increases were needed
to keep in step with general pay increases in the country, while the 1978
increase was also due to salary adjustments made as a result of the railway's
new personnel statutes. Thirdly, introductions of tariff increases after
approvals by the Ministries of Finance and Economy have been implemented
too late and on too small a scale. Tariff increases which should have been
introduced in 1974 were actually made effective in October 1976; and at 10%
for freight rates and 25% for passenger fares were insufficient. The Govern-
ment has been reluctant to approve further increases because they are seen as
contributing towards inflationary pressures. Fourthly, revenues from two
sources forecast in the appraisal report for the previous project have so far
not materialized: (i) CIBA, the wood treatment plant subsidiary of RNCFM for
producing sleepers and utility poles, has not been operating successfully
and as a result has not produced any net gains; and (ii) reimbursements for
concessionary fares granted by the railway under Government directives have
not been forthcoming from the Government.
5.02      The income statement summarized below shows the situation (at current
prices) from 1975 to 1977 compared with the appraisal forecasts made in 1973
for the previous railway project.l/ RNCFM has failed to achieve the 2.5% annual
return on net fixed assets through 1976 and 3% thereafter required under the
Project Agreement; instead it has incurred operating losses for the last two
of these years. The main issues which the railway faced during the period
1975 to 1977 are that operating expenses increased at an average annual rate
of 12% per annum due largely to high increases in personnel costs without
corresponding increases in productivity, while operating revenues increased at
a rate of only 9% because of the low volume of traffic and inadequate tariffs.
5.03      In 1971 RNCFM revalued its fixed assets, bringing the values in
line with current price levels, which resulted in a doubling of book values.
Revaluation of fixed assets was not a specified covenant in the previous
Project Agreement, and in the circumstances RNCFM's fixed assets have not been
revalued since 1971. Tariffs will have to be increased possibly by an addi-
tional 10% (over and above the 25% increase introduced recently) to cover the
accelerated depreciation resulting from a revaluation. During negotiations
agreement was reached that: (i) RNCFM will revalue its fixed assets on the
basis of replacement costs every year beginning in 1980; and (ii) that the
annual and accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect the revised
valuation.
1/   1978 accounts were not available at the time of the latest revision
of the report.

5.04      RNCFM's balance sheets are summarized below.  Current assets have
been increasing annually, because of the large amounts of accounts receivable
from the various Government agencies. This has also resulted in higher
current liabilities. As the debt equity ratio shows, RNCFM's debt has been
increasing slightly while the equity position is slowly eroding because of the
losses. The railway has been financing its capital additions through borrow-
ings mainly from the Association and CCCE.

B. Future Prospects
5.05      Projections of the railway's financial results have been made
through 1984. Projected operating revenues and operating expenses are shown
in the Income Statement given on page 49.
5.06      Traffic is assumed to grow at the rates projected in the economic
evaluation. Manpower increases to handle this modest growth are assumed only
for the traffic department, requirements of other departments being offset by



- 47 -
productivity increases. Consumption of materials and supplies is estimated
to increase at an average rate of 3% per annum.
5.07      In addition, the projections assume the following:  (i) the intro-
duction in 1979 of a real tariff increase of 17%, which cumulated with
the inflation rate would raise revenues by 25%; (ii) increases of oDerating
revenues and working expenses at a rate of 8% annually to reflect price level
changes caused by inflation; (iii) replenishment of shortfalls in RNCFM's cash
flow in 1978, the reimbursement by the Government of two thirds of the outstand-
ing receivables due by various Government agencies; (iv) timely collection of
accounts receivable; and (v) annual reimbursements by the Government to the
railway of amounts foregone by the latter on account of concessionary passenger
fares imposed by the Government. Arrears due from the Government on this
account starting 1974 are estimated at FMG 400 million. Since the railways
fixed assets have not been revalued the projected depreciation has been
calculated on the basis of historical costs and current values of the new
additions. In recent years, the new additions have been quite substantial.
5.08      The operating results shown in the projections, though not immedi-
ately meeting the financial covenant of the previous project, are reasonable
inasmuch as the financial viability of the railway takes a favorable turn.
The operating ratio improves from 95% in 1979 to 86% in 1984, and the annual
rate of return on net fixed assets in use (based on the historical values of
existing fixed assets and the current values of the new additions) shows an
increase from 1.5% in 1979 to 6.1% in 1984. In order to achieve the projected
operating results, the Government has increased the tariff level by 25% effec-
tive April 23, 1979; has reimbursed RNCFM of two-thirds of all the amounts
outstanding for more than 90 days due by the Government departments and agen-
cies as of October 31, 1978; and has agreed to reimburse the remaining third
before the end of 1979. During negotiations, the Government has also agreed
that all such accounts will be collected in the future within a credit period
not exceeding 90 days, and that it will reimburse RNCFM of the amounts foregone
on account of concessionary passenger fares.
5.09      The Government should clearly recognize the importance of establish-
ing and requiring RNCFM to operate within a framework of sound overall finan-
cial objectives. Specifically, the Government and RNCFM should take all steps
within their powers to ensure that:
(a)  RNCFM's tariff structure and levels are established in
accordance with appropriate economic and commercial
principles for railway operations; and
(b)  such tariff structure and levels cover the economic
cost of individual services and the individual carriage
of goods but, taken as a whole, such tariffs should:
(i) cover the full costs of services; and (ii) internally
generate such funds as shall be sufficient to service
RNCFM's debt, provide adequate working capital, and
make a reasonable contribution towards investment needs
including replacements.



- 48 -
During negotiations, the Government and RNCFM agreed that the above objectives
will be established for RNCFM and that these objectives will form the basis
for the decisions they will take in setting tariffs and controlling operating
maintenance and administrative costs.
5.10      The projected statement of Source and Application of Funds given on
page 50 shows that RNCFM should be able to achieve the above-mentioned
financial objectives.

5.11      The financing agencies are the Association and the French CCCE.
The Association will be making the credit available to the Government, and the
Government would then onlend the proceeds to the railway. It is assumed the
subsidiary loan will carry a rate of interest of 8% per annum and its life
will be 20 years with a grace period of 5 years. 1/ During negotiations
agreement was reached on the terms of the subsidiary loan. CCCE will be
making the loan direct to the railway and its loan will carry anL interest
rate of 6% per annum over 17 years including a 5 1/2 year grace period. The
railway will be executing the project, and financing the local currency
requirements from its own internal generation of funds. It was agreed during
negotiations that, if for any reason the railway should be unable to cover the
local currency expenditures under the proposed project, the Government would
make available all necessary funds to complete the project.
5.12      In making the financial projections, the railway's likely capital
additions and/or replacement requirements, including the local currency
expenditures under the proposed project, have been taken into account. Apart
from routine investment requirements of FMG 500 million in 1978 and FMG
1,000 million each in 1983 and 1984, no financial commitments for any major
investment plan other than the proposed project are envisaged. It is assumed
that such major investments will be financed through external borrowings.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that until the proposed project
shall have been completed, RNCFM shall inform the Asociation, before committing
itself to any capital expenditures not required in the proposed project,
exceeding FMG 200 million for any fiscal year of RNCFM or FMG 50 million for
any individual capital item. It was also agreed that the railway shall keep
the Association informed of all investments in the railway sector whether
public or private.
5.13      Projections of RNCFM's balance sheets are summarized below.  They
show that RNCFM is well-capitalized. The current ratio stays at reasonable
levels, and the Debt-Equity ratio ranges from 17/83 in 1979 to 32/68 in
1984 reflecting the borrowings for the proposed project.
1/   The annual rate of inflation in the most recent three-year period was
7.7%. Indications are that it might be slightly higher in the coming
years. The current interest rates charged by domestic lending institu-
tions vary between 7% to 9% per annum.

5.14      The previous Project Agreement specifies an annual rate of return on
net fixed assets of 3.0% starting 1977. The Income Statement shown on page 45
indicates that it is not realistic to expect the railway to achieve the above
rate of 3.0% before the 1980's. Therefore, during negotiations it was agreed
that the railway will achieve 1.3% rate of return in 1979, 2.5% in 1980, 1981
and 1982 and 3.0% thereafter. These are considered adequate for assuring the
railway's financial viability. However, it was agreed that in the light of
the revaluation of fixed assets in respect of year 1980 as envisaged in para-
graph 5.08 above, the Government, the railway and the Association shall agree
on revised rates of return for the purpose of maintaining the railway's
financial viability.
5.15      RNCFM's financial stability could be endangered if it were to incur
substantial additional debt. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that RNCFM will not incur any additional long-term debt without the Associa-
tion's prior agreement unless its net cash revenues for the fiscal year
or the twelve consecutive months immediately before the date of incurrence,
whichever is greater, would be at least 1.5 times its maximum debt service
requirements of any succeeding year on all its debts.
