PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND - POTASH ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 1947-TH)
PREFACE
On January 5, 1981, the Bank approved a loan of US$8.9 million
equivalent to the Kingdom of Thailand to assist the Ministry of Industry's
Department of Minerel Resources (DMR) in studying the technical feasibility
and ecnomic viability of a potash operation in rhailand, based on the
exploitation of local resources.
By January 1985 it had become apparent that there were severe
technical difficulties in progressing with the project and as a result the
total project cost, if the project were to be completed, would be
substantially above the original estimates and would require additional
sources of finance. The Bank's view, supported by the external consultants,
was that the project had imply demonstrated that there were high technical
risks and poor economic prospects associated with potash production from the
Bamnet Narong deposits, and that the project should be closed down. However,
the DMR did not endorse this view and reportedly they plan to proceed with
further investigations.
This report includes retrospective analyses of the project, its
justification and implementation, and draws conclusions from the experience
gained.
Comments received from the Borrowers have been taken into account
as appropriate in finalizing the report, and are reproduced as Annex I.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND - POTASH ENGINERING PROJECT
(LOAN 1947-T-H)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Thailand is located in a major potash consuming area that
includes the ASEAN Region (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia),
India, Japan, Korea, China and Oceania. With the exception of a negligible
potash production in Qinghai Province in western China, this region of the
world imports all of its potash requirements, mainly from Canada and
Jordan. Thailand, having substantial potash deposits, would be
strategically located to supply the East Asian markets if its deposits
could be economically exploited. On this basis, the Government in early
1979 requested Bank financing of a feasibility study to assess the
technical feasibility and economic viability of a commercial-scale potash
operation, based on the exploitation of the Bamnet Narong potash deposits,
the l&rgest so far identified in the country. The Engineering Project was
appraised in July 1980; the loan, in an amount of US$8*9 million, was
approved by the Bank in January 1981. It was signed on March 4, 1981 and
became effective on December 29, 1981.  The Project sponsor was Thailand's
Ministry of Industry's Department of Mineral Resources (DMR).
2.        The physical execution of the project was halted in September
1984, and the project was terminated in January 1985 (37 months after the
Loan Agreement became effective), when sufficient evidence emerged on the
technical difficulties and risks related to a possible potash operation in
Thailand and on the consequent discouraging prospects for an economically
viable project. DMR did not agree with Bank conclusions and felt that
appropriate technical measures could permit to proceed with a full-scale
exploitation of the potash resources. However, Bank staff are confident on
the soundness of their recommendations and believe that the available
evidence should persuade the Government against promoting the much more
expensive full-scale project. In this respect, the project reached its
main objective.

THAILAND - POTASH ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 1947-TH)
I.   PROJECT BACKGROUND, IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, APPRAISAL, APPROVAL
AND LOAN EFFECTIVENESS
1.        Potassium is an essential element for animal and plant growth
and, with nitrogen and phosphorous, is one of the three main
macronutrients. It is obtained through refining of natural ore or brine
deposits that exist on a commercial scale in only a limited number of
locations in the world. World potash reser!es are estimated at 17 billion
tons (K20); more than 80% of these reserves occur in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (USSR) and Canada, which are the first and second world
producers, with 13.7 million tons K20 and 10.6 million tons K20,
respectively, of installed capacity. Potash is produced in relatively few
other locations buit its extensive use throughout the world entails
transportation over considerable distances, so that location relative to
market is essential to assessing production sconomics. Potash consumption
in south, central and east Asia and Oceania accounted for about 3.3 million
tons K20 or 12.0% of world consumption in 1985/6. These markets, the
natural outlet of a possible potash production in Thailand, are expected to
grow at a faster pace than other regions; overall consumption in this area
is expected to increase to 4.7 milliot tons K20 by 1990 and to 5.6 million
tons K20 by 1995, corresponding to 15.0% and 16.'%, respectively, of
projected world potash consumption. With the exception of a small potash
production at Qarhan Lake, in the Qinghai province of the People's Republic
of China (PRC), the whole region is totally dependent on imports, and
currently obtains its potash requirements mainly from Canada and Jordan,
followed by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic
Republic (GDR).
2.        During the drilling of boreholes for groundwater exploration in
the 1950s, thick beds of rock salt were diacovered by the Thai authorities
in the Northeast of Thailand. Beginning in 1970, several drilling
programs, with a total of 110 boreholes, were carried out by the Department
of Mineral Resources (DMR) on the salt deposits. These programs
established the existence of three salt-bearing beds overlain with and
separated by claystones coverli.6 an area of 50,000 sq. km. in the Khorat
and Udon-Nakhon basins. Within this program, reconnaissance drillings
carried out by DMR, consisting of 63 boreholes at 40 to 50 kilometer
spacings, showed carnallite as the most abundant potash mineral,
intercepted in more than half of the boreholes drilled in the basins. High
grade carnallite (13-14% K20) was identified at Bamnet Narong and Udon
Thani. Subsequent development drilling of 33 boreholes in a 30 sq.km. area
at Bamnet Narong established the existence of a significant carnallite bed,
in sufficient indicative amounts that could economically justify its
exploitation.
3.        With the assistance of foreign consultants and on the basis of
the development drilling work carried out at Bamnet Narong, DMR established
that the amount of 'drilled indicated" potash mineral in the form of
carnallite was at least 230 million metric tons (mt) of carnallite at an
average 13.6% K20. Mineable reserves were estimated at 135 million mt of
carnallite. This amount of material could be capable of sustaining a



-2-
commercial-scale potash fertilizer operation of 1.0 million tons per year
(tpy) of potassium chloride (KCl) at 60% K20 for about 15 years.
Additional potential reserves appeared to exist in the project area. Given
the important size of these deposits, coupled with the favorable prospects
for potash marketing in the region, the Government decided to proceed with
a detailed feasibility study, including engineering design work, and in
1979 approached the Bank for possible financing. The project was appraised
in July 1980. The Board approved a loan of US$8.9 million for 20 years,
including 5 years of grace at the Bank's prevailing standard rate, to the
Kingdom or Thailand in January 1981 to assist in financing the detailed
feasibility work. The loan was signed in March 1981 but only became
effective in December 1981, due to delays in finalizing the contract with
the selected engineering firm.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND DESCRIPTION
4.        The objectives of the project were to determine the technical,
economic and financial viability of a potash project in Thailand based on
the carnallite deposits already known at Bamnet Narong, and to provide a
comprehensive information base which could be presented to potential equity
participants and sources of financing. Such a document would also include
an appropriate plan of exploitation and production, with engineering
design, equipment lists, and manpower levels to a degree of detail
sufficient for an accurate prediction of operat.ing levels, cost and
benefits, and recommended measures to ensure a rational, long-term
development of the sector.
5.        The Project consisted of (a) the execution of a feasibility
study, including trial mining operations; (b) provision of financial and
legal services to assist the Government in negotiations with private
investors to carry out the full-scale project if the feasibility study
established such a project to be viable; and (c) assistance to the
Government in the formulation of broad potash development policies. The
feasibility study was designed to be executed in phases to ensure that the
costlier parts of the study were carried out only after previous work has
established the desirability of proceeding further. The first phaWe
comprised the determination of the availability of raw materials, sinking
of an exploration shaft and initiation of trial mining operations,
execution of potash refinery tests, and preliminary review of infrastruct-
ure, utility and environmental requirements. Several interim reviews at
key stages were built into this first phase to determine courses of future
action to eusure the achievement of the objectives of the studies. The
second phase of the study was extended to include the execution of mirket
studies, completion of trial mining investigations, development of
appropriate mining methods, execution of preliminary design and engineering
for the mine and refinery, preparation of detailed capital cost estimates
for the plant, infrastructure and utility facilities, studies on
operational and marketing arrangements and execution of economic and
financial analyses. The second phase of the project was to proceed only if
justified by the results of the first phase,

III. PROJECT IMPLICMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.        With the Bank's agreement, DMR selected in April 1981 two
reputable firms one from the Federal Republic of Germany (PRG) as technical
advisor (the T.A.) and the other from the United States (USA) as financial
and legal advisors. A consortium of firms (the Consortium) from France, UK
and FRG was selected shortly thereafter by DMR, with T.A. assistance and
the Bank's agreement, for the execution of the feasibility study.
Negotiations were quite lengthy mainly because of difficulties in
translating into a contractual agreement the complex technical aspects of
the trial mining operation. The Government was very keen to exploit not
only the carnallite but also the overlying salt strata, to provide adequate
feedstock for a soda ash project then being considered to be installed in
Thailand to be financed by the ASEAN community. It was therefore decided
that instead of a shaft, a decline should be excavated, not only because of
its estimated lower cost, but also because of the possibility of using it
for initial small scale mining of salt and carnallite.
7.        The contract was finally signed on Docember 14, 1981.  The
overall work was expected to take 17 months, of which 10 months were for
Phase I and 7 months for Phase II.  (Some wo,k on geophysical surveys and
drilling took place prior to the start of Phase I.) The agreed contract
value was US$7.7 million, of which US$4.6 million was for the execution of
the decline and underground works. A key clause of the contract provided
that, if the Consortium encountered underground conditions which could not
reasonably have been expected, DMR would discuss and agree with the
Consortium the measures required to correct the conditions so encountered
and would negotiate a reasonable payment to the Consortium. This clause,
although typical of these types of agreements, would later give rise to
prolonged discussions between the client and the contractor.
8.        While certain components of the project (e.g. market and
marketing analyses, ore processing tests etc.) proceeded satisfactorily,
serious delays occurred in 1982/83 due to (i) difficulties in obtaining
customs clearance for the equipment imported for mining operations; (ii)
contractual problems with local firms hired to recruit miners; and (iii)
most worrying of all, serious difficulties in the excavation of the decline
due to weak and unstable formations in the clay beds in the deposit area.
The first two problems were eventually resolved with the active
intervention of Bank staff, but the third cnntinued to cause anxiety as
progress fell further and further behind schedule. By April 1983 the
tunnelling operation was five months behind schedule with only one third
(240 metres (m) out of 720m) of the decline having been completed; the
decline face was at 45m from the surface, while the carnallite mining
horizon was at 130m depth. Also, controversy had arisen concerning the
excavating techniques being used by the Consortium and the safety measures
being adopted.
9.        A major reason for the extra delay was an in-rush of water,
exceeding 200 litres per minute, from a borehole previously drilled ahead
of the tunnel; this led to an increase of water level in the decline.



- 4 -
Additional pumping capacity was quickly installed and the situation was
brought under control, but tunnelling work had to be halted.
10.       It was apparent at this stage that additional costs would be
incurred in continuing with the decline, grouting through adverse ground,
and pumping out the brine. The Consortium and DMR agreed that, before
embarking on discussions as to who should bear these costs (as well as
those arising from earlier delays), a program to drill additional boreholes
and carry out pumping tests should be implemented in order to assess the
presence of cavities, identify the location and cl.aracteristics of water
horizons, and evaluate the magnitude of the grouting work and the costs
involved. This program was carried out in May to July 1983 with the
participation of the T.A. and in the presence of a Bank consultant. Data
collected included core logging, geophysical logs (including resistivity),
gamma ray and neutron readings, in-situ hydrogeological tests and pumping
and recovery tests. Unfortunately, the collaboration between the parties
involved in the collection and interpretation of these data left much to be
desired, with a very limited exchange of views, results and basic data.
Indeed the first joint detailed discussion among all the parties only took
place during the subsequent Bank mission in July 1983.
11.       After examining the data obtained in the emergency exploration
and research program, the Consortium expressed the opinion that it would be
unwise to proceed with the construction of the decline, even as a temporary
measure with the decline lasting only for the duration of pilot mine tests
and the preparation of the feasibility study. In support of this view the
consortium adduced the following arguments (i) any methods for dealing with
the water problems, including grouting and satisfactory support, or even
freezing, were likely to give dubious results; (ii) water seepage from the
decline would have adverse effects in weakening the lower salt strata
located ovei the carnallite ores and in leaching these, thus spoiling the
chemical quality of the deposits and creating dangerous working condition;
(iii) there would be difficulties in handling the very large and heavy
structural components now required for roof support; and (iv) it would be
impossible to establish a decline vith adequate seal lining to achieve a
condition of absolutely no leakage. The Consortium therefore recommended
abandoning the decline, and establishing a shaft using freezing techniques
through the water bearing strata. The Consortium's preliminary estimate
for the cost of such a shaft.was about US$16 million.
12.       In retrospect all parties agreed that a shaft, as originally
envisaged at appraisal, would have been a better approach to overcome the
difficulties now encountered. However, it was also difficult to finally
conclude that the decline should be abandoned, since detailed technical
studies and analyses had yet to be executed, particularly in geology,
hydrogeology, support, and grouting. The Consortium therefore agreed to
execute further studies in order to determine the technical viability of
excavating the decline, focussing particularly on geology, support
htdrogeology, and grouting. These studies would facilitate a decision as
t> whether to continue or abandon the excavation of the decline.



- 5 -
13.       The desk studies and laboratory tests made by the Consortium,
consisting of geological and hydrogeological interpretations and of
laboratory grouting studies, were presented in September 1983; the
Consortium outlined alternatives for establishing access to the area
selected for trial mining. However, it was decided to adopt a prudent
apprc'ch consisting of field trial tests and drilling up to a maximum of
about 2900 mt to be executed over a period of three months at a cost below
US$0.15 million, starting by mid-October 1983, prior to reaching a final
decisiorn on future mine access works. Execution of this field trial phase
under the supervision of the Consortium was considered essential to
eliminate uncertainties in respect of actual grouting performance, and to
obtain specific confirmation of correlated geological trends along the
proposed courses of decline ex2avation.
14.       The report on the findings of these field tests was presented in
January 1984. Specialists from the T.A. and the Consortium and
representatives of DMR and the Bank participated. *fhree different
approaches were considered: (a) grouting from the surface, (b) grouting
from a gallery, and (c) grouting from the decline; however, none of these
approaches appeared to provide a safe solution to the problem. Having
received and considered the advice from all experts, DMR, supported by Bank
staff, informed the meeting that any plan for a continuation of the decline
could not be accepted as a viable proposition. DMR therefore proposed to
give priority attention to a shaft access to the trial mining area, and it
was agreed that a pilot hole would be drilled to assess ground conditions
in the location selected for the shaft sinking.
15.       The drilling of a shaft pilot hole was executed in February 1984,
and an additional and very serious cause for concern emerged: the drilling
indicated that the carnallite ore body contains considerable volumes of
inflammable and explosive gas, containing about 30% hydrogen. The
subsequent reexamination of carnallite cores from other drill holes in the
area under consideration indicated that the carnallite deposit in general
seemed to be gas-bearing. In the experience of the T.A., cutting
techniques during mining of potash ore under gas pressure could not be used
for safety reasons, since outbursts of rock of considerable volume were
likely to occur; in three of the T.A.'s potash mines in FRG no less than
310 C02 gas outbursts occurred between 1979 and 1982; 197 of these involved
rock blowouts. The situation of Bamnet Narong appeared to be even more
dangerous because of the presence of hydrogen; only in very few mines
(Sclikai;qk and Beresniki in the USSR) is potaa extracted under such
conditions. The T.A. recommended that it would be mandatory to resolve the
problem of gas outbursts and explosions before undertaking underground
operations; a special mining technology would have to be studied and
developed, for Which very little technical expertise is available
worldwide. The T.A. carried out a preliminary re-evaluation of the project
viability under the new conditions. This yielded an estimated ERR of about
15%; however, it was recognized that the assumptions relating to the
increase in investment and operating costs, due to the overall combined
effect of water in-rush, adverse ground conditions and presence of
inflammable and explosive gases, were extremely tentative, and that a very



- 6-
detailed study would be necessary before any conclusions could be reached
on the overall project viability.
16.       Bank scaff after lengthy internal discussions recommended to the
Government in August 1984 to halt the engineering project. The principal
reasons for this decision were: (i) the whole of the loan proceeds were
disbursed and significant additional funds would be required to proceed
with further investigations; (ii) no satisfactory method of dealing with
the water problem had as yet been found; (iii) the problem of inflammable
gas would have to be solved to safeguard men and equipment in any future
underground operations. Not only would such a solution, if it existed, be
likely to be expensive, but the current consultant had no experience of
dealing with such conditions; (iv) international prices for potash were
significantly lower than had been estimated at the time of appraisal
(currently US$85/ton kCl FOS Vancouver compared with an appraisal estimate
of US$115/ton).
17.       In the Bank view, the prospect of having a technically and
economically viable project appeared to be more and more discouraging and
there was little justification for additional costs and investigations.
The project was officially terminated at the end of January 1A5 and the
loan closed on May 30, 1985. DMR did not endorse the decision to halt the
project.
IV.  PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACTOR AND THE TECHNICAL ADVISOR
18,       Overall, the performance of the Consortium is difficult to judge,
given the negative results of the trial mining operations, the relative
inexperience of the DMR team and the decision to undertake a development
activity under a fixed price contract without adequate provision of
handling unforeseen events. In retrospect it appears that the risk and
related costs of the trial mining operations, especially for excavation in
clay, were underestimated. When the extensive problems arose as described
in paras. 8-15, there was no effective mechanism to achieve a high level of
cooperation between DMR and the Consortium to define the problems and
develop satisfactory solutions. Given the severe, unforeseen technical
problems that occupied all concerned staff, the training component received
less attention than originally envisaged.
19.       The performance of the T.A., was fully satisfactory; the T.A.
played a fundamental role In assisting DMH to monitor properly the
implementation of the project, promptly providing, when required, experts
of various disciplines to support DMR staff.
V. PERFORMANCE OF THE SPONSOR'S PROJECT TEAM
20.       With the exception of the project manager, the members of the
sponsor's project team were young and professionally inexperienced;
although they should be praised for their enthusiasm, dedication and
motivation. Thus, the DMR project teams relied extenaLvely on the
assistance of the T.A. to monitor the Implementation of the trial mining
operations. Difficulties were initially experienced within DMR, in



-7-
particular with regard to information flow between the DMR Project Team and
other units, These problems, however, were largely overcome towards the
end of the project, partly as a result of the catalytic role played by the
TeA.
VI. PR&JECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
21.       An overall implementation time of 17 months was estinated at the
time of the project's appraisal. In retrospect, the appraisal estimate
appears somewhat unrealistic, even if the project would have moved
smoothly. Adverse ground conditions encountered during the execution of
the trial mining operations were the main cause of the overall project
schedule slippage. Significant delays, however, originated from the time
needed for the loan to become effective due to the lengthy contract
negotiations with the Consortium and, later, from customs clearance
difficulties for the mining equipment imported by the Consortium. In the
event, the project was halted at the end of January 1985, 44 months after
the date when it was originally envisaged that the loan would become
effective.

The foreign exchange component of the project cost was totally financed
through the US$8.9 million IBRD Loan. The Government financed the local
component. The local expenditure was 60% higher than the appraisal
estimated, due principally to the difficulties associated with mining, the
much longer time to complete than had been estimated at appraisal, and a
greater load of geological testing than had originally been envisaged.
23.       The actual disbursement schedule is compared to the disbursement
estimate made at appraisal in the fol'lowing table.

VIII. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONS
24.       This project has been one of the more complex technical studies
recently financed by the Bank. It required the involvement of some of the
world's top experts in potash operations, and needed an extremely intensive
supervision effort by Bank staff (in eighteen months, four supervision
missions plus three technical meetings were carried out).
25.       As previously discussed, the project was halted due to technical
problems during the execution of trial mining operations. These problems
have received exhaustive in-depth analysis; consequently Bank staff are
confident that the recommendat-:on to the Government to halt operations at
Bamnet Narong was the only reasonable solution to minimize costs and
risks. However, although the project was not completed, it fully reached
its primary objective of providing conclusive (if negative) evidence on the
overall feasibility of a potash operation in Thailand; the work carried out
at Bamnet Narong zlearly indicated that a full-scale exploitation of the
carnallite deposits would be technically difficult and would pose
considerable safety risks; in theory the adoption of measures to overcome
such problems might be possible, but with a heavy impact on investment and
operating costs, thus affecting the economic viability of a full-scale
project. A preliminary economic assessment made on this basis showed an
ERR of about 4%.
In retrospect, the following conclusions can be drawn:
(i) Origital Project Justification
The main rationale for exploring the feasibility of a potash
project in Thailand, i.e. its location in the middle of a major



- 9 -
potash consuming area with no other significant local source of
supply, is still valid. Potash consumption growth in the region
has been substantially in line with projections made at the time
of project appraisal. Evolution of international potash prices,
however, has been significantly lower than estimated. At the
time of project appraisal it was estimated that potash prices
would remain in real terms at the levels prevailing at that time,
(US$115/ton KC1 FOB Vancouver) compared to the current
US$85/ton. This is another reason affecting the economics of the
project at Bamnet Narong, compounding the negative impact of the
likely heavy increases in investment and operating costs deriving
from the peculiar characteristics of the deposits.
(ii) Initial Availability of Data
At the time of project appraisal, the exploration section of DMR
had collected a significant amount of data concerning the Bamnet
Narong deposit. During project implementation, geological and
geochemical data provided by DMR were cross-checked and some
inconsistencies were found, mainly due to sometimes imperfect
procedures of collecting and logging samples. It was particular-
ly unfortunate that no early indications of gas-bearing potash
strata were available when the project started.  While the amount
of information to support a feasibility study appeared at first
sight to be sufficient, it turned out that it was not adequate to
predict the adverse conditions later encountered; the difficul-
ties experienced during the excavations of the decline exceeded
by far any reasonable expectation.
(iii)  Change in Project Scope
During contract negotiations, the change in scope from shaft
sinking to decline excavation (decided for budgetary reasons),
had a major impact on the problems later encountered during the
trial mining operations. In retrospect, it appears that, al-
though the outcome and conclusions of the project would not have
changed, the shaft sinking option would have proven technically
more compatible with the peculiar soil characteristics at Bamnet
Narong. The technical implications of such a change in scope
should have been fully assessed before its implementation.
(iv)  Project Contribution to InstitutiotrBuilding and Human Resources
Improvemett
Overall, the project has resulted in valuable training experience
for DMR and has stimulated improvements in the Department's
internal work organization and coordination. The project
promoted the setting-up of laboratory test procedures and
facilities, including computerization, useful for future general
research work. The project has also facilitated bringing into
DMR a considerable amount of external information and expertise;



- 10 -
this, together with the practical lessons learned during the
trial mining operation at Bamnet Narong, has greatly contributed
to improving the professional level of DMR's staff.
26.       Considering the large investment related to a full scale potash
project (in the range of US$300 to 400 million), this engineering pro-act
remains a relatively low cost way of minimizing the risks of a wrong
investment decision. Although these types of feasibility study are
expensive, bearing in mind the limited resources of countries such as
Thailand, they are essential elements in the development process. Such
projects not only exploit the national resources of a developing country
but also provide externalities through employment and infrastructure
development. The essential need is for adequate research, and geological
and geotectonic assessment to be completed before shaft drilling takes
place; water problems in potash mining are often encountered and in many
cases precautionary measures can be taken before the problems arise in full
scale shaft drilling.
