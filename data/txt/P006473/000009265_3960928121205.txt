MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF SANTA CATARINA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE LAND MANAGEMENT II PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the State of Santa Catarina with the guarantee of the Federative Republic
of Brazil for US$33.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years, including 5 years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would help finance a
land management and soil conservation project.
2.       Background.  In the 1970s, agricultural growth in Brazil averaged
4.2Z per annum based largely on the expansion of non-traditional crops
(soybean and citrus) and sugar cane for the fuel alcohol program. In the
early 1980s, the sector entered a period of relative stagnation. In spite
of a partial recovery in the mid to late 1980s due to some significant
increases in yields on specific crops (cotton, wheat, tobacco and rice),
Brazilian agriculture is experiencing efficiency losses with static or
declining productivity for a number of traditional export and food crops.
In large part, this is the result of soil erosion owing to increased
mechanization and expanded cultivation onto marginal land. Although
particularly pronounced in the older agricultural areas of the South and
the Southeast, it is also becoming a significant problem in the Center-
West. In addition to reducing productivity and farmer net income, soil
erosion has also been responsible for the silting of rivers and dams,
flooding, water pollution and the destruction of local ecosystems. It can
be halted and prevented through the participation of all farmers in a
microcatchment area in a program of improved land mLanagement. In the past,
however, traditional soil conservation approaches largely depended on
costly runoff control structures which required substantial subsidies and
produced delayed benefits. More advanced techniques, which are less costly
and have a shorter payoff period, focus more on increasing the vegetative
cover of the soil and improving soil structure and drainage through reduced
*          tillage, green manuring, liming and other improved cultivation techniques.
The use of these advanced techniques, kowever, has not been widespread in
Brazil. Current constraints underline the need to: (a) improve the
-          efficiency and effectiveness of incentives used to promote on-farm soil
conservation activities; (b) increase research to adapt soil conservation
techniques to different types of erosion within Brazil; (c) increase the
number of extension agents and farmers trained in conservation techniques;
and (d) develop a proper land use z' nitoring system.
3.       The State of Santa Catarina has an enterprising farming community
and dynamic, although financially constrained, agricultural agencies which
are eager to tackle land management issues. A pilot soil conservation
program was initiated in 1987, based on a participatory approach
implemented at the microcatchment level. However, financial and technical
constraints have prevented a more rapid and better focused expansion of the
program.

4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy in
Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic
growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic stability.
Concern for overall sustained development and continued growth in the
agricultural sector leads to heightened emphasis on efficient resource
allocation, increased institutional efficiency, environmental
sustainability, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support
systems to the poor. Increasing soil erosion problems in the South and
Southeast threaten to undermine past efficiency gains on the country's most
intensely utilized and productive farmlands. Through its support for the
proposed project, the second in a series of pioneer state projects, the
Bank would help develop innovative approaches for economically viable
investments in soil conservation and overall land management. The project
would combine the existing participatory approach based on microcatchment
farmer associations with an integrated and well-focused technical strategy
supported by an effective incentive program and implemented by trained
extension agents.
5.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would increase
productivity, improve the Santa Catarina farmers' net incomes and safeguard
state natural resources for the future through increased adoption of
sustainable modern forms of land management and soil and water
conservation. Farm profitability would be increased, while soil loss, the
silting of river beds and reservoirs, floods, the destruction of rural
roads, falling water tables, pollution of water sources and depletion of
natural resources would be reduced. The project would also strengthen the
State of Santa Catarina's capacity to implement more efficiently an
expanded land management and soil conservation program.
6.       Project Description.  Some 81,000 farmers -- more that 901 small-
scale -- residing in 520 selected microcatchments covering about 25Z of the
state farmland and distributed among 143 of the state's 199 municipalities,
would directly benefit from the project. Activities would include: (a)
adaptive research focusing on improved soil cover and soil structure (7Z of
total costs) (b); land use mapping, planning and monitoring (5% of total
costs); (c) public and private extension services to assist in planning and
execution of microcatchment soil conservation plans (24Z of total costs);
(d) financial assistance to microcatchment farmer associations through an
incentive program which would consolidate under a Soil Conservation Fund
(SC Fund) existing state subsidies for land management, soil conservation
and pollution control (121 of total costs); (e) erosion control works along
rural roads to reduce erosion ia the microcatchments (291 of total costs);
(f) conservation and commerci4l forestry development and natural resource
protection (12X of total costs); (g) project administration, monitoring and
evaluation (6Z of total costs); and (h) training (52 of total costs). As a
complementary activity to the project, the official credit system and the
participating banks under the Bank-assisted Agricultura,. Credit Project
(Loan 2971-BR) would provide project beneficiaries with on-farm investment
credit. Project activities would be executed by state agencies and
coordinated by the Secretariat of Agriculture, Supply and Irrigation
(SAAI), under the general guidance of a project Management Committee
chaired by the SAAI Secretary. A Project Administrative Unit (AU) within
SAAI would monitor project planning and implementation through its nine
regional coordinators in liaison with state executing agency coordinators,



- 3 -
cooperatives, agro-industries, private agricultural planning enterprises,
and municipal microcatchment commissions.
7.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$71.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$8.3 million (12x). The
project, to be carried out over seven years, provides funds for: civil
works; equipment and furniture; an incentive program for en-farm land
management, soil conservation and pollution control activities, which would
be gradually phased out during project implementation; technical assistance
and training; and, on a declinir.g basis, related incremental administrative
and operating costs.  The incentive program, through the establishment of
an SC Fund, would consolidate and reduce existing state subsidies set for
soil conservation and pollution control. The SC Fund of US$6.8 million
(excluding contingencies), representing about 11? of total on-farm
investments, would provide grants on a declining basis to partially finance
soil conservation subprojects in accordance with selection criteria
involving farm size and gross value of production. Grant rates and limits
and operating procedures would be provided for in an agreed Operational
Manual. Grants would be entirely phased out by the end of project
implementation as the priority of the microcatchments entering the project
decreases and the benefits of the program become more visible to farmers.
Retroactive financing of about US$1.2 million would be provided for initial
project expenditures incurred during a period of about ten months after
April 19, 1989, but prior to loan signing. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
bank group operations in Brazil are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. Two maps, and the Staff Appraisal Report No.7872-BR, dated
October 27, 1989, are also attached.
8.       Agreed Actions.  The State Government has agreed on the following
actions: (a) as conditions of loan effectiveness: (i) signing of nine
operating agreements between SAAI and the various project executing and
collaborating agencies; (ii) approval of a satisfactory Operational Manual
defining selection criteria, grant rates and limits and operating
procedures for the use of the SC Fund established under the project;
(iii) approval of the resolution regulating the project Management
Committee and the AU, and satisfactory staffing of the latter; and (iv)
satisfactory terms of reference for the baseline evaluation of the project;
(b) as conditions of disbursement: (i) for land use mapping, pl...ling and
monitoring, the hiring of a consultant to assist the state in developing
the system; and (ii) for erosion control works along rural roads, the
signature, prior to initiating any erosion control roadworks in a
municipality, of the contractual arrangement for the maintenance of the
road section to be improved; and (c) as other covenantst (i) presentation
to the Bank of the Technical Manual for land management and soil
conservation not later than June 30, 1990; (ii) annual evaluation of the
impact of the SC Fund and, as part of the project mid-term evaluation,
review of the possibility of advancing the phasing out of the grant system;
(iii) continued enforcement of the provisions of the decree complementing
the regulation of the existing environmental law or other similar state
legislation; (iv) maintenance of the project AU with satisfactory
structure, functions and staff; (v) completion of the project baseline



evaluation by June 30, 1990; and (vi) satisfactory terms of reference for
the mid-term and ex-post evaluation reports to be provided prior to their
commencement and the reports to be presented by June 30, 1994,   1
September 30, 1997, r spectively.
9.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from the increase in agricultural production through sustainable
productivity gains and land use improvements. At full development about
712 of the value of annual incremental output (US$41 million) would come
from seven main crops (maize, edible beans, soybean, wheat, tobacco,
cassava and oaion) and 29? from commercial forestry products.  The internal
rate of return calculated for the directly productive components with
readily quantifiable economic benefits is estimated at 152. Expanded
agriculture and forest activities would create employment equivalent to
some 3,900 man-years annually. Other benefits would include reduced road
maintenance costs and water source pollution, lower risk of flooding,
reduced pressure on remaining native forests to supply fuel wood, and
improved protection of local ecosystems.
10.      Risks.  The principal risk of the project is that the interest
among the farming community in controlling soil erosion could fail to
expand as a result of: a) farmers' reluctance to use commercial investment
credit for conservation activities in the current uncertain economic
environment; b) insufficient interinstitutional cooperation; and
c) shortfalls in counterpart funding. The project has been designed to
minimize these risks. The availability of grants through the SC Fund to
assist microcatchment farmer associations in financing soil conservation
and pollution control works, the availability of green manure crop seeds
and of planting material for commercial forestry development, and the
overall participatory philosophy of the project should encourage farmers to
invest in soil conservation activities. The integration of most project
executing agencies under the authority of the Secretariat of Agriculture,
Supply and Irrigation, the setting of a strong monitoring and evaluation
system, and a thorough training program should ensure efficient project
coordination. Finally, the support the project enjoys among state
authorities should help secure adequate counterpart funding.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
