ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
Program and Credit Suninary
Borrower:           Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Education
Amount:              SDR 104 million (US$150 million equivalent)
Poverty Category:    Program of targeted interventions. The program has specific mechanisms for
targeting the poor in urban slums and rural areas, and the proportion of the poor
among project beneficiaries is significantly larger than their proportion in the
overall population.
Program Description: IDA would provide financing for a time-slice of five years to help implement a
long-term NWFP government program in primary education with special
measures to improve girls' education. The objectives are to improve: (a) access,
equity and efficiency; (b) the quality of the learning environment; and (c) the
organizational framework, planning and management. Beneficiary participation
would be instituted as a means to achieve all of the above objectives.
Improved access, equity and efficiency would be achieved through reforms to:
(a) locate school sites only where justified by enrollment and community demand;
(b) reduce or consolidate schools with very low enrollment; (c) promote
mixed-gender schools in receptive communities; (d) increase the supply of female
teachers in rural areas by recruiting and training local women and by removing
disincentives for women to teach in rural areas; (e) upgrade girls' primary
schools to middle schools where enrollment is sufficient; (f) subsidize private
schools catering to low-income populations and rural girls through the Frontier
Education Foundation. The program would finance new construction (giving
preference to girls' schools), rehabilitation, rental of available facilities for
shelterless schools, and provision of ancillary school needs, including furniture
and equipment. Boundary walls and latrines would be provided for all new and
existing girls' schools.
Improved learning environment would be achieved through reforms aimed at: (a)
integrating and rationalizing existing textbook development and subsidizing
production so that all students have access to affordable, high-quality textbooks;
(b) providing every classroom with a minimal set of instructional materials; (c)
professionalizing teacher education through creation of a separate cadre for
teacher trainers and regular in-service teacher training; and (d) training of
Learning Coordinators to improve their ability to provide better academic support
to teachers. To reduce teacher absenteeism, the frequency of field supervision
would be increased through better mobility and an increase in the number of
Learning Coordinators.  The program  would finance faculty training and
i



equipment and materials needed for high-quality pre-service and in-service
training systems.
Improved organization. planning and management would be achieved through
reforms aimed at: (a) making school supervisors accountable for improvement in
student enrollments and achievement; (b) establishing policies and procedures for
monitoring quantitative and qualitative outcomes of primary education; (c)
promoting staff with ability and experience in primary teaching and field
supervision to senior positions in the education administration; and (d)
introducing Head Teachers in schools with five or more teachers. The program
would finance: (i) continued development and expansion of the present EMIS,
including a continuously updated school mapping program on which to base site
selection; (ii) annual student assessment; (iii) management training at all levels.
Beneficiary Participation would be encouraged through a policy of giving
preference in construction and teacher posting to villages with parent groups
(village education committees) that agree to support, manage, and supervise their
respective schools. The program would finance NGOs and field promoters in
community organization and parental education.
Benefits:            The five-year program is expected to increase primary enrollment by about
886,000 of which about 42% will be girls. This will increase the gross
enrollment rate (GER) for girls substantially, from 36% now to 60% at the end
of the program period. The GER for boys would increase from 71% to 94%.
Worldwide research has shown that primary education has the highest social
returns and that education of girls, in particular, will also lead to reduced fertility
-- which is particularly important in light of Pakistan's high population growth
rate of 3. 1 %. The recruitment and use of local women as teachers will show
rural parents that girls can be an economic asset, and thus encourage them to
send their daughters to school. Information-based decision-making in education
management and involvement of parents in school monitoring and supervision
will lead to increased participation rates and enhanced resource mobilization, the
latter through parents' donating labor or services. The Education Assessment
Programs introduce accountability of district-level officials and teachers for
student outcomes. Increasing the number of hours of active learning by pupils
in class as a result of a more pupil-centered approach will improve performance,
and thus students' and teachers' levels of satisfaction with schooling. This in
turn should reduce drop-out and repetition rates and increase the efficiency and
decrease per-student costs of primary education.
Risks:               The major risk is that the Government implementation agencies will lack capacity
to implement the program. This risk is alleviated by using the SAP Project as
a macro-level instrument to remove key bottlenecks to implementation, by
preparation of a five-year implementation plan, and by detailed Annual
Workplans.  In addition, provision of a donor-supported resident technical
assistance and integration of donor inputs will also facilitate implementation.
Another risk is the potential lack of female teachers to staff girls' schools in rural
areas. This risk is alleviated by a survey identifying educated girls willing to be
ii



teachers, who will then be recruited and trained through a Mobile Teacher
Training Program and local Teacher Resource Centers. Continued professional
and materials support are provided to these teachers through the Learning
Coordinators System.  Risks also attach to the development of community
involvement. In the past, beneficiaries have not been involved in community
decisions about schooling, which were taken by a few traditional community
leaders who tended to oppose to girls' education. The program would be
hindered if they do not relinquish control. This risk would be addressed by
establishing village education committees (VECs), which would consist mainly
of parents of children in the school catchment areas, regardless of their status in
the community. Another risk is the involvement of politicians in site selection
at the district level, which may result in school locations not suitable for
schooling. This risk will be alleviated through a program to prepare politicians
to use the EMIS for rational selection and monitoring of school sites.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
A. Introduction
1.1          Despite a record of satisfactory economic growth and some recent progress on human
resource development, Pakistan's social indicators continue to lag behind those of countries at similar
stages of development. In the education sector, both literacy and gross enrollment rates (GER) are among
the lowest in the world, and do not reflect the country's economic achievements. The present GER for
primary education of 58 % and the literacy rate of 29 % are far below the corresponding averages for other
low-income countries (75%  and 49%  respectively'). Low levels of literacy hamper the attainment of
other social and economic goals such as improving health and slowing the rate of annual population
growth, which, at over 3 % greatly complicates the task of making basic services universally available.
1.2          The slow rate of improvement in social indicators is the result of inefficient and relatively
low levels of social sector spending, as well as poor project implementation over many years. Systemic
and policy issues relating to the social sectors as a whole, as well as overall expenditure issues, are being
addressed through the Government's Social Action Program (SAP), which is currently under
implementation with assistance from donors. The SAP aims to increase the volume and efficiency of
social sector spending by addressing bottlenecks crucial to improved social sector performance. Its focus
is on the extension and qualitative improvement of basic services and, within education, on the primary
education sub-sector. Only through rapid increases in the capacity of this sub-sector (especially in rural
areas) will it be possible to generate enough students to reach the middle, secondary and tertiary levels
of education. Enrollments, particularly on the female side, are so small that middle level education
cannot yet expand at a rapid pace.
1.3          The North-West Frontier Province Primary Education Program (NWFP-PEP) is part of the
SAP initiative. NWFP's aggregate literacy rate of 21.5% is about two-thirds of the national average of
and conceals severe inequities between districts, rural and urban areas, and males and females2. For
example, the literacy rates for males and females are, respectively, 34% and 8%. The 55% GER for
grades kachi through five is only slightly lower than the national average. The GERs for girls and boys
in NWFP are 36% and 71 % respectively.
1.4          Enrollments in primary education in NWFP have risen over the last few years, but progress
has been slowed by rapid population growth. Current additions to educational capacity can barely
accommodate all the new entrants, much less make significant inroads into the substantial backlog of
under- and un-served areas. Girls' enrollment has grown faster than boys' over the last seven years, at
10.3% and 4.6% per year respectively. However, the declining relative percentage of girls to boys for
1/ The gross enrollment ratio (GER) is defined as the gross enrollment in primary level classes (kachi through 5th grade) as a percentage of school age
children. The enrolment and literacy estimates for Pakistan are taken from the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS); the comparator figures are from
the World Development Report for 1993.

each succeeding year in school indicates that girls are less likely than boys to stay in school for the entire
primary cycle.
1.5         NWFP's population of about 20 million is ethnically and linguistically diverse, and largely
rural. Over 16 million people reside in rural areas, in more than 9,000 villages and settlements.
Consequently, most schools are rural, with approximately two-thirds located in villages or small
peri-urban settlements.3 Half of NWFP's districts are in mountainous or desert areas which are difficult
to access and able to sustain only small, scattered villages. Thus, the difficulties of providing services
that will meet the diverse needs of the province, particularly of the far-flung areas and particularly for
girls, are apparent.
B. Financing of Education in NWFP
1.6               The Constitutional responsibility for the providing of social services rests with the
provincial governments. Hence, their fiscal status is a key determinant of the quality and coverage of
basic social services. While macro-economic performance has been satisfactory in Pakistan in the past
decade, revenues have consistently fallen short of public expenditures, leading to persistent, large fiscal
deficits. This is particularly evident at the provincia! level, where the provincial governments rely on
the federal revenue-raising effort to finance the bulk of their investment programs and recurrent budgets.
1.7         Over the last decade the overall financial position in NWFP has become increasingly
constrained, though some additional revenues were provided through the National Finance Commission
(NFC) award of 1991. Nevertheless, spending on the education sector in NWFP, and on the primary
education sub-sector in particular, has not been adversely affected. Total education spending (excluding
donor funds), though historically low, has increased from 26% to 29% as a share of total public
expenditures over the last eight years (see Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2). This is mainly due to growth in
recurrent expenditure on education, which grew by 6.8 % per year in real terms between FY87 and FY95,
compared to 4.8% for the total provincial recurrent budget. Since recurrent expenditures (largely for
salaries) make up the bulk of expenditures in the education sector, the sector as a whole has grown faster
than total provincial expenditures. Within the total education budget primary education has increased its
share from 28% in FY87 to 46% in FY94 and an allocated 52% in FY94 (excluding donor funds).
1.8               Recurrent Expenditures Between FY87 and FY95, the primary education recurrent
budget grew by over 15% annually in real terms, increasing its share of the total provincial recurrent
budget from 6% to 13 % (Annex 3, Table 2). The increase has been achieved by increasing primary
education's share of the total recurrent budget for education, from 24% in FY87 to 45% in FY95. As
a result, other education sub-sectors have stagnated or experienced negative growth.
1.9               Continuous policy dialogue and agreements reached under the Social Action Program
Project (SAPP) initiative over the past two years have led to marked improvement in the composition of
the recurrent budget. The non-salary budget has been increased from 3% in FY92 to over 10% in FY94,
with a significant share going to educational inputs, including stationary, crayons, library books, jute mats
and sports articles. However, about 15 % of total salaries go to chowkidars (watchmen) who have no role
in the delivery of education.
3/ Peri-urban settlements are those within a one hour's drive of a settlement of 5,000 or more inhabitants.

1.10             Development Expenditures Stagnant provincial expenditures on the development side
have been made up for by large increases in donor funding, which have allowed total development
spending (including donor funds) on primary education to increase by 10% annually over the last eight
years, from Rs. 390 million in FY87, to an actual of Rs. 738 million in FY94, and an allocated Rs.
1,506 million for FY95. Hence, primary education has increased its share of total development spending
on education from 44% in FY87 to an allocated 72% for FY95. Development spending on other sub-
sectors has remained fairly constant in absolute terms, but their relative share of total development
spending has decreased due to the influx of donor funds to primary education. Under this project,
Government spending would increase sharply in both absolute and proportional terms.
1.11             The influx of donor funds has altered the composition of expenditures to achieve a
better balance between civil works and employment generation on the one hand, and previously under-
emphasized educational inputs such as instructional materials and teacher training, on the other. For
exanple, non-salary educational inputs, which in the past accounted for less than one percent of recurrent
expenditures, receive enhanced funding through donor projects. Furthermore, development expenditures
have in the past been distributed unevenly between boys' and girls' schools, but through increased donor
funding this bias has become less pronounced. As a result of the SAP initiative, 60% of all new primary
schools have been earmarked for girls since FY93.
1.12             Nevertheless, as a result of the Government's weak commitment and low
implementation capacity, less than half of donor funds committed to primary education were disbursed
between FY87 and FY94. The utilization of government ADP allocations was 85%, bringing the
combined utilization of government allocations and donor commitments to 64% over the period. Though
utilization is improving, past performance highlight the need to restructure primary education development
expenditures so that more resources are devoted to improving the ability of executing agencies to
implement large investment programs. A number of policy measures under SAPP and under this project,
such as engagement of private management consultants for construction, have been designed to enhance
absorption capacity.
C. Major Sectoral Issues
1.13       The major issues confronting the primary education sub-sector in NWFP are similar to those
faced by other provinces: limited access, particularly for girls; high drop-out rates due to a poor learning
environment; low quality of education and poor student achievement due to teacher absenteeism,
inappropriate curriculum, poor textbooks, limited availability of supplementary learning materials, and
weak teaching; problems with the timely release of funds; and inefficient operation and management of
the primary education system. Of particular concern in rural areas are low enrollments, especially of
girls, due to inadequate coverage and inadequate supply of qualified, especially female, teachers. These
issues all reinforce one another; for example,low female enrollments, high drop-out rates and poor student
achievement jeopardize the steady supply of female teachers required for further expansion of coverage
to girls in the rural areas.
Access, Equity and Efficiency
1.14             Insufficient availability Over 40% of the 8,763 villages in NWFP lack a government
girls' school and a quarter lack a boys' school. In non-urban areas, where over 80% of the population
resides, opportunities for schooling are particularly limited. Even if average enrollments were brought
up to the recommended level of 40 students per classroom through measures to improve access and

retention, the number of classrooms would have to increase by over 100% over current levels in order
to reach all children between the ages of five and ten.
1.15              Facilities are in far shorter supply than teachers, as indicated by an average
student/classroom ratio of 45 to 1, compared to a student/teacher ratio of only 34 to 1. The distribution
of facilities, students and teachers is very uneven, with many under-enrolled and overstaffed schools, and
conversely, many that are overcrowded and understaffed.
1.16             Unequal opportunity Of the 20,317 government primary schools in NWFP, only
4,395, or 22%, are for girls. This imbalance results from a historically segregated school system where
a male administration from the district level and below manages all boys' schools and a duplicate,
separate female administration manages all girls' schools. The policy of separate schools has drastically
limited educational opportunity for girls as the emphasis has been on increasing the number of boys'
schools only. As the demand for girls' education has risen, some parents are sending their girls to the
only schools available in the village, i.e. the boys schools. However, not all parents are willing to send
their daughters to a boys' school with a male teacher. Thus the girls' enrollment rate has been about half
that of boys due to lack of appropriate schools. Furthermore, because they have not been officially open
to the female half of the children in the same village, schools in rural areas have often been under-
enrolled and hence inefficient.
1.17              Recently there have been signs that parental opposition to coeducation is diminishing.
According to a 1991 Human Resource Survey funded by USAID, over one-third of all primary schools
in NWFP are now co-educational. Parents in 72% of NWFP's peri-urban villages will accept a mixed
school or male teacher for girls in the kachi to third grade range, and parents in 44% of the villages will
accept them for grades 4 and 5. To reduce gender inequities and increase enrollments, cross-registration
was introduced in both boys' and girls' schools in 1993 as part of the SAPP-supported policy reforms.
District Education Officers (DEOs) have been encouraged to enroll girls in boys' schools and vice versa.
The increasing acceptance of mixed schooling suggests that, in the future, one larger and more efficient
primary school, rather than two costly single-sex schools, may become an accepted way of educating
children at the primary level, particularly if the teacher is female.
1.18             Inefficiency Low enrollments in rural schools and high drop-out and repeater rates
are major contributors to inefficiency in the primary system and to rapidly escalating per-student costs.
In 1992-93, over 30 % of posted teachers taught classes with fewer than 20 students; only 15 % of teachers
taught more than 40 (see Annex 1, Table 10). Repeater rates are also high. Based on EMIS data for
AY92 and AY93, every year between 8% and 10% of pupils in each grade repeat that grade (Annex 1,
Table 5). Both repeater and drop-out rates have declined over the past five years, but remain higher for
girls than for boys.
1.19             Private Sector There are currently about 1,500 schools in the regulated private
sector, mainly in urban areas, catering to middle and upper middle class income groups. An unknown
number of unregulated private schools also exists. To reduce the burden on provincial finances and
increase gross enrollment, the GONWFP is encouraging private sector involvement in primary education
through the Frontier Education Foundation (FEF) and through an improved regulatory framework for the
private sector (see Annex 4). The FEF will be particularly active in areas where market failure exists,
and where the private sector can operate with lower costs than the Government.

Learning Environment
1.20              Most schools in NWFP lack the resources required to create a successful learning
environment, including proper physical facilities, adequately trained teachers, and instructional materials
such as textbooks, science kits, and supplementary readers.
1.21             Physical Facilities Though NWFP has few schools that are shelterless, the physical
facilities of most government primary schools in NWFP are very inadequate: 37% need repairs beyond
routine maintenance; five out of every six lack toilets (a particular problem for girls); over 70% lack
electricity; and about half lack drinking water (see Annex 1, Tables 13 and 21). Furniture is sparse to
non-existent. Schools are often overcrowded, particularly in urban areas, with 60 to 100 students
crowded into small classrooms and extending onto verandas or courtyards. Repair, upgrading and routine
maintenance of school buildings and facilities are constrained by inadequate budgetary allocations, as well
as by non-use or mis-use of funds allocated for these purposes.
1.22              Teacher Trainin,:  The quality of the training teachers receive, as well as the
numbers trained, have important implications for the education system. It is widely held that the current
system of teacher training does not adequately prepare teachers for the multi-class, and multi-age
environment prevalent in most primary schools. Nor does available training upgrade subject matter
knowledge significantly.
1.23              Since 1988, four major studies of teacher training have been done. The essence of
the findings is that the staff of the Government Colleges for Elementary Teachers (GCETs) are poorly
trained and under-motivated, use inappropriate methods, have poor facilities, and do not supervise the
teaching practice of student teachers in a way likely to enhance teaching skills. Assessment of the
students depends entirely on rote performance. In this impoverished learning environment, the key topics
of primary teacher training,-- i.e., promotion of literacy and numeracy and development of skills to treat
learners' difficulties--are not addressed. GCETs are supervised by the Curriculum Bureau (CB), which
lacks the capacity to effectively oversee teacher training.
1.24             Primary Teaching Certificates (PTCs) are offered through twenty-two GCETs in the
province, fifteen for male teachers and seven for female. However, there is no institutionalized system
for training of trainers. GCET staff are usually transferred, often against their wishes, from secondary
schools, and have neither first-hand experience with primary teaching nor the incentive to learn about it.
The Principals of GCETs also lack a firm grounding in the profession of primary teacher training. A
recent study of teachers' content knowledge shows inadequate grasp of mathematics and science and only
slightly better knowledge of Urdu. No remedial "content knowledge" is taught in GCETs. Furthermore,
the results on the same tests before and after the one-year PTC course showed only minimal gains.
1.25             Teachers are supposed to receive in-service training every five years. But in practice
many never get it, and the rest receive it only sporadically. NWFP has a backlog of 9,000 teachers who
have never received in-service training. A condensed PTC course of three months duration has been
offered to experienced teachers during their vacations. Tutors for the short course are mainly secondary
teachers whose commitment to, and knowledge of, primary education is poor. Although the Curriculum
Bureau reports difficulties in enforcing attendance of tutors and PTC candidates, the short course has
proved popular with untrained teachers because their service is regularized on passing the final exam; and
virtually all pass. The enhanced salary and regularization of service given to those who achieve PTC
status is not matched by noticeable improvements in classroom practices, however.



6
1.26              The scale of in-service training required to meet the needs of 50,000 teachers is
beyond the capacity of the CB and the GCETs to provide. In-service needs are almost limitless, given
the abstract nature of the initial training, and the condensed course training which are all that most
teachers have had. Increased numbers of Learning Coordinators (LCs) and Assistant Sub-District
Education Officers (ASDEOs) will be necessary, to serve both as tutors and, more importantly, to provide
instructional support and supervision for teachers.
1.27              The problems of inappropriate teacher training and ineffective teaching are magnified
by the extensive existence in NWFP of multi-grades, with many under- and over-age children. To
manage and teach multi-grades more effectively, primary teacher candidates should learn the implications
of instructional practices for student learning, how to assign "contingent" tasks that keep children engaged
in learning even when teachers are busy with other classes, and how to use student tutors productively4.
No resources are presently allocated to solving the special problems of multi-grades, however, not just
in terms of teacher training, but also in terms of textbooks, facilities and curriculum.
1.28              Textbooks and Instructional Materials The only instructional materials available in
most schools are textbooks of poor content and physical quality. Yet the textbook assumes a position of
central importance, as it is the sole vehicle for the curriculum.  It is usually the only source of
knowledge, information and pedagogy available to the teacher, and it is the basis of all assessment.
1.29              Furthermore, the textbook may be one of the key determinants of enrollment.
Textbooks must be bought by parents. If parents do not purchase textbooks, their children do not go to
school. A recent study has shown that teachers lay great stress on the possession of textbooks (at least
the basic textbooks of Urdu and Math) and copybooks. Most children at school possess the basic
textbooks, which are of very low quality and in some cases need to be replaced several times during the
school year.  Most children also purchase at least one or two copybooks.  Children are under
considerable pressure from teachers to make sure that these items are brought to school. Recent data
indicate that textbooks and copybooks can amount to as much as 45% or more of the cost of primary
education to poor parents, which may greatly influence their decision on whether or not to send a child
to school.
1.30              Textbooks are currently prepared by the NWFP Textbook Board, according to topic
outlines developed by the Federal Ministry of Education. The Board does not test its materials based on
scientific methods in actual schools during or after the development phase. Instead, it depends on the
experience of the author and the opinions of experts for judging the suitability of curricula and textbooks.
In the absence of a rigorous and scientific process of school trials and revisions before final publication,
the effectiveness of the materials suffers, as does student learning. To some extent this is a question of
capacity, which could be expanded through the introduction of inexpensive measures such as the use of
test editions5. Several donors have been developing parallel sets of textbooks in NWFP, but their use
has been limited to a few experimental schools. This situation is likely to improve as a result of the
Textbook Board's recent decision to publish donor-produced materials that are acceptable to the
Curriculum Wing of the Federal Ministry of Education.

1.31              Textbook design has also been complicated by the lack of reliable student achievement
data as a source of information on which to base textbook reform. Previously, the only data available
were grade 5 examination pass rates, which are neither valid nor reliable measures of how well the
textbooks are achieving the objectives of primary-school instruction. The recently established North-West
Education Assessment Program (NEAP) now tests a random sample of children in grades 3 and 5 at year
end in science, math and language, which may help to illuminate needed reforms in those textbooks.
Organization, Planning and Management
1.32             Inadequate management. In 1991, the Directorate of Schools within the provincial
Department of Education was split into Directorates of Primary and Secondary Education. This was done
to strengthen the organizational focus on primary education, which had been neglected in favor of
secondary education in the old Directorate of Schools, where neither budget nor personnel were
specifically earmarked for primary education. The perception of primary education as less important than
secondary education was reflected in a lack of facilities and materials for primary schools as compared
with middle and high schools. The lack of organizational focus on primary education was further
repeated at division and district level.
1.33             While the administrative structure of the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) is
now firmly in place at provincial, district and sub-district levels, the DPE has yet to institutionalize
dynamic and efficient data-driven and merit-based management practices. The focus of DPE staff remains
on routine functions such as posting and transfers, inquiries and complaints, and on administrative, rather
than academic and supportive, supervision of schools. The lack of operational and financial flexibility
at lower tiers in the system, coupled with lack of accountability and the absence of discretionary funds
at district levels, makes it rigid and unresponsive to actual local needs.
1.34              Policv-Making and Planning. Sectoral policy-making and planning have been severely
constrained by the lack of timely and accurate data about the education system. The validity and
reliability of data collected in the past was not systematically checked; nor was it analyzed or used as the
basis for sectoral developments or improvements. The data were also not sufficiently detailed to allow
for evaluation of the impact of past or current policies and sectoral investments on enrollments and
student achievement. Over the past three years, a provincial Education Management Information System
(EMIS) has been established and expanded, and a large body of research has been carried out. However,
this information is not being used by education planners or by politicians who are heavily influencing
sectoral management decisions.
1.35             Communication and data flow between the various actors in the sector and between
donors has been slow or non-existent, leading to poor coordination of sectoral activities and duplication
of inputs. Preparation of sectoral development schemes was done on the basis of the expected availability
of funds, without taking account of demand or local needs or the capacity of the executing agencies. The
planning process was frequently distorted by a political process which influenced site selection for
schools, as well as teacher recruitment and transfer decisions and admissions to teaching colleges, without
regard to needs or merit.
1.36              Staffin,. Staff management at the provincial and district level is complicated by
DPE's lack of complete autonomy to select and deploy its own staff. At the district level, DEOs are
legally vested with the authority to decide most staffing issues, including hiring, firing and transfers.



8
However, as the DEOs are often subjected to intense political pressures, and in practice these issues are
usually referred to the provincial level for resolution.
1.37              While the overall teacher: student ratio is generous at 1:34, there is severe imbalance
due to frequent teacher transfers to more desirable locations. Absenteeism is high and morale low
among primary teachers. Salaries stagnate early on in a primary teacher's career and upward mobility
is extremely limited because administrative staff are recruited from the secondary-schools cadre. Besides
depriving the primary teacher cadre of career choices, the exclusion of the less educated but more
experienced primary teachers from administrative positions deprives the system of a potential source of
informed supervision.
1.38         Furthermore, there is currently significant unmet demand for female teachers willing to
teach in rural areas, which exacerbates the detrimental impact the unequal provision of facilities has on
girls' enrollment. The shortage of females with the required teaching credentials is particularly severe
in the more isolated districts. Distance, difficult and sometimes dangerous living conditions, cultural
barriers and an allowance system that provide negative incentives to teachers in rural areas, all serve to
prevent urban-educated females from travelling or relocating to rural areas.
1.39              Supervision of primary schools is generally confined to periodic but infrequent school
visits with checks of enrollment, facilities, teacher absenteeism, and other routine information. The
intended academic support function of supervision is neglected because supervisors frequently have no
experience teaching primary children. To improve academic supervision, Learning Coordinators (LCs)
have been hired to provide on-the-job instructional support to primary teachers. As the LCs are recruited
among primary teachers, this new cadre serves a dual purpose by improving the prospects of promotions
for primary teachers while improving the quality of learning in the classroom. Moreover, if the 2,000
schools with more than five teachers recognized one of them as the Head Teacher, then a potential 2,000
supervisors would be added to the supervisory strength. However, school supervision continues to be
hampered by lack of transportation. This particularly complicates the work of female LCs, whose
mobility in remote areas is more restricted. Furthermore, LCs (and other supervisory staff) are few in
number, and suffer from excessive workloads.
1.40              Efforts by the DPE to professionalize its staff in primary education management are
impeded by lack of an adequate staff training program. Staff training needs include instruction in more
effective management techniques which are linked to outputs.  This would facilitate increased
accountability for performance and student outcomes, including student enrollments and achievement.
Beneficiary Participation
1.41              The beneficiaries have the most immediate stake in improving the accountability and
effectiveness of the services delivered. Policy makers are often disinterested in rural primary education,
and the Government has difficulty in accommodating local needs and preferences in the planning process.
In the absence of local involvement, the result is often indifference on the part of parents, leading to low
participation and retention rates.
1.42              To address this problem, IDA's Balochistan Primary Education Program sponsored
a highly successful community participation program in Balochistan, which features village education
committees (VECs) drawn from the parents of children attending the local school. As a result, many
VECs constructed their own school building, using local materials at no cost to the Government, and



9
attendance has been near-perfect at almost all such schools. UNICEF is now introducing a similar
program in three districts of NWFP.
D. Government and Donor Strategies in Primary Education
1.43             The First Seven Five-Year Plans (1955-93). While the goal of universal primary
education has been enshrined in all five-year plans since Independence, the education sector has not
received the required political backing or the financial support necessary to attain this goal. Nor have
policies been adequate to the task. Hence enrollment and literacy rates have remained well below targets,
as well as below those of comparable countries. During the first five plans, spending on education never
went beyond 2 % of GNP; it rose above 2 % for the first time only during the Sixth Plan . In addition
to increasing sectoral allocations, the Sixth Plan also substantially changed sectoral priorities to emphasize
primary and secondary education over higher education, a mass literacy program, increasing enrollment
of girls, and education facilities in rural areas. Variable political commitment and frequent shifts in
government policy toward education have also reduced the effectiveness of the resources available to the
education system. In 1972, all private school except a few elite institutions were nationalized, thus
increasing the stress on a public system that was already heavily overburdened. While the nationalization
policy was reversed during the Sixth Plan, the private sector has only slowly responded to the improved
policy environment.
1.44             Since the mid-80s, the Government has attracted substantial resources to primary
education from donors. Major programs of quality improvement and expansion in primary education,
with emphasis on girls, are being financed by IDA and other donors in Punjab and Sindh. USAID
provided substantial budgetary support for primary education development programs in NWFP and
Balochistan starting in 1990, but this support was withdrawn in 1994. ADB, UNICEF, ODA, NORAD,
Netherlands, and KfW are also supporting improvements in quality or coverage. However, these donor-
supported operations have been fragmented, duplicative and sometimes run in opposite directions. As
a result, all projects have experienced implementation problems and disbursement lags.
1.45             The Social Action Program: In 1991, recognizing that its social indicators are very
low compared with most other Less Developed Countries, the Government of Pakistan began drafting a
Social Action Program (SAP) with the purpose of greatly improving the provision of basic services in
education, family planning, health, and water and sanitation. The SAP has now evolved into a
framework for action to improve the planning, programming, budgeting and implementation of all
on-going and new programs and projects in the social sectors, with emphasis on integration of donor
inputs. The SAP represents a strong new commitment by both Government and donors in partnership
to focus attention and resources on removing critical political, policy, institutional and financial
constraints to improving effectiveness of social services. It is intended to remove endemic and systemic
constraints in implementation of programs and projects and to expand the absorptive capacity of the
Government.
1.46       IDA and other donors are supporting the policy reforms in SAP through an umbrella policy-
based Social Action Program Project (SAPP) for FY94 to FY96 to cover basic services in health,
education, population, and water and sanitation. SAPP concentrates on the major issues of program
design, implementation and funding that cut across the social sectors. However, these macro-level efforts
need to be complemented by province-based sectoral projects to support implementation of sectors and
province-specific policy reforms and institution-building in weak provincial line agencies. NWFP is the
only province without a province-based basic education project, and NWFP-PEP fills this void.



10
1.47             IDA strategy. Over the past twenty years, IDA's lending strategy to the education
sector has shifted from an emphasis on higher and technical education to primary education; it has also
shifted from provision of isolated project inputs scattered throughout the country to province-based
sectoral programs. Four phases can be discerned:
*    Meeting manpower needs through vocational and higher education projects was the
focus of the early 70s. These projects provided small amounts of inputs to a limited
number of project institutions scattered throughout the country and had limited
impact.
*    In the late 70s, realizing that primary education has the highest rate of social return,
IDA supported two experimental primary education projects in a limited number of
districts in all provinces. The impact was limited to the projects' duration and the
project areas.
*    Province-based primary education projects began with the FY85 Third Primary
Education Project, which devoted substantial resources to one province (Punjab) to
bring about institutional change.
o    Finally, a province-based sectoral program strategy was adopted in FY90 through the
Sindh Primary Education Development Program, which emphasized institution-
building as well as policy reforms. The Balochistan Primary Education Program
went a step further to ensure more complete coverage of primary education in one
province, with particular focus on integrating inputs from other donors and the
Government to ensure coherence of the program and improved implementation.
1.48       Building on the successful provincial operations, IDA strategy will continue to emphasize
province-based sector operations. NWFP is the last province to be supported in this way. Furthermore,
beneficiary participation leading to long-term sustainability is emphasized. This strategy forms the basis
for IDA support to the Government's Social Action Program in the education sector.
1.49             Rationale for IDA assistance. IDA has a policy of promoting universal primary
education worldwide and has substantial accumulated experience in this sector. In Pakistan, it has
emphasized the need for enhanced social services delivery through its continued policy dialogue with the
Government. This has led the Government to request IDA support for its Social Action Program. In
response, donors, including the Bank, have established a Multi-Donor Support Unit (MSU) in Islamabad
to provide technical assistance to the Government to prepare the SAP and assist with implementation of
new and on-going and new programs. To further the goals of the SAP in education, IDA is committed
to a pipeline of provincial education development programs based on the expanding absorptive capacity
of the respective provinces.
1.50             The proposed NWFP Primary Education Program (NWFP-PEP) constitutes the
education component of the SAP in that province. NWFP-PEP fully integrates the inputs of all the other
donors active in the province (ODA, JICA, ADB, UNICEF, Netherlands, KfW and GTZ) into a coherent
program that covers the entire primary education sector.



11
E. Experience with Past Lending and Sector Work
1.51             Findings from donors' research in primary education and a series of World Bank
sector reports on education in Pakistan contributed to the design of program components. Lessons from
past projects and programs, funded by IDA as well as other donors, have been carefully incorporated into
the preparation and design of the present program. These lessons are outlined below:
1.52             One-Province Projects. Past projects involving a Federal Coordinating Unit and more
than one province, such as PEP II, have resulted in serious implementation delays because: (a) the
province is legislatively and financially responsible for primary and secondary education, and therefore,
the federal unit introduced more bureaucratic hurdles to implementation; (b) uniform solutions cannot be
applied across provinces because wide variations exist among them (e.g., Balochistan has a shortage of
teachers while Punjab has plenty); and (c) the different absorptive capacities of the provinces meant that
a multi-province project could not proceed at an even pace. In PEP II, a one-year lag was observed
between provinces. The NWFP-PEP is a province-based program.
1.53             Technical Assistance. Long-term resident technical assistance has been crucial to the
success of the USAID PED and IDA Balochistan PEP program. TA funds for short-term consultants
provided under PEP II remain largely unutilized, however, in good part because the PEP II lacked long-
term resident TA to assist with the identification, recruitment, management and orientation of their short-
term counterparts. Furthermore, the impact of short-term consultants has been minimal since much of
their time was spent in orientation and developing an understanding of the problems. Donors supporting
the NWFP-PEP have recognized these problems and are paying particular attention to ensure continuity
of technical assistance. Starting from September 1994, Germany will support a PEP-CO (Coordination
Office) whose main function is coordination of new and on-going donor activities and sequencing of
donor inputs in a rational manner.
1.54             Annual Reviews. Annual reviews have become a tool for successful planning under
the USAID PED and Balochistan PEP. The annual review sets realistic targets for the following year
based on implementation records of the past year. In other projects, rigid adherence to PC-1 targets
established at project appraisal have become a major constraint to implementation; these targets are often
outdated and do not reflect the changing realities or needs that may arise over time. For annual reviews
to be successful, the Government must have flexible PC-Is and involve all donors in the review. New
donors must also agree to the annual review process to incorporate new inputs.
1.55             Program Management. Experience under several projects has shown that project
management structures established outside the normal administrative hierarchy of provincial Departments
of Education fail to institutionalize project gains into the regular system. The short-term benefits attained
through temporary structures by way of partial circumvention of normal bureaucratic hurdles eventually
turn into a long-term loss in terms of lasting impact. The Project Implementation Units of PEP II were
phased out during preparation for this proposed project, so that successful inputs from PEP II could be
incorporated into the regular system.
1.56             Donor Coordination. Without coordination, donors can create inefficiencies in the
use of scarce resources. For example, donors' interest in the primary education sub-sector, particularly
in the area of educational materials development, has produced a confusing multiplicity of parallel
materials, sometimes with competing claims for recognition. To date, none has been institutionalized on
a province-wide basis, although the NWFP Textbook Board has now agreed to publish donor-supported



12
materials that are approved by the Federal Curriculum Wing. In addition, the limited government
absorptive capacity means that implementation of one project is often at the expense of another unless
both are well coordinated beforehand. In the NWFP-PEP, all donors were invited to be part of all the
missions during program preparation, beginning with identification. Two donors' coordination meetings
have been held, one hosted by KfW in Frankfurt and one by the MSU in Islamabad. Donors will
continue to meet bi-annually to ensure coordination. Integration of donor inputs is built into program
design through the establishment of the aforementioned Coordination Office (PEP-CO).
1.57             Leaming Coordinators.  Learning modules and Learning Coordinators were
introduced in Pakistan through the IDA-financed First Primary Education Project in the early 80s.
Evaluation showed that the presence of Learning Coordinators greatly improved teacher attendance.
Based on this evaluation, USAID PED introduced Learning Coordinators into all NWFP districts in the
province not covered by PEP II. However, Learning Coordinators need further training and supervision
in provision of instructional support to teachers.
1.58             Approval of School Sites.  One of the most intractable problems in school
construction is the selection and approval of sites. In nearly all past projects, the injection of politics in
this process has overturned agreed criteria for site selection and delayed school construction programs
by one to two years. Agreement by the Government to select sites based on criteria according to EMIS
Human Resources Survey and School Maps is a cornerstone of SAPP policy reform in education. During
NWFP-PEP, politicians will be inducted to the use of EMIS criteria. This process will be strengthened
by independent verification by EMIS of the final list of school sites, as well as by additional verification
by donors during Annual Reviews in April.



13
II. THE PROGRAM
A. Program Objectives
2.1        The objectives of the Government's program for the primary education sub-sector during
the years FY96-FY2000 are: (a) to improve access, equity and efficiency in primary education,
particularly for girls; (b) to improve the quality of the learning environment for all schools; (c) to
improve the organizational framework, and the planning, management, assessment and monitoring
capacity of the provincial education system; and (d) to increase village-level beneficiary involvement in
all phases of primary education service delivery. These objectives reflect GONWFP policy as stated in
its letter of development policy, attaching the NWFP-PEP PC-1, which was submitted to IDA in advance
of negotiations (see Annex 8).
2.2         The NWFP-PEP supports the implementation of the policy reforms introduced under the
Social Action Program Project (SAPP) in FY94-FY95. It will encompass all activities in primary
education, including improved operation of the current system, as well as its gradual expansion in step
with increased implementation capacity. To avoid duplication of effort and ensure a comprehensive
approach to primary education, the provincial Government's program integrates all on-going and planned
activities under various donors and its own Annual Development Plan (ADP) in a coherent and
synchronized manner. The program includes both development and recurrent costs and financing by the
GONWFP, IDA, ODA, Germany, ADB, UNICEF, JICA and the Netherlands.
2.3        Instead of fixing rigid and often unrealistic targets in advance, the program supports a
reform "process" as much as it supports "education inputs". The size and composition of the Annual
Work Plan will be based on detailed assessments of the progress achieved in the past year and the
feasibility for expansion. Special measures are built into the program to remove implementation
constraints and expand the absorptive capacity of Governmnent agencies responsible for program
implementation. Assessment will be made of both physical implementation of inputs and outcomes.
Unsuccessful components would be dropped or revised and new components added, if needed, during
Annual Reviews among GONWFP and donors.
2.4        During the five years (FY96 to FY2000), the program is expected to increase enrollment
by about 886,000 students, of which about 42% will be girls. This includes increased enrollments
resulting from the establishment of new schools, schools started in rented facilities and community
schools, as well as from the increased utilization of existing schools that will result from an improved
learning environment. This would lead to a projected 24% increase in the gross enrollment rate (GER)
for girls, up from a current 36% to 60% at the end of the program period. The GER for boys would
increase from 71 % to 94%, bringing the total GER for the province up from 55 % to 78 % at the end of
the program period (see Annex 2), assuming that the population continues to grow at 3.1 % annually.
Rapid population growth greatly inhibits the enrolment rates from increasing any faster than currently
projected.
B. Program Strategy
2.5         To ensure that the program objective of improved access to quality primary education is
achieved, NWFP-PEP adopts a three-pronged strategy: (a) implement policy reform measures agreed to
under the Social Action Program; (b) agree on specific inputs and annual targets through joint



14
consultations among Government and donors at Annual Reviews; and, (c) emphasize outcome-based and
performance-based monitoring to ensure that effective inputs are planned and delivered.
2.6        Policy Reforms: As an integral part of the Government's on-going Social Action Program,
a series of reform measures were discussed and introduced during the program preparation period. These
reforms were initially supported under IDA's Social Action Program Project in FY93/94 and FY94/95.
They include: (a) cross-registration of girls in boys schools and vice versa and expanding the number of
new mixed-gender primary schools; (b) relaxation of age and academic requirements for entry into the
teaching profession and improving incentives for female teachers in rural areas; (c) rationalization of the
site selection process; (d) introduction of a new staff posting and transfer policy; (e) increasing private
sector involvement in the delivery of primary education; (f) expansion of construction management
capacity through private sector participation; (g) institutionalization of data-based management and
strengthening of the Educational Management and Information System (EMIS); (h) delegation of authority
for all Government and donor activities in primary education to the provincial Director of Primary
Education; (i) increasing the involvement of communities in motivation, supervision and school
development; and, (j) establishment of a permanent budget heading for instructional materials in the
recurrent budget and allocation of not less than 10% of the recurrent budget for non-salary expenditures.
2.7        The above policy measures will be implemented more fully under the NWFP-PEP and will
be complemented by a set of additional reforms to be undertaken during the NWFP-PEP period. These
additional measures are tailored to the needs and problems of NWFP education. The groundwork for
several of these actions, including studies and other preparatory measures, was undertaken during the
SAPP period. Policy reforms scheduled for implementation during the NWFP-PEP period include actions
to: (a) professionalize teacher education; (b) institutionalize adequate allocations for teacher training; (c)
rationalize the distribution of ASDEOs and Learning Coordinators; (d) improve mobility for ASDEOs
and LCs; (e) improve the viability and management of larger schools; (f) institute a system of local
accountability for educational outcomes at the district level; (g) professionalize the cadre of education
supervisors and managers; and (h) institute a system of outcome-based monitoring and evaluation.
2.8        The reform measures and the phasing of each action required can be found Annex 7.
During Annual Reviews, the specific policy actions would be reviewed and adjusted according to
implementation progress.
2.9        Annual Work Plan Reviews: Annual Reviews of program performance would be carried
out jointly by the Government and IDA (with participation by all donors active in NWFP prirnary
education) in March every year beginning in Year 1, in order to determine implementation progress and
agree on a work plan for the following fiscal year. An indicative five-year program -- which includes
all development and recurrent expenditure requirements for current and planned activities in the entire
primary education sub-sector in the province -- has been prepared by GONWFP with assistance from
donors. The program includes funds for school construction, teacher training and salaries, instructional
materials and operation and maintenance. Implementation of this program will be guided by Annual
Work Plans, which will be agreed between GONWFP and donors during Annual Reviews. The following
principles would be followed in the evaluation of the Annual Work Plans:
(a)   The Work Plan should include all activities in primary education, including all domestic and
external funding sources.  All program  components should be fully consistent and
synchronized in a coherent manner, including sequencing and timing of various activities,



15
irrespective of funding source. No activities in primary education should be carried out
outside of the Annual Work Plan.
(b)   Specific and fully costed performance targets for each component should be based on
demonstrated achievements in the year just past, and should include planned measures to
improve implementation capacity. The program components should demonstrate a logical
progression from the past year's experience, and unsatisfactory inputs should be deleted and
new components added, including new donor financing consistent with overall objectives.
New initiatives, either donor- or Government-supported, must be part of the Annual Work
Plan and discussed during the Annual Review. The review of such new initiatives would
be on the basis of their contribution to program objectives and complementarity with all
other components of the program.
(c)   The Annual Work Plan should include a detailed calculation of the development and
recurrent cost needs of all existing, new and planned schools, taking into account that non-
salary recurrent costs for instructional supplies would be not less than Rs. 500 per
classroom.
(d)   The Annual Work Plan should include a financing plan, including for the Government's
own contribution, which should increase at not less than 5 % annually in real terms for both
development and recurrent allocations. Agreements were reached during Negotiations
that GONWFP will ensure that the Government's budgetary allocation to primary
education will increase by at least 5% in real termns annually for both development and
recurrent expenditures, using the actual level of expenditures for fiscal year 1993-94
as the base year.
2.10        At the Annual Reviews, provincial budget documents for both development and recurrent
expenditures would be checked to ensure that GONWFP has fully allocated the required financing to
carry out the agreed Annual Work Plan.  Agreements were reached during Negotiations that
GONWFP will: (a) hold an Annual Review with IDA not later than May 1 of each year to
formulate: (i) the scope and financing of the following year's Annual Work Plan; and (ii) policy
actions to be carried out during the Annual Work Plan period, all satisfactory to IDA; and, (b)
allocate the total financing required, from domestic and external sources, to carry out the Annual
Work Plan as agreed during the Annual Review. Furthermore, at least one-fourth of the
Government's allocation to the program in a given Fiscal Year would be deposited in the accounts
of the implementing agencies prior to the start of the first quarter of each Fiscal Year.
Expenditures incurred out of the proceeds of such amount deposited would be fully replenished
prior to the start of each subsequent quarter.
2.11        As part of the Annual Work Plan, the Government would submit a list of school sites for
the following year by February 15th, for joint discussion by the Government and the donors at the Annual
Work Plan Review. The final list should be selected from a master list of school sites that conform to
agreed criteria according to the EMIS databases, including School Census, Human Resources Survey and
School Maps. At the Annual Reviews, donors would independently verify that the final list is based on
the EMIS master list of schools according to the agreed criteria. Agreements were reached during
Negotiations that GONWFP will provide to the Association not later than February 15 of each fiscal
year a list of school and classroom construction and rehabilitation sites for the following fiscal year
selected according to agreed site selection procedures.

2.12       Monitoring and Evaluation:  During Annual Reviews, the Government would report on
progress in implementing program inputs (both physical and financial) according to the agreed Annual
Work Plan.  In addition, a set of monitoring indicators which measure both the efficiency and
effectiveness of the system has been agreed upon (Annex 11). These indicators provide assessments of
student outcomes (e.g., enrollment increase by gender), learning achievement (through achievement
scores), and system efficiency (e.g. decrease in number of schools without students).  Moreover, a
North-West Educational Assessment Program (NEAP) has been created to assess pupil performance in
the critical areas of math, science and language in grades 3 and 5. From time to time, evaluation studies
will be conducted by the Research, Development and Evaluation Cell in the DPE to assess the
effectiveness of various specific program interventions.
2.13       Mid-term Review: The Mid-term Review would replace the third Annual Review and focus
on in-depth assessment of the policy framework for sectoral improvements. The review would: (a) effect
any necessary mid-course adjustments; and (b) identify a possible follow-up operation to ensure continuity
of the program  after completion of the current operation.  Agreements were reached during
Negotiations that GONWFP will, in consultation with IDA, and in accordance with terms of
reference and methodology satisfactory to IDA, undertake and complete by October 31, 1998, a
Mid-term review of the Program and carry out the recommendations of such a review.
2.14       Reporting: The program has one Government PC-I for the five-year program period. The
PC-1 was cleared by the Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) and the Central Development
Working Party (CDWP), and received final approval from the Executive Committee of the National
Economic Council (ECNEC) before Negotiations, thus meeting the only condition for Board presentation.
The PC-1 provides a flexible framework for implementation. Within the general plan, an Annual Work
Plan would be prepared by the DPE, reviewed by the Steering Committee, and submitted to IDA by
March 30 of each year for the following fiscal year. Each year, beginning in Year 1, the DPE would
prepare a Mid-Fiscal Year Status Report by January 15 and an Annual Review Report of program
performance by March 30, describing: (a) current activities and implementation status for each
component; and (b) financial status. Within six months of the Credit Closing Date, the federal Ministry
of Education would prepare and forward to IDA its inputs for the Program Implementation Report, which
would summarize program performance and evaluate the program's successes and problems. At
Negotiations, it was agreed that GONWFP will: (a) submit an Annual Work Plan for the following
riscal year by March 30 of each year; (b) prepare a Mid-Fiscal Year Status Report by January 15
of each fiscal year, including financial and physical progress; and (c) submit a Program
Implementation Report to IDA within six months of the Closing Date.
C. Program Description
2.15       The NWFP-PEP program parallels the Government objectives outlined at the beginning of
this chapter. It has four major components: (a) improving access, equity and efficiency; (b) improving
the learning environment; (c) improving organizational framework, planning and management; and (d)
promoting beneficiary participation. Within each component, the NWFP-PEP provides for various sub-
components, as noted below.



17
1. Improving Access, Equity and Efficiency
2.16       This component is designed to improve access, equity and efficiency in primary education
by: (a) providing buildings, equipment, and facilities in existing and new schools, particularly those with
a female teacher and a mixed student population; (b) introducing double shifting and schools in rented
buildings; (c) improving construction management; and (d) encouraging private sector provision of
student places in areas with low income and enrollment rates, through support for the Frontier Education
Foundation.
School Planning and Construction Management. (Base Cost: US$ 1.6 million)
2.17       To increase the pace of school construction, improve the quality of primary education
facilities and expand its construction management capacity, DPE has established a Construction Advisory
Unit (CAU). This unit would contract with Architecture and Engineering (A&E) firms to carry out
construction management and supervision. Depending on performance, the role of the CAU would be
expanded.
2.18       With the aid of private A&E firms and technical assistance, the CAU would develop a
typology of primary-school designs suitable for the various NWFP climatic conditions, and make
improvements in current designs to enhance learning and provide flexibility for future adjustments (e.g.,
second story, natural light, cross ventilation). The CAU would also be responsible for preparing site
plans to assure proper accommodation of main and ancillary facilities, as well as to provide for future
expansions of the facilities. It would also inspect potential school sites in advance, with a view to
assessing accessibility, soil conditions, environmental factors, and other critical parameters.
School Development. (Base Cost: US$ 254.0 million, including ongoing foreign aided
projects)
2.19       The objective of this program would be to upgrade existing school facilities and expand
capacity. In five years, the total program would: (a) construct about 12,000 classrooms, in both new
and existing schools; and (b) construct about 11,900 classrooms in existing shelterless, reconstructed and
converted schools. New construction would favor 60% girls schools and mixed-gender schools where
acceptable to communities, as well as currently shelterless schools. IDA would finance about 40% of
the classrooms, GONWFP's own Annual Development Plan 48 %, and other donors about 12 %. All new
schools would be provided with appropriate furniture and storage for books and materials. Boundary
walls and latrines would be provided for all new and existing schools to which classrooms are added.
Maintenance would be budgeted at 1.5% of capital costs annually. IDA is also financing incremental
staff on a declining basis.
2.20       Regardless of funding source, decisions on school location, planning, design and number
of classrooms (multi-grade or regular) would be based on needs and demonstrated demand, as shown in
the yearly school census conducted by EMIS and/or community requests (see Annex 13 for site selection
criteria). The EMIS would produce a master list of schools according to agreed criteria. This list would
be forwarded to the districts for selection. The final list will be submitted to the donors as part of the
Annual Work Plan (see Annex 14). During Annual Reviews, the site selection criteria and priorities
would be reviewed jointly by Government and IDA to determine if any amendment is necessary, based
on the latest school census.



18
Private Sector Participation: (Base Cost: US$0.84 million)
2.21        The Government's program  would encourage private sector participation in education
through support the NWFP Frontier Education Foundation (FEF). The GONWFP has reached agreement
with IDA on the formulation of rules, targeting mechanisms and transparent and fair review procedures.
The key objective of Government subsidies to the private sector is to assist or to encourage
NGOs/entrepreneurs to establish schools catering to low-income groups in urban and rural areas where
a profit cannot be made from tuition alone. The general principles governing the operation of the
Foundation can be found in Annex 4. The Foundation will support a series of pilots and components,
including: (a) loan and grants to establish new schools, with particular emphasis on rural areas; (b)
distribution of financial assistance to facilitate access to private schools for low income urban pupils; (c)
canvassing of and assistance to private donors willing to sponsor private schools; and (d) research and
development with a view to improving private school quality. In all these activities, special emphasis will
be given to community-managed schools. A number of studies will be carried out on private schools
operating in rural and low-income urban areas, on parental willingness to pay for education, and on
potential entrepreneurs/NGOs in this field. Technical assistance would be provided (see Annex 4).
Agreements were reached during Negotiations that GONWFP will ensure that the FEF carries out
schemes for provision of financial assistance in accordance with the Frontier Education Foundation
Act, 1992, with particular emphasis to the beneficiary targeting provisions set forth therein.
2. Improving the Learning Environment
2.22        The objective of' this component is to raise student achievement by improving the delivery
of education in all primary schlools in NWFP through improving the quality and availability of
instructional materials and imiprovinig the quality of teachers. The component includes all Government
and donor-funded projects in teacher training, textbooks and materials, as well as projected future needs.
Instructional Materials (Base Cost: US$ 17.8 million, including on-going foreign- aided
projects)
2.23        The provision of basic instructional materials (textbooks, teachers' guides, classroom
learning aids and a minimum collection of supplementary readers) is one of the most important and cost-
effective investments in educational quality. It would benefit all primary school pupils equally and
quickly. At present all textbooks are published by the NWFP Textbook Board (NWFBTB), for purchase
by parents. The current textbooks are extremely cheap but suffer from very low production quality, short
book life, and content problems.  There are virtually no supplementary readers to support reading
development. The objectives of this program component, which build on the experience and lessons of
the ongoing and past primary education programs (PEP II, USAID PED, GTZ Charsadda Project and
UNICEF PCRCP), are: (a) to increase textbook content and production quality within defined limits of
parental affordability; (b) to provide a guaranteed and recurrent supply of teachers' guides to accompany
all primary textbooks; (c) to sustain a provision of not less than Rs. 500 per classroom in the annual
recurrent budget for classroom teaching aids and instructional materials; (d) to develop and sustain good
basic collections of supplementary reading materials in every primary school to support curriculum work,
activity-based learning and reading development; and (e) to develop the English by Radio course for
grades 3 to 5, which would give children access to learning regardless of the availability of highly
qualified teachers. If the approach is successful, it may be extended to the teaching of math and science.



19
2.24       The continuation of the program should build on work already in progress in NWFP and
should support the following items (see Annex 6 for details):
(a)  financial support for textbook production on a declining basis, to enable content, production
and presentational quality to be improved. This will serve to cushion the immediate impact
of increased textbook costs to parents and will provide time for parents to realize that the
better books will last longer and thus cost them less on an annual basis than the current
system. By the end of the project, parents will be used to purchasing better and probably
higher-priced books. The conditions on which financial support will be applied are:
textbooks must be approved for general use in NWFP by the Federal Curriculum Wing;
they must meet minimum approved production standards; they must be accompanied by
teachers' guides; and they must provide evidence of field testing and successful evaluation;
(b)   provision of free teachers' guides to all teachers to accompany all basic textbooks from
grades 1 to 5;
(c)   provision of a free collection of supplementary readers to every primary school, and
maintenance of the collections as a regular part of the Government's recurrent budget;
(d)  technical assistance to support the design, establishment and maintenance of a supplementary
readers system;
(e)   upgraded storage facilities to enable schools to maintain supplementary reading materials,
teachers' guides and other ancillary teaching/learning materials;
(f)   basic equipment to support the TA referred to in the above component.
(g)   an annual allocation of Rs. 500 per school to be permanently included in the recurrent
budget, to ensure adequate provision of non-book instructional materials for all existing
schools.
Teacher Training (Base Cost: US$ 21.2 million, including training facilities and on-going foreign-
aided projects)
2.25       Teacher performance will be improved by: (a) training of ASDEOs, Learning Coordinators,
and Head Teachers; (b) educating teachers in-service to extend teaching strategies and enhance subject
knowledge of the primary school curriculum; (c) enhancing the quality of GCETs through development
of improved instructional methods for PTC curriculum; and (d) establishing a cadre of trained primary
Master Trainers.
2.26       From a base within an existing institution, a technical assistance training team will take
training programs to various districts. A cadre of primary education Master Trainers, drawn from the
teacher trainer cadre, from ASDEOs, and elsewhere, will be identified and trained. The Master Trainers
will in turn train and "coach" ASDEOs, Learning Coordinators and Head Teachers in pedagogical content
and methods, as well as in the techniques of instructional supervision. In schools with five or more
teachers, in return for an enhanced charge allowance to reflect the additional responsibility, the Head
Teacher will deliver in-service training to teachers in his/her charge. LCs will deliver in-service training
to other teachers on a "train and visit" model. The ASDEOs have a key role in contributing to training



20
of teachers and in ensuring that both Head Teachers and LCs undertake the planned number of programs
in the specified fields.
2.27        Master Trainers will be trained by the TA team through both formal instruction and field
coaching. Practical assessment of competency will be a feature of all supervisor-level training programs.
The Master Trainers in turn, using the same train-and-visit model, will train ASDEOs, LCs and Head
Teachers.
2.28        Long-term foreign and local technical assistance, together with returnees from short overseas
fellowship training, will: (a) prepare and deliver primary sector Master Trainer training programs and
materials; (b) prepare course materials for and deliver courses to primary education professionals; (c)
within the national curriculum for the PTC program, prepare and introduce modern pedagogical content
knowledge and instructional methods to GCETs.
2.29        The DPE is the focal point for all the above training. The In-service Training Team will
prepare, in conjunction with fellowship returnees, modules of in-service training in priority topics. The
experience of the PED and Charsadda projects in delivering in-service teacher training will be carefully
evaluated to generate a cost-effective approach that can cover the whole province and be sustained after
the PEP.
2.30        The component provides for: (a) international and local technical assistance; (b) overseas
and local training for some Master Trainers and GCET staff; (c) local training funds and packages of
furniture, equipment and materials for schools that are used for in-service teacher training and as home
bases for LCs; (d) mobile training facilities (including specially equipped vehicles, trained LCs and
materials), for female teachers in remote areas; and (e) a series of studies to be undertaken by staff of
the CB and GCETs, assisted by foreign and local consultants.
2.31        The GONWFP will depute qualified primary education staff and support staff to the
component; they will be based in GCETs and/or rented premises. The GONWFP will also provide
recurrent costs for TA/DA for training and for enabling ASDEOs and LCs to be mobile.
2.32        GCETs and Teacher Resource Centers: Additional GCETs may be established in areas not
now served by existing GCETs following the updating of the Teacher Supply Master Plan (see Annex
5). A survey of the physical facilities of existing GCETs will be undertaken with a view to improving
their adequacy, utilization and capacity for further development or more intensive use. PTC graduates
from GCET will be given "starter tool-kits" consisting of book and non-book materials. Following a
feasibility study, some Teachers Resource Centers may be established to increase access of teachers to
INSET.
3. Improving Organizational Framework, Planning and Management.
2.33        This component is designed to support and expand on-going efforts to establish a needs-
driven and data-based system of policy development, planning, management and administration, and
monitoring. This will be accomplished through: (a) strengthening the Directorate of Primary Education;
(b) strengthening of the policy monitoring, research and assessment function within the DPE, with special
attention to improving the accountability and performance of administrators and teachers through



21
assessment; (c) strengthening the EMIS; and (d) conducting district-based workshops on educational issues
for policy-makers. Funds will also be provided for studies necessary for future program development.
Strengthening of the Directorate of Primary Education (Base Cost: US$ 8.0 million,
including physical facilities)
2.34       The provincial Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) has four functional sections:
Planning and Development; Research, Policy and Evaluation; Management and Administration; and,
Training and Curriculum. Each section is headed by a Deputy Director and is responsible for all related
areas of work. Below the provincial level, District Primary Education Officers and Sub-District Officers
have the main responsibilities for administrative and academic supervision of primary schools.
2.35       The management, administration, planning and development functions of the DPE will be
supported by long-term TA to work with the Director of Primary Education and his senior officers, to
strengthen institutional capacity for project and policy implementation. There will be close links with the
Chief Technical Advisor heading the Primary Education Program Coordination Office (PEP-CO) in the
provincial Secretariat and it is expected that this will provide an integrated package of management
support.
2.36       Professional development is the key to quality improvement, but it has traditionally been
accorded low priority. To develop administrative capacity and staff skills within the primary education
sector further, the program would support long-term and short-term TA to work with a staff development
unit -- consisting of the Deputy Director for Training and Curriculum, a proposed management trainer
as Assistant Director, and their support staff -- to: (a) establish a permanent training capacity within the
Directorate; (b) identify staff training needs; (c) plan a departmental training matrix; (d) identify and
equip training facilitators and resource persons; (e) assist in the planning, development and delivery of
courses; (f) identify and facilitate training opportunities, including institutional and private sectors; (g)
help coordinate study tours and fellowships; and (h) encourage a professional development culture
throughout the Education Department. The development of institutions such as MUST and the proposed
Institute of Education Planning and Management, together with innovative training strategies, will be
considered in the overall context of departmental training requirements. Sustainability will be enhanced
through permanent budget provision for training by the Government of NWFP.
2.37       Fellowships and study tours would be included and distributed throughout the program to
allow for continued staff development and training for new appointees. They would cover academic and
professional training, both in and out of Pakistan. Conferences, seminars, workshops and mentor
strategies will be utilized as vehicles for development.
2.38       Workshops appraising local politicians on the status of education and proper use of available
data for school site selection would be conducted in each district. The workshops would seek to define
a productive role for politicians, e.g. in promoting literacy and motivating communities to become
involved in education.
Research, Development and Evaluation (Base Cost: US$ 2.1 million)
2.39       The Deputy Director for Research, Development and Evaluation will be responsible for
analyzing and interpreting the data collected by EMIS and for producing related policy studies and
recommendations. The RD&E section will be directly responsible for EMIS (described below) and will



22
work to improve the quality and reliability of the data that EMIS collects. Development of the RD&E
section will be supported by long- and short-term technical assistance with the aim of establishing a
permanent capacity within DPE for collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative information. It
will further strengthen data usage in decision-making processes, and program monitoring and evaluation
capabilities.
2.40        EMIS will collect and prepare the annual school census, including core data for the National
Education Management Education System. The EMIS cell will also collect, prepare and analyze
additional data for provincial use (including personnel and financial and construction management
information), teacher training and school mapping, and expand and update the human resource survey.
For example, EMIS will help program managers determine what kinds of school inputs and approaches
have most impact on attendance.
2.41        Information will flow to the central EMIS cell from cells established in each district office,
which will be responsible for the collection and periodic updating of all education statistics in their area.
Each district-level cell will be equipped with computers and trained personnel. The use of EMIS data
will be incorporated into the training of district-level officers.
2.42        The program will also support the North-West Educational Assessment Program (NEAP),
which has been created to assess pupil performance in the critical subjects of math, science and language
in grades 3 and 5 in order to diagnose and develop measures to improve weaknesses in the instructional
program.
2.43        Using these results and the results from the EMIS school census, district administrators are
expected to set yearly targets and develop action plans for improving enrollment (especially of girls), the
efficiency of schools (decreasing dropouts and repetition rates), and the effectiveness of schooling (higher
achievement), especially in the areas of weakness shown by the NEAP results. The results of NEAP
testing are to be fed to the Curriculum Bureau for use in upgrading instruction in the teacher training
colleges and to the Instructional Materials Development Cell in the Directorate for use in developing in-
service training materials for teachers and teacher trainers and additional remedial learning packages for
pupils, if necessary.
Institutional improvement incentives (Base Cost: US$ 10.1 million, excluding base year
recurrent expenditures).
2.44        To improve the operation of the primary education system, the program supports a series
of efficiency-enhancing measures and incentives. The mobility of ASDEOs and LCs will be improved
through the provision of vehicles for female staff and motorcycles for male staff. The travel allowance
for ASDEOs and LCs will be increased, and all supervisory staff will be able to draw a monthly charge
allowance. To give female ASDEOs and LCs an incentive to drive their assigned vehicles (rather than
relying on drivers), they will receive a driving allowance. One vehicle will be provided for every four
female ASDEOs/LCs. Male ASDEOs/LCs will be provided with one motorcycle each. Adequate
provision for O&M costs will be made each year in the permanent recurrent budget.
2.45        To ensure adequate provision of non-book instructional materials for all existing schools,
an annual allocation will be permanently included in the recurrent budget.



23
2.46       To ease the shortage of female teachers willing to accept posting to rural primary schools,
a financial incentive will be introduced in selected areas.
4. Beneficiary Participation (Base Cost: US$ 4.3 million, including on-going foreign-aided projects)
2.47       The basic goal of this component is to increase parental involvement in the management of
all government and community primary school.  Parents have the major stake in improving the
accountability and effectiveness of primary education that their children receive, and can be an important
source of additional resources. The component will support all the other objectives of the program.
2.48       Various pilot programs will be conducted, and replicated if successful. This will include
the Community Support Basic Education Project for girls currently operating in three districts with
funding from UNICEF. Following on the earlier Balochistan model, the UNICEF-supported program
emphasizes the formation of village education committees (VECs) as means to involve beneficiaries in
decision-making and planning. The basic principles of the component are: (a) only rural villages without
government girls schools would qualify; (b) qualified females (or males, if acceptable to parents), willing
to teach must be identified; and, (c) parents have demonstrated a commitment to education. The
minimum commitment required would be the provision by the community, free of charge, of the school
building. The VEC also has to: recruit a local teacher, who will volunteer to teach for a three-month trial
period; guarantee teacher and student attendance (by girls as well as boys); perform repair and
maintenance of the school, and provide general support to the teacher. After three months, when the
teacher has demonstrated his/her commitment to teach, the Government would provide a regular (paid)
post. After three years, it would provide a permanent building. Membership of the village education
committee should consist mainly of parents of children in the local school, since they are the people most
concerned. Agreements were reached during Negotiations that GONWFP will establish community
schools and implement schemes for provision of scholarships in accordance with arrangements to
be established by December 31, 1996, acceptable to IDA.
2.49       The component will support the establishment of Village Education Committees in all
government-run primary schools and community managed schools. VECs are expected to support the
rehabilitation and operation and maintenance of government schools. In those schools fully managed by
the NGOs/VECs, parents should be expected to pav tuition fees (in the range of Rs. 10 to Rs. 40) to help
secure sustainability for the program beyond the intervention period. The program supports international
and local consultancies which would assist in the implementation of all activities in this component,
including the development of education and community development NGOs and Community Based
Organizations (CBOs). Successful schemes will be replicated.
Program Management and Implementation
2.50       Intra-Departmental Program Coordination: The DPE Director would: (a) be responsible
for full coordination of all program-related activities; (b) facilitate resource flows to the implementing
agencies; and (c) to the appropriate extent, consolidate the procurement of goods and services in
consideration of efficiency and economies of scale. The DPE would also serve as the clearinghouse for
issues requiring decisions by top management of the NWFP Education Department and by external
agencies, including IDA. The Steering Committee, under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary
for Planning and Development, would ensure coordination outside of the Department of Education among



24
the different Government departments and agencies that have an impact on primary education. Its
members would include: Additional Chief Secretary (Chair), Secretaries of Finance, Education and P&D
(Implementation); Director of Primary Education; Director, Curriculum Bureau; and Secretary, Textbook
Board. This Committee would be responsible for reviewing all schemes and projects in the primary
education sub-sector, regardless of funding sources.
2.51       Program Management and Implementation: The program would be implemented by the line
units of the DPE and by other line agencies of the NWFP Education Department. An organizational chart
showing program management arrangements for each sub-component is included in the Program
Implementation Plan (PIP). The Directorate of Primary Education would be responsible for overall
program implementation as well as daily program operations as follows: (a) monitoring program progress,
costs and program accounts; (b) processing disbursement applications and keeping track of disbursements
of credit funds; (c) procurement of equipment and software packages and administration of supplier and
technical assistance contracts; (d) placement and tracking of local staff receiving training abroad; (e)
monitoring procurement of civil works undertaken by the Communication and Works (C&W)
Department, Construction Advisory Unit (CAU) and Architect/ Engineer (A/E) consultants; (f)
preparation of consolidated periodic reports on the progress of program implementation; (g) arranging
for audits of accounts; and (h) preparation of annual work plans and budget requirements for program
implementation.
2.52       Other principal implementing agencies and their respective program sub-component would
be: (a) the CAU, which will take charge of school construction and facilities in one division, with the
objective of expanding to more divisions if successful after two years of operation; (b) the C&W
Department for school construction in the remaining divisions; (c) the NWFP Textbook Board
(NWFPTB) for publication and distribution of books and instructional materials; (d) the Directorate of
Primarv Education (DPE) for strengthening the institutional framework (provincial directorates program,
education management information system, planning, research and evaluation); and (e) the Frontier
Education Foundation (FEF) for mobilizing private sector resources (private school pilot experiment,
beneficiary participation). The Curriculum Bureau, supported by the Provincial Institute for Teacher
Education (PITE), would be in charge of teacher training programs including the Teacher Training
Project funded by ADB. Key indicators for attainment of program targets are shown in Annex 11.
2.53       Primary Education Program Coordination Office (PEP-CO): PEP-CO was established prior
to negotiations and is assisting the Government to comply with all donors' requirements for project
processing during the pre-effectiveness period. During the program period PEP-CO will: (a) coordinate
donors' inputs to ensure the coherence and consistency of the program and advise all new and existing
donors about on-going activities in the province to avoid duplication; (b) assist the Government in the
preparation of in-advance progress reports to include all pertinent data to meet supervision requirements;
and, (c) provide the Government, and donor supervision missions, with independent verification of the
Governrent's progress reports (see para. 3.28). PEP-CO will be located at the Provincial Education
Secretariat level and will work closely with both principal implementing agencies and the PEP Steering
Committee. PEP-CO is supported by Germany and is headed by an expatriate long-term resident
technical advisor.

III. PROGRAM COST AND FINANCING
A. Program Cost
3.1                   The program  cost estimates are based on an indicative program  for the five-year
period from FY96 to FY2000 which incorporates all on-going and planned activities in primary education
in NWFP, on both the development and recurrent sides. Each year, precise annual program costs would
be agreed upon during the Annual Review on the basis of the proposed Annual Work Plan.
3.2                   The overall program  cost is estimated to be about Rs 29,580 million, or US$ 813.1
million equivalent, including price and physical contingencies of the total program; US$ 342.4 million
are incremental costs over the program period. Base cost estimates are about Rs 22,283 million, or US$
725 million equivalent. Price contingencies and physical contingencies amount to Rs 7,297 million, or
US$ 88 million equivalent, representing about 11 % of total program cost. Total program costs and
financing by component are shown in Table III.1 and program costs by year are shown in Table 111.2.

3.3                   About US$ 274 million have been allocated to the development side and US$ 539
million for recurrent expenditures (Table 111.2). The Government would finance US$ 596 million, or
about 74% of total program cost. Govermment development and recurrent expenditures would grow
annually by 5% and 5.6% respectively over the project period, which is consistent with the level of
increase in primary education expenditures that the Government has committed itself to as part of the on-
going SAPP initiative6. Donor financing accounts for 61%  of total development costs and 49%  of the
incremental recurrent cost. Total new and on-going donor financing make up about 27% of the total
program cost.
6/ The SAPP formula specifies an annual increase in Government expenditures on the basic social sectors of not less than . 1% of GDP.

3.4                Total program  recurrent costs, including contingencies, are US$ 539 million equivalent
during the five-year program period, of which about US$ 92 million are incremental recurrent costs. To
implement the program, the recurrent budget would need to maintain a real rate of increase of 5.6%
annually. If the provincial budget continues to grow at approximately the same rate as GNP, which is
projected to grow at about 6% during the program period, the financial sustainability of the program is
ensured.
3.5                The recurrent-cost calculation is based on the needs of every existing, new or planned school
in the province. Furthermore, it is assumed that every classroom has to have a teacher, every student



27
a set of textbooks, every school a minimum set of supplementary materials, O&M support and
instructional supplies, and that in-service training would be provided annually to all existing and new
teachers through the Learning Coordinators network. During Annual Reviews, the NWFP Government
would provide documentary evidence that adequate recurrent funds for salaries and maintenance and
operation of existing facilities and newly instituted programs have been provided and, in the semi-annual
status report, that adequate recurrent expenditure funds have been allocated in the budgetary documents.
3.6               The Government financing pattern for primary education will gradually be restructured to
emphasize items that are necessary for improved enrollment, retention and achievement-- i.e. instructional
materials, teacher training, stationery and supplies. The Government will also have to ensure that
sufficient posts will be created, as necessary, in the Directorate of Primary Education, and that sufficient
teacher posts are made available annually to meet the anticipated demand from the construction program.
The estimated number of posts required is shown in Annex 5, Table 2. Table 11I.3 provides program
costs by component, and Table III.4 by category of expenditures.

Note: Numbers may not add due to rounding.
3.7               Basis of Cost Estimates:  Base cost estimates reflect prices at the time of appraisal in June,
1994, as follows: (a) school construction and furniture costs are derived from recently awarded contracts
by the GONWFP under the USAID-financed Primary Education Development Program (PED) and actual
costs under the Second Primary Education Project (Credit 1621-PAK); (b) unit costs for consultants,
fellowships and training are based on comparable technical assistance in PEP II and PED and include
housing, relocation costs, salaries, subsistence and overheads; (c) equipment, textbook and other goods'
costs are derived from recent contracts and quotations from suppliers; and, (d) salaries and allowances
of local staff are based on current Government rates.

3.8         Costs per Student: Construction and furniture costs per student place are estimated at about
Rs 5,075, or US$ 170 equivalent7.
3.9         Customs Duties and Taxes: Customs duties and local taxes on civil works, goods and
services are estimated at about US$ 13 million equivalent and will be financed by the Government.
3.10        Contingencv Allowances: Contingencies for unforeseen physical additions are calculated
at about 5 % for all categories of expenditures except for on-going donor projects and GONWFP recurrent
expenditures. Physical contingencies total about Rs 425 million, or US$ 14 million equivalent, and
represent about 2 % of total Program base costs. Price contingencies are estimated at the following rates:
(i) local price increases at 7% in FY96, 7.4%  in FY97, 7.3%  in FY98, 6.8%  in FY99 and 6.3%  in
FY2000 and (ii) foreign price increases at 2.3% in FY96, 2.6% in FY97-FY99, and 2.7% in FY2000.
Price contingencies amount to about Rs 6,898 million or US$ 74 million equivalent and represent 10%
of total base costs.
3.11        Foreign Exchange Component: Foreign costs are estimated as follows: (i) civil works and
furniture: 3% (ii) textbooks, books, instructional and training materials: 70%; (iii) equipment: 80%;
(iv) vehicles: 67%; (v) foreign consultants: 80%; (vi) overseas fellowships: 100%; (vii) operation and
maintenance of equipment: 4%; (viii) vehicle operation and maintenance: 4%; and (ix) local consultants,
in-country training, scholarships, project management and government staff salaries and allowances: 0
percent. The resulting foreign exchange component, including price and physical contingencies, is
estimated at US$ 45 million equivalent or about 6% of total program cost.
B. Financing Arrangements'
3.12        The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 150 million would finance about 18.5% of the program
cost, excluding taxes and custom duties, as follows: about 34% of the foreign exchange requirements or
US$ 15 million, and about 18% of the local costs of the program or US$ 135 million. Under parallel
financing, the other donors would finance the remaining 66% of the foreign exchange requirements, or
US$ 30 million, and about 5% of local costs, or US$ 41 million. The Government of NWFP would
finance the balance of local costs of US$ 578 million, or 77 % of local costs including estimated taxes and
custom duties of US$ 13 million. IDA will not finance taxes and duties. Program financing by
expenditure category is estimated to be as shown in Table 111.5, Financing by Category of Expenditure.
3.13        Based on the Annual Work Plans, the proposed IDA Credit would finance items in the
NWFP-PEP not already committed by other donors or the Government. IDA's financing of civil works,
furniture and construction management/supervision expenditures will focus on primary schools. Non-
school construction and furniture will be funded by the GONWFP and other donors.
7/ Estimates are based on an average design capacity of 40 students per classroom. Construction costs include the school structure, boundary walls and
latrines. Classroom furniture includes a teacher table, a demonstration table, two chairs, a locked cabinet and pupils mats.
8/ Amounts include price and physical contingencies; USS means USS equivalent.

32
3.15        Civil Works: (US$ 192 million). School civil works are scattered in 21 districts of the
province and will be procured over a period of five years. Most are in rural areas, and are small in
value' even when packaged to include more than one school site. It is unlikely that foreign contractors
would be interested in these small works. School construction contracts (US$ 185 million) would be
awarded through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to IDA in packages of three-
to-five sites depending on their distance from one another. Non-school civil works, involving teacher
training and DPE facilities (US$ 7 million), would also be procured through LCB procedures acceptable
to IDA. GONWFP has agreed to use qualification procedures and bidding documents acceptable to IDA.
3.16        Furniture: (US$ 5.8 million). Like school construction, school furniture contracts are
scattered and small in value. School furniture items would be packaged to suit the agreed annual
construction program and would be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Small items
or groups of items of furniture estimated to cost less than US$ 10,000 equivalent per contract, up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 100,000 equivalent, may be procured through local shopping
procedures acceptable to IDA. GONWFP has agreed to use bidding documents acceptable to IDA.
3.17        Educational materials and textbook production:  (US 6.9 million).  Book production
contracts for grades kachi through 5th valued at less than US$ 200.000 per package up to an aggregated
amount of US$ 6.9 million would be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to IDA. The materials
are printed in regional/local languages and will be procured in contracts spread over the five-year duration
of the project, and therefore, international publishers would not be interested to bid.
3.18        Training materials: (US$ 1.2 million). Training material packages estimated to cost less
than US$ 200,000 equivalent would be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Packages
estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 500,000,
may be procured through local shopping procedures acceptable to IDA.
3.19        Equipment: (US$ 3.8 million). Bid packages for equipment costing US$ 200,000 or more
would be awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines, using IDA standard
documents. Local manufacturers would be given a margin of preference in bid comparison of 15% of
the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the actual custom duty, whichever is lower. Equipment packages
costing less than US$ 200,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 1.7 million,
would be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Small items or groups of items of
equipment estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
US$ 600,000, may be procured through local shopping procedures acceptable to IDA.
3.20        Consultants' services:  (US$  13.1  million).   Services of consultants for project
implementation, including Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firms and NGOs, and for capacity building
would be procured in accordance with IDA guidelines".
10/ Estimated cost for each individual two-roont school is about Rs 400,1H)1 or US$ 13,000 equivalent.
I1/ See "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency', August 1981 The recruitment of the Construction
Management A/E firm to work with the CAU, undertaken during program preparation, follows IDA guidelines.



33
3.21        Overseas trainin,: (US$ 0.5 million). Expenditures for overseas training would be subject
to government administrative procedures acceptable to IDA. Local training costs'2 are included under
the pertinent expenditure categories.
3.22        Vehicles and motorcycles: The cost of motor vehicles and motorcycles would be financed
by other donors -- excluding IDA -- and the GONWFP.
3.23        Procurement Reviews: All contracts for goods, civil works and textbook production services
exceeding US$ 200,000 equivalent in value and one school construction contract from each division in
the first school construction procurement undertaken in each fiscal year, irrespective of value, would be
subject to prior review  by IDA  before inviting bids"3.  The technical assistance firm  for school
construction management, headed by the Technical Advisor on Construction Management (TACM)
already in place under German financing will verify and certify that about 40% of the remaining school
construction contracts are awarded to the lowest responsive bidder before signing the contract. Contracts
for consultants' services would be subject to prior review by IDA except for contracts less than US$
100,000 equivalent in value each for consulting firms and US$ 50,000 equivalent for individual
consultants. Single-source consultant contracts, consultant contracts for assignment of a critical nature,
and contract amendments raising the contract value to or above the aforementioned sums would be subject
to prior review by IDA. It is estimated that the prior review would cover about 49 % of the total contract
value financed by IDA. The rest of the contracts would be subject to selective ex-post review by IDA.
D. Disbursements
3.24        The proposed Credit is expected to be disbursed over a period of five and a half years (July
1995 - December 2000).  The current disbursement profile of the education sector in Pakistan is
seven-and-a-half years. The shorter disbursement period for the proposed project is justified on the basis
of the borrower's improving implementation capacity, advanced stage of project preparation during the
preceding two years and the time-slice nature of the proposed program. Expenditures, spread over a five-
year period, reflect the phasing of program activities in line with GONWFP's sector development plan.
The disbursement period is, however, extended by six months to allow for time to process withdrawal
applications for expenditures incurred in the last phase of the program (Annex 12). Disbursements, net
of taxes and custom duties, would be made as shown in Table III 7.
12/ Such as consultants, materials, travel/daily allowances, vehicles etc.

and 45 % thereafter.
Unallocated                                       100%
3.25       Full documentation would be required for all consultant services, and for contracts for goods
and works above US$ 200,000 equivalent in value. Disbursements for goods and works less than US$
200,000 equivalent and project management costs and scholarships would be made on the basis of
itemized Statement of Expenditure (SOEs). The documentation for SOEs would be retained by the
implementing agency and made available for review by IDA supervision missions. A Special Account
would be established at the National Bank of Pakistan under the NWFP Primary Education Director to
facilitate payment all eligible expenditures. This account would be maintained in US dollars with an
authorized allocation of US$ 8 million. It would be used for both local and foreign expenditures for all
categories. At the GONWFP's option, applications exceeding 20% of the Special Account may be
submitted outside the Special Account using normal IDA disbursement procedures. Applications for
replenishment of the Special Account should be submitted to IDA on a monthly basis or whenever 20%
of the Special Account has been used, whichever occurs first.
E. Accounts and Audits
3.26       Separate accounts would be maintained by the DPE for all items financed by IDA. These
accounts, including the Special Account, would be audited in accordance with IDA "Guidelines for
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank" (July 1992). IDA would be
provided, within nine months of the end of each fiscal year of the Government, an audit report of such
scope and detail as IDA reasonably requests, including a separate opinion on disbursements against
certified SOEs. The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year,
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to

H. Envirommental Impact
3.29       The environmental impact of the proposed program is expected to be neutral (screening
category C). The program would provide latrines with on-site septic systems or connection to a sewer
system, when available, to all new schools regardless of gender and improve the sanitary environment
of existing schools, which lack basic facilities. Construction supervisors and architects would be required
to ensure that buildings and other works under the program are constructed in such a way as to minimize
any adverse environmental impact, such as soil erosion from improper drainage, contamination of the
water table by sanitary facilities, and other environmental disruptions associated with construction.
Moreover, the project will promote female education, which over time will help reduce population
pressure.

IV. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Expected Benefits
4.1              The five-year program is expected to increase primary enrollment by about 886,000
of which about 42% will be girls. This will increase the gross enrollment rate (GER) for girls
substantially, from 36% now to 60% at the end of the program period. The GER for boys would
increase from 71 % to 94 %. Worldwide research has shown that primary education has the highest social
returns and that education of girls, in particular, will also lead to reduced fertility -- which is particularly
important in light of Pakistan's high population growth rate of 3.1 %. The recruitment and use of local
women as teachers will show rural parents that girls can be an economic asset, and thus encourage them
to send their daughters to school. Information-based decision-making in education management and
involvement of parents in school monitoring and supervision will lead to increased participation rates and
enhanced resource mobilization, the latter through parents' donating labor or services. The Education
Assessment Programs introduce accountability of district-level officials and teachers for student outcomes.
Increasing the number of hours of active learning by pupils in class as a result of a more pupil-centered
approach will improve performance, and thus students' and teachers' levels of satisfaction with schooling.
This in turn should reduce drop-out and repetition rates and increase the efficiency and decrease
per-student costs of primary education.
B. Program Risks and Actions to Minimize Them
4.2              The major risk is that the Government implementation agencies will lack capacity to
implement the program. This risk is alleviated by using the SAP Project as a macro-level instrument to
remove key bottlenecks to implementation, by preparation of a five-year implementation plan, and by
detailed Annual Workplans. In addition, provision of a donor-supported resident technical assistance and
integration of donor inputs will also facilitate implementation. Another risk is the potential lack of female
teachers to staff girls' schools in rural areas. This risk is alleviated by a survey identifying educated girls
willing to be teachers, who will then be recruited and trained through a Mobile Teacher Training Program
and local Teacher Resource Centers. Continued professional and materials support are provided to these
teachers through the Learning Coordinators System. Risks also attach to the development of community
involvement. In the past, beneficiaries have not been involved in community decisions about schooling,
which were taken by a few traditional community leaders who tended to oppose to girls' education. The
program would be hindered if they do not relinquish control. This risk would be addressed by
establishing village education committees (VECs), which would consist mainly of parents of children in
the school catchment areas, regardless of their status in the community. Another risk is the involvement
of politicians in site selection at the district level, which may result in school locations not suitable for
schooling. This risk will be alleviated through a program to prepare politicians to use the EMIS for
rational selection and monitoring of school sites.

V. CONDITIONALITIES AND RECOMMENDATION
A. Agreements Reached
5.1              Agreements were reached during Negotiations that GONWFP will:
(a)   submit an Annual Work Plan for the following Fiscal Year by March 30 of each year (para.
2.14);
(b)   hold an Annual Review with IDA not later than May 1 of each year to formulate: (i) the
scope and financing of the following year's Annual Work Plan; and (ii) policy actions to
be carried out during the Annual Work Plan period, all satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.10);
(c)   allocate the total financing required, from domestic and external sources, to carry out the
Annual Work Plan as agreed during the Annual Review. Furthermore, at least one-fourth
of the Government's allocation to the program in a given Fiscal Year would be deposited
in the accounts of the implementing agencies prior to the start of the first quarter of each
Fiscal Year. Expenditures incurred out of the proceeds of such amount deposited would
be fully replenished prior to the start of each subsequent quarter (para. 2.10);
(d)   ensure that the Government's budgetary allocation to primary education will increase by at
least 5 % in real terms annually for both development and recurrent expenditures, using the
actual level of expenditures for Fiscal Year 1993-94 as the base year (para. 2.9 (d);
(e)   prepare a Mid-Fiscal Year Status Report by January 15 of each Fiscal Year, including
financial and physical progress (para. 2.14);
(f)  in consultation with IDA, and in accordance with terms of reference and methodology
satisfactory to IDA, undertake and complete by October 31, 1998, a Mid-term review of
the Program and carry out the recommendations of such a review (para. 2.13);
(g)   ensure that the FEF carries out schemes for provision of financial assistance in accordance
with the Frontier Education Foundation Act, 1992, with particular emphasis to the
beneficiary targeting provisions set forth therein (para. 2.21);
(h)   establish community schools and implement schemes for provision of scholarships in
accordance with arrangements to be established by December 31, 1996, acceptable to IDA
(para. 2.48); and,
(i)   provide to the Association not later than February 15 of each Fiscal Year a list of school
and classroom construction and rehabilitation sites for the following Fiscal Year selected
according to agreed site selection procedures (para. 2.11).
5.2        Subject to the above understandings and conditions, the project provides a suitable basis for
an IDA Credit of SDR 104 million equivalent (US$ 150 million) to the Government of the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan.

ANNEX 4
NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION: THE FRONTIER EDUCATION FOUNDATION
A. The Need for Private Sector Education in NWFP
1.                 In NWFP the public sector does not have adequate capacity to reach its goal of
universal primary education in the short to medium term. Hence, the GONWFP is encouraging private
initiatives in the field of primary education. Under present circumstances, private schools, whether run
by non-profit organizations or by owners who intend to make profit, serve the public interest.
2.                 However, private schools usually cater to urban middle classes and often cannot
cover their costs when operating in lower-income urban areas or in rural areas. A Government that wants
private schools to extend services to less privileged groups and areas cannot rely on market mechanisms
alone, but will want to consider incentives which may include subsidies, provided the latter are lower than
the cost of comparable services provided by the state.
B. The Frontier Education Foundation (FEF)
3.                 The GONWFP has created the FEF with the goal of promoting private education
in order to narrow the gap between a growing educational demand and what the public school system is
able to supply. GONWFP intends to channel its subsidies to private schools through the FEF. These
private schools may be run by the private sector, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), Community-
based Organizations (CBOs) and Village Education Committees (VECs).
4.                 The FEF administration is headed by a Managing Director assisted by a technical
and a financial manager, a legal adviser and support staff. It plans to establish regional committees,
supported by offices with full-time coordinators and secretarial staff, which shall examine and comment
on applications before their submission to the Foundation's headquarters.
5.                 The FEF's capital consists, so far, of Rs. 250 million granted by GONWFP. This
amount is intended to serve as seed money and will be kept as a fixed interest-bearing deposit. The
budget is based on this income. In addition, the Foundation has entered an agreement with a commercial
bank which is prepared to sponsor educational projects, and it intends to approach other potential
sponsors. As part of the NWFP-PEP, ODA is expected to provide financial support for community and
other private schools through FEF.
6.                 Considering the need for additional educational facilities at all levels of the
educational system, FEF has the intention to act not only to the benefit of primary, but also of secondary
education. It has been agreed, however, that primary education should be given high priority during the
first years of FEF's operation, while gradually increasing the share of support to middle and secondary
education. FEF financing for the primary sector would be 100% of the total FEF spending in 1994-95,



57
at least 90% in the first year of the NWFP-PEP, 80% in the second and third years, 70% in the fourth
and at least 60% in the fifth year. This agreement will be implemented through the Annual Work Plan
reviews.
C. The Conceptual Framework for FEF
7.                  General Targeting Principles under all Modalities. Female education has been
defined as the principal target of the NWFP-PEP. To support this objective, the FEF will provide
assistance to schools serving girl students living in rural areas and urban slums. In these areas, girls
schools and mixed schools with at least 50% girls enrollment will qualify for the program. Other
conditions include approval, by the Foundation, of standards, syllabus, and fee adjustments. Schools
assisted by FEF shall be registered as a corporate body. Small community organizations (like unregistered
CBOs and VECs) can qualify for the program by associating themselves with registered NGOs.
Furthermore, assisted schools are requested to operate in two shifts where possible. FEF expects assisted
schools to be financially self-sustaining after three years.
8.                  During the initial phase of its operation, the Foundation's management has prepared
a conceptual framework plan for possible future activities. This framwork includes several components:
(a) loan-cum-grants to assist in the establish of 60 private schools in rural areas and urban slums per year;
(b) aid to help establishment of 250 community schools in rural areas or urban slums; (c) provision of
stipends/matching grants to low income pupils; (d) designing a flexible mode of operations to permit the
FEF to try different approaches and search for cost-effective interventions; and, (e) provision of
implementation/technical assistance to individual and collaborative private and public sector initiatives in
promoting additional access to primary education. Components (a), (b) and (c) are described in greater
detail below. The FEF would also provide technical assistance, but not financial assistance, to schools
catering to the non-disadvantaged population. The implementation strategy, levels of subsidies, adjustment
to targeting mechanisms and design issues will be reviewed annually during the Annual Work Plan
reviews.
9.                  Loan-cum-Grant Component. FEF's rules provide for it to  support the
establishment of new schools by making available financial support covering half of the costs involved,
25 % as loans and 25 % as grants. If they meet the criteria in paragraph 8, private schools run by NGOs,
CBOs, Community Organizations and by owners who intend to make a profit will qualify under this
component. The loans are to be paid back after three years. While this is a workable arrangement for
schools in an urban or peri-urban setting, the formula might fail to attract private educational
entrepreneurs to rural areas, where the chances to recovering their investment are considerably lower.
Hence, given the urgency of attracting investors to educationally deprived rural areas, the formula was
adjusted, for rural areas, to 50% loans and 20% grants, the remaining 30% to be provided by the
investor. This formula could prove attractive not only to individual entrepreneurs, but also to local
communities. It is important to emphasize that the schemes supported by FEF, under this component, will
not follow the conventional model of school construction before the school has been functioning for
several years and a stable enrollment is assured. School construction will only be financed after a
probation period of two years during which the school enrollment is verified. During the probation period
the program will provide partial financing of the operational costs of the school.
10.     As previously stated FEF was originally constituted to provide assistance to the establishment
of private schools in NWFP. In the original design the loan-cum-grant component constituted the main



58
approach. However, it was soon verified that it was hard to identify applicants from small rural villages.
In response, it was agreed (starting in FY 1994-1995) with the GONWFP that FEF would expand its
scope of work to the establishment of rural community-based schools. Those schools would be established
with NGO/CBO assistance, and would be managed jointly by the NGO/CBOs and the Village Education
Committee. This strategy was designed to bridge the gap between the demand of small communities for
girls education and their lack of capacity in organizing themselves to prepare and submit projects for
consideration by FEF.
11.                 Moreover, any formula of loans-cum-grants is unlikely to satisfy the specific
educational needs of sparsely populated areas, and of the smaller villages typical for large parts of
NWFP. Schools with less than 200 pupils can only with difficulty cover their recurrent costs; schools
with less than 150 pupils cannot break even. (The major sources of lumpiness in the cost structure are:
teachers salaries, rent, building maintenance and repair, and instruction materials.) Hence, under the
specific demographic conditions of many places in rural NWFP, private schools can operate only if they
are granted subsidies covering their recurrent costs deficit. It has been agreed that the Foundation, which
gives strong priority to educational development in rural areas, should provide subsidies to smaller village
schools. These villages schools may be owned and operated by NGOs, CBOs and VECs. The Scheme
would operate as described in paragraphs 12-15 below.
12.                 Rural Community Private Schools. FEF will provide assistance to rural community
organizations to establish and run community primary schools. It will assist the community organizations
to identify teachers acceptable to the village (female or male, according to the standards set by the
Education Department, and acceptable to VECs, or Village Organizations). A minimum of 25 girls
students will be a prerequisite to starting a village private school for girls. The responsibility of the
village organization would also include the formation of a Village Education Committee (VEC), ensuring
the availability of a permanent site for the school, and the payment of the teacher's salary. It can be a
consortium of 2-10 villages or individual villages. Under the program, for a period of 3 years, subsidy
of Rs. 100 per female student would be made available directly to the VEC for up to 25 female students
per class, to provide pooled grants of Rs. 2500/month. The limit of Rs. 2500/teacher/class is based on
the current salary level paid by government to teachers in community schools. However, if the VEC
wished to pay only a part of that amount to the teacher as salary, and use the balance for repair or
maintenance of the school premises, or for the purpose of additional educational materials, it should be
free to do so. Similarly, if the VEC wishes to pay a higher salary or to provide annual salary increases,
it may do so through its own resources, or by collecting a suitable fees from the students.
13.                 Should the VEC and the community jointly decide to allow boys to attend the
school, this is acceptable, though no grants would be provided to them. Indeed, it is acceptable for the
VEC to charge fees for boys' attendance. If the girls are charged fees in addition to the Rs. 100 subsidy
the boys should be charged at least the same or more as that additional fee. Additionally the maximum
proportion of boys in any classroom should not be more than 50%. However, the maximum class size
should not exceed 50 and the minimum class size should not fall below 15.
14.                 Teachers in VEC schools will be required to have, at a minimum, a certificate of
matriculation with at least a B grade, and to have met the teaching qualification standards established by
the FEF. The VEC and the teacher will write a formal contract which lays out compensation terms and
the rights and responsibilities of both parties.



59
In selecting schools appropriate for subsidies that are located in small villages, FEF
can draw on the experience of the Community Support Basic Education Pilot Project for Girls currently
under way and funded by UNICEF. Should the community school program prove to be highly successful
and lead, as planned, to the establishment of 250 schools in small villages, FEF might consider acting
as an agency for their support. Those decisions will be part of Annual Work-Plan Review process. FEF
is currently conducting an assessment of NGO and CBO capacity with the aim of identifying NGOs and
CBOs with proven capacity in community organization.
15.                Stipends/Matching grants. FEF is considering several approaches to facilitating
access to private schools for female pupils from urban underprivileged groups, such as support for
schools to be found in, or in the vicinity of, urban slums. The allocation of stipends/matching grants,
allowing pupils from such groups to attend already existing private schools, constitutes a particularly
efficient and rapid approach. The Foundation will set up an independent body (Terms of Reference to
be agreed during the forthcoming annual review) to identify private schools qualified and willing to
accommodate stipend holders, and to establish appropriate rules for the selection of candidates. The
stipends will be initially set at Rs. 100 per girl per month; the values will be review annually during the
Annual Work-Program Review.
16.                FEF has succeeded in securing a financial contribution from a private bank donated
to sponsor educational purposes. The Foundation intends to canvass other potential donors, offering its
services in selecting and monitoring appropriate projects.
17.                It is agreed that the Foundation will entrust the monitoring and evaluation of its
activities to independent private consultants.  Furthermore, FEF intends to obtain the services of
independent researchers or agencies for studies relevant to its work.

ANNEX 5
NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
ISSUES IN TEACHER SUPPLY AND TRAINING
1.      There are two main routes to trained status for primary teachers. The first main route is
through the 9-month course at GCET toward the Primary Teaching Certificate. There is no shortage of
candidates for this route and though the minimum qualification is matriculation, taken after 10 years of
schooling, many applicants have 12 years and FA/FSc. The second main route is for untrained teachers
to upgrade through either the AIOU distance learning/ correspondence course or through the shortened
3-month PTC course. The latter is more popular, though of doubtful quality for reasons given below.
2.      Annual Requirements for Teachers: The capacity of the GCETs, together with the output of
PTC teachers by the AIOU, should be governed by the annual requirements for teachers. The total
number of teachers required is determined by the formula relating enrolment, by steps, to teachers.
Because teachers in each district are de facto a separate cadre, transfers between districts are few. Hence,
there is a maldistribution of teachers. Within a single district there are also inequalities in staffing partly
caused by cultural factors, particularly in the case of women, which inhibit residence outside the "home"
area. Thus, while Table 1 shows that there are at present sufficient teachers - to match the formula -
it is known that staffing of schools, again particularly of girls' schools, is very difficult in rural areas.
There are unknown numbers of unemployed trained teachers. Teacher posts in some areas have been
obtained by political influence rather than ability/qualification. Data on attrition from the work force are
not available. In short, the standard calculation of annual teacher requirements is not easily answered
in NWFP. Ideally judgement of the adequacy or otherwise of the current and planned GCET capacity
should be made after work is done to update the Master Plan and a survey of the GCET facilities is
completed. The estimates below are made on the basis of the best data presently available.
3.      Current numbers of teachers: The Provincial EMIS data provides excellent data on the current
(1992-93) number of teachers by sex by District and Tehsil. This data is summarized in Table 1. There
are 47,635 teachers of whom 11,978 are female. The formal legal position for government schools is
that each primary school should have two teachers for rolls of 1 - 149, 3 for 150 - 199 etc. When that
formula is used the number of teachers required is 40,647, of whom 10,815 should be female. In five
Tehsils' the number of female teachers does not reach the formula level. Otherwise there are excess
teachers in schools compared to the formula.

4.       Demand for Teachers: Table 2 sets out a forecast of the demand for teachers on the basis of
a number of assumptions. The present excess of teachers over the formula number is taken as the de
facto number required in the base year. The number of teachers required as a result of i) school openings;
ii) additional rooms; iii) conversion of Mosque schools into full-fledged schools equals the planned
numbers in the building program up to 1997/8. A similar number is assumed for the remaining two years
of the program. A notional number of trained teachers is included against the needs of private schools.

5.       The demand for teachers rises from 47,700 last year to 79,750 by FY 2000.
6.       Supplv of Trained Teachers: Table 3 shows how supply of trained teachers could change under
certain assumptions and as a result of successful completion of the current and planned building program
for GCETs and of the proposed seven new GCETs. The key assumptions are:
a.          Wastage from current stock will be 3 % annually. (If an average career is 30 years
in teaching then 3% would be the annual loss from retirement annually.)
b.           A detailed note to Table 3 shows the assumptions for the growth of outputs from
GCETs. It is pointed out that the female GCETs will have an average enrolment of 100 PTC
places.



62
7.          It is reported that the condensed PTC  course enrolled 9000 untrained teachers in the 1992/3
session. However, it is proposed to halt the present course until the new PTC curriculum can be
condensed into a course which may give classroom skills and useful knowledge to experienced but
untrained teachers. When it starts up again it will be taught by staff of GCETs who have appropriate
training. In short, the training done by secondary teachers will be abandoned.

phased out. New cturse introduced to upgrade selected teachers with 3+ years of service and coming from selected areas. Volume of condensed course
training to be linited to capacity of GCETs and master trainers to conduct the training. Use of High School teachers to be abandoned.
8.         The supply  figures show  that on the basis of the above assumptions the number of trained
teachers could double by the year 2000 from  38000 in 1992/3 to over 77000 after the outputs from  the
GCETs in FY  2000.  (These conclusions are particularly  sensitive to the rate of attrition of trained
teachers.)
9.          The balance between  supply of and  demand  for teachers:   Table 4 shows that the balance
remains  negative  over the  program   timeframe.   The  plans  for expanding  supply  through  adding
strategically to provision and reforming the condensed PTC course result in a relatively low deficits of
trained teachers while ensuring that should demand for short course training emerge from a larger than

expected enrolment2 of girls there is a suitable course available. By not over-expanding GCET provision
possible over production of PTC teachers is avoided.

work, production of CT teachers etc.

ANNEX 6
NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS COMPONENT
A. The Role and Importance of Textbooks in the NWFP
1.      Very little teaching/learning support is provided to parents or pupils in NWFP by either the
Federal or Provincial governments. A test survey of primary schools revealed that the basic minimum
equipment and resources purchased by almost all children in primary schools consisted of text books,
copy books, pencils, a tahti, qulum, clay and ink. Government provides buildings and teachers. Many
buildings are in need of maintenance and many teachers are untrained. Furniture often does not run even
to jute mats.  With so little provided to the pupils and teachers, the textbook assumes a position of
central importance. It is the sole vehicle for the curriculum; it is usually the only source of knowledge,
information and pedagogy available to the teacher; it is the basis of all assessment.
2.      The textbook also may be one of the key determinants of enrollment. Teachers lay great stress
on the possession of textbooks (at least the basic textbooks of Urdu and Maths) and copybooks. Most
children at school possess the basic textbooks (even though the physical condition of many of the
textbooks is extremely poor). Most children also purchase at least one or two copybooks (many poor
children write in pencil, rub out and reuse the copybook until it disintegrates). Considerable teacher
pressure is brought to bear on children to make sure that these items are brought to school. The inability
or unwillingness of very poor parents to afford these basics may determine whether or not a child attends
school.
3.      Recent figures suggest that the large increase in primary school investment by government in
the last three years has not been accompanied by a corresponding large increase in enrollment.
Government investment is largely in salaries and buildings; only very limited resources are devoted to
those inputs that are known to have the greates impact on educational quality and learning. Existing data
suggests that while textbook expenditure represents only a fraction of the cost of primary education to
richer parents (perhaps 5% or less; see Table 3 below), it can amount to 45% or more of the cost of
primary education to the very poorest parents. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the results of a survey of books
and consumable supplies and other items of parental expenditure on primary education. They indicate
the potential importance of a few basic items of recurrent expenditure to poor parents.

4.      Textbooks in NWFP (as in all provinces in Pakistan) are extremely cheap. A complete set of
textbooks (5 books) for grade 1 would cost a parent around US$0.90 at 1993 prices and exchange rates.
A complete set of grade 5 textbooks (7 textbooks) would cost a parent around US$2.50. The textbooks
are cheap because of perceived parental price resistance but also because of intense social and political
pressure to keep prices at very low levels. Unfortunately the very low cost of textbooks has
disadvantages. The textbooks are very poorly specified in the quality of paper, cover card, cover finish
and binding used in their manufacture. In addition to the poor specifications the manufacture is not
always well performed. In consequence the textbooks deteriorate very quickly - particularly in lower
grades in rural areas. NWFP Textbook Board sales figures for 1992/3 indicate that annual sales of key
textbooks for grades I and 2 can be 5 times the provincial enrollment for these grades. This is a clear
indication that the textbooks are not lasting through the school year and that parents are obliged to
repurchase several times if they can afford it. Many poorer children maintain tattered, dirty and often
incomplete collections of unbound pages which have little or no practical educational value. The general
condition of books owned by children - even in the wealthier districts - is very poor after only a few
months of the school year.
5.      It is often claimed that parents have their new textbooks bound up by village bookbinders and
that this provides added protection and achieves much enhanced book life at little extra cost (the binding
cost appears to vary randomly between R5 and R20 per book). There are certainly bound books in
schools but from the available evidence these are very much in the minority. The final school survey
results will provide concrete information on the proportion of strengthened bindings in schools. There
is little doubt that local bookbinding does greatly add to the strength of the books.
6.      Another consequence of the concentration on low-cost textbooks is that a number of the
textbooks are very short in length. A grade 4 maths textbook, for example, only has 48 pages - which
is not long enough for a year's work. Conversely teachers complain that many of the textbooks are too
hard. This in turn is almost certainly a consequence of short book length since the level of progression
from one concept to another is too steep because there is insufficient page space to progress at a more
acceptable pace. This would matter less if the teachers were well trained or were supported by good
teachers' guides related to the textbooks. In NWFP neither is true and poorly trained teachers without
the benefit of good teachers' guides have to rely on very short textbooks with insufficient information,
explanation, practice, exercise or activity material.
7.      There are regular complaints of poor content quality in the textbooks. This is difficult for a non
Urdu or Pashto speaker to judge but the plethora of curriculum reform and instructional materials projects
in the Province and repeated criticism of textbook content suggests that there is a need for radical
improvement.
8.      The Textbook Boards have opted for color in the lower primary grades. The preliminary results
of the school survey suggest that most teachers and parents would prefer less color and stronger books
with more content and help to pupils and teachers. Black and white texts would allow more to be spent
on durability and extent without significantly increasing costs. When the final school survey results are
available in October there will be hard information available on which to base future textbook production
and presentation decisions.
9.      Few teachers have ever seen a curriculum. The allocation of subject hours per week, for
example, is largely ignored in schools. Teachers often concentrate on the subjects they know best. Thus
Urdu (or Pashto) dominates the teaching hours - closely followed by Maths. Science often gets far less



67
than its allocated time simply because teachers feel relatively insecure with science in comparison with
Urdu and Maths - particularly in the higher grades of primary school. The existing primary school
curriculum is currently being printed and provided to all schools funded by the Education Department.
10.     Textbook distribution works very well. Most schools have access to books at the beginning of
the school year and can acquire replacements relatively easily. In distant areas teachers act as sales
agents for Textbook Board books which provides a service to parents and creates a little extra commission
income for the teachers. Textbooks are generally sold at official prices without mark-up and there is no
evidence of profiteering. Conversely, free book distribution (of teachers' guides) does not have a good
record. There is a widespread consensus that textbooks should not be given away free. They should be
sold even if the price is notional. The maintenance of a commercial interest is considered essential to
maintain the efficiency of the current textbook distribution system.
11.     In summary, textbooks are the most basic and most widely available investment in educational
quality in NWFP. For most schools they represent the curriculum, the most cost effective teacher
training and the basis of all assessment. They are extremely cheap but they are also very poorly produced
and this leads to short book life and repeat purchases which increase costs to parents. The textbooks are
also very short, which increases their level of difficulty while decreasing their utility to teachers and
pupil. For the very poorest parents they appear to be one of the two major costs in sending children to
primary school. They are also one of the basic items that are common to all children in the educational
system - even the poorest schools possess textbooks although not perhaps in the same numbers as richer
schools. The affordability of textbooks may thus be one of the determinants of marginal enrollment
among the poorest students. Despite their importance, textbooks receive no financial assistance from
government. Indeed the heavy tax on both local and imported paper represents a tax on access to
education which unfairly punishes the poorest. Donor investment to date in instructional materials has
been more concerned with the development of improved materials (which is extremely important) rather
than with cost support to the poorest parents.
12.     On the basis of the above analysis there is a very strong case for financing textbook production.
B. Teachers' Guides
13.     Teachers are expected to purchase teachers' guides out of their own pockets. Historically they
have been unable or unwilling to do so. There has been little or no federal or provincial government
assistance for teachers' guides. As a result the NWFP Textbook Board (which operates on a self
financing basis) has not published teachers' guides to accompany its textbooks for many years.
14.     Primary school teachers - poorly trained and using inadequate textbooks in under-resourced
classrooms - thus have had no access to the cheapest and most basic tool to improve teacher performance.
Virtually no teachers guides exist in any government primary school classroom in NWFP.
15.     The Curriculum Bureau has received very modest sums of money from the Provincial Education
Department in recent years to produce teachers' guides but the finance was inadequate, the guides were
recognized to be of poor quality and the free distribution system failed to achieve widespread distribution
to schools in the province.



68
16.     The IDA PEP 2 project aimed to solve the problem by the production and dissemination of
learning modules with the active assistance of learning coordinators. The learning modules are currently
under reappraisal.
17.     A NORAD project is currently programmed to provide free annotated textbooks for teachers'
use to accompany the Textbook Board textbooks. They are in active production and are scheduled for
distribution to schools for the first three grades of primary in 1994.
18.     The government of NWFP has recently approved a recurrent school budget of R500 per
classroom per year for the purchase of teachers' guides and other ancillary classroom material. Core
teachers' guides should be given priority in this allocation.
19.     The amount of finance required to provide teachers' guides in all subjects in all grades to all
schools in NWFP is very small. On current calculations less than $100,000 p.a. is required to cover the
requirements of all schools from Grades 1 to 5. These cost estimates assume a five year teachers' guide
life which in turn assumes good quality physical production specifications and good conservation practices
by teachers.
20.     The development costs of teachers' guides should be covered by the development costs normally
associated with textbooks and do not require separate financial provision in the project.
C. Supplementary Readinz Materials (SRMs)
21.     Reading ability is basic to all education. In NWFP, as in all other Provinces in Pakistan, the
primary school system has no provision for any supplementary reading material whatsoever. Only
children from wealthy homes attending good private schools are likely to have access to a reasonable
variety of stimulating reading materials. The preliminary results of the school survey indicate that most
schools have no supplementary reader collections and that hardly any have convenient access to a nearby
children's library.
22.     Recent research evidence demonstrates convincingly that children's reading interest and skills
are greatly enhanced with practice. Practice is only possible with constant access to a relevant collection
of reading materials.
23.     In NWFP the overwhelming majority of children are taught to read with no books in the home,
no books save the basic textbooks in schools and no access to a public library system. Textbooks are the
only source of reading material available and they are usually in a very shoddy condition, are curriculum
not pleasure/leisure oriented and are far too short.
24.     With so little access to reading material it is not surprising that reading skills are poorly
developed in NWFP and that this in turn has an adverse impact on the learning of other curriculum
subjects and skills.
25.     The lack of a school library market combined with very poor parents who cannot afford to buy
reading books has severely affected the development of private sector children's publishing in Urdu and
other local languages. A recent UNICEF survey on supplementary reading materials in Urdu for children
commented critically on the number of stimulating and educationally acceptable titles available. Since



69
reading habits are generally formed early in life it is difficult to see how a genuinely literate society in
Urdu and other local languages can ever develop in Pakistan without positive action by government to
encourage reading by investing in basic collections of SRMs in every primary school.
26.     Donor agencies have recognized the problem and a number of projects in NWFP have funding
for the development of SRMs. Apart from NORAD, none have funds for province wide distribution and
the NORAD project will support relatively few titles and is in any case scheduled to terminate in 1995.
No existing project aims at a sustainable system of SRM provision based on maximum cost effectiveness
(to achieve affordability) and maximum educational benefit (to achieve significant pupil achievement
upgrading.

SUBJECT: NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAMME 1995-2000
Dear   .n   Ijen memX
ii| i     To redress the low literacy rate and improve education at
primar  level in NWFP, the Government of NWFP with the assistance
of!the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, KFW/GTZ, ODA, JICA,
the jr yal Netherlands Government and other multilateral and
bilate al donors is launching the Primary Education Programme 1995-
2000 f om 1st July, 1995. The aim of the programme is to promote
primar   education with a focus on rural girls education.  The
strate y adopted for implementation of the programme expresses the
intere t of the Government of NWFP to implement the NWFP Primary
-Educat on Programme as outlined in the attached PCI Form. The PCI
has be n cleared by the CDWP on 10th November, 1994 for approval by
the EC EC. The strategy conforms to the policy reforms to which the
Govern6ment of NWFP has agreed to under the Social Action Programme.
Whe strategy is as follows:-
i.   To improve access, equity and efficiency in the primary
education sub-sector through reforms to:
a.   locate schools only where feasible on the basis of
the agreed planning criteria;
b.   reduce  or  consolidate  schools  with  very  low
enrolment;
c.   promote   mixed-gender   schools   in   receptive
communities;
d.   increase  the  supply   of   female  teachers  by
recruiting and training local girls;
e.   upgrade  girls  primary  schools  to middle  school
level where feasible on the basis of the planning
criteria;
f.   subsidize private schools catering to the needs of
the low income population and rural girls through
the Frontier Education Foundation and;
g.   entrust the responsibility of construction work of
primary schools to the Construction Advisory Unit
already established within the Education Department
from 1st July 1995 in Peshawar Division on trial
basis.
li. To improve the learning environment through reforms to:
a.   integrate  and  rationalize   existing   textbooks
development through NWFP Textbook Board subject to
approval of Curriculum Wing, Ministry of Education,
Government  of  Pakistan,  and  improve  textbook
production so that all students have access to
affordable, high quality textbooks and;
b.   provide  every  classroom  with  a minimal  set of
instructional materials;

a       coordinators.
ii. To improve organization planning and management of the
primary education sub-sector through reforms to:
a.   make school supervisors accountable for improvement
in student enrolment and achievement;
b.   establish    policies  and  procedures  to  monitor
quantitative and qualitative  outcomes of primary
education and;
c. |designate  one of the existing  teachers  as head
// teacher in schools with five or more teachers.
/ Priority will be given to the continued development
and expansion of the existing Education Management
Information  System  (EMIS) , including  the annual
school census and a continuously updated school
mapping   programme   (SMP),  an   annual   student
assessment   through   assessment   programme   and
management training at all levels.
iv. To coordinate donor involvement in the primary education
sub-sector through the already established Primary
Education Programme Coordination Office and through
annual review meetings with the donors in March each year
to finalise:
a.   the scope and financing of the following year's
Annual Work Plan and;
b.   policy actions to be carried out during the Annual
Work Plan period.
v.  To allocate the total finances required from domestic and
available external resources to carry out the Annual Work
Plan. Furthermore, one fourth of the Government's share
to the programme would be placed at the disposal of
implementing agencies at the beginning of the fiscal year
for execution of work on approved schemes.

NWFP-PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Organization Responsible for the Program
1.             The NWFP Province through the Education Department would be responsible to carry out the
Program. The NWFP DPE, Education Department, would be the organization responsible for the coordination of
all program-related activities and for facilitating resource flows to the implementing agencies. The DPE would also
serve as the clearinghouse for issues requiring decisions by the top management of the NWFP Education Department
and by external agencies, including IDA.
B. Responsibilities for Implementation
2.             The program would be implemented by the line units of the Directorate of Primary Education
(DPE) and by other line agencies of the NWFP Education Department. The DPE would be responsible for overall
program implementation as well as for daily program operations as follows: (a) monitoring program progress, costs
and program accounts; (b) processing disbursement applications and keeping track of disbursements of credit funds;
(c) procurement of equipment and software packages and administration of supplier and technical assistance
contracts; (d) placement and tracking of local staff receiving training abroad; (e) monitoring procurement of civil
works undertaken by the Communication and Works (C&W) Department, Construction Advisory Unit (CAU) and
Architect/ Engineer (A/E) consultants; (f9 preparation of consolidated periodic reports on the progress of program
implementation; (g) arranging for audits of accounts; and (h) preparation of annual work plans and budget
requirements for program implementation.
3.             Other principal implementing agencies and their respective program sub-component would be: (a)
the CAU, which would take charge of school construction and facilities in one division, with the objective of
expanding to more divisions, if successful, after two years of operation; (b) the C&W Department for school
construction in the remaining divisions; (c) the NWFP Textbook Board (NWFPTB) for publication and distribution
of books and instructional materials; (d) the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) for strengthening the
institutional framework (provincial directorate program, education management information system, planning,
research and evaluation); and (e) the Frontier Education Foundation (FEF) for mobilizing private sector resources
(private school pilot experiment, beneficiary participation (see Annex 4). The Curriculum Bureau, supported by
the Provincial Institute for Teacher Education (PITE), would be in charge of teacher training programs including
the Teacher Training Project funded by ADB. For specific allocation of primary implementation responsibility by
component, see Table 1. Organizational charts for the NWFP Directorate of Primary Education and Offices of
District and Sub-district Education Officers are included in Table 2-4 below.
4.             Primary Education Program Coordination Office (PEP-CO): PEP-CO has been established prior
to negotiations and is assisting the Government to comply with all donors' requirements for project processing
during the pre-effectiveness period. During the program period PEP-CO will: (i) coordinate donors' inputs to
ensure the coherence and consistency of the program and advise all new and existing donors about on-going
activities in the province to avoid duplication; (ii) assist the Government in the preparation of in-advance progress
reports to include all pertinent data to meet supervision requirements; and (iii) provide donor supervision missions
with independent verification of the Government's progress reports. PEP-CO will be located at the Provincial
Education Secretariat level and will work closely with both principal implementing agencies and the PEP Steering



76
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 6
Committee. PEP-CO is supported by FRG and is headed by an expatriate long-term resident technical advisor.
C. Relationship of the NWFP-DPE with other Entities
5.             The Steering Committee, under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary for Planning and
Development, would ensure coordination outside of the Department of Education among the different Government
departments and agencies that have an impact on primary education. Its members would include: Additional Chief
Secretary (Chair), Secretaries of Finance, Education and P&D (Implementation); Director of Primary Education;
Director, Curriculum Bureau; and Secretary, Textbook Board. This Committee would be responsible for reviewing
all schemes and projects in the primary education sub-sector, regardless of funding sources. The participation of
the Program beneficiaries (teachers, students and parents) would be ensured by the DPE through its Education
Officers. Several program components are specifically designed to enhance beneficiary participation.
D. Role of Bank and other Donors during Implementation
6.            In line with the Bank's directive to increase borrower ownership and reduce supervision cost, the
program is supporting several new and on-going processes and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation,
including: (i) institutionalization of the Annual Reviews as a Government mechanism to report implementation
progress for the year to the Government's own Primary Education Steering Committee and to the donors; (ii)
contracting private architectural and engineering firms for ex-post site verification; and (iii) strengthening the
capacity of the Research, Development & Evaluation (RD&E) section in the Directorate of Primary Education to
monitor outcomes through educational assessment programs and through on-going and planned data-collection
exercises conducted by the EMIS. These processes and mechanisms will be supported by donor-funded technical
assistance and will provide both the Government and donors with timely and accurate data on implementation
progress and educational outcomes. A fourth mechanism is the donor-funded Primary Education Program
Coordination Office (PEP-CO), which in addition to its coordination and capacity-building role, will provide donors
with independent verification of the Government's own monitoring and evaluation efforts. In particular, PEP-CO
will ensure that the Government, with technical assistance, prepares in advance progress reports to include all
pertinent data to meet supervision requirements. During supervision missions, the PEP-CO will assist all the
donors' supervision missions to validate Government's progress reports. PEP-CO has already been established and
is currently assisting the Government to comply with all donor requirements for project processing.
7.            There will be semi-annual supervision missions, the Annual Work Plan Review in March/April
and the Mid-Year Review in November each year during Program implementation. The Annual Work Plan Review
will be a full supervision with participation from all donors. Each donor will supervise its respective component
in coordination with others. At the Annual Review the Work Plan for the coming year will be discussed and agreed
upon. The Mid-Year Review supervision mission will be conducted mainly by World Bank Resident Mission staff,
with voluntary participation from other donors. To ensure complementarity with the on-going SAPP operation, both
missions will also supervise the NWFP SAPP education component. Donors will continue to meet bi-annually to
ensure coordination.

ANNEX 10
NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
SUPERVISION PLAN
1.      NWFP-PEP has a built-in self-supervision system which is designed to reduce the cost of
supervision and enhance Government participation and ownership of the program. The evaluation and
monitoring system will make use of existing databases such as EMIS, Human Resources Survey and the
Northwest Education Assessment Program. Further sub-systems will be developed with the technical
assistance from donors, including construction management and financial management systems. The
donor-funded PEP Coordination Office, staffed by GTZ, will assist the Government with progress
reporting in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the reports.
2.      Institutionalization of the self-supervision system and joint supervision missions with donors
will cover a large portion of the supevision costs. The remaining costs which has be to borne by IDA
are to ensure that the Government follow IDA procedures in procurement and disbursement.  It is
expected that IDA supervision costs can be reduced from the standard 15 staffweeks to an average of 10
staffweeks per year.
3.      A project launch mission will take place around June 1995 to familiarize Government staff on
IDA procedures and further induct various implementation units to activities of each component. There
will be semi-annual supervision missions at the time of the Annual Work Plan Review in March/April
and the Mid-Year Review in November. At the time of the Annual Review a full supervision will take
place with participation of HQ and RMP staff, as well as representatives from the various donor agencies
who will supervise their own components. At the Annual Review the Work Plan for the coming year
will by discussed and agreed and all program components will be reviewed. The Mid-Year Review
supervision mission will be conducted mainly by Resident Mission staff. Both missions will also
supervise the NWFP SAPP education component to reduce Bank costs and ensure complementarity with
the on-going SAPP operation, Increased reliance on RMP staff, inclusion of other donors on supervision
missions, and concurrent supervision of the SAPP will serve to increase the effectiveness of supervision
while keeping the cost of supervision low.

NWFP PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
A. Development Impact Monitoring
1.      The development impact of the NWFP-PEP will be closely monitored through the Annual Work
Plan Review process, drawing on inforrnation from on-going and planned data-collection exercises (incl.
EMIS sub-systems), educational assessment programs (incl. the North-West Educational Assessment
Program), and studies conducted by the Research, Monitoring & Evaluation section in the DPE. These
monitoring mechanisms and procedures will be supported by donor-funded technical assistance, and will
provide the Government and donors with timely and accurate data on implementation progress and
educational outcomes. This will improve targeting of program inputs and encourage borrower ownership.
Furthermore, the already established PEP Coordination Office will assist the Government in preparing
in advance progress reports containing all data required by IDA supervision missions. During supervision
missions, the PEP Coordination Office will assist all donors supervision missions to validate
Government's progress reports.
2.      During Annual Work Plan Reviews, the Government would report on progress according to a
set of monitoring indicators (see Tables 1-3 below) which measure both the efficiency and effectiveness
of the system. These indicators provide assessments of student outcomes (e.g., enrollment increase by
gender), learning achievement (through achievement scores), and system efficiency (e.g. decrease in
number of schools without students). The North-West Educational Assessment Program (NEAP) will
provide assessments of pupil performance in the critical areas of math, science and language in grades
3 and 5.
3.      The monitoring indicators will be reported at the provincial, district and sub-district level and
will form the basis for yearly achievement targets to be set by district administrators. To reach these
targets, district administrators will develop action plans for improving enrollment, the efficiency of
schools, and the effectiveness of schooling.

compliance with the agreed criteria must be verified by DEOs/DPE using EMIS, Human
Resource Survey, and school mapping data, and suitability for construction must be
confirmed by the executing engineers.
By Mar. 30   Send the draft Annual Work Plan to IDA.
By May 1      Annual Program Review between Government and donors to review and agree on the
Annual Work Plan including size of construction for the following FY and school mix
(new, shelterless, additional classrooms etc), as well as the final list of school sites.
By May 15.   Mutate and hand over all of the sites to the construction unit
By May 30.   Package school construction works and prepare tender documents
