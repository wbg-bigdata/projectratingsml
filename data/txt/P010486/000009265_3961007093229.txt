MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed development
Credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 104.0 million, US$150.0 million equivalent, on
standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance a North-West Frontier Province Primary
Education Program (NWFP-PEP).
2.    Country/Sector Background.   Despite substantial economic growth, human resource
development in Pakistan has lagged well behind other countries at similar stages of development and
income levels. Pakistan's gross participation rate of 58% in primary education compares poorly with
developing countries of similar or lower GNP per capita -- for example, Nepal at 64 %, India 98 %, Laos
111%, Bangladesh 70%, China 135%. The low level of human resources development is a major
constraint to a qualitative transformation of Pakistan's economy into a dynamic, middle-income country
like its East Asian neighbors. The Government's own Five-Year Plans since 1955 have set universal
primary education as a priority objective. However, this objective is far from being met as it has not
been backed up by an adequate policy framework or sufficient financial and political commitment. Nor
has the institutional framework been adequate to implement it. Since the mid-80s, IDA and other donors
have devoted substantial resources to primary education. Major programs of quality improvement and
expansion in primary education, with emphasis on girls, are financed by IDA and other donors in Punjab,
Sindh and Balochistan. The ADB, UNICEF, ODA, the European Union, Norway, Germany, and the
Netherlands are also supporting improvements in quality or coverage in primary education in Pakistan.
However, as a result of the Government's limited implementation capacity and an impractical policy
framework, donor-supported projects have been less effective than planned.
3.    To strengthen the policy framework, improve implementation, and increase the volume of social
sector spending, the Government prepared a Social Action Program (SAP), which covers basic education,
basic health, population and water and sanitation programs. IDA and other donors are supporting the
SAP reforms through an umbrella policy-based Social Action Program Project for FY94 to FY96. The
SAPP highlights key issues of program design, implementation and level of funding that cut across the
social sectors. However, these macro-level efforts need to be complemented by province-based sectoral
projects to support a more intensive policy dialogue and institution-building in weak provincial line
agencies. NWFP is the only province without a province-based basic education project. NWFP-PEP fills
this void.
4.    With an ethnically and linguistically diverse population of about 20 million -- 80 percent of whom
live in rural areas, in more than 9,000 villages and settlements -- NWFP contains about one-sixth of
Pakistan's population. Its aggregate literacy rate of 21.5% is about two-thirds the national average of
30% and conceals severe inequities between districts, rural and urban areas, and males and females (for
whom the rates are, respectively, 34% and 8%).



2
5.     The provision of schooling opportunities is insufficient, while at the same time inequitable and
inefficient. Of the 20,137 government primary schools in NWFP, only 4,395, or 22 %, are girls' schools.
Over 30% of teachers have fewer than 20 pupils, indicating inefficient utilization of teaching staff and
facilities. Repeater rates are also high; between 8% and 10% of pupils in each grade repeat that grade.
A poor learning environment may explain why only 60% of the children who begin kindergarten complete
grade 5. Most schools have multi-grade classes, for which the teachers are not trained and instructional
materials not suitably designed. Inadequate organization, planning and management result in school
location and teacher recruitment decisions being made on political bases, with little regard to enrollment
size or community demand. School supervision is hampered by excessive workloads and lack of adequate
transportation. Supervisors also lack training for academic supervision.
6.    Program Objectives. The objectives of the Government's program for the primary education
sub-sector during the years FY96-FY2000 are: (a) to improve access, equity and efficiency in primary
education, particularly for girls; (b) to improve the quality of the learning environment for all schools;
(c) to improve the organizational framework, and the planning, management, assessment and monitoring
capacity of the provincial education system; and (d) to increase village-level beneficiary involvement in
all phases of primary education service delivery.
7.     The NWFP-PEP (FY96-FY2000) is designed as a comprehensive program of education delivery,
which builds on the policy progress made in SAP in FY94 and FY95. It promotes improved operation
of the current system and its gradual expansion in step with increased implementation capacity. To avoid
duplication of effort and ensure a comprehensive approach to primary education, the Government's
program now integrates all on-going and planned activities under various donors and Government-
financed development projects in a coherent and synchronized manner. The program includes both
development and recurrent costs and financing by the GONWFP, IDA, ODA, Germany, ADB, UNICEF,
JICA and the Netherlands.
8.    Program StratM. To ensure that the program objective of improved access to quality primary
education is achieved, NWFP-PEP adopts a three-pronged strategy: (a) implement policy reform
measures agreed to and initiated under the SAP; (b) agree on specific financial inputs, and policy
measures, and annual targets through joint consultations among Government and donors at Annual Work
Plan Reviews; (c) emphasize outcome-based and performance-based monitorinp, indicators to ensure that
effective inputs are planned and delivered.
9.     The policy reform measures introduced during the program preparation period, supported under
IDA's Social Action Program Project in FY94 and FY95, and to be implemented through this operation
include: (a) cross-registration of girls in boys schools and vice versa and expanding the number of new
mixed-gender primary schools; (b) increases in the number of women teachers through relaxation of age
and academic requirements for entry into the teaching profession and improvement in incentives for
female teachers in rural areas; (c) rationalization of the site selection process to ensure adherence to
merit-based criteria; (d) introduction of a new staff posting and transfer policy; (e) increased private
sector involvement in the delivery of primary education; (f) expansion of construction management
capacity through private sector participation; (g) institutionalization of data-based management and
strengthening of the Educational Management and Information System; (h) delegation of authority for
all Government and donor activities in primary education to the Director of Primary Education; (i)
increased involvement of communities in motivation, supervision and school development; and, j)
establishment of a permanent budget heading for instructional materials in the recurrent budget and
increased non-salary expenditure to at least 10% of the recurrent budget. On-the-ground implementation



3
of these reforms will continue during the NWFP-PEP period. They will also be complemented by
additional reforms started under this project and tailored to the needs and problems of NWFP education,
including actions to: (a) professionalize teacher education; (b) institutionalize adequate allocations for
teachers training; (c) rationalize the distribution of local supervisors and improve their mobility; (d)
improve the viability and management of larger schools;  (e) institute a system of district-based
accountability for educational outcomes; and (f) professionalize the cadre of education supervisors and
managers.
10.   Instead of fixing all of its targets rigidly and possibly unrealistically in advance, the program
supports a reform "process" as much as it supports "education inputs". While an indicative five-year
program has been appraised, the size and detailed composition of the Annual Work Plan will be based
on detailed assessments of the progress achieved in the previous year and on the feasibility for expansion.
Special measures are built into the program to remove implementation constraints and expand the
absorptive capacity of Government agencies responsible for program implementation. Assessment will
be made both of physical implementation of inputs as well as outcomes. Unsuccessful components would
be dropped or revised and new components added, if needed, during joint Government and donor Annual
Work Plan Reviews. During Annual Work Plan Reviews, the Government would report on the physical
and financial progress of program components according to the agreed Annual Work Plan. Agreed
monitorable outcome indicators providing an assessment of student outcomes, learning achievement and
system efficiency will also be reviewed. A North-West Educational Assessment Program has been
created to assess pupil performance in the critical subjects of math, science and language in grades 3 and
5. From time to time, evaluation studies will be conducted by the Research, Development and Evaluation
section in the DPE to assess the effectiveness of specific program interventions.
11.   Program Components. The program integrates all donor inputs in primary education in a
coherent manner and synchronizes them to ensure efficient delivery. Access, equity and efficiency would
be increased by: (a) provision of buildings and additional classrooms and facilities, particularly for girls;
and (b) support to the NWFP Frontier Education Foundation (FEF) which would promote increased
private sector participation in the provision of primary education to low-income groups. Quality of the
learning environment for existing and new schools would be improved by: (a) establishing appropriate
systems for pre-service and in-service teacher training; and (b) better instructional materials. The latter
would be achieved through financial support for textbook production, development and purchase of
supplementary readers, teachers' guides to accompany all primary textbooks, and an annual non-salary
budget provision of Rs. 500 per classroom to replenish used instructional materials. Organizational
framework, planning and management would be improved by: (a) strengthening the Directorate of
Primary Education at provincial and district levels; (b) strengthening the Research, Development and
Evaluation section of the DPE and continuing the development of the Education Management Information
System to facilitate planning and management; (c) introducing institutional-improvement incentives,
including driving allowances for female Learning Coordinators and allowances for female teachers serving
in isolated rural areas. To achieve the above objectives, beneficiary participation would be instituted by
establishing parents' committees in all government and community operated primary schools, and
involving these committees in school opening and supervision. IDA would finance construction of
schools, furniture, equipment and educational materials, specialist and NGO services, fellowships,
training, recurrent costs for incremental staff, and operation and maintenance.
12.     The NWFP-PEP is currently estimated to cost about US$813 million -- US$274 million for
development and US$539 million for recurrent expenditures. GONWFP will contribute US$596, and
US$217 will come from donors through ongoing and planned commitments. The proposed IDA Credit



4
of US$150 million would finance items not already committed by other donors or the Government in a
time-slice of five years. IDA would also finance a declining percentage of incremental recurrent costs.
The financial contribution from GONWFP would increase by at least 5 % in real terms annually. Based
on preliminary base case estimates of such items, the proposed IDA Credit would finance items having
a total cost of US$150 million with a foreign exchange component of US$15 million. The financing plan
for the five-year program, and the indicative breakdown of foreign and local costs for the base case IDA-
financed items, are shown in Schedule A.  The amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule for the IDA-financed items are shown in Schedule B. A
time-table of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given
in Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing the geographical coverage of the program is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13432-PAK, is being distributed separately.
13.   Program Management, Implementation and Monitoring. The program would be implemented
by the line units of the Directorate of Primary Education and by existing line agencies of the NWFP
Education Department. The DPE would be responsible for overall program implementation, coordination
and daily program operations. It would serve as the clearinghouse for issues requiring decisions of top
management of the Education Department and external agencies, including IDA. A Steering Committee,
under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary for Planning and Development, would ensure
coordination among other Government departments and agencies that have an impact on primary
education. A Primary Education Program Coordination Office (PEP-CO), headed by an expatriate
advisor, will ensure that donor inputs are fully integrated to meet the specific needs of the NWFP primary
education sector. Supervision will be done in partnership with all donors, with PEP-CO providing
independent verification of the Government's progress reports. Supervision costs are expected to be low
as a result of improved Government monitoring and evaluation procedures, including the Education
Management Information System (EMIS) and the North-West Education Assessment Program.
14.   Prouram Sustainability. The NWFP-PEP is a time-slice of the Government's long term program
in primary education. Its sustainability is strengthened through a focus on improving the capacity of the
regular NWFP line departments and agencies so that they can more efficiently transform increased levels
of funding into effective service delivery. Improved, more effective sector management practices and
better targeting of expenditures on high-yield inputs will also help ensure long-term financial
sustainability. The estimated increase in annual development and recurrent expenditures is well within
the Government's Eighth Five-Year Plan and projected long-term economic growth.
15.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The program draws heavily on lessons learned
from previous donor-supported basic education projects: (a) emphasize operations limited to one province
at a time, tailor them to the specific needs of the province and avoid implementation delays at the federal
level; (b) ensure that all donor inputs in the sector are fully integrated; (c) strengthen the regular line
departments/agencies instead of creating parallel temporary structures to implement donor-financed
operations; (d) institutionalize Annual Reviews as both a planning tool and a monitoring and evaluation
mechanism; (e) provide institution-building through resident technical assistance; (f) advance program
start-up activities during the preparation period, including selection of school sites nine months in advance
of actual construction; and, (g) institutionalize an outcome-based evaluation system to enhance self-
monitoring by the Government and hence reduce donor supervision costs.
16.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA has a policy of promoting universal primary education
and has substantial accumulated experience in this sector. IDA is already supporting the Government's
Social Action Program, which emphasizes basic education, inter alia. The proposed project would further



5
the goals of the SAP in education by expanding the absorptive capacity of the province in primary
education. The proposed project is fully consistent with IDA country assistance strategy discussed by
the Board in March, 1994.  This strategy focuses on poverty alleviation, and on human resource
development, which are the main objectives of the NWFP-PEP.
17.    Actions Agreed. Agreements were reached during negotiations with the GONWFP that it will:
(a) submit an Annual Work Plan for the following fiscal year by March 30 of each year; (b) hold an
Annual Review not later than May 1 of each year to formulate: (i) the scope and financing of the
following year's Annual Work Plan; and (ii) policy actions to be carried out during the Work Plan period;
(c) allocate the total financing required, from domestic and external sources, to carry out the Annual
Work Plan as agreed during the Annual Review. Furthermore, at least one-fourth of the Government's
allocation to the program in a given fiscal year would be deposited into the accounts of implementing
agencies prior to the start of the first quarter of each Fiscal Year. Expenditures incurred out of the
proceeds of such amount deposited would be fully replenished prior to the start of each subsequent
quarter; (d) ensure that Government's budgetary allocation to primary education will increase by at least
5% in real terms annually for both development and recurrent expenditures, using the actual level of
expenditures for fiscal year 1993-94 as the base year; (e) prepare a Mid-Year Status Report by January
15, including financial and physical progress; (t) in consultation with IDA, and in accordance with terms
of reference and methodology satisfactory to IDA, undertake and complete by October 31, 1998, a Mid-
term review of the Program and carry out the recommendations of such a review; (g) ensure that the FEF
carries out schemes for provision of financial assistance in accordance with the Frontier Education
Foundation Act, 1992, with particular emphasis on the beneficiary targeting provisions set forth therein;
and, (h) establish community schools and implement schemes for provision of scholarships in accordance
with arrangements to be established by December 31, 1996, acceptable to IDA; and, (i) provide to the
Association not later than February 15 of each Fiscal Year a list of school and classroom construction
and rehabilitation sites for the following Fiscal Year selected according to agreed site selection
procedures. GONWFP also submitted a letter of development policy which incorporates agreed policy
reforms.
18.    Environmental Aspects. No detailed environmental analysis was carried out, since by its nature
the program does not include items likely to have a significant environmental impact. The criteria for
school construction would include standards designed to minimize any harmful environmental impact.
19.    Program Objective Categories. The program focusses on poverty alleviation through provision
of basic education services to unserved and underserved segments of the population in a relatively poor
area of Pakistan. The program has specific mechanisms for targeting the poor in urban slums and rural
areas, and the proportion of the poor among project beneficiaries is significantly larger than their
proportion in the overall population. Particular emphasis is placed on expanding access for the 80% of
the population that live in rural areas, and on girls' education by earmarking 60% of all new schools for
girls. The NWFP-PEP supports private sector development by contracting out the bulk of implementation
activities to the private sector where it has comparative advantage, including construction of all schools,
construction management, textbook and materials development and publishing, as well as a pilot
experiment in provision of school places through private schools.
20.    Benefits. The five-year program is expected to increase primary enrollment by about 886,000,
of which 42% will be girls. This will increase the gross enrollment rate (GER) for girls substantially,
from 36% now to 60% at the end of the program period. The GER for boys would increase from 71 %
to 94%. Worldwide research has shown that primary education has the highest social returns and that



6
education of girls, in particular, will also promote children's health and reduce fertility -- which is
particularly important in light of Pakistan's high population growth rate of about 3%. The use of local
women as teachers and involvement of parents in school affairs will lead to increased participation rates
and enhanced resource mobilization through parents' donation of labor or services. Information-based
decision-making and the Education Assessment Programs will introduce accountability of district-level
officials and teachers for student outcomes. Increasing the number of hours of active learning by pupils
in class as a result of a more pupil-centered approach will improve performance, and thus students' and
teachers' levels of satisfaction with schooling. This in turn should reduce drop-out and repetition rates
and increase the efficiency and decrease per-student costs of primary education.
21.    Risks. The major risk is that the Government implementation agencies will lack capacity to
implement the program. This risk is alleviated by using the SAP Project as a macro-level instrument to
remove key bottlenecks to implementation, through preparation of a five-year implementation plan, and
through detailed Annual Work Plans.  In addition, provision of donor-supported resident technical
assistance and integration of donor inputs will also facilitate implementation. Another risk is the potential
lack of female teachers to staff girls' schools in rural areas. This risk is alleviated by a survey identifying
educated girls willing to be teachers, who will then be recruited and trained through a Mobile Teacher
Training Program and local Teacher Resource Centers. Continued professional and materials support are
provided to these teachers through the Learning Coordinators System.  Risks also attach to the
development of commnunity involvement. In the past, beneficiaries have not been involved in community
decisions about schooling, which were taken by a few traditional community leaders who tended to
oppose girls' education. The program would be hindered if they do not relinquish control. This risk
would be addressed by establishing village education committees (VECs), which would consist mainly
of parents of children in the school catchment areas, regardless of their status in the community. The
VECs would be involved in determining school sites, operation and maintenance, and monitoring quality.
Another risk is the involvement of politicians in site selection at the district level, which may result in
school locations not suitable for schooling. This risk will be alleviated through a program to prepare
politicians for the use of EMIS for rational selection and monitoring of school sites.
22.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
