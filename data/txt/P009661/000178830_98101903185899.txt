REPORT AND RECO1MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIE EXECIJTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO fIDIA
FOR TIE GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
IDA credit to India for the equivalent of U.S.$ 5 million.   Concurrently,
the Government of Sweden proposes to make a credit of approximately u.S.$
5.0 million on similar terms. to India to finance lonponents of this project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has made 39 loans amounting to U.S.$ 1,051.2 million to
India (including those guaranteed by India), and the Association has ad-
vanced 3h credits totalling US$ 1,507.0 million (both loans and credits
net of cancellations). A major thrust of recent Bank group activity in
India has been in agriculture; the proposed credit would be the first
for a grain storage project. Currently the Association is also consider-
ing projects in various fields, including irrigation, agricultural credit,
water supply, transportation, population, education and power.
3.        Of the 39 loans and 30 credits already declared effective, 6
loans and 7 credits have not yet been fully disbursed. A summary state-
ment of these loans and credits as of May 31, 1971, is attached in Annex
I. The reasons for the delays in disbursements were outlined in the re-
port to the Executive Directors of May 17, 1971 on the Tamil Nadu and
Haryana Agricultural Credit projects.   There have been no significant
changes since that report.
4.        Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$
42.3 million, of which US$ 2.8 million has been repaid, US$ 5.8 million
sold and US$ 6.3 cancelled. Of the balance of US$ 27.h million,US$ 19.1
million represents loans, and US$ 8.3 million equity. As of May 31, 1971,
US$ 10.4 million is undisbursed. The largest commitment to date has been
a total of US$ 18.9 million to Zuari Agro-chemicals for a fertilizer plant
in Goa.
5.        The .3heat Storage project was appraised in March and April 1970.
Negotiations took place in November 1970. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. C. S. Swaminathan, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs,
Ministry of Finance, Mr. P. K. Dave, Managing Director, Food Corporation
of India, (FCI) and Mr. R. Balasubramian, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Food.
The Government of Sweden was represented by Messrs. G6sta Westring and
Klas Markensten of Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA).
During negotiations all major issues were resolved except the bidding pro-
cedure for civil works for the construction of silos, which the Association
was unwilling to finance unless they were put up for international compe-
titive bidding. Following discussions this Spring between SIDA, the Associ-
ation and the Government of India agreement was reached on the procedure
outlined in paragraph 12.

PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        An economic report entitled riEconomic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA 25a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 24,
1971. This report emphasized India's continuing progress, particularly
in the growth of exports and in agriculture. It notes, however, that
net aid receipts have fallen to the lowest level in the past decade. As
a result of a shortage of resources investmnent has fallen short of the
planned level, which already represented the miin-:n.um r34uired, if India
is to achieve a tolerable rate of growth. Consequently, India continues
to need substantial net aid on concessionary termis.
7.        The Report points out that agricultural production has continued
to grow, spurred on by the technology of the green revolution.   Foodgrain
production reached a new- record of 105 million tons in 1969/70 and appears
to be increasing at an annual rate of 5 percent. This increase has occurred
primarily in wheat, but progress in the production of rice has occurred and
is expected to accelerate. The Fourth Plan target is a 5-6 percent rate of
growth in foodgrain production per year, aiming at a total crop of 129
million tons in 1973/74; actual performance may fall somewhat short of these
goals. The delay in increasing assured irrigation supplies and the closely
related slowdown in the growth of fertilizer consumption have contributed to
the slower-than-expected expansion of foodgrain production, but the further-
development of irrigation projects with effective agricultural support pro-
grams should ensure continued growth in the use of new inputs, including
fertilizer.
8.        A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex II.
PART III - TEE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "IWheat Storage Project - India"
(PA - 6ha, June 15, 1971) is attached. A Credit and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III.
10.       Progress in foodgrain production has been most dramatic in the
wheat belt comprising the states of Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Rajasthan
and Uttar Pradesh. Bumper crops have strained both storage- and transporta-
tion facilities. The Government is also involved in large-scale storage
through its price support program and4arrangements for the public distribu-
tion of foodgrain administered by State governments and FCI. For these
reasons India requires about 5.9 million tons capacity of publicly owned
storage facilities. The balance of its requirements is met by hiring priv-
ately owned stores which are in short supply and some of which are unsatis-
factory. India is aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains.
Storage requirements particularly in the producing and consuming areas will
increase as domestic supplies procured during peak harvest periods continue
to replace imports distributed more evenly over the year. To meet the
increasing deficit in storage capacity, the GOI has embarked on a program
of construction.
11.        The proposed project (see Annex III) is designed to support this
program. It will consist of (a) the planning, design, construction and



equipping of 10 silos of 20,000 tons capacity each, and of 10 godowns of
10,000 tons capacity each located in northwest India, (b) the training
of silo personnel and, (c) an all-India study of foodgrain storage and
distribution. The project will provide 300,000 tons of additional storage
capacity to help reduce the current public storage deficit of 900,000
tons and will also add about 6 percent to gross public storage facilities.
12.       Total project cost is estimated at U.S.$ 15.9 million, to which
the Government of India will contribute Rs. 11.3 million, (about U.S.$. 5.9
million) or 37.2 percent. The Government of Sweden and the Association
would each provide credits of U.S.t 5.0 million equivalent, or 31.h percent.
The GOI will relend the proceeds of the SIDA and IDA credits to FCI, for
a term of 19 years, including four years of grace, with interest of 7 percent
per annum. The Swedish credit will be applied to the cost of civil works
for the construction of the silos; Sweden has agreed to accept resort to
local rather than international competitive bidding for this work. Of the
items to be financed by the Association the largest is electrical and
mechanical equipment (about U.S.-t 3 million including contingencies, or
60 percent of the proposed credit), which will be procured under interna-
tional competitive bidding.  Civil works for the construction of godowns,
of which , 1.5 million to be financed by IDA, do not lend themselves to
international competitive bidding since individual contracts will be too
small, and the sites are scattered over several states. These contracts
will accordingly be let on the basis of local competitive bidding. The
balance of the proposed credit (1 0.5 million) will finance 100 percent
of expenditures for engineering and other consulting services and training
provided outside India, and 50 percent of local expenditures for consulting
services and training in India. Given the justification for local financing
in India the Association credit will finance 100 percent of the cost of
contracts won by Indian bidders. Local costs to be financed from the IDA
credit are expected to total about 6, 2.7 m-illion or 54 percent of the Credit.
The Association will supervise the execution of all aspects of the project,
including those financed by the Swedish Government credit.
13.       The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will carry out the bulk of
the project, in particular the construction and operation of storage facili-
ties, and will be responsible for training silo personnel. The management
of FCI is good. It has an engineering department which will be responsible
for the construction phase of the project. An interesting technical feature
of the project is the use of the slip-form method for the construction of
grain storage silos. This technique is the most modern and least expensive
method of construction for silos and has not yet been widely used in India.
For this reason fully qualified and experienced consultants will assist FCI
in the design and supervision of construction of the silos included in the
project.
lh.      The FCI operates storage facilities in connection with the Governs-
ment's price-support program, and in the event of serious shortfalls in
food production it is responsible, with State Governments, for distribution
of relief supplies. In normal years it provides food grains to the poor
at concessionary prices through "fair price" shops. In 1969, the last year
for which statistics were available, FCI distributed about 6.6 million tons
of foodgrains (L.o million tons procured locally and 2.6 million tons imported);
this represented about 70 percent of all public distribution, the remairinler
having been made up by distribution carried nut by the States. The
program, which is subsidized by the Govern7rent, as it now operates thrcA2gh



-4.
FCI and the "fair priceT' shops is relatively efficient and entails less admin-
istrative *ork than a system of direct rationing or money grants. Of the pub-
licly owned storage facilities which have a capacity of about 5 million tcns,
at the present time FCI owns about 2.8 million tons of storage capacity and man-
ages substantial additional facilities with an estirmated capacity 2.7
million tons, much of which is rented from the private sector. Some
hired storage facilities are inadequate.
15.        Assura.ices were obtained during negotiations that within six
months of the date of the proposed credit agreements India, Sweden and
the Association iwould enter into discussions on an all India grain storage
study. This study, which would complement other investigations which the
GOI has already undertaken, would be carried out by a body to be agreed
upon by GOI, FCI, SIDA and the Association with the assistance of consul-
tants as necessary.  Its purpose will be to examine the costs and benefits
of the public distribution system, to survey existing public and private
storage facilities and to determine grain losses during storage and
handling. The object of the study is to make recommendations for the
improvement of existing storage and handling facilities and methods and
to devise an investment program for new facilities, including provision
for rice milling.
16.        The economic rate of return is estimated at about 25 percent
(20 percent for godoTrns, 28 percent for silos). This return will be
achieved largely through reduction of losses of grain which would other-
wise be stored in inadequat-e facilities. A sensitivity analysis has also
been made. If without-the-project storage losses were 15 percent per
annum instead of 25 percent per annum (which is unrealistically low under
the present circumstances), the rate of return on the project facilities
would be 15 percent. At a loss rate of 35 percent per annum, the rate of
return on the facilities would be about 40 percent. The provision of
these facilities primarily in wheat producing areas will have the addi-
tional benefit of reducing pressure on the transportation system following
the harvest, at a time when large quantities of grain must be moved and
stored before the monsoon begins.
PART IV - LEGAL IN2STRUENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.        The Draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
International Development Association, the Draft Joint Financing Agreement
between India, the Kingdom of Sweden, the International Development Associa-
tion and the Food Corporation of India, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Draft Resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.        The Draft Development Credit Agreement, Sections 7.01 (d) i and
ii, in addition to the customary provisions, set down as conditions of
effectiveness the appointment of engineering consultants (para. 15 above)
and the acquisition of sites for the proposed storage facilities.



19.        I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMDENDATION
20.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
