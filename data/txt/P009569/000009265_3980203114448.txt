FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      To support an increased development effort and to expand its
sources of economic asaistance, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) in
1981 joined the Int:er:national Monetary Fund arLd the World Bank, and in
1982, the Asian Development Bank. With forests being the country's
largest renewable natural resource, R.OB has placed high priority on this
sector for development. First attention is to be paid to developing wood
related industries and to initiating a systematic program of plantation
establishment. In May 1983 RGOB prepared, with assistance from FAO, a
report on reforestation near two of the high population areas in the
foothill region. That report formed the basis for a request to IDA for
assistance in financiug a forestry plantation project. This report is
based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. W.B. Johnson (IDA), M.I. Aitken and D.W. Wright (Consultants),
which visited Bhutan in October 1983.
II, BACKGROUND
2.01      The Kingdom of Bhutan comprises an area of approximately 47,000
sq km situated in the Himalayan region, and lying between 26.5 and 29
degrees north latitude and 88.5 and 92 degrees east longitude. The
country is land locked, bordered in the North and Northwest by China
(Tibet), and by India to the South, West and East. The country can be
divided into three distinct zones. The Southern zone adjoining India
consists of foothills rising to an altitude of about 1,000 meters a.s.l.
This area has a hot, humid, tropical climate and the natural vegetation
and forests are dense. The central zone consists mainly of steep hills
and narrow valleys at elevations from 1,000-3,000 meters a.s.l., and has a
temperate climate and vegetation. The nation's capital, Thimphu, is
located in this zone. The Northern zone comprising snowy ranges above
3,000 meters is the region bordering China, and is of an alpine character.
2.02      Except for a narrow strip of lowlands along the southern border,
the country is entirely mountainous. High ridges divide the region, and
the country is traversed by numerous streams and rivers which flow in a
generally north-south direction. Of the total land area, it has been
estimated that about 60-70 percent is covered by forest (no accurate
records are available), 9 percent is under cultivation, and the rest is
classified as alpine pasture or mountain wilderness and is mainly above
the tree line.



-2-
2.03      The mountainous terrain makes 3hutan accessible only with great
difficulty. Transportation therefore presents considerable problems.
Although roads now link Bhutan with the Indian plains to the south,
geographical factors limit this access. The first paved road of 175 km
from the border town of Phuntsholing to Paro and Thimphu, the capi-al, was
constructed in 1962. The main road network now totals about 2,000 km and
generally follows the main river systems. One east-west main road has
been completed linking Thimphu with Tongsa, near thie geographic center of
the country and Tashigang in the east. There are no railways; the nearest
railhead is about 40 km south of the southern '.vrder entry town of
Phuntsholing. The nearest seaport is Calcutta about 750 km by road to the
south. RGOB recently initiated commercial flights between Paro (about 40
kl from Thiuphu) and Calcutta.
2.04      Although no accurate statistics are available the total popula-
tion, 95 percent of which is rural, is currently officially estimated at
1.2 M and believed to be growing at around 2 percent per annum. With the
low population, pressures on land, food and housing appear to be much less
than elsewhere in South Asia and the standard of living appears to be
better than the calculated per capita income of about US$120, one of the
lowest in the world. Literacy and life expectancy, however, remain low.
2.05      Agriculture and animal husbandry account for about half of GDF,
and provide the main livelihood for about 95 percent of the population.
The forestry sector accounts for some 16 percent of GDP, industxy for only
6 percent due to the small domestic market, services account for some 30
percent and tourism, 1 percent.
2.06      The official currency is the ngultrum (Nu) which the Governmemt
began issuing in 1974. As there are no controls on trade and payments
with India, the Indian rupee circulates freely and is interchangeable with
the ngultrum on a one-to-one basis within Bhutan.
2.07      His Majesty, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the present king and fourth
of the line, is the head of state and head of the Royal Government. The
National Assembly, which comprises about 150 members (of which about 100
are elected on a one-household/one vote basis), is the main legislative
and policy making body.  The Cabinet is the main executive body and is
composed of members of the Royal Advisory Council; heads of the Ministries
of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs, Communications, Development, Finance,
Industry, Trade and Forests, and heads of important departments and the
district administrations.
2.08      Administratively, the country is divided into 18 dzotgkhags
(districts); three in Eastern Bhutan, five in Central Bhutan, seven in
Western Bhutan, and three in Southern Bhutan. The district administration
report directly to the Ministry of Home Affairs through appointed district
administrators (Dzongdag). The Dzongdag is primarily responsible for



-3-
revenue collection and more recently, following decentralization, for
implementation of much of the development effort at the district level.
Law and order are the responsibility of the Thrimpon (magistrate).
2.09      Only limited information is available on land ownership pat-
terns. Most cultivated land is owner-operated, although monasteries
traditionally have supported themselves through land farmed by sharecrop-
pers, and there is some absentee ownership, especially in the west.
Landholdings are fairly equitabLy distributed, being legally litited to 25
acres (10.1 hectares) but seldom exceeding 4 ha. Farm sizes are believed
to be somewhat larger than average in the south and somewhat smaller in
the east. Most grazing land is commuaally owned with access governed by
traditional rights. Some grazing areas are within classified Reserve
Forests and grazing rights have been acquired from Government. Legisla-
tion is, however, under consideration to encourage private enclosure to
establish a system of independent smallholders with an incentive to invest
in land improvement.
III. THE FORESTRY SECTOR
A. The Forest Resource
3.01      The size of the forest resource is impressive and represents the
largest renewable resource in the country. Efforts to regulate the
exploitation of forest begatn in the early 1960s with a number of surveys.
None of the early efforts, however, supplied aata about land use patterns,
forest types and their extent, growing stock, increments of growth, yield,
etc. The first comprehensive survey of Bhutan's forest resources was
undertaken witb the assistance of the Indian Government between 1974 and
1979. This reconnaissance inventory, known as the Pre-Investie-nt Survey
of Bhutan Forest Resources, was conducted in four phases over about 3
million ha. Forests covered 74 percent of the area surveyed. The area
outside the survey is mainly the northern high Himalayan region. The
demarcation of forests began in 1974 and, by 1981, about 11,000 sq km had
been surveyed and boundaries demarcated.
3.02      Up to about 1,000 m elevation, broadleafed tropical forests are
dominant and in unexploited stands, very dense. Between 1,500 and 3,000 m
temperate forests of pine and oak dominate along with indigenous species
of rhododendrons. Oak tends to grow on southern slopes, which receive
most of the monsoon rains, while on the drier northern slopes, coniferous
forests predominate. Above 3,000 m and to the treeline at about 4,000 m,
the forests tend to be entirely coniferous and include valuable quantities
of pine, spruce, and fir. Forests are generally restricted to the slopes
as the valley bottoms are mostly cultivated.



-4-
3.03      According to the above survey the following table summarizes the
growing stock and the estimated theoretical annual allowable cut (AAC) for
the country. Most of this resource is currently inaccessible due to
physical constraints such as a lack of roads.

B. ForestrL in the EconoEY
3.04      Bhutan is abundantly endowed with high grade forest resources
and, despite the low rate of utilization relative to the annual increment,
forestry plays an important role in the economy. Forestry directly con-
tributed about 16 percent of GDP in 1980/81; in addition, about half of
the country's industrial units are based on wood resources. Forest royal-
ties and taxes also accounted for about 9 percent of government receipts,
but these have fallen since 1979 when restrictions on commercial logging
were introduced and totalled 3 percent in 1981/82 (para 3.11). Restric-
tions were imposed by government to control exploitation, ensure good
forestry management practices and to encourage greater value added to
exports of forest produce.

3.05      Exports of forest products amounted to 26 M Nu in 1981/82, about
15 percent of total national exports and of which sawn timber (Nu 16 M)
represented the bulk. Sales of rosin (Nu 7 M), tea chest components and
core veneer represented the balance. Due to the presence of reasonable
road communications, most of the commercial operations of timber extrac-
tion take place in the Thimpbu forest division.  Conifers are the main
species exploited, mainly for purposes of meeting the domestic demaad for
sawn timber. However, when the Gedu mill (para 3.08) reaches full produc-
tion the proportion of hardwood logs utilized would be about equal that of
conifers.
3.06      Forest based industries presently comprise some 26 small saw-
mills, 3 veneer plants, a peeling unit, a factory producing battons for
tea chests, a pencil slat factory, and various small plants producing such
items as cable drums, bobbins, furniture, and matches. With the recent
decline in log extraction, production of sawn hardwood and veneer has
dropped. The Forest Department (FD) has established a new sawmill at the
Gedu colplex (para 3.08) which will be shortly expanded to a capacity of
5,400 m  of sawnwood.  In addition to the output frog existing commercial
mills, it has been estimated 1/ that up to 120,000 m are converted
annually to sawnwood by village based pit-sawers.
3.07      Fuelwood is the main energy source for both heating and cooking.
No records are available on ictual usage and estimates for similar areas
in the region range from 1 m to 3 m per person per year depending on the
elevation. Applying even the lower rate indicates that fuelwood is
presently the largest use of the forest resource. Fuelwood in the larger
towns is shipped in on a commercial basis. Wood residue from the sawmills
is also sold to the public.
3.08      In the Fifth Five Year Developme!nt Plan (1981/82 to 1986/87)
RGOB has, in addition to programs for systematic forest renewal, planned
for a significant increase in the commercial h^rvesting and utilization of
wood resources. Three new wood processing plants, as shown in Table 3.3
are planned. The first phase of the integrated plywood/sawnwood mill
located at Gedu is now operational and construction of buildings needed
for the second phase is well underway. Government is proceeding with the
development of a particleboard plant near Phuntsholing. In addition,
Government has planned the development of a calcium carbid   plant for the
area. This plant would require the equivalent of 50,000 m of wood per
annum as charcoal. IDA has been requested to assist in the development
of the calcium carbide plant.

3.09      With the imposition of controls on forest exploitation in 1979
(pars 3.11), RGOB is gradually increa3ing its capability (T0.1e 3.2) to
extract sufficient forest products to meet the present and future needs of
the country's wood based industries. To achieve this end UND? is providing
assistance which covers a comprehensive program of staff training in FD
and the Asian Development Bank has recently agreed to finance about US$1 M of
logging and road construction equipment.
C. Forest Policy
3.10      The utilization of forest resources is controlled by several
major pieces of legislation. In 1969, the Bbutan Forest Act was passed
which consolidated numerous previous laws relating to forest rights,
forest products, and royalties. It declared that forest lands on which no
person had a permanent, heritable, and transferable right to be Government
Forest. While this covered almost all the land under forest, the Govern-
ment also retained the right to absolute ownership of the forest resources
on private land. Forest clearance for tsheri (shifting) cultivation was
banned (although encroachment continues to occur', and the felling of
trees and grazing rights on forest land were brought under the control of
the Forest Department. In 1974, the National Forest Policy Act was passed
which further spelled out various aspects of forest utilization$ develop-
ment, and conservation. That Act stated that 60 percent of the land area
should remain under forest cover. It also permitted private individuals
to take dry firewood, including dead trees, from forest land against
presentation of a permit. The permits are free and are required mainly to
control entry to the forests. Commercial felling was permitted in areas
approved by the Department of Forests against the payment of royalties and
contractor license fees.



-7-
3.11       In 1979, the Government introduced two major changes in forest
policy. First, commercial felling of timber was severely restricted, with
practically all felling being undertaken by the Forest Department, which
would then auction the logs to private sawmills. This was done to control
exploitation and to ensure good forest management practices. Second, the
Government restricted the export of logs and sawn timber in an effort to
encourage greater value added to exports of forest produce and to allow it
to formulate plans for future development of forest industries (para
3.08). These events led to the decline in timber production (Table 3.2)
due to the limited extraction capacity of the Department of Forests and
the present limited scope for processing sawn timber or logs in Bhutan.
Thus RGOB, up to 1979, tended to view the considerable forest resources as
an unending source of timber and revenue and did not fully recognize the
need for the phased re-establishment of exploited forest. In 1980, with
the introduction of the Fifth Five Year Plan, this attitude underwent a
change when the Forest Department began to develop proposals for a sys-
tematic approach to reafforestation. Up to this time only small areas of
tree plantations had been established and these in isolated patches
throughout t-he country (para 3.16).
3.12      Thte National Forest Policy Act also listed a set of objectives
which were recently updated for the Fifth Five Year Development Plan and
which emphasize the need to conserve the forest wealth and protect the
environment, and provide for the rational exploitation and replanting of
live resources.
D. The Forest Department
3.13      The Government recognized at an early stage that Bhutan's
forests represented a valuable resource. To help properly manage them, a
forest directorate was established as early as 1959. The Forest Depart-
ment was established in 1967, making it one of the first government
departments. Reflecting the importance of the forests and the desire to
maintain strong control over their exploitation, all forest activities
other than social forestry and forest fire control are under central
administration. In line with the strategy for decentralization under
which about 25 percent of the financial resources of the Fifth Plan are to
be passed to the districts, social forestry and forest fire control
programs will be administered by the district administration. These
programs rely heavily on voluntary labor with technical and material
inputs provided by the central government.
3.14      The Department is headed by the Director of Forests, Industries
and Mines and is located in the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Forests.
Reporting to the Director are the Deputy Director, 15 Assistant Directors
and 6 District Forest Officers (Annex 2). Total departmental strength is
about 600 with about 25 graduate Forest Officers, 60 Forest Rangers and
122 Foresters.



3.15      Training is an important on-going program in the Department.  Up
to 1982/83, 13 officers had been trained at the Indiaa Forest College at
Dehra Dun and 2 in wildlife management in Canada. Ranger training is
given at the Northern Forest Rangers College and the Eastern Forest
Rangerp'College, both in India, whilst Foresters now receive training at
the Bhutan Forest School, which has also trained some 340 Forest Guards.
3.16      Forest plantations were started on a small but widespread scale
soon after the Department was created. The program has increased
gradually over the years and by 1982/83 the Department had planted a total
of about 8,500 ha located throughout the Kingdom. In addition, a Social
Forestry Program was initiated in 1979 with the aim of encouraging every
household to plant trees on private land.  Under this program seedlings
are provided free to growers.
E. Project Rationale
3.17      The proposed project would be the first attempt at an integrated
land clearance and reforestation operation in Bhutan; its major objectives
being to develop programs of forest renewal in support of the development
of locally-based wood industries. In the course of project implementa-
tion, training and technical assistance would be provided to FD staff in
species selection, nursery operations, road construction, logging and
plantation establishment. In addition, departmental personnel would
receive training and experience in project management. Further, t:he
project aims to address some of the environmental problems now emerging as
a result of uncontrolled exploitation of natural forests (for fuelwood,
timber, and grazing) close to roads and settled areas in southern Bhutan.
Simultaneously, RGOB wishes to reinforce the authority of the Forest
Department over preservation and exploitation of natural forests.
3.18      The constraints to development of the forestry sector are both
human and physical in nature and result from rugged topography, low
population, shortage of skilled and unskilled labor for development
projects, and the long distances to seaports and hard currency markets.
3.19      Nevertheless Govetnment gives high priority to this project
(ahead of wood industries development) because of its concern over the
increasing degradation of forest areas in the southern foothills and the
associated risks of ecological damage to the relatively fragile Himalayan
environment. In addition Government wishes to ensure the long term supply
of raw materials to existing and planned users in the area. Consequently,
developing the institutional capacity within ED to undertake meaningful
reforestation programs becomes a priority. Such development would orovide
capacity within FD to establish and manage forests on a sound ecological
basis. As a first project, a small scale pilot operation has been
selected in order to develop suitable systems and procedures for road



-9-
construction, land clearing, and nursery operations and to establish
species for plantations required to meet the needs for firewood, timber,
etc. Training in preparation of forest management and operating plans for
future projects would be included. To assist in achieving the above, UNDP
is providing assistance by way of a comprehensive program of training and
technical assistance to the forestry sector covering a broad spectrum of
forestry activities but with particular emphasis on forest road construc-
tion and lg extraction.
3.20      Government is presently faced with a shortage of skilled
artisans and unskilled labor and has overcome this by importing labor for
specific tasks on fixed term contracts from neighboring countries. Such
arrangements would provide for adequate manpower, at least in the initial
years until the strategy of training Bhutanese to take over skilled posi-
tions is fully operative. Current training plans envisage that this would
take 5-IU years. The proposed project would thus support the government's
plans to upgrade local skills.
3.21      The project would, in the longer term, lead to an expanded
reforestation program and once the capacity for land clearing and replant-
ing has been established, additional wood industries development could be
considered. The Bank would play an important role in assisting Bhutan
with this development.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Area
4.01      The 1974-79 Pre-Investment Survey of Bhutan Forest Resources
included the lower (southern) foothills of Bhutan bordering on India, and
recognized the need for reforestation in that area. Of the forest area of
8,800 sq km in the border region it was estimated that over 500 sq km were
classified as degraded forests (this estimate is now considered low). As
a result of government investigations, two areas, both adjacent to main
urban centers, have been selected for development under the project and
are located in the foothills bordering on India. The western location is
situated within 30 km of Phuntsholing (population 10,000) and near to the
existing plywood factory at Gedu, the proposed particleboard and calcium
carbide factories and existing private sawmills. The eastern location is
situated within 35 km of Gaylegphug (population 4,000) where two existing
sawmills, a veneer factory, furniture factory, and a distilling plant
(requires wood fuel for the boilers as well as sawnwood for packing cases)
are located (Maps 17664-17666).
4.02      Both areas are with.in 30 km of the Indian border and show
similar topographic and climatic features. The areas comprise foothillq



-10-
rising steeply from an altitude of 200 m a.s.l. on the Duars plains (an
extension of the Gangetic Plain) to over 1,700 m a.s.l. within a horizon-
tal distance of 7 km in the Phuntsiholing area and to 900 m a.s.l. in the
Gaylegphug area. The foothills are generally steeply dissected by streams
flowing in a north-easterly/south-westerly direction.
4.03      The vegetation on the lowest slopes is moderately dense to open
degraded forest with heavy undergrowth and comprises a vegetative associa-
tion of Terminalia myriocarpa, Duabanga sPs Pterospermum acerifoluim,
Acrocarpus faxinifolius, Bombax ceiba and Ailanthus grandis gradually
giving way to Schima walichii, Careva arborea, Amoora sps and occasional
Alnus spa at higher elevations. At altitudes of over 1,000 m Betual s9s,
Castanopsis sps, Cachela sps, Albizzia Drocera, Schima wallichii and Alnus
nepalensis are found in association with a characteristic shrubby under-
growth. The area is dominated by the gregarious climber Mikania, which
has overrun all exposed sites. There is evidence of old logging and tree
cutting for firewood and other purposes, cattle grazing as well as areas
of shifting cultivation. Hill slopes are generally steep, varying from 20
percent to over 60 percent. Most of the select sawlogs and plylogs have
been extracted. In some areas, however, the remaining forests still
contain trees of commercial value, the amounts of which would justify
their extraction.
4.04      The climate is humid tropical to sub-tropical with hot summers
and generally cool winters. Precipitation is heavy in both areas and the
average annual rainfall in Phuntsholing is 3,950 mm and in Gaylegphug
4,870 mm mostly falling as monsoonal rains from May to September. Tem-
peratures average 10-15° C in winter months and 27-300 C in summer.
4.05      Geologically the area is derived from schists, quartzite and
phyllite parent material over which lie stony but easily erodable light
sandy l^ams. Soils are moderately fertile, well drained and do not
present any barrier to tree rooting, except in isolated rocky areas.
4.06      The selected plantation sites fall on land presently classified
as "Reserve Forest". Humail encroachment over the years, in addition to
degrading the forest to meet the needs of timber and firewood, has allowed
farmers to acquire both grazing permits for their cattle as well as rights
to land for cultivation. Non-agricultural land is abundant and it will be
possible to leave undisturbed most presently cultivated areas. However,
legislation under the National Forest Act allows Government to resume
ownership in Reserve Forest areas. RGOB gave assurances that areas
selected for plantations would allow for the minimum displacement of
farmers. Hence, within the project areas this would amount to only about
68 ha of cultivated land and about 200 ha of grazing land and would
involve not more than twenty families. Government would reacquire these
rights at the established rates of Nu 2,500/ha for cultivated land and Nu
185/ha for grazing land. Any reduction in family incomes would be made up



-11-
by employment opportunities created by the project. RGOB has provided
written confirmation that Government can resume ownership of grazing
rights and cultivated land in project areas. In any event there would be
little impact on the project if these areas were not included.
B. Brief Description
4.07      The proposed project would be implemented over a five year
period 1/ and would:
- Clearfell and extract merchantable trees from 3,800 ha of
degraded forest in preparation for ecttablishing plantations
in the Phuntsholing and Gaylegphug areas;
- establish about 2,800 ha of plantations on clearfelled land;
- develop four tree nurseries to support the plantation pro-
gram;
- construct and maintain the necessary access roads;
- build within the Forest Department a trained cadre of staff
experienced in nurserv operations, plantation establishment
and maintenance, log extraction and road construction; and
- provide foreign training of staff and technical assistance
for project implementation.
4.08      Implementation.  The implementation program over the five year
project period is summarized in Table 4.l.
1] Commencing in Bhutan rY 1984/85 (Fiscal Year April 1 - March 31).

C. Detailed Features
4.09      Prior to commencement of felling operations a detailed opera-
tional plan, to cover the project period would be prepared. Project areas
would be examined in more detail and sub-divided into annual working
compartments. An inventory would be carried out for each compartment to
more accurately assess the volume and species of standing timber. Soils
would be surveyed and details prepared of amounts of seedlings of recom-
mended species (Annex 5) required. A tentative road network would be
mapped. To ensure an early start to this work the project provides for
early financing (US$0.05 M) from UNDP sources to engage an experienced
Forester to assist FD in drawing up the operational plan. Early action is
also required to provide minimal access to project areas and establish
tree nurseries to supply well grown seedlings for planting in Project Year
2 (paras 4.10-4.13).
4.10      Nursery Operations.  Two nurseries would be established in each
of the two project areas, each capable of producing about 500,000 seed-
lings annually. Appropriate nursery sites have been selected (Maps 17665
and 17666) and three of the four sites have basic facilities already in
place. Each nursery would be provided with a small office/store, potting
shed, water pump, storage tank, pipes and hoses, and a cement mixer (for
mixing soils).



-13-
4.11      Seedlings would be raised in perforated polythene pots (8 cm by
20 cm) over a four to twelve month period depending on species. Seedling
production would begin in April 1984 in order that seedliags would be
ready for the first planting season (May-August 1985).
4.12      Road Construction.  Road construction in project areas would
begin post-monsoon in 1984 to provide access to those areas required for
the first logging and land preparation season. Over the project period
about 19 km of road would be constructed in each sector with an additional
2 km in the Phuntsholing area (built in Project Year 1) to connect the
project network with the proposed network to Singi Gaon (site of the
proposed calcium carbide factory). The density of the proposed roads is
light by normal logging standards due to the steep terrain, and the high
costs of road construction. Cable cranes would be used for log extraction
to compensate for the low road density.
4.13      To carry out road construction, cach of the two project areas
would be provided with a bulldozer and loader, 500 CFM air compressor and
drills, two tipper trucks and necessary hand tools. Adequate facilities
and expertise for maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment are
available in the nearby towns of Phuntsholing and Gaylegphug where exist-
ing private and government owned (but privately operated) garages would
provide these services. Technical assistance, under existing UNDP
programs, includes the provision of expertise to strengthen maintenance
and repair capability within FD. Roads would be constructed to
all-weather logging standards with a gravel or crusked stone surface of
about 3.5 m width over a 4.5 m earth base.
4.14      Salvage Logging.  Preliminary surveys of project areas indicate
that on average about 67 mj/ha of merchantable logs presently exist.
Assuming that 75 percent of this yield would be recovered during the
logging operation (the balance being lost to difficult terrain and for
economic reasons), the net average yield would be 50 m3/ha. Logging would
commence post-monsoon in 1984 in order to clear areas for the first plant-
ing season in 1985. FD would start felling operations in the more
degraded zreas where less intensive logging is required. Over the project
period abcat 3,800 ha would be clearfelled (Table 4.1); the 1,000 ba
felled in Project Year 5 would be planted in the year subsequent to
project closing as an ongoing FD opeiation.
4.15      Salvage logging would utilize diesel powered cable cranes with a
carrying capacity of 2.5 tons and an annual working capacity of about
6,000 m .  By Year 5 of the Project 10 cranes would he required.  This
system of log extraction is presently being used by FD and technical
assistance and training have been provided under UNDP and Swiss bilateral
arrangements. Felling and bucking would be carried out using chainsaws
and two-man handsaws. Following current practice, all forest produce



-14-
would be sold at the roadside with the buyers providing loading and tran-
sport.
4.16      Plantation Establishment.  After plantation sites have been
logged they would be cleared of residual debris; unmerchantable trees,
bush and shrubs would be cut and all climbers, particularly Mikaaia,
pulled out by the roots. The material collected would be available to
local resideDts for fuel and anything remaining stacked and burned. Where
necessary, small check dams and conservation works be constructed and
steep gulleys plugged to 1-eak torrential flows. A network of footpaths
would be developed to gain access to plantation sites. To carry out these
operations tools, such as saws, axes, slashing knives, spades, hoes etc.
would be provided.
4.17      A total of 2,800 ha of plantations would be established during
the project period (Table 4.1), with about 25 percent devoted to long
rotation (60 years on average) protection plantations on steep slopes with
gradients in excess of 60 percent. Ealf of the remaining area would be
planted to short rotation species (8 years) and half to medium rotation
plantations (25 years). Details of species, density etc. are given in the
Project File. In the Phuntsholing area, emphasis would be on estab-
lishment of fuelwood plantations where good markets for charcoal and
fuelwood exist and where raw material for manufacturing particleboard will
be required (paras 6.08 - 6.09). In Bhutan, a four month planting season
is possible beginning around the first of May and ending in early Septem-
ber. All other operations of the project would be phased around this
planting season.
4.18      Fencing of plantations would initially be required in order to
protect young trees from grazing animals and to clearly define Forest
Department operational areas. Imported fencing material is expensive and
alternative but less expensive methods, such as catte-proof trenches,
used effectively in India, and "living hedges" would. be constructed/-
planted. Plantations would be subdivided into blocks of about 50 ha and,
in the first project year, about 1.5 kI of fencing would be provided for
each block.
4.19      Rainfall in project areas is heavy and the hazard of fire is
not expected to be serious. Nevertheless, firebreaks would be constructed
to minimize the risk of loss. Firebreaks having a width of 20 m would be
established around plantation blocks and kept free of growing grass and
shrub species. Natural barriers, such as rivers, ravines and roads would
be utilized wherever possible. Cleaning of firebreaks would be carried
out during the dry season between November and January in conjunction with
other weeding operations.
4.20      An unusually intensive weeding program would be required.  Con-
ditions for plant growth are excellent, due largely to the heavy rainfall,



-15-
and substantial competition from weeds is there.fore expected. The climber
MikanLa, which can completely overrun all other vegetation in a few
months, is prevalent in the area. If left unchecked in young plantations
it will climb over planted trees, pulling them to the ground. Plantations
would, therefore be weeded over a three year period. In the first year
(i.e. the year of planting) each site would be weeded five times at
two-month intervals; three weedings would be necessary in the second year
and two in the third. Hand weeding would be carried out and extensive use
of herbicides is not envisaged.
4.21      Established plantations would continue to require small amounts
of protection and maintenance every year until clearfelling takes place.
This would include removal of climbers and treatment of outbreaks of
disease or attack by insects (e.g. white ants). Annual maintenance of
roads, fences and firebreaks would also be essential.
4.22      SPecies.  Species recommended for each type of plantation are
listed in Annex 5. It should be noted that some species are suited to
more than one type of plantation and are therefore listed twice. The
number of recommended species is, however large. Past tree plantations
have been few and there are no species or provenance trials within the
project area to indicate those species best suited to local growing condi-
tions. Furthermore, there is considerable climatic variation within the
project area, caused by differences in elevation and aspect of the slopes.
By using a number of species the chances of large scale failure are
reduced and since the project is essentially of a pilot nature, much
valuable information concerning site/species compatibility in southern
Bhutan would be generated.
4.23      Thinning.  Thinning is recommended for all production planta-
tions to generate income and to improve residual stands. Short Totation
plantations would be thinned at an average age of 5 years al*-hough this
would vary according to species.  About one third of the tre t would be
removed, leaving a residual stand of about 1,000 stems per ha.  Mediu1m
rotation plantations would be thinned three times, at ages of 10, 14 and
18 years after establishment. The intensity of the first thin would be 33
percent leaving 800 stems per ha, the secord thin would leave 600 stems
per ha and the third thin would leave a residual stand of 450 stems per ha
for clearfelling. No systematic thinning regimne is prescribed for long
rotation plantations. Stands that become overcrowded and stagnant would
be thinned as required, provided the operations are not hazardous to the
ecological balance of sensitive slopes.
4.24      Research.  Since this is a pilot project there is opportunity
to experiment, under southern Bhutanese conditions, with various plaata-
tion techniques. Emphasis would be givjen to species and provenance tri-
als, to provide reliable iaformation relating to species/site com-
patability. Various silvicultural techniques would also be examined.



-16-
Spacing and fertilizer trials (particularly in nurseries), experimentation
with chemical weedicides and experiments to test out various cover crops
would be laid out. Improved seed collection and seed storage techniques
would be deveLoped. Plantation tools, such as mechanical hand-planting
devices, would also be tested. All research would be simple and practical
in nature, oriented towards developing more effective plantation methods
in the country. The detailed research program would be drawn up with
technical assistance provided under the project (para 4.25).
4.25      Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance would be provided
under UNDP financing arrangements, to assist FD with project implementa-
tion and provide tr_ .ning to staff assigned to the project. In Bhutan,
UNDP supports an extensive assistance program to the Forestry sector which
inn;:)lves the provision of US$2.3 million over 5 years. The program covers
technical assistance, training and foreign fellowships in all aspects of
forestry and wood industries operations. The program envisaged under the
project would complement the UNDP program and is related to project
specific activities. The initial requirement would be for a forestry
specialist for 3 m/m to assist FD with project planning, including
preparation of management plans for selected areas, required staffing,
initial nursery operations, and equipment specifications. Ideally, this
specialist would return in subsequent years to provide assistance with
road construction and logging (12 m/m) and the general husbandry of plan-
tations (3 m/m).  In addition 3 m/m has been allocated for assistance in
developing the research program and 6 m/m of unspecified specialists.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that technical assistance
specialists would be employed in accordance with the timetable (Annex 2)
and with qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.
4.26      Foreign Training.  UNDP has a substantial and on-going foreign
training project for FD personnel.  In view of this program and the small
size of FD, foreign training under the project would be limited to 6
trainees for a total of 30 m/m equally divided amongst three specific
project related subjects--plantation management, nursery operations and
road construction. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the foreign
training program would be undertaken in accordance with the timetable
(Annex 2)
D. Project Costs
4.27      Total project costs are estimated to be US$6.8 M (Nu 68.4 M) of
which 74% (Nu 50.4 M) would be in foreign exchange (Table 4.2), and
include a negligible amount of duties and taxes as all materials imported
for and used by government departments are free of tax and duty.

Coats were based on prices prevailing at October, 1983 and updated to
January 1, 1984. Physical contingencies amount to 5 percent of base costs
and were estimated at 7.5% for civil works and material and 10% for
vehicles and equipment. Price contingencies represent 18% of base costs
and were estimated based on expected local and Indian inflation rates of
7%, 7%, 6%, 6%, 6% and international price escalation of 7.5%, 7.0%, 6%,
6%, and 6% per annum for 1984/85 through 1988189. Cost estimates are
detailed in Annex 1.
E. Financing
4.28      The proposed IDA credit of US$5.5 M would finance 80% of project
costs including US$4.6 M of foreign exchange. RGOB would finance US$0.9 1M
including staff and other local costs. UNDP would finance the costs of
technical assistance (US$0.3 M) and foreign training (US$0.1 M). The IDA
credit of US$5.5 M would be passed on to FD as annual budgetary subven-
tions. Retroactive financing of US$0.2 M would be required for initial
nursery operations, road construction, and log extraction.

RGOB has provided assurances that the project has been included in the
Fifth Development Plan with sufficient allocation to cover the costs of
the project until the end of the plan period (1986/87) and that the
remaining financial requirement would be provided for in the subsequent
Plan. In addition, the amount required for the current year has been
included in the 1984/85 budget.
F. Procurement

-19-
4.30      Direct clearing and plantation works (US$3.2 M) including tree
felling, 'sr,d clearing, nursery expenditures, planting, thinning and
protectioa works, would be done manually and carried out over different
Deriods of time and ir a number of locations. The number of private
contractors in Bhutan engaged in construction is very small and in
reforestation activities almost non-existent. Therefore, contracts fol-
lowing competitive bidding would not be generally practical. However FD
may use sub-contracts for various aspects of these operations (i.e. land
clearing, clearing firebreaks etc.). All the above works would be other-
wise carried out by force account by FD. However, required materials such
as barbed wire, tools etc. would be procured through normal RG.OB p^-ocure-
ment procedures and which are satisfactory to IDA. Direct expenses for
road construction (US$0.5 M) totalling 40 km over the five year project
period, would be carried out by force account by FD as part of normal
operations. Construction standards are simple and the annual amounts would
be insufficient to attract suitable contractors. Civil works (US$0.3 M)
would involve the construction of about 61 small buildings for offices and
housing and would be scattered geographically and constructed throughout
the project period. Construction would be to simple design standards
using wood framing and other local materials and with an average cost of
under US$5,000 each, would be carried out by force account by FD. Conse-
quently, construction would not be suitable for ICB or local competitive
bidding, however some construction activities may be sub-contracted.
Procurement of vehicles and equipment (US$1.3 M) would follow ICB proce-
dures in accordance with Bank/IDA procurement guidelines. Vehicles and
equipment costing less than US$50,000 per contract, and totalling no more
than US$500,000, would be procured following LCB procedures which are
satisfactory to IDA. The balance of project cost (US$1.0 M) would be
mostly staff salaries and related expenditures (US$0.6 M) as well as
technical assistance and foreign training (US$0.4 M) which would be
provided under UNDP financing arrangements.
G. Disbursements
4.31      Disbursements under the Credit would cover:
(i)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported vehicles
and equipment (US$1.60 M);
(ii)  US$340 equivalent for each ha of satisfactorily established
plantations, representing about 85% of direct expenditures
(US$0.95 M);
(iii)  US$10,000 equivalent for each completed kilometer of road
constructed, representing about 85% of direct expenditures
(US$0.40);



-20-
(iv) US$460 equivalent for each ha of land cleared, representing
about 85% of direct expenditures (US$1.75 M); and
(v)  Unallocated (US$0.8 M).
4.32      Disbursements against direct nursery and plantation expenditures
would total a fixed equivalent rate of US$340 per ha or part thereof, up
to a maximum of 2,800 ha. This rate represenLs 85 percent of the average
direct costs per ha of nursery and plantation establishment over the
project period, Actual disbursements would be made annually in three
tranches, the first of which would be made after preparation of plantation
sites and based on a rate of US$100 per ha. The second tranche would be
made after the seedlings have been planted and the area fenced and would
be based on a rate of US$100 per ha. The final request for payment of
US$140 per ha would be certified by the Director of Forest, aad made on
the basis of field inspections carried out at least 6 months after plant-
ing and certifying that all establishment works had been carried out
satisfactorily arid that the plantations contained more than 65 percent of
surviving tree seedlings (Annex 4).
4.33      Disbursements for road construe.tion would be made at a fixed
equivalent rate of US$10,000 per km, or part thereof, of completed road
up to a maximum of 40 km. This would cover about 85% of estimated direct
expenses of equipment, labor and material. Disbursements for land clear-
ing would be made at a fixed equivalent rate of US$460 per ha or part
thereof, up to a maximum of 3,800 ha and would cover about 85% of the
estimated direct costs of labor and material (Annex 4).
4.34      Applications for withdrawals against the JDA credit would be
fully documented except for disbursements against nursery establishment,
road construction, land clearing and plantation establishment and which
would be accompanied by a certificate, signed by the Director of Forests,
stating that the work had been satisfactorily undertaken. Annual audited
financial statements covering all project expenditures would be prepared
and forwarded to IDA (para 4.36). Documentation supporting these state-
ments would be retained by FD at one central location and available for
review during IDA project review missions.
4.35      The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit
is shown in Annex 1, Table 11. The disbursement period (6 years) is
shorter than the average agricultural/forestwy project in South Asia
region (8.5 years). This reflects the smallness and relative simplicity
of the project. The schedule aLlows for a sixth year of disbursements in
order that certification criteria for plantings made in Project Year 5 are
adhered to.



-21-
H. Budget. Accounts and Audit
4.36      RGOB gave assurances at negotiations that FD would keep separate
accounts of expenditures made under the project. These would be audited
annually by the R3yal Audit Departmernt for each fiscal year in accordance
with sound auditing principles consistently applied. Accounts would be
submitted for audit within 3 months of the end of the fiscal year and
audited not later than 6 months after the end of such year, and the
audited reports submitted promptly to IDA. Such reports would show, inter
alia, that the funds withdrawn were used for the purpose intended, that
goods have been received or work performed, and that payments have been
made.
4.37      FD's institutional and staffing capabilities, as well as
budgetary, accouncing, internal control and auditing procedures were
reviewed during appraisal and found adequate and satisfactory both for the
purposes of general project accounting, project reporting and the audit of
financial statements.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Organization
5.01      Overall responsibility for project implementation would lie with
the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Forests and which includes the Forest
Department. Under the general direction of the Director of Forests, day
to day project implementation would be handled by a project organization
headed by the Project Manager (PM) (Annex 2). Activities relating to
procurement, project progress and financial reporting would be the respon-
sibility of the Project Manager and his staff.
5.02      Reporting to the Project Manager, there would be in each sector
an Assistant DFO (Loggi_g), responsible for road construction aud log
extraction activities, and an Assistant DFO (Plantations), responsible for
nursery operations, plantation establishment and plantation maintenance.
Two additior:al Rangers and four additional Foresters would be added to
eaci' divislot to assist in carrying out project actions. These staff are
immediately available from within FD.  An Accountant Grade II would also
be added to each District Forest Office and be responsible for project
accounts, local purchases and financial reporting. Staff at Head Office
(FD) would be increased by one Grade I Accountant and two clerks to handle
consolidation of project accounts, financial reporting and preparation of
requests for reimbursement. RGOB gave assurances that appointment of
project staff would be made in accordance with the timetable agreed to at
negotiations. Recruitment to these positions would be from within Bhutaa
where possible.



-22-
5.03      Skilled and semi-skilled workers required by the project would
total about 45 by year 4 when the project reaches full operations. There
should be no difficulty in finding suitable persons due to the proximity
of project areas to India and Bangladesh. Casual labor requirements would
peak at about 500 workers in each area. Recruitment of laborers would be
from within Bhutan where possible, but it may be necessary to recruit
during peak periods fronl nearby India.
B. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.04      Monitoring and evaluation of Lhe project would be undertaken by
PM under the direction of the Director of Forests. In light of experience
and data collected, suggestions for improvements to project implementation
would be made. In addition, PM would be responsible for carrying out at
project closing, an evaluation of the project (para 7.18). RGOB gave
assurances that the PM would also produce semi-annual progress reports,
each October and April giving a summary of activities undertaken during
the preceding six months, staffing levels, and targets achieved and
problems encountered during project implementation.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKET AND PRICES
A. Production
6.01      The main products from site preparation and plantations would be
logs for plywood, veneer and timber, fuelwood, smallwood and building
poles. Project output is summarized below, while details are given in
Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2.

-23-
B. Markets and Prices
6.02      All commercial grade logs from site clearing would be sold to
nearby wood industries and plywood quality logs would be purchased by the
new mill at Gedu (however the main supply for the Gedu mill would come
from other areas). Firewood would be sold in adjacent markets, par-
ticularly the tea estates of West Bengal and Assam and poles would be sold
to local construction firms and individuals. Forest produce resulting
from the project represents relatively small additional volumes entering
the market. Consequently, no marketing difficulties are expected. RGOB
gave assurances that production from the project would when necessary be
exported and that all forest products extracted from project areas would
be sold at prevailing market prices.
6.03       In line with existing government practice, tne Export Division
of the Department of Trade and Commerce would handle all project sales to
the Indian market. Government has recently received royalty rates
vis-a-vis the prevailing selling rates obtained by the Export Division of
timber and other forestry products. As a result of this review and with
agreement of both departments concerned, the rates were adjusted to
reflect current market price less reasonable profits to both agencies.
Royalty rates will be periodically reviewed during IDA supervision mis-
sions.
6.04      Based on existing capacities, plantation sawlog supply could
exceed the local effective demand. The project area is, however, adjacent
to large wood deficit markets in the Indian states of West Bengal and
Assam and as project onutput would supply less than five percent of overall
consumption in these markets, no marketing difficulties are envisaged.
6.05      The small quantity of veneer logs produced would readily be
absorbed by local industries such as the Gedu plywood/sawnwood complex,
which has now comm Inced operation and which will have a total capacity
for about 20,000 m of veneer logs per annum.
6.06      Annual consumption of fuellood in the districts of Samchi and
Sarbhang would total about 300,000 m . Only a small portion of this is,
however, traded commercially. Generally, fuelwood is still in abundant
supply and most requirements are collected by family members at no finan-
cial cost. It is only in some of the larger urban centers that fuelwood
is commercially traded, and then only in relatively small quantities.
6.07      Most fuelwood would, therefore, be sold to markets in West
Bengal and Assam, where there is a high demand for wood for domestic
cooking and for use as a fuel in tea factories. Similarly, there is only
a limited domestic demand for poles and the majority of these would also
be sold in India, where demand and prices are high. Much 'smallwood' is
used for the manufacture of furniture, small tools and implements and



-24-
commands a considerably higher price than actual fuelwood; again demand is
high.
6.08      Government and private itterests are currently examining the
feasibility of establishing a calcium carbide plant at Singi Barsa, near
Phuntsholing. Shoild this plant materialize, it would have a requirement
for about 50,000 m of fuelwood per annum (for conversion to charcoal);
well in excess of anticipated project production in the proposed western
plantation area. In view of the uncertainty still surrounding this
proposal, economic projections have been based on disposal in the Indian
market.
6.09      Recently, financing has been arranged for a particleboard mill3
to be located near Phuntsholing. This mill would utilize about 23,000 m
per annum of forest and wood industry mill residueb as raw material. The
mill is planned to commence operation within the current Year 5 Develop-
ment Plan (ending in March 1987).
6.10      Prices.  Project production represents a small proportion of
total market demand, and it is not anticipated that the project would have
any impact on market prices. The prices used for financial and economic
evaluation of the project represent prevailing market prices in Bhutan,
northern West Bengal and Assam states, with adjustments for transporta-
tion. The Indian market, which would absorb the bulk of initial project
output, is characterized by high prices resulting from inadequate supply
relative to demand. A summary of the net finantcial prices is shown below
in Table 6.2. Details of the calculation of these prices are shown in
Annex 3.

VII. BENEFITS. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Proiect Benefits
7.01      The main beneAit would be the development of institutional
capacity within FD to und'rtake integrated logging and reforestation
operations to support boti the development of wood based industries and
the replacement of over -ature forests with young, healthy, productive
species. This would alao lead to the control of the insidious encroach-
ment of forest areas by -"ose seeking agricultural land, not just in the
project areas, but by demonstrative effect, in other parts of the country
as well.
7.02      Apart from institution building, providing employment oppor-
tunities to local residents and environmental benefits resulting from
reduced soil erosion and flooding, other benefits would include:
Table 7.1: OTHER PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
ActiitLy               Beneficiary                 Benefits
Road Construction      Rural Population         Improved access
to government
services, markets
and farm inputs
Nurseries              Rural Population         Fodder, fuelwood
and timber seed-
lings for social
forestry.

and Ministry of          revenues
Finance
Plantations            Wood based industries   Enhanced raw
material supplies
7.,3      Employment.  Over the five year implementation period, 3,200 ha
would 1Fe logged and cleared and 2,800 ha of plantations established and
maintained, all through labor-intensive methods. In total, about 3,200
man-years of labor would be generated by the project during implementa-
tion, culminating, at full operation (Project Year 5), in about 1,000
man-years annually of incremental labor.



-26-
B. Financial Benefits
7.04      Forest Department is an operating government department with
separate budgetary heads for revenue and expenditures and consequently
does not maintain accounts along commercial lines. Over the project
period, incremental revenues from royalties and sale of forest produce
would total about Nu 268 M (constant 1984 Nu). Project develupment costs,
including all establishment and capital costs during the 5 year implemen-
tation period are estimated to total Nu 68 M and ongoing plantation and
harvesting expenses through year 30 total Nu 52 M (Annex 3). The internal
rate of return to government would be about 12 percent.
C. Economic Analysis
7.05      Assumptions.  For internationally traded goods, prices were
derived from world market prices expressed in projected January 1984
currency values. Appropriate adjustments were made for freight, handling,
and processing. No duties or taxes would be levied on imported major
equipment items.
7.06      In view of the virtually free trade situation existing between
Bhutan and India, domestic prices in Bhutan closely approximate those
ruling in India, with variations for transport costs. Local costs and
benefits have been expressed in economic values through application of a
Standard Conversion Factor of 0.8.
7.07      There is a relatively even demand for labor throughout the year
in Bhutan and though data are unavailable, unemployment is considered to
be low. In fact, it is likely that a significant portion of project labor
requirement would be supplied by non-national workers allowed into Bhutan
on short-term work visas. Consequently, no shadow wage rate was assumed
for labor.
7.08      Due to geographic isolation and well developed local markets,
Bhutan's timber products are not internationally traded. Economic prices
for project output were therefore assumed to equal local market prices,
adjusted by the standard conversion factor. The Indian market, vhich
would account for the bulk of project output, is characterized by excess
demand relative to supply, and there has been a steady increase in real
prices over the last decade. Prices are expected to continue to increase,
and to account for this, future prices of project products were assumed to
vary in line with World Bank projections for logs and, in the case of
fuelwood, for petroleum products.
7.09      Detailed economic cost-benefit cash flows are contained in
Annex 3.  Project costs would consist of capital investment and operating
costs for salvage logging/clearing operations, nurseries, plantations, and
project supervisicn and administration. Costs of foreign training and



-27-
technical assistance are also included. The costs include those of plant-
ing land in the sixth year of the project and which was cleared in Year 5,
along with the cost of maintaining all plantations through to harvest.
Approximately 25 percent of the total area to be reforested (the steeper
slopes) would be planted to long term protective forests, with the prime
objective being to provide soil protection, rather than to produce timber.
As these protection benefits have not been quantified, 25 percent of the
costs of nurseries, roads, plantation establishment, overheads, and tech-
nical assistance and training have been deducted from the economic cash
flow. The project would resume a small area (less than 100 ha) of poor
quality agricultural land, which currently is being cultivated. The net
economic benefits of these agricultural operations, have been included as
an opportunity cost. All costs included in the analyses are net of
duties, taxes and price contingencies. Physical contingencies have been
included.
7.10      Project benefits would include fuelwood/smallwood, poles,
sawlogs and veneer logs, resulting from both salvage logging and refores-
tation activities. The environmental benefits of reduced soil erosion and
flooding, along with benefits that may accrue from the project's assis-
tance to the social forestry program, have not been quantified.
7.11      Project life was assumed as 30 years, in order to incorporaze
the output from all commercial plantings under the project.
1.12      The opportunity cost of capital (OCC) has been estimated at 10M.
This rate is somewhat lower than for other countries in the region due to
the limited investment options available to Government in the short run,
Government's cautious and deliberate approach to development and lack of
entrepreneural investment capacity. Bhutan is still at an early stage of
development where relatively few suitable investment opportunities have
been identified and where implementation capacity is limited. Current
Government plans in the forestry/wood industry sector include only three
small projects over the current five year development plan.
7.13      Rate of Return.  On the basis of these assumptions, the project
is expected to yield an overall economic rate of return (ERR) on invest-
ments of 13 percent. The Bhutan economy would realize net benefits in
present worth terms (discounted at OCC) of about Nu 43.5 M (US$4.4 M) on
related project investments. Project returns have been measured on a five
year implementation period and the resultant benefits. The project offers
the opportunity of continuing the plantation program on an ongoing basis
which is in fact almost certain to occur. The incremental benefits of
this continuation would be high as the capital equipment and facilities
would all be in place. If the net benefits of continuing the clearing and
replanting program for five additional years (until the first year of



-28-
short rotation species has matured) were included in the economic
analysis, the ERR would increase to 17%.
7.14      Road construction and log extraction costs are high due to the
pilot nature of the project. Unit costs should improve considerably once
FD gains the necessary experience and economies of scale on larger
projects take effect. Road construction will also benefit local resi-
dents.
D. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
7.15      While the proposed project would be implemented by a core of
established and experienced staff within FD, it is a large undertaking by
past efforts. Consequently, project targets in the early years are modest
and so set as to allow for gradual buildup to full operation over the five
year period. This would allow FD to gain experience in planning, hiring
and training of labor and in-field level operations. Furthermore, FD
staff would be assisted in the early years by experienced technical
specialists. In conjunction with the relatively strong and dynamic
administration for a country at Bhutan's stage of development, the risks
associated with FD falling behind in project implementation are low.
7.16      Technical risks, while always a concern in plantation projects
would be minimal. The proposed tree species are all well known in the
region, have proven growth records and are well adapted to the
agro-climatic and environmental conditions prevailing in project areas. A
number of species have been proposed for plantations in order to minimize
the risk of failure and provide a broad and practical basis for selection
of species for future plantations--a major objective of this pilot
project. There is little factual data in existence as to productivity and
yields of commercial plantations in Southern Bhutan. However, con-
siderable data exists from areas elsewhere and similar to project growing
conditions. Nevertheless expected yields have been set at conservative
levels and should easily be exceeded.
7.17      Labor for large scale development efforts has been a coumon
constraint elsewhere in Bhutan, often as a result of isolation and dis-
tance from population centers. Also, by South Asian standards, Bhutan is
relatively under-populated, having by far the lowest population density in
t.he region.  Government has generally sought to alleviate this problem by
allowing labor from nearby countries to enter for fixed terms of employ-
ment. To the extent there are shortages of domestic labor, such arrange-
ments would also apply to the proposed project. In addition, Project
areas are adjacent to sources of plentiful labor supply in nearby India.
Irrespective of these arrangements, FD would in line with national policy,
continue to recruit and train Bhutanese to fill all skilled and
semi-skilled positions by close of the project.

variations ia incremental cost and benefit streams on the project's
viability. These switching values at the OCC are shown in Table 7.2.

1J Percentage changes in variable concerned
which would reduce NPV to zero.
Switching values indicate that project returns are relatively insensitive
to changes in costs or benefits. A significant cost increase (greater
than 42%) or a substantial drop in benefits (more than 35%) would have to
be experienced before the ERR would fall below the OCC. Since such large
cost increases or decreases in benefits are highly improbable, overall
project economic risks are considered low. Nevertheless to optimize
project objectives, particularly with regard to species selection and the
establishment of environmentally safe land clearing practices, an evalua-
tion of the project would be carried out by FD at project closing. It was
agreed at negotiations that RGOB would submit a draft of the Project
Completion Report to IDA for review by December 31, 1990.

8.01      The followiag assurances were obtained at negotiations:
(a)  There would be the minimum displacement of farmers in
selecting pLanting areas (para 4.06);
(b)  Foreign specialists would be employed in accordance with
an agreed timetable and with qualifications and terms of
reference satisfactory to IDA (para 4.25);
(c)  Sufficient financial allocation for the project had been
included in the Fifth Development Plan ard that the
remaining financial requirement would be provided for in
subsequent plans and in addition that the amount required
for the first year of operation of the project be included
in the 1984/85 budget (pars 4.28);
(d)  FD would keep separate financial accounts for the project
and provide to the Bank audited annual financial state-
ments and audit reports within siX months after Government's
fiscal year end (para 4.36). Tn addition, FD would prepare
aad forward to the Bank six-monthly progress reports (para
5.04);
(e)  Appointment of senior level staff would be made in accor-
dance with an agreed timetable (para 5.02);
(f)  Production from the project can be exported and that all
forest products extracted from project areas would be sold
at prevailing market price (para 6.02);
(g)  A Project Completion Report would be prepared by FD a-ad a
draft copy of the evaluation submitted to IDA for review
by December 31, 1990 (para 7.18).
8.02      With these conditions and assurances the project would be
suitable for a credit of US$3.5 M to RGOB.

Opportuni.ty Land Cost
It is anticipated that the project -would resume approximately 100 ha of
agricultural land.  While this land has relatively poor agricultural
potential and is being farmed illegally, its resumption for forestry
would incur a net economic cost. This is estimated as follows:
