PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report presents a completion evaluation of the Feeder
Roads Project financed by Credit 810-TO for US$5.8 m, which was approved
on May 23  1978.  The credit closing date was March 31, 1986 and the
undisbursed part of the credit, amounting to US$15,748.94 was cancelled.
The report was prepared by the Western Africa Region.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project perfor-
mance audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited
by OED staff.   Minor comments were received from the borrower in a
letter dated September 21, 1987; these have been taken into account in
the present report (see Annex).

FEEDER ROADS PROJECT, CREDIT 810-TO
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        Project execution took three vears longer than the four years
estimated at appraisal.   During the "irst  two vears,  project  imple-
mentation was delayed by insufficient local funds, fuel shortages, and
organizational difficulties.  Progress improved with the establishment
of the SNPR and the appointment of a competent director. In 1983 local
funds dried up, but from 1984 to 1986, progress improved considerablv,
despite the absence of consultants, with more local funds available and
better management.   Alm,st 65% of the feeder roads called for at ap-
praisal were completed. The quality of construction was generally good
(paras 3.01 and 3.09).
2.        There is insufficient data available to recalculate a precise
ERR, but a rough estimate indicates that it is about 17% which is
slightly lower than the appraisal estimate of 18% (para 4.01).
3.        One of the main objectives of the project was to establish an
efficient institutional framework for planning, constructing and main-
taining feeder roads.  Some progress was made in this regard and part
way through the project, the Government established a national director-
ate (SNPR) to take over responsibility for feeder roads which had been
delegated among  separate ministries  in  the past.   The  Government's
commitment to the project's goals improved towards the end of the pro-
ject.  However, more needs to be accomplished.  The new national road
organization which was established early in 1987 should be expanded into
planning and maintenance of feeder roads and its management strengthened
(paras 5.01-5.03).
4.        In retrospect, project preparation efforts by the Association
could have been more thorough; however, supervision was adequate (pa-
ra 6.01).
5.        The project provided useful lessons for the Association in
preparing the next project.  The Transport Rehabilitation Project, which
was appraised in March 1987, contains a component for feeder roads. It
includes specific provisions for expediting procurement, upgrading
maintenance, carrying out more road construction by contract and im-
proved budgeting procedures (para 7.03).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The  first Feeder Roads Project was the seventh Bank Group
operation in Togo and was based in part on a study financed under the
Second Highway Project. At the time of appraisal, in 1977, the agricul-
ture sector employed 75% of the country's total work force and was
responsible for nearly 40% of the countrv's total export earnings.
About 4,000 km of the country's total of 5,000 km or feeder roads were
serving on-going or planned agricultural projects.
1.02      The six earlier IDA credits were equally distributed between
agricultural and highwav construction/maintenance projects.  UJnder the
Highway  Maintenance  and  Second  Highway  Projects   (Credit 131-TO,
US$3.7 m, 1968 and Credit 450-TO, US$8.7 m, 1973, respectively), mainte-
nance of the primary and secondary road network improved noticoably in
the first half of the 1970s following reorganization and training of
staff in the Public Works Department (DTP).  Further improvements were
expected from additional tec'.nical assistance and maintenance/workshop
equipment provided under the Third Highway Project (Credit 693-TO,
US$10.0 m, 1977). However, the administration and development of feeder
roads was ill-defined and shared among several Government agencies
without clear strategy for planning, construction, and maintenance.
Consequently, the condition of the feeder roads deteriorated rapidly,
and a n;:±ed was felt to introduce an institutionalized approach to
improve and maintain them.   This was originally expected to be done
under the Third Highway Project. However, in earlv 1976, tAe Associa-
tion decided to finance a separate Feeder Roads Project to focus more
clearlv on the problems of rural roads and firmly establish an institu-
t-on to deal with them.
1.03      The overall responsibility for execution of the Project was
entrusted to the Ministry of Rural Wlorks (M!AR) through its Directorate
of Rural Engineering (DGR). Because DGR lacked experience and equipment
had to be provided before it could start work, part of the Droject was
delegated to the Ministry of Equipment, Public Works, Housin;, Post and
Telecommunications (MEPW).
1.04      This report  is based on the information obtaine1  from the
Appraisal and President's Reports, Bank files, the preliminary comple-
tion report prepared by the consultant and a final report prepared bv
the Borrower on the execution of tha project.   It is also based on
interviews witih Bank staff associated with the proiect and information
gathered by the completion mission in June 1986.



II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification and Preparation
2.01      A program for feeder road improvement', was identified in the
early 1970s, and project preparation was initiated in 1976 under the
Second Highway Project.  The project was prepaied Jointly by MAR and
DTP, assisted by two short-term consultants directly engaged by the
Association.  IDA concluded that the content and economic justification
of the study were adequate, but that the cost estimates needed revision
and the organizational arrangements for implementation needed to be
better defined.  These issues were taken up during the follow-up prepa-
ration and appraisal/post appraisal missions.
Project Appraisal
2.02      The project was appraised in July 1977 but there were still
unresolved issues related to training, organizational arrangements, and
financing of feeder road maintenance. A post-appraisal mission was sent
in December 1977 to resolve these issues. The Issues Paper highlighted
two major points:
(a) DGR staff was expected to eventually take over the DTP's
feeder roads functions on a permanent basis after com-
pleting the training program, which was one of the
principal project objectives. However, there was consid-
erable risk of losing the engineers once trained as they
would only receive between a third and a half of the
salary for similar works in the private sector. Thus, it
was recommended that IDA finance allowances for DGR staff
under the project for the first two years of implementa-
tion, which was expected to cost about $50,000 (at about
US$120 per m-m).
(b) Maintenance of the feeder road network, which was the
responsibility of local authorities, ranged from poor to
non-existent, due to lack of funds and proper organ-
ization.   Redress of this situation became one of the
project's main objectives.
2.03      Negotiations  were  held  in April 1978  and  agreements  were
reached on criteria and procedures for selecting the roads for improve-
ment under the project.  In view of the poor state of the feeder roads,
the Government agreed during negotiations to establish a separate Feeder
Roads Unit (SRD) within DGR to carry out part of the Project works and
to monitor the economic, social and engineering aspects of the project.
Since DGR had little experience on feeder roads works, it was agreed
that it would handle only 600 km of the total of 1000 km of feeder roads
to be financed under the project.  Work on the remaining 400 km was to
be carried out under a contractual agreement with the MEPW through its
Public Works Department  (DTP).  Signing of a contract to this effect



-3 _
between MAR and MEPW was a condition of effectiveness of the Credit
Agreement.  Phvsical execution of the project was scheduled to commence
in October 1978.
2.14      A post-negotiations mission was necessary in May 1978 to reach
agreements on:  establishing and staffing of the SRD; detailed arrange-
ments for appointing consultants and acquisition of equipment; and the
contract between MAR and METP. The Credit was approved on May 23, 1978
and  the  agreements  were  signed  on  June 28, 1978.   The  project  was
expected to be completed by December 1982, over a four-year implemen-
tation  period  beginning  in  October 1978.   Credit  effectiveness  was
delayed by about five months beyond the expected date, mainly due to the
Government's delay in providing local funds and in ratifying the Credit
Agreement. The Credit was declared effective on March 2, 1979.
Project Objectives ard Description
2.05      The main objectives of the project were to:  (a) establish an
efficient institutional framework for planning, developing and maintain-
ing feeder roads; (b) train local staff to perform the above functions;
and (c) construct and subsequently maintain 1,000 km of high priority
feeder roads.
2.06      To meet these objectilres, the project consisted of:
(a) a four-year program for the improvement and maintenance
of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, including (i) purchase
of equipment. spare parts and workshop tools; (ii) pur-
chase of materials and supplies; and (iii) construction
and repair of culverts and bridges by local contractors;
(b)  technical assistance, consisting of (i) about 77 m-m to
establish a Feeder Road Unit (SRD) within DGR, to imple-
ment the above program, and to train local staff of the
unit in planning, implementing and monitoring feeder road
improvement  and maintenance;  and  (ii) about  10 m-m  to
improve the effectiveness of DTP's road brigades; and
(c) short-term consultant services for studying a follow-up
feeder road program.
2.07      Out of 4000 km of feeder roads servicing various ongoing and
planned agricultural projects, 1000 km of roads were selected for
rehabilitation and improvement.  The work consisted of:  (a) reshaping,
(b) regravelling selected road sections and (c) building, repairing and
reinforcing drainage structures.    A firm work program for the first
year was agreed by MAR for the works to be carried out by the SRD which
was expected to maintain the feeder roads built under the project.
2.08      Institution building was one of the three objectives of the
project.   Technical  assistance  was  to be  provided  to help  DGR  to
(a) assume   responsibilitv   for   defining   the   proiect's   annual



-4-
construction, improvement and maintenance program; (b) prepare implemen-
tation plans; (c) supervise and monitor the feeder roads program; and
(d) graduallv assume responsibility for (i) determining appropriate
technology,  (ii) identifying  agencies  to maintain  feeder  roads;  and
(iii) preparing a maintenance program. Training was to be provided for
staff at all levels in SRD.
IIT. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Start-up
3.01      Start-up of the project, originally scheduled for late 1978,
was delayed by about five months, mainly due to delays in ratification
of the credit agreement and in making the local funding available. New
office premises had to be constructed for SRD headquarters, but the
location 20 km outside of Lome and the lack of telephone facilities
throughout the project period made communications difficult. During the
early stages of project implementation, progress was frequentlv delaved
bv fuel shortages, underutilization of equipment, administrative delays
because of cumbersome procedures required by MAR and inexperience at the
DGR and SRD levels, Government interference at all levels of project
implementation, and deviation of the work force to non-project works.
Allocation of local funds was slow, mainly due to budgetary constraints
which delayed implementatUon of the project for about one year.  Also,
frequent personnel changes at all levels resulted in lack of continuitv
in the management of the project. Although DGR did not have sufficient
equipment and trained staff, it formed three brigades rather than the
two agreed during appraisal. The Government was later persuaded by IDA
to revert to two brigades.
3.02      The project was also handicapped by poor financial management
and accounting practices because of the lack of qualified accountants.
Initially, proper accounts were not maintained and the books were not
available to the DGR.  Consequently, neither it nor IDA could properly
monitor project expenditures; however, this was eventually remedied.
Works Carried Out by the Feeder Roads Unit (SRD)
3.03      SRD brigades started work in Januarv 1980 after a delav of
nearly 10 months, due to slow procurement of equipment and training.
During the training period, the first 20 km of feeder roads work was
carried out with rented equipment which turned out to be a high cost
operation. Two roads selected according to the agreed on procedure were
dropped from the first year construction program and replaced bv other
roads designated by MAR, without approval of the Association.  Due to
the short length of many roads, the brigades had to be moved frequently
from one construction site to another, resulting in a low monthly
construction output.



3.04      The  situation  improved  after the  reorganization  of MAR  in
Mav 1981. Project management enjoyed reasonable autonomy, which result-
ed in increased efficiency and productivity. However, non-availability
of local funds persisted and delayed work progress.  Equipment mainte-
nance was generally good and with the arrival of radio equipment, the
brigades were able to communicate more effectivelv with headquarters.
3.05      Tn  early  1982,  a presidential  decree  changed  SRD  into  a
national  service  (Service Nationale  des Pistes Rurales -- SNPR).   A
public works engineer was appointed as Director of SNPR in September of
198?.  Overall, the SRD/SNPR built over 400 km of feeder roads, or two
tlhirds of the roads assigned to it under the project.  The accelerated
progress made by the SNPR is attributed to its new director. He carried
on for most of his tenure without the assistance of the consultant whose
contract terminated at the end of 1983 (para 3.13). Later, the Govern-
ment appointed an experienced road maintenance engineer to SRD which led
to improved maintenance of feeder roads.
3.06      When local funds for the project were unavailable, in order to
pay the wages of its equipment operators, drivers and laborers, SNPR
carried out feeder roads construction works under contract with the
Togolese Cotton Companv (SOTOCO), the implementing agency of the
TDA-'inanced Second Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 1302-TO).
During this period, SNPR built 126 km of feeder roads for SOTOCO.
Audits of both projects did not find any indication of double counting
of costs.
Works Carried out by Public Works Department (DTP) Brigades
3.07      The improvement works by DTP began in early 1979 about as
planned.   The work progressed  slowly at  first  due  to dispersal  of
equipment and brigades over several sites and breakdowns of several key
equipment units.  The quality of works carried out on the first 25 km of
roads was not  fully satisfactory.   Output and -ualicy gradually im-
proved, and by August 1980, about 127 km roads had been completed, but
it was still about half of what was expected at appraisal. Construction
almost came to a standstill in September 1980 for about four months due
to lack of fuel and other supplies caused by a shortage of funds in MAR
and DTP.  Work stoppages due to shortage of funds occurred repeatedly
despite  strong efforts by IDA to redress  the situation.   The  final
production by DTP at the time of credit closing was 195 km or almost
half of the 400 km scheduled.
Local Contractors
3.08      Two local contractors were hired by the SRD during the period
preceding delivery of equipment to train operators and drivers on the
job.  They built 34 kilometers of roads in this manner.   Some of the
drainage works were awarded by SNPR to small local sub-contractors for a
total amount of about US$1 m. Most of this work was completed satisfac-
torily.



-6-
Overall Progress
3.09      Project execution took three years longer than the four years
estimated at appraisal due to the problems outlined in para 3.01.  From
1979/80, progress was slow during start-up with very little field work
done.   Tn 1981, modest progress was made, while in 1982 progress im-
proved with the establishment of the SNPR and the appointment of a
competent director.   In 1983, local funds dried up, but from 1984-86,
progress improved considerably with more local funds available, better
management and no consultants.  The three executing entities completed
about 634 km of roads out of the 1,000 km estimated at the time of
appraisal (Table 1).  This is considered reasonable in the light of the
difficulties encountered during project implementation. The quality of
construction was generally good.
Training
3.10      The training of equipment operators and drivers was an essen-
tial requirement for successful project implementation.   Training was
first carried out by contractors until the equipment for the training
center arrived.  The training program went reasonably well and a large
number  of  operators  and  mechanics  were  successfully  trained.   The
program was less successful in training higher level staff for planning,
development and maintenance.
Project Cost
3.11      The total project cost was estimated at appraisal to be about
US$8.3 m, net of taxes,  of which 71% was  in foreign exchange.   IDA
financed US$5.8 m, all of the foreign exchange cost except for mainte-
nance and other local cost-, which the Government was expected to fi-
nance.   In retrospect,  it appears that unit construction costs were
substantially underestimated at appraisal, particularly the costs of
rental equipment, and fuel and lubricants.
Disbursements
3.12      The  first  extension  of  the  closing  date  was  made  from
June 30, 1983 to March 31, 1984 because of delays in credit effective-
ness and initial project work. IDA agreed to a second extension of one
year after the Government made available an amount of CFAF 100 million
as counterpart funds. In late 1984, in view of the good performance of
SNPR and the Government's difficult financial situation, the Association
agreed to increase its rate of disbursement subject to certain condi-
tions, including the appointment of a highway engineer to take charge of
SNPR (para 3.05).  Finally, following the Government's agreement to an
audit provision and the appointment of an engineer to be responsible for
feeder roads maintenance, a third extension of the closing date to
March 31, 1986, was agreed to by the Association. Overall, the closing
date was extended by almost three years mainly due to delays related to
project implementation (para 3.01). A small balance of about US$15,800
was  cancelled  effective  December 31, 1986.   The  Government's  slow



-7-
administrative procedures for transmission of withdrawal requests to the
Association sometimes delayed disbursement of funds as shown in Table 3.
The project accounts have been satisfactorily audited.
Consultant's Performance
3.13      The  project  originally  provided  for  87 m-m  of  technical
assistance of which 77 m-m was for SRD and 10 m-m for DTP.  Additional
short-term services were provided for the preparation of a follow-up
feeder road program.  The technical assistance contract was signed in
late 1978 for two years; however, due to delays noted above, it was
extended to the end of 1983 for an additional 56 m-m.  The consultant's
performance was mixed, mainly due to the cumbersome procedures required
by MAR.  Their performance was also handicapped by internal problems of
the  firm.   The  consultants  were  less  effective  in  providing  the
short-term services.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01      The economic justification of the project at appraisal was
based on lowering transport costs and reducing spoilage in the areas of
the project roads, thus contributing toward the expansion of agricultur-
al production.   At that  time,  the ERR was estimated  at about  18%.
Although a comparable recalculation is not possible due to limited
information on agricultural production and traffic, it is clear that the
project generated increased agricultural surplus and transport. A 1983
traffic study indicated that traffic levels of some 3-4 vpd on old
unimproved feeder roads had risen to about 33 vpd on the improved feeder
roads. Similarly, some 4,000 kg of agricultural produce was transported
dailv on the old unimproved feeder roads as compared with 8,500 kg on
the improved roads.  A comparison of six project feeder roads in 1983
and 1984 showed that average vehicle traffic increased further from
about 33 to 47 vpd, and the average goods transported increased by
almost two thirds per day; this increase may, in part, be due to a
better harvest in 1984 than in 1983.  While these data are too limited
for a full economic reevaluation, they do show positive results and can
be used to arrive at a rough estimate of the average rate of return of
17%.  The estimated rate explained below, takes into account benefits
from value added in agriculture, vehicle operating cost savings on base
and generated (non agricultural) traffic.
4.02      The above estimate is based on (a) an average actual construc-
tion cost (including technical assistance) of about CFAF 3.6 miliion per
km with a residual value of 25% at the end of 10 years; (b) an average
maintenance   cost  of  CFAF 200,OOC per  km  with  the  project  and
CFAF 100,000 without; (c) an average value added of CFAF 30 per kg for
an average incremental agricultural surplus of 7,000 kg per day during
the harvest season (75 days p.a.) per feeder road of 30 km -- only 75%
of this value added was actually attributed to the road investment; and
(d) an average vehicle operating cost saving of CFAF 60 per km for



normal road traffic (4 vpd) and CFAF 30 per km for generated non-agri-
cultural traffic (30 vpd).  Counting all incremental value added from
agriculture would have increased the rate of return to 22% while taking
only two thirds would have reduced it to 15%.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      One of the main objectives of the project was to establish an
efficient institutional framework for planning, constructing and main-
taining feeder roads.  As noted in para 1.02, while the feeder roads
component waa originally intended to be included under the Third Highway
Project, IDA decided to finance a separate Feeder Roads Project so that
an institution with integrated responsibilities for feeder roads could
be developed.   At first,  the SRD lacked technical competence and a
commitment from the Government.   After it was initially set up in a
small office, it was moved to a newly constructed facility lacking
telephone services. Little or no authority was delegated to the project
level by MAR, especially during the first two years of project implemen-
tation.  Also, there were frictions at times between DGR, SRD and the
technical assistance staff.  When, in mid-1982, the Government estab-
lished SNPR, IDA supported it on the condition that the Government
appoint a technically competent engineer as the Director.   This was
done, and SNPR satisfactorily implsmented the remainder of the project
for much of the time without technical assistance.
5.02      SNPR was established as a iieans of improving the performance
in executing the project, and it was successful in this regard. Despite
the earlier problems in execution, the project was concluded on a strong
note as a result of the Government's willingness to take the steps
necessary to strengthen the feeder road organization and achieve the
project's goal.
5.03      Early in 1987, after the project was completed, the Government
abolished MAR and provisionally re-attached SNPR to the MEPW which is
now responsible for maintenance and construction of all types of roads.
This organization should be expanded into planning and maintenance of
feeder roads, and its management strengthened.
VI. THE ASSOCIATION'S PERFORMANCE
6.01      In retrospect, project preparation efforts  could have been
more thorough, particularly as regards assessment of the capacity of
existing organizations to execute the project.   Supervision was ade-
quate, and IDA made substantial efforts to ensure successful implementa-
tion of the project. During the very early stages of project implemen-
tation, IDA staff considered the possibility of suspension of disburse-
ments and declaring the project a problem project, but shortly thereaf-
ter, progress improved.



VII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      As noted above, the preparatory studies during project prepa-
ration could have been more thoroughly carried out. Despite shortage of
counterpart funds, organizational difficulties, lack of Government
commitment and higher than expected costs, almost 65% of the 1,000 km of
feeder roads called for at appraisal were built.  The quality of con-
struction, in general, was good.  Although not fully realized, progress
was made on implementing the institutional objectives, particularly
towards the end of the project.
7.02      While the economic data available is too limited to recalcu-
late a precise ERR, a rough estimate indicates that it is about 17%, or
somewhat lower than the appraisal estimate of 18%.  Studies show that
traffic on the feeder roads picked up considerably after they were
improved.
7.03      The  planning  and  maintenance  activities  of  the  recently
reorganized DTP (para 5.03) should be further expanded and strengthened.
This will be followed up under a Transport Rehabilitation Project which
was appraised in March 1987. This project builds on the lessons learned
under earlier projects including the need:  (a) to improve procurement
procedures; (b) to carry out more work by contract rather than by force
account;  (c) to increase the annual budgets for routine and periodic
maintenance; and (d) to open a revolving fund and maintain a minimum
balance,

SUBJECT: Completion Report on Feeder koads Project
(Credit 810-TO)
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
The National Feeder Roads Service has read the Completion Report on
the Feeder Roads Project with interest and is gratified to note the good
overall results notwithstanding the initial difficulties.
This success, due particularly to the judicious selection of the
present managers, justifies the existence of the service.
Like any human activity, the work of the National Feeder Roads
Service is perfectible, and the service undertakes to do better still if it is
provided with the means. We accordingly request the World Bank to reaffirm
its confidence in us by financing the second phase of the project.
Despite our satisfaction with the report as a whole, we have the
following comments:
-    There is a typographic error on page ii under OTHER PROJECT DATA:
the Effectiveness Date of the Credit Agreement is 06/28/78 and not
06/28/86.
-    In paragraph 3.01, line 10, the word "inexperience" shoild be used
instead of the phrase "lack of technical expertise."
-    It would be desirable to reword paragraph 5.03, since a.ter the
abolition of the Ministry of Rural Works, the National Feeder Roads
Service was provisionally attached to the Ministry of Equipment and
of Posts and Telecommunications and not merged with the Public
Works Department.
