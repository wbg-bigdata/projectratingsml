REPUBLIC OF TOGO
APPRAISAL OF A FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
1.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      The Republic of Togo, with a 50 km coastline on the Gulf of Benin,
forms a narrow 600 km corridor between Ghana and Benin (see map) and is
relatively small (about 57,000 km ). Its population is about 2.3 million
growing at about 2.7% p.a. The country is bordered on the north by land-locked
Upper-Volta. Except for a long mountain range along the northern border with
Benin and a central range along the Ghana border, Togo's terrain is flat and
rolling and presents no geographical obstacles to transport. Good road-
making soils are generally available throughout the country except close to
the coast in the Maritime Region.
1.02      The economy is predominantly rural.  About 75% of the active popula-
tion is engaged in agriculture which accounts for about 30% of the gross
domestic product (GDP) and some 40% of total export earnings. GDP per capita
was about US$260 in 1976; rural incomes, however, remained low -- about US$100
per capita. Over the period 1960-75, average growth of GDP was about 6% p.a.
in real terms with wide disparities among sectors. Growth over the period
1971-76, was 3% p.a., mostly sustained by mining activities and services
while agriculture grew only slightly. The current Third Development Plan
(1976-80) aims at a 7% p.a. growth with emphasis on further expansion of the
mining sector and restoration and expansion of food and cash crop production.
B.   The Agricultural Sector
1.03      Practically all agricultural production is carried out by about
300,000 small-holders on farms averaging 2.5 ha using family labor and low-
yielding traditional techniques. The main foodcrops are yam, maize, rice
and sorghum which account for about 80% of total agricultural output; produc-
tion of these crops has increased about 3% p.a. over the last decade, just
ahead of population growth.
1.04      The principal export crops are cocoa and coffee, which together
contribute about 75% of agricultural exports, and cotton, groundnuts and
copra. Over the decade 1966-75, total agricultural exports stagnated at
about 60,000 tons p.a., except for 1970 and 1971 when exports peaked at
90,000 and 80,000 tons respectively. This stagnation is attributable to
(i) the Government's neglect of the agricultural sector in the 1960's both
in terms of investments and establishing effective institutions and (ii)
socio-political obstacles such as local overpopulation in some regions,
migration patterns and land tenure, and poor roads.



-2-
1.05      The northernmost Savanna region is characterized by an irregular and
short-duration rainfall pattern (1,100 mm/year).  The overall population
density is about 30/km .  Principal crops are millet/sorghum, groundnuts, and
recently, rice; the area has moderate prospects for livestock development.
1.06      The Kara region, a mountainous region, has adequate rainfall (1,400
mm/year) but low agricultural potential due to overpopulation in part of the
region and the 2resultant depletion of soil fertility. Population density
averages 53/km but reaches almost 300/km in some areas; about one-fourth of
the region is unpopulated due to onchocerciasis. Migration to the south, both
seasonal (about 20 percent of the adult male' population) and permanent, is
significant.
1.07      The Central region is the least populated region with only about
19/km . Precipitation, which averages about 1,300 mm in a single season, and
generally adequate soils can support crops such as cotton, groundnuts, yams,
maize, and pulses. However, the absence of an easily accessible aquifer to
supply drinking water is a major constraint to settlement and agricultural
development.
1.08      The Plateau region, with average rainfall of 1,200-1,600 mm/year
(bi-modal), generally good soils and population density of about 30 km ,
has the best agricultural potential. Cocoa and coffee dominate the wetter,
mountainous area to the west, while the eastern part of the region is suited
to integrated cotton/food crop development and intensive maize cultivation.
1.09      The Maritime region shares some of the characteristics of each of
the other reigons. Rainfall, spread over two seasons, ranges from 700-
900 mm/year near the coast to 1,000-1,200 mm/year in the north. Development
of the northern third of the region is hindered by the scarcity of drinking
water and the presence of onchocerciasis. The southeast suffers frgm depleted
soil fertility due to overpopulation with densities reaching 200/km , bringing
the regional average rural population density to 90/km , the highest in the
country. Principal crops are maize, cassava, pulses, groundnuts and cotton.
The Institutional Framework
1.10      Responsibility for the Agricultural Sector is shared by two minis-
tries: the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and the Ministry of Rural
Works (MRW). The former is essentially concerned with policy formulation and
program coordination of production activities. The latter is concerned
primarily with infrastructure development and support services and includes a
Rural Works Department (Direction du Genie Rural, DGR) and divisions for
pedology, plant protection, veterinary services, police of forestry and
fisheries, and produce inspection.



-3-
1.11      DGR is being reorganized as shown on the chart.  It consists of
six divisions: programming and studies, rural works, rural water works,
food industries, survey and mapping, and administration and accounting. DGR
has an office in each of the five regions headed by a regional director.
Under the proposed project a feeder road unit will be created within the Rural
Works Division.
1.12      Recently, the Government established autonomous, crop-related agen-
cies and corporations with responsibilities ranging from supply of inputs and
provision of extension services to rural engineering, credit distribution,
marketing and processing.  These agencies include five Organismes Regionaux de
Promotion et de Production des Cultures Vivriere (ORPV) I/ tor toodcrop
development activities; Societe pour la Renovation du Cafe et du Cacao (SRCC)
for coffee and cocoa; Societe Nationale du Palmier et des Huileries (SONAPH)
for palm-oil; SOTOCO Societe Togolaise du Coton (SOTOCO) for cotton; and
TOGOFRUITS for fruit. The Government is also executing and preparing several
agricultural/rural development projects mostly with external financing, in-
cluding three by the Bank Group: Togo Cocoa/Coffee Development Project
(Cr. 503-TO, US$6.0 million, 1974), Maritime Region Rural Development Project
(Cr. 638-TO, US$9.5 million, 1976) and Cotton Areas Rural Development Project
(Cr. 741-TO, US$14.0 million, 1977). The Government has allocated 22% of
investments under the Third Plan to speed up restoration and expansion of
agricultural production.
C.   The Transport System
1.13      Togo's transport system consists of about 7,400 km of roads, 436 km
of railway, a deep-water port, a phosphate wharf, one international airport
and five airstrips. The main transport system, which is export/import
oriented, is focussed on Lome, the nation's capital and economic center, where
there are a deep-water port and an international airport. Links to the rest
of the country are provided along a main north-south rail/road axis. The
extent and density of the main system is adequate for the country's relatively
small size, but the feeder road network generally needs expansion, improvement
and rehabilitation. Emphasis on transport development to date has been on
modernizing the main system.
Highways
1.14      Details of the highway sector are discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.15      The railway network operated by the Reseau des Chemins de Fer du
Togo (CFT) comprises three lines originating at Lome: (i) the central line
northward to Blitta (276 km), the northwestern line to Palime (116 km), and
(iii) the coastal line (44 km) eastward to Aneho through Kpeme, the site of
1/   The ORPV's are replacing the five SORAD's (Societe Regionales d'Amenage-
ment et de Developpement) which dealt with all Regional Development.

the phosphate wharf and processing plant. All the existing railway lines are
meter gauge and in reasonably good condition. A 40 km line for the CIMAO
(Ciments de l'Afrique de l'Ouest) will extend from km 19 on the Lome-Blitta
line to Tabligbo, the site of the regional clinker plant being financed by the
Bank and a group of other lenders.
Seaports
1.16      The autonomous, free port of Lome handled about 590,000 tons in
1976, and port capacity is being increased to 800,000 tons p.a. The port,
managed by an efficient, independent port authority, is self supporting.
Technical assistance for port operation by the Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG) is being phased out. The Kpeme wharf is a modern structure that
handles 3 million tons of phosphate per year as well as the petroleum needs
of the phosphate mine.
Air Transport
1.17      Domestic air transport is unimportant owing to Togo's small size
and the good condition of the primary road network. Infrastructure, mostly
used by military and general aviation, consists of five airstrips of which
two can handle DC-3s. International air transport has been increasing rapidly,
from 10,000 passengers and 206 tons of freight in 1962 to 115,000 passengers
and 3,300 tons in 1975. The international airport at Lome is modern and
capable of handling DC-l0's. The Government's current plans include expand-
ing the airport and studying the location and layout for a new airport at
Lome.
D.   Transport Sector Management, Investments and Issues
1.18      The Ministry of Commerce and Transport (MCT) is responsible for
transport sector management including screening transport investment proposals
of other ministries and public agencies, coordinating transport modes, formu-
lating transport policy, and investigating and resolving specific transport
sector issues. However, MCT was created as a separate ministry only in 1977
and does not have qualified staff to perform these functions. Under the Third
Highway Project, a start is being made to improve the situation through the
creation of a separate Transport Planning and Coordination Unit within MCT
with substantial technical assistance (72 man-months) to assist in establish-
ing it. At the subsector level, highway planning is also being improved with
technical assistance under the Third Highway Project.
1.19      During the Second Development Plan (1971-1975) transport sector in-
vestments totalled CFAF 15.5 billion (US$63 million equivalent) or about 25%
of total public investments. The primary objectives were to improve the
north-south primary road axis and to expand the port of Lome. Under the Third



Plan the Government plans to invest CFAF 38.6 billion (US$156 million equivalent)
in the transport sector or 14% of total public investments. The plan emphasizes
the completion of the north-south primary road axis, further expansion of the
port of Lome, the construction and rehabilitation of two railway lines serving
the CIMAO clinker plant and a regional fertilizer plant, and improvement of
the airport at Lome and five regional airports. The plan's objectives largely
reflect the sectors' needs, apart from the apparently excessive airport
investments.

1.20      The Association is helping the Government to achieve the above sec-
toral objectives through ongoing projects as well as future projects in an
advanced stage of preparation. The ongoing Third Highway Project is assist-
ing in constructing two trunk roads. The Association is also assisting in the
development and maintenance of the feeder road network through feeder road
components of three rural development projects (the Cocoa-Coffee Project, the
Maritime Region Project and the Cotton Areas Project) for a total of 1,000 km,
of feeder roads. In the Cocoa-Coffee Development Project, the Association is
providing funds for constructing about 100 km of feeder roads to faciiitate
the evacuation of cocoa and coffee and to connect the local communities to the
main road system. The 900 km under the Maritime Region Project and the Cotton



-7-
Areas Project will provide efficient transport for inputs into and produce out
of the areas as well as provide accessibility for the people within the
project areas to health and educational facilities. A German-financed Rural
Development Project for the Central Region is in its first year of implementa-
tion. No feeder roads are provided for in that project. The proposed project
would provide the resources for constructing and maintaining about 1,000 km
of feeder roads as additional support to the development projects and on a
national scale improve the feeder road network where it is unable to meet the
demands of existing and future development projects. In addition, the project
would help to establish permanent institutions for feeder road planning,
administration and maintenance.
II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.  The Road Network
2.01      Togo's road network totals about 7,400 km of which about 1,140 km
are paved and about 1,000 km are all-weather gravel or laterite roads; the
remainder are dry weather roads and tracks.

The country's two most important roads, which extend from Lome north to the
Upper Volta border (717 km) and east to the Benin border (48 km), are paved
except the last about 200 km of the road to the Upper Volta border. About
590 km of the secondary roads are also paved. The rest of the primary and
secondary network, though generally adequate in extent and distribution for
the country's needs, is mostly only in fair or poor condition in spite of
improving maintenance. The situation is even worse for the feeder roads, most
of which have deteriorated badly due to the compounded effect of low construc-
tion standards and practically no maintenance.
B.   Traffic on the Feeder Roads Network
2.02      Traffic on the feeder roads network consists of (a) agricultural
produce destined for local markets, district centers and cooperative centers,
(b) small volumes of agricultural inputs and consumer goods, and (c) passen-
gers. There are no reliable traffic volume statistics on these roads. In
general, however, there is a large variation in the traffic volumes of indi-
vidual feeder roads depending on population density and economic activity.



- 8 -
Sample traffic counts during the preparation of the proposed project revealed
that traffic ranges from about 5 vehicles per day (vpd) on farm-to-market
roads to about 30 vpd on roads leading to district or cooperative centers.
The typical freight transport vehicles on these roads are three to five ton
payload trucks; passenger transport is mostly by small buses and passenger
cars.
C.   The Road Transport Industry
2.03      There are no valid statistics on the volume of the existing motor-
vehicle fleet, since the Road Transport Service registers new vehicles but
does not collect information on withdrawals from the fleet. However, esti-
mates based on reasonable assumptions of vehicle life indicate that the fleet
size was about 14,000 in 1974, the most recent year for which registration
data are available; about 71% was passenger cars, 26% trucks, vans and buses,
and 3% specialized vehicles. During the period 1971-1974, the motor vehicle
fleet grew at an average rate of about 8% p.a. almost in pace with the 9% p.a.
growth of gasoline consumption.
2.04      Togo's road transport industry comprises many small, Togolese
transporters owning one to five passenger cars or trucks; two large foreign
companies which handle petroleum tanker traffic; the Togo railway authority
which operates six buses on the Lome-Kpalime-Atakpame route; and since 1976,
Togo-Route, a joint public-private-company with a monopoly for transit freight
traffic to and from neighboring countries. There are no restrictions on
vehicle importation or entry into the transport business, but this has not
resulted in overcapacity. However, a too rapid acquisition of trucks and
trailers by Togo-Route could lead to over-capacity in the trucking industry
and subsequent Government protection of Togo-Route from direct competition
with private transporters. The Third Highway Project includes a study of
supply and demand of surface transport with the object of recommending neces-
sary measures to avoid over-capacity in transport fleet investment.
2.05      Transport on the feeder road network is either by small private
truckers or, in the case of cash crops, to some extent by a few cooperatives.
Supply is generally adequate with sufficient competition in the transport of
passengers, foodcrops and consumer goods to ensure that most of vehicle
operating cost savings from road improvements will be passed on to the rural
communities. For the transport of cash crops, the savings goes partly to a
few cooperatives which either provide their own transport or purchase produce
directly from the producers at prices fixed independently of transport costs,
and partly to private transporters.
D.   Highway Administration and Maintenance
2.06      The Public Works Department (PWD), within the Ministry of Equipment,
Public Works, Housing, Post and Telecommunications (MEPW), through its Road
Division is responsible for planning, developing and maintaining the primary
and secondary road network. The Road Division has five field subdivisions
comprising 18 sectors. All road equipment is maintained by PWD's equipment



-9-
Division which has its main workshop at Lome and an annex at Sokode. The
Equipment Division has the capacity to service equipment used by other Govern-
ment agencies on feeder roads, and the Government will use the Division for
major repairs of the equipment to be purchased for GDR under the proposed
project.
2.07      Maintenance of the primary and secondary road network has improved
considerably following reorganization of maintenance operations, training of
PWD staff, purchase of equipment and technical assistance provided under the
Highway Maintenance Project and Second Highway Project (Credits 131-TO, US$3.7
million, 1968, and 450-TO, US$8.7 million, 1973, respectively).  More improve-
ment is expected from additional technical assistance and purchase of road
maintenance and workshop equipment provided under the Third Highway Project
(Credit 693-To, US$10.0 million, 1977).
2.08      The administration and development of feeder roads is ill-defined.
It is shared between the Ministry of Interior (MI) through the Circonscrip-
tion, MEPW through the PWD, and MRW through DGR. In addition, other agencies
such as the SRCC and SOTOCO (formerly the SORAD's) all build feeder roads.
Apart from an inefficient use of scarce manpower and other resources, the
proliferation of agencies has resulted in the lack of proper coordination of
feeder road development and a clear strategy for their maintenance.
2.09      To remedy the above situation, the Government has adopted the
following strategy for feeder roads:
(a) to gradually reorganize, strengthen and equip DGR to
assume responsibility for feeder road development and
maintenance; for that purpose a Feeder Road Unit (FRU)
would be created within DGR;
(b) in the short-run to permit agricultural agencies executing
feeder road works to complete their ongoing programs; once
they have been completed, Government intends to transfer
these agencies' road equipment to the DGR. Until DGR
reaches its full maintenance capacity, agricultural
agencies currently engaged in feeder road construction
will maintain these roads during project implementation
as provided for in the IDA-financed Maritime Region Rural
Development Project, the Cotton Areas Rural Development
Project, and the Cocoa-Coffee Development Project;
(c) to develop a feeder roads maintenance program to be
implemented by DGR. This program initially covers about
250 km of feeder roads in a maintainable state, eventually
to be expanded by the 1,000 km included under IDA-financed
agricultural projects and the project roads; and



- 10 -
(d) to establish an Interministerial Technical Working
Group to provide overall policy guidance on project
implementation and to assist in developing and reviewing
annual feeder road programs (para. 3.20).
The Government has confirmed that it will set up a Feeder Road Unit within DGR
not later than July 31, 1978, and agreed on the staffing of the unit.
2.10      DGR has built or maintained feeder roads, but only under the aus-
pices of the regional SORAD's.  Its field staff including engineers, road
technicians, mechanics and equipment operators will, to the largest possible
extent, be retained for the execution of the proposed project. With the
technical assistance and training provided under the project, DGR is expected
to develop gradually the necessary capacity to undertake overall responsibil-
ity for feeder roads. PWD's involvement in the project is expected to: (a)
reduce the initial burden on DGR, thus permitting it to develop its capacity
at a reasonable pace, (b) provide PWD with funds that will permit full use
of its equipment, and (c) assist PWD in increasing its productivity which
is currently too low (para. 3.13).
E.   Road Planning, Engineering and Construction
2.11      PWD is responsible for planning, engineering and constructing roads.
Until recently, road projects were selected on a project-by-project basis
since the Government's efforts were justifiably focussed on improving the
important links in the primary and secondary road network. After this
objective was met, longer-term planning became imperative. Under the Third
Highway Project, technical assistance is being provided to PWD to strengthen
its planning and design unit.
2.12      All major road design is carried out by foreign consultants with
PWD's role restricted to supervision and some soil testing. For feeder roads,
DGR has adequately executed the preliminary engineering and design for the
roads executed by the SORAD's and SRCC. Under the proposed project DGR will
be further strengthened to cope with its expanded engineering responsibilities.
F.   Financing
2.13      Highway investments in the 1971-1975 period were financed from
two sources: (a) multilateral and bilateral aid--European Development Fund
(EDF), 53%; IDA, 13%; and French FAC, 12%; and (b) the investment budget, 22%.
Highway maintenance expenditures are provided almost solely by the general
budget, which also finances minor improvements and small equipment purchases.
2.14      Total investments in primary and secondary roads averaged CFAF 1,700
million (US$7.0 million) per year during 1971-1975. Expenditures for maintenance



- 11 -
and minor improvements of primary and secondary roads increased at an annual
rate of 15%, from CFAF 315 million (US$1.3 million) in 1971 to CFAF 552
million (US$2.2 million) in 1975.
2.15      Expenditures for feeder road improvements are often provided from
general government agency budgets and are difficult to isolate because they
may be part of agricultural projects.  Feeder roads have been financed by
OPAT and the EDF.  Until recently, only about 50 km of feeder roads were
constructed or improved annually at a cost of about CFAF 80 million (US$0.3
million). Maintenance budgets have been small, amounting to about CFAF 30
million (US$120,000) for the circonscriptions, and CFAF 7 million (US$28,000)
for SRCC.
2.16      The cost of routine maintenance per km on newly improved feeder
roads is estimated to be CFAF 50,000 (US$200) per year for Class I roads
and CFAF 30,000 (US$120) for Class II roads (para. 3.02). Since in 1979
DGR should maintain a minimum of 250 km of Class II roads, the cost would
be about US$30,000. In the first year after completion of the project and
when the feeder roads components of the IDA-financed agricultural develop-
ment projects have been completed, a total of 2,250 km of feeder roads
would need routine maintenance at an annual estimated cost of US$300,000.
At negotiations, Government has agreed to provide DGR with the necessary
financing for such maintenance.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   General Discription
3.01      The proposed project consists of:
(a) a four-year program for the improvement and main-
tenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, including
(i) purchase of equipment, spare parts and workshop
tools, (ii) purchase of materials and supplies, and
(iii) construction and repair of culverts and bridges
by local contractors;
(b) technical assistance, consisting of (i) about 77
man-months to establish the Feeder Road Unit within
DGR, to implement the above program, and to train
local staff of the unit in planning, implementing and
monitoring feeder road improvement and maintenance and
(ii) about 10 man-months to improve the effectiveness
of PWD's road brigades; and
(c)  short-term consultant services for studying a follow-up
feeder road program.



- 12 -
B.   Feeder Road Program
3.02      The approximately 1,000 km of feeder roads to be improved and reha-
bilitated were selected from about 4,000 km presented by Government to serve
various ongoing and planned agricultural projects. DGR will be equipped to
improve and maintain 600 km of the project roads while the improvement and
initial maintenance of the remaining 400 km of the more trafficked feeder
roads will be subcontracted to PWD. The proposed improvement and rehabilita-
tion consists of: (a) reshaping, (b) regravelling selected roads sections,
and (c) building, repairing and reinforcing drainage structures. The design
standards for the roads have been chosen as a function of the expected traffic
level over a ten-year period (as shown below):
Feeder Road Design Standards
1.   Existing feeder roads to be improved under the proposed project
are nearly all passable to vehicle traffic during the dry
season as are the majority during the rainy season, though at
much higher vehicle operating costs. The road formation width
varies from 3m to 6m. Under the proposed project, roads would
be given a well-defined cross-section, improved (all weather)
surface, and adequate drainage.
2.   For new or improved roads, two road standards have been deter-
mined based on economic criteria taking into account traffic volume
(vehicles per day and seasonal variations) and composition. The
following standards will be adopted:
Table 1
Class I          Class II
Vehicles per day /a                  >  20              <  20
Clearing (m)                         10-12                7-8
Road formation width (m)               6.5                  5
Gravelled surface width /b (m)         5.5                  4
Thickness of gravel /b (cm)             15                 10
Drainage                            Lateral ditches, culverts and
fords; bridges only where the
size of the river or the volume
of traffic warrants.
/a   The figures which refer to opening year are indicative only,
representing average conditions.
/b   Only to be gravelled where it is required.



- 13 -
Where existing standards are higher than those proposed, they will be re-
tained. Government has agreed to the above standards.
3.03      For the works to be executed by DGR (para. 3.17), a firm work
program for the first year and a proposed second-year program (Table 2, page
14) have been established and tentatively agreed upon with the Government. A
tentative list of roads to be included in the third and fourth-year program is
also shown in Table 2. For the works to be executed by PWD (para. 3.17), a
firm first-year work program has been established and agreed upon with
the Government (Table 3, page 15). The criteria for selecting of the roads to
be included in the first year's program were:
(a) a minimum economic rate of return (ERR) of 10% for
each road; the ERR was based on road-user savings for
those feeder roads with substantial existing traffic
and on road-user savings to non-agricultural traffic,
net incremental agricultural production and reduced
spoilage on existing production for feeder roads with
little or no existing traffic but serving areas
expected to increase production as a result of the
project;
(b) the needs of the agricultural projects supported by
the roads; and
(c) the necessity of geographical coordination to prevent
long travel distances by road brigades.
For the second-, third- and fourth-year programs, the same criteria will
be used.

/a   Design standard see Chapter III, Table 1.
3.04      The project includes maintenance of the roads listed in Table 3
during the project period.  In addition to maintaining the roads after project
completion, the Government through DGR will also have to maintain other
feeder roads. These are expected to total about 250 km by the start of the
project and eventually,be increased by about 1,000 km of feeder roads being
improved and subsequently maintained during the implementation period under
three IDA-financed development projects (Maritime Region, Cotton Areas and
Cocoa-Coffee Projects). The project provides for equipment to maintain the
project roads improved to Class II and the additional 250 km of feeder roads.
When the feeder road components of the above projects have been completed, the
equipment purchased under these will be transferred to DGR. For the roads
improved by PWD the Class I roads will be maintained by PWD to the end of the
project implementation period while the Class II roads will be maintained by
PWD only during the first year after their improvement. Thereafter DGR will
maintain these roads. The minimum acceptable maintenance standards will be as
follows:
(a) roadways will be kept at the width to which they were
constructed with adequate camber to ensure that the roadway
is basically all-weather; pot-holes and larger corrugations
will be eliminated;



- 16 -
(b)  drainage will be kept without obstructions to original
standard or improved to ensure that lateral ditches and
cross-drainage structures are able to carry water to out-
lets or recipients without causing erosion; and
(c)  drainage structures (culverts and bridges), retaining walls
and slope protection will be maintained or improved to ensure
structural soundness and adequate protection against erosion
and scour.
The Government has agreed to take all administrative, technical and financial
steps to maintain (i) the project roads to the defined standard after comple-
tion of the project, and (ii) 250 km of feeder roads not included in the
project from in 1979 eventually to be increased by about 1,000 km of feeder
roads being improved under three ongoing IDA-financed rural development
projects.
C.   Equipment and Materials Purchases
3.05      Since the PWD has sufficient equipment to improve the 400 km that
will be subcontracted to it (para. 3.17), PWD will not be provided with
additional equipment. DGR, on the other hand, has no road equipment. The
proposed project provides for all the equipment and spare parts needed to
operate the different DGR brigades as listed in Table 4. The project also
provides for purchasing materials such as cement, steel and lumber and sup-
plies such as fuel, lubricants and tires.
D.   Technical Assistance and Studies
3.06      Technical assistance (five experts for about 77 man-months) will be
provided under the project to help DGR to:
(a) execute the Feeder Roads Project including:
(i)  assuming responsibility for defining the project's
annual construction, improvement and maintenance
programs;
(ii)  preparing detailed implementation plans, including
the preparation and evaluation of bidding documents
for civil works and equipment;
(iii) implementing such programs;
(iv) supervising the feeder road program contracted to
MEPW; and
(v)  monitoring the engineering, economic and social aspects
of the program;

(b)  gradually assume responsibility for developing a feeder roads
program for the country as a whole by preparing a long-term
strategy for the construction and improvement of the feeder
roads network, including:
(i) determining the appropriate technology to be used;
(ii) identifying the agencies responsible for maintenance of
particular roads;
(iii) estimating the costs of such works and identifying
appropriate sources of financing; and
(iv) preparing an action program for maintenance.
3.07      The consultants would be employed no later than September 30, 1978.
The experts' draft Terms of Reference, qualifications and duration of assign-
ments have been discussed and agreed upon with the Government.
3.08      Ten man-months of technical assistance are provided to strengthen
PWD's activities for the improvement of 400 km of feeder roads under the
project. Funds are also included for short-term consultants (about four
man-months) to supplement the efforts of technical assistance to study a
follow-up feeder road project. The Government has agreed to attach suffi-
ciently qualified local staff and in adequate numbers to the FRU on a full-
time basis.
E.   Training
3.09      The project will provide training for Togolese personnel at all
levels in FRU, including engineers, road technicians, mechanics, brigade
chiefs, foremen, equipment operators and drivers. An initial training program
for the period from September 1978 to beginning 1979 has been prepared by
consultants financed under the Third Highway Project. Training for engineers
and road technicians will be mainly on-the-job since DGR has sufficient staff
in these positions with adequate formal training. Mechanics, foremen and
brigade chiefs will be trained by the technical assistance experts in advance
of the expected arrival of the project equipment in beginning 1979. Existing
DGR equipment supplemented by rented equipment will be used for the training.
Equipment operators and drivers will also be trained by the suppliers of the
equipment to be purchased under the project; bidding documents for equipment
will include this provision. A comprehensive training program will be pre-
pared with the assistance of consultants retained under the proposed project.
The Government has agreed that this program be submitted to the Association
for review and comments no later than December 31, 1978 and thereafter be
implemented taking into account such comments.
F.   Project Monitoring
3.10      The proposed project includes the establishment of a monitoring
system within FRU with the following principal objectives:



- 19 -
(a) to develop the economic, social and engineering aspects of
the project to permit, if necessary, (i) modification of the
project during implementation to maximize its output, and
(ii) design of the follow-up feeder road project to reflect
insights gained from the proposed project;
(b) to permit the assessment of the long-term socio-economic
impact of feeder road improvement in their areas of
influence; and
(c) to test some of the assumptions underlying the engineering
design of the project, including the productivity of
different operations and the appropriateness of the design
standards recommended.
3.11      Project monitoring activities will include:
(a) measuring traffic flow on statistically selected roads to
establish growth and evolution in traffic composition;
(b) for the influence areas of the project roads, collecting
data periodically on (i) the size of population, (ii) agri-
cultural production and the proportion marketed, (iii) evolu-
tion in economic and social fields, and (iv) changes in
farm-gate prices for different commodities;
(c) collecting and updating information on vehicle operating
costs and transport charges on project roads;
(d) evaluating the productivity and costs of PWD and DGR force
account brigades and local contractors mainly engaged in
drainage works;
(e) evaluating the productivity and costs of using alternative
techniques for routine maintenance of feeder road; and
(f) evaluating the quality of works and the rate of deterioration
of project roads in relation to materials used, rainfall,
traffic, and maintenance effort and techniques.
FRU will assemble the results of the monitoring operations. The Government
has agreed to these arrangements.
G.   Cost Estimates
3.12      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$9.1 million,
including US$0.8 million equivalent in taxes and duties. Project costs, net
of taxes and duties, are estimated at US$8.3 million equivalent with a&foreign
exchange cost of US$5.9 million (71%). The following shows project costs (de-
tails of project costs by year is given in Table 5):

3.13      Cost estimates for equipment and tools (Table 4) are based on the
findings of consultants and bids received in 1977 for similar equipment in
Benin. Operating costs of equipment, assuming 180 working days per year, are
for works to be executed by PWD based on cost figures observed under similar,
previous projects taking into account a small increase in productivity which
should be feasible. Slightly lower productivity has been assumed for the
first year for the works to be carried out by DGR and for the following
years DGR is assumed to have about the same productivity as PWD. Since DGR
would pay higher salaries to its personnel than PWD and provide incentives
and bonuses related to performance which PWD is not presently able to provide,
this assumption takes full account of DGR's learning period. The average
costs, net of taxes, but including equipment depreciation and excluding
contingencies for road construction and improvement are as follows:
Road type                               Cost per km
5.5 m roads (Class I)                     US$6,700
4.0 m roads (Class II)                    US$4,200
Access tracks                             US$2,500
3.14      Since the employment conditions make it difficult especially for PWD
to recruit and retain certain key personnel, Government would carry out a
study of employment conditions in PWD, DGR and the private sector. The study
would identify and recommend incentives required to retain competent staff in
PWD and DGR. It would be presented to the Association no later than June 30,
1979 for review and comments; the recommendations would be implemented taking
account of the Association's comments. The Government has agreed to these
arrangements.
3.15      Technical assistance is assumed to be provided by consultants.  The
average man-month cost is estimated at US$7,500 which corresponds to rates
charged by firms working in the region. The billing rate for these services
is estimated at US$5,000 to US$6,000 per field man-month, depending upon the
experts' qualifications, and comprises salaries and overheads (home office
expenses, expatriate allowance, social security, etc.). Reimbursable expenses
payable to consultants, i.e. housing, travel, etc., are estimated at US$1,500
to $2,000 per month. The cost of short-term consultants is estimated at about
US$7,500 per man-month based on the Association's experience with their use
during project preparation and assuming that the experts will be provided by a
consulting firm.
3.16      A quantity contingency allowance of 5% on equipment and spare parts
and 10% on all other items has been included in the cost estimates to allow
for increases in quantities. Provision for future price increases has been
calculated separately in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines as follows:
for equipment and spare parts 7.0% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6.0% thereafter;
for other items, 8% for 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% thereafter. These amount to
about 18% of the total base cost in January 1978 prices.

H.   Execution
3.17      The Ministry of Rural Works, through DGR, will have overall respon-
sibility for execution of the project. However, it will conclude arrangements
through MEPW, for PWD, to improve about 400 km of selected project roads and
to carry out major repairs of the road equipment to be used for the project.
In addition PWD will, for these roads, maintain the Standard I roads during
the four-year project period and the Standard II roads during one year follow-
ing their improvement. Thereafter they will be maintained by DGR. DPW has
the necessary equipment and manpower to carry out this maintenance for which
MEPW would be paid under their contract with MRW. Signing of a contract
between MRW and MEPW will be a condition of effectiveness of the Development
Credit Agreement.
3.18      Physical execution of the project is scheduled to commence in
October 1978 for the PWD road brigades and March 1979 for the DGR brigades,
and be completed by end of 1982 in accordance with the implementation schedule
shown below. The Government has agreed to this schedule. Road improvement
and maintenance will be carried out by force account; local contractors will
be used to construct some drainage structures and supply road-building materials.



- 24 -
3.19      Various mixes of labor and equipment for the improvement of feeder
roads have been examined. The conclusion is that the scope for use of labor-
based technologies is limited because of little availability of unemployed
labor in several areas, the nature of the works, and the higher economist
costs. Consequently the road construction under the project will be executed
as follows:
DGR Roads (600 km):  Two feeder road construction
brigades will be formed to build these roads: one
"heavy" to be used where heavy clearing or signi-
ficant earthworks have to be done and one "inter-
mediate" to be used elsewhere. DGR will execute
the necessary surveys and engineering.
PWD Roads (400 km):  These will be built by the existing PWD
road betterment and regravelling units according to an agreed
program with DGR and the Association. DGR will approve the
design standards and supervise construction.
For the maintenance of feeder roads DGR will establish a maintenance brigade
equipped under the project (para. 3.04 and Table 4). As one of its tasks,
FRU will define a long-term strategy for equipment-labour utilization in
improvement and maintenance works (para. 3.06).
3.20      The roads to be improved during the first year have been agreed
upon. The list of roads for the subsequent years will be proposed annually by
the DGR and reviewed and approved by an Interministerial Technical Working
Group (ITWG) to be organized with representatives from MEPW and the Ministries
of Planning, Finance, Rural Works, Equipment, and Rural Development as well as
important national and regional agencies with a direct interest in feeder
roads. The lists would then be submitted to the Association for approval
three months before the scheduled start of works for that year's program.
During negotiations, Government has agreed to the above procedure for road
selection and to establish the ITWG not later than February 28, 1978.
I.   Procurement
3.21      Equipment, vehicles, materials, and supplies amounting to about
US$2.0 million (net of taxes) will be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. These items
will be bulked to the extent possible to make them suitable for international
competitive bidding. Goods manufactured in Togo would be allowed a preference
equal to 15% of the c.i.f. price on imported goods or prevailing duties
generally applied to imports, whichever is lower. Contracts for equipment,
materials and supplies costing under US$50,000 may be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding following local procedures acceptable to the Association.
The aggregate amount of such purchases would not exceed US$400,000. Contracts
for the construction of drainage structures totalling about US$200,000 will
follow local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association.
Consultants for technical assistance and for the feeder road follow-up study
will be employed in agreement with and under terms of reference and conditions
satisfactory to the Association. The above arrangements have been agreed to
by the Government.

J.   Financing and Disbursements
3.22               The proposed credit of US$5.8 million will finance about 69% of
total project costs net of taxes, i.e. all foreign costs with the exception
of those for maintenance. Government will finance local costs of US$2.4
million and foreign costs of US$0.2 million. Taxes and duties are estimated
at US$0.8 million 1/. The financing plan of the project is shown below.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
4.01      Growth in Togo's agricultural sector, which contributes about 30% of
GDP and 40% of total export earnings, has stagnated over the past five years
due to inadequate investments, lack of effective institutions to program and
implement agricultural programs, and to generally poor accessibility to exist-
ing and potential production areas. To remedy the situation, the Government
has (a) allocated about 22% of total planned investments under the Third Plan
to speed restoration and expansion of agricultural production, (b) established
several crop-related agencies and cooperatives to implement agricultural
investment programs (para. 1.12) and (c) started feeder road improvement
as a part of a few specific integrated agricultural projects. However, in
existing productive farm areas outside these projects, poor feeder roads and
consequent high transport costs and unreliability contribute to low farmgate
prices for foodcrops, excessive spoilage and some farmers' reluctance to use
fertilizers and insecticides. The planning, development and maintenance of
feeder roads, on the other hand, demand an efficient, well-staffed organiza-
tion in order to carefully plan and to ensure adequate maintenance of the
investments made. This need is not being satisfied under the current piece-
meal effort. The objectives of the proposed project are, therefore, (a) to
establish an efficient institutional framework for planning, developing and
maintaining feeder roads, (b) to train local staff to perform the above
functions, and (c) to provide adequate resources for the construction and
subsequent maintenance of 1,000 km of high priority feeder roads.
4.02      The institution-building component of the project represents a major,
if unquantifiable, benefit. It will create within the DGR the capacity for
the proper planning and execution of feeder road improvement and maintenance
thereby helping to achieve the project's goals and reducing the waste of
resources. The training component will result in increased capacity for local
staff at all levels to handle feeder road responsibilities and will decrease
the need for technical assistance in follow-up projects. The project will
also initiate a coordinated interministerial/interagency approach to planning
feeder roads.
B.   Economic Justification
4.03      The economic justification of the proposed project derives from
its role in reducing transport costs and produce spoilage in the areas of the
project roads, contributing toward the expansion of agricultural production
and in institution-building.
Feeder Road Program
4.04      The economic justification of the project roads addresses the
following:

(a)  the justification of the specific roads included in the
first-year program;
(b)  the justification of the entire four-year program; and
(c)  criteria for selecting roads for the second and later years'
programs.
In the economic justification economic costs and benefits have been used
without shadow pricing of labour or foreign expenditures.
4.05      The road-by-road justification for the first-year program has been
analyzed using as benefits (a) road-user savings and (b) reduced produce
spoilage. Benefits from induced increased agricultural production were as-
sumed insignificant since these roads, even in their present state, provide
access between farm areas and the main road network. Estimates of traffic
and vehicle operating costs used for calculating road-user savings were
based on the findings of a short-term consultant who visited Togo in October
1976 to update a detailed study by consultants BCEOM in 1975. Average
traffic on the first-year roads ranges between 11 and 26 vehicles per
day (vpd); a reduction in vehicle operating costs ranging between 25% and 50%
is expected to result from the road improvements. No direct measurements were
made on the reduction in produce spoilage. However, based on suggestions by
TOGOFRUITS, SOTOCO and SRCC and depending on current road condition, up to 4%
of total annual production has been used. In 1980, the total savings in
vehicle operating cost savings would amount to about US$200,000 and the
reduction in spoilage to about US$50,000. A population of 48,000 would be
directly affected by the first-year road improvements. A sensitivity analysis
on the economic rates of return (ERR), assuming no reduced spoilage, indicates
that all the first-year roads still have ERR exceeding 11%. A summary of the
ERR's for the first-year roads and a sample calculation for a typical road are
attached in Annex I.
4.06      The justification for the second-, third- and fourth-year roads
followed a similar procedure to the above except that induced increases in
agricultural production were important, generally for those roads requiring
new construction or considerable reconstruction. Moreover, except for the
first-year roads, the data base used for the analysis was very coarse; for
each district, recorded average yields per farm for various farm products were
used to estimate induced production and reduced spoilage. This is quite
acceptable in view of the tentative nature of the road lists beyond the first
year of implementation and the high costs and delays inevitable with collect-
ing more detailed data which might in any case be useless should the road
lists change appreciably. Further, the built-in, more detailed justification
for the annual programs and the criteria for selecting roads beyond the
first-year (para. 4.07) should eliminate any risk of unacceptable project
return. On the basis of (a) road user cost savings to non-agricultural
traffic, (b) reduced produce spoilage and (c) induced increases in agricul-
tural production, the economic rate of return for the project over its 10-year



- 29 -
estimated economic life is 18% 1/. This return should be considered only
indicative of a range estimate between 12% and 24% as shown by the following
results of the sensitivity analysis:
ERR
(a)  Best Estimate                         18.0%
(b)  Project Cost +20%                     13.6%
(c) Best Estimate-Induced
Agricultural Production              11.9%
(d)  Project Benefits -20%                 11.9%
(e)  Project Cost -20%                     23.9%
(f)  Project Benefits +20%                22.8%
(g)  Project Cost +10% and
Project Benefits -10%               13.0%
Criteria for Selecting Roads after First-Year Project
4.07      The criteria for selecting roads to be included in the second,
third and fourth years' programs will be:
(a)  Economic Rate of Return (ERR):  Roads will be ranked
according to their ERR. An economic rate of return of
at least 10% is required for a road section to be included
under the program. The ERR will be based on the following
quantifiable benefits depending upon the road type as
follows:
Category I: This includes roads in areas of existing sub-
stantial agricultural activity. The ERR will be based on
road-user savings and reduced produce spoilage.
Category II: This includes roads other than those in
Category I. The ERR will be based on the sum of (i) road-user
savings to non-agricultural traffic, (ii) net value-added to
incremental agricultural production (considering also the
complementary costs on the agricultural side), and (iii)
benefits from reduced produce spoilage.
(b)  Needs of Agricultural Program:  Subject to the 10% ERR
cut-off rate above, inclusion of roads in the annual programs
will consider the needs of agricultural programs being
executed or planned in Togo. Thus, for example, a road
needed for access to a central seed farm or to an extension
center may be included in the program in preference to one
with a higher ERR calculated by the methods prescribed under
(a) above.
1/   By 1984 the benefits from the road improvements would amount to
US$450,000 for (a); US$90,000 for (b); and US$95,000 and for (c).



- 30 -
(c) Geographical Coordination of Brigades: Subject to the cri-
teria under (a) and (b) above, inclusion of roads in the annual
programs will take into consideration the geographical coDrdi-
nation of the road brigades to prevent long travel distances.
4.08      The list of roads included in the tentative second-, third- and
fourth-years' programs will be used as a basis for selecting roads, but roads
not included in these lists will be considered if warranted by government
plans for agricultural development.
Distribution of Project Benefits
4.09      The distribution of project benefits will depend on (a) the Govern-
ment's policy on producer prices for food and cash crops, and (b) the extent
of competition in the transport industry. Under prevailing differential
between farmgate prices and f.o.b. for various produce (Annex I, Table 2) and
the level of competition in the trucking industry (para. 2.04 and 2.05),
approximately one-third of the benefits of increased cash crop production --
mostly cocoa, coffee and cotton -- will accrue to farmers OPAT and the
Government will share the remaining benefits; the farmers will eventually
recuperate some of the latters' benefits through subsidies, improved agri-
cultural services and ploughback of feeder road maintenance funds. With
regard to food crops, farmers will capture most of the benefits through both
selling more and enjoying a higher producer price, given the competitiveness
of the trucking industry; transporters and exporters will share the rest.
Benefits from reduced transport costs to passengers and non-agricultural goods
will be shared by the communities in the project area, the transporters and
the traders.
Project Risk
4.10      The main risk associated with the project would be DGR's failure to
develop the necessary capacity to execute the project on schedule. This makes
staff training and retention and the quality of technical assistance critical.
The Government's strong commitment to these will be sought during negotia-
tions. These items will also be monitored closely during project imple-
mentation. A minor risk of political interference with the selection of the
roads for the annual programs is expected to be alleviated by the guidelines
agreed to by the Government for justifying roads selected in the annual
programs (para. 4.07).
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations the following items were discussed and
agreed upon with Government:
(a) the creation of a Feeder Road Unit within DGR no later than
July 31, 1978 (para. 2.09);
(b) the feeder road design standards outlined in Chapter III,
except where otherwise agreed by the Association (para. 3.02);



- 31 -
(c) the first year's road program and the arrangements for estab-
lishing the subsequent annual programs including the guidelines
for selecting individual roads (paras. 3.03, 3.20 and 4.07);
(d) the Government will take all administrative, technical and
financial steps necessary to maintain (i) the project roads to an
agreed and acceptable standard after completion of the project,
and (ii) 250 km feeder roads not included in the project and
another 1,000 km included in IDA-financed development projects
after their completion (paras. 2.16 and 3.04);
(e) the Government will employ consultants for technical
assistance (not later than September 30, 1978) and studies
under terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the
Association (paras. 3.06, 3.07, 3.08 and 3.21);
(f) the Government will recruit and assign adequate staff to
the Feeder Road Unit to be trained by the technical assistance
staff (paras. 3.08 and 3.09);
(g) a training program will be submitted to the Association for
review and comment no later than December 31, 1978, and
thereafter implemented taking into account such comments
(para. 3.09);
(h) a study of employment conditions for key staff in PWD, DGR
and the private sector be carried out and presented to the
Association no later than June 30, 1979, identifying and
recommending incentives required to retain competent staff
in PWD and DGR; thereafter taking appropriate action to im-
plement recommendations taking into account the Association's
comments (3.14);
(i) the implementation schedule and the arrangements for monitoring
the project (paras. 3.10, 3.11 and 3.18);
(j) that Government would create an Interministerial Technical
Working Group no later than February 28, 1979 to propose
annual lists of roads to be improved; such lists would be
submitted to IDA three months before the start of works for
that year's program (para. 3.20);
(k) that arrangements for procurement will be on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines if not otherwise agreed between the
Government and the Association (para. 3.21).



- 32 -
5.02      A condition of credit effectiveness is that a contract is signed
between MRW and MEPW. The contract would specify that MEPW improve and main-
tain 400 km of project roads and carry out major repair to DGR equipment
procured under the project.
5.03      Provided that agreement is reached with Government on the items
mentioned in paragraph 5.01, the proposed project would be suitable for a
Credit to the Republic of Togo in the amount of US$5.8 million on standard
IDA terms.
