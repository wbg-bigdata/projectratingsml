Project Summary
Borrower:              The Republic of Togo
Amount:                US$5.8 million

Description:          lish an efficient institutional framework for planning,
executing and maintaining feeder roads in support of
agricultural development would include: (a) a four-year
program for the construction and improvement of about
1,000 km of feeder roads; (b) technical assistance to
establish a Feeder Roads Unit within the Department of
Rural Works to implement the above program and train
local staff (87 man-months); and (c) a study of a fol-
low-up feeder road program (4 man-months). Some of the
quantifiable benefits expected to result from the road
improvements are reduced vehicle operating costs,
reduced produce spoilage and induced increases in agri-
cultural production. Institution building represents
a major, if unquantifiable benefit. About one-third of
the benefits from increased cash crop production are
expected to accrue to farmers and the Government while
most benefits resulting from increased foodcrop produc-
tion will go to farmers. Benefits from reduction in
transport costs are expected to be shared by trans-
porters, traders and the local communities. About
48,000 people live in the project area. The main risk
associated with the project would be the failure of
the project's executing agency to develop the capacity
to execute the project on schedule.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed dev-
elopment credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of US$5.8 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a feeder roads project in Togo.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a-TO "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30, 1974.
A basic economic mission visited Togo in March/April 1976, and the report
is being discussed with the Government. Some of the report's findings are
incorporated below. Annex I contains basic country data.
Economic Performance
3.        Togo's long-term annual average growth of GNP per capita in real
terms was about 4 percent during 1960-76. From 1960 to 1970, GNP growth in
real terms was steady, averaging some 6 percent yearly. The sustained expan-
sion of Togo's economy was due mostly to a vigorous expansion of phosphate
exports at favorable prices and also to good market conditions for cocoa and
coffee exports. With its low-tariff structure -- a legacy from trusteeship
days -- Togo developed into an important regional commercial and trade center.
Between 1965 and 1970, Togolese exports increased by 22 percent a year in
current prices. During this same period, imports -- particularly of consumer
goods, of which a high percentage were subsequently re-exported -- also rose
sharply. The 1970's brought some reduction in the real growth rate of the
economy, as a result of slow growth in agriculture and fluctuations in phos-
phate production. However, sparked by generally buoyant domestic demand,
construction and services continued their rapid rise. Togo's population in
1976 is estimated at 2.3 million and GNP per capita at $260.
4.        Although substantial progress was made in developing industry and
tourism during the second five year development plan (1971-75), economic
performance in Togo still depends preponderantly on the export of phosphate,
cocoa and coffee, which together account for about 80 percent of export
receipts. Phosphate production expanded steadily from 1.5 million tons in
1970 to 2.6 million tons in 1974. In 1974, there was a favorable shift in
Togo's terms of trade, reflecting a threefold increase in world market prices
for phosphate. Subsequently, in 1975, world prices declined sharply; output
fell from 2.6 to 1.2 million tons and phosphate export earnings fell from
CFAF 38 billion to CFAF 16.5 billion. Since then, phosphate production has
recovered to 2.0 million tons in 1976 and 2.8 million tons in 1977, and export



earnings in 1977 are estimated to be about CFAF 24.0 billion. Cocoa and
coffee exports fluctuated during the 1970's with no discernible trend, averag-
ing about 16,000 tons and 9,000 tons per year respectively. But high world
prices in the 1977 and 1978 crop years have yielded record export earnings and
stabilization fund surpluses.
Financial Developments
5.        Prior to the 1974 phosphate boom, Togo's financial and investment
policies were generally prudent and well adapted to the smallness and open-
ness of the economy and to its dependence on a few primary commodities for
foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues. Total public expenditure
was commensurate with the availability of domestic and foreign financial
resources, and the Government maintained adequate reserves in the form both
of deposits with the banking system and net foreign assets. Public invest-
ments tended to be concentrated in infrastructure, education and health ser-
vices, while private investment was channeled to industry, trade and tourism.
However, development of agriculture tended to lag mainly because of institu-
tional bottlenecks and the vagaries of weather. Foreign financial and tech-
nical assistance on concessionary terms was forthcoming from a variety of
donors, and the debt service burden was negligible.
6.        During the 1973-76 period, the current budgetary receipts of
the Treasury grew from CFAF 12 billion to CFAF 38 billion, or by an annual
average rate of 49 percent. In 1975 and 1976, however, phosphate export
receipts lagged behind expectations, while the Government was engaged in an
expansionary policy. Since then, the Government has found itself progres-
sively in need of budgetary resources additional to those derived from phos-
phate. In 1976 the agricultural marketing and stabilization agency (OPAT)
considerably increased its contribution to the budget, transferring almost all
of its net profits after having paid its regular corporate profit tax. Total
Government expenditure, including current and investment expenditures, grew
from CFAF 13 billion in 1973 to CFAF 50 billion in 1976. Current budgetary
expenditure grew by almost 50 percent every year and investment expenditure
quintupled in three years. As a consequence, the overall deficit rose from
CFAF 3 billion in 1974 to CFAF 12 billion in 1976, financed by the use of
Central Bank credit, accumulated cash balance by the Togolese Phosphate
Agency (OTP) and the accumulation of arrears. In 1977 and 1978, the rate of
growth of budgeted expenditures was substantially reduced to about 9 percent
per year. Due to the rapid achievement of production capacity in phosphates
and record world market prices for cocoa and coffee in 1977/78, surpluses of
the marketing agencies for these products will add substantially to Central
Government revenues. However, with the real growth of phosphate over the next
three years limited by existing mining capacity and with a possible decline in
cocoa and coffee prices, Government financial equilibrium is unlikely to
be restored without reductions in Central Government expenditures.



-3-
The 1976-80 Development Plan
7.        The 1976-80 Development Plan assesses the physical and institutional
bottlenecks in future growth with considerable realism, although financial
targets have had to be revised in the light of recent price movements. The
Government's strategy is to further diversify the economy and exploit natural
resources, to rehabilitate and expand both food and cash crops production, to
further improve the country's infrastructure in order to lay the ground for
new, directly productive investments and to promote international regional
cooperation. A longer term development policy gives emphasis to equity and
employment, including basic education reform, rural development programs and
extension of the feeder roads network, promotion of small and medium-scale
indigenous enterprises. However, in the past two years of the current plan
period, the largest share of investable resources has gone to industrial
development and tourism, including the construction of the CIMAO clinker
plant, an oil refinery, a scrap steel mill and two large hotels.
Economic and Financial Prospects
8.        Despite the severity of the public finance situation, real growth
and employment in the plan period will be stimulated by high investment
demand with substantial effects on construction and services. However, phos-
phate production and agricultural production will remain constrained in the
medium term and the rapid real growth achieved in the first two years of the
1976-80 Plan is not likely to be sustained. The 50 percent domestic con-
tribution to total investment experienced during the second plan period is
also not likely to be repeated in the current plan period. This is due to the
lower level of phosphate prices and the much higher level of total public
expenditure including budgeted debt service, which rose from CFAF 1.0 billion
in 1974 to 8.0 billion in 1977 and 1978, or 15 percent of total budget ex-
penditure. During 1971-1974 aid to Togo was provided on soft terms, with
grants accounting for about half the capital inflow. The European Development
Fund, the Federal Republic of Germany, and France were the major donors. More
recently, although official development assistance has been maintained, the
share of suppliers' credits and commercial borrowing has risen sharply. As
of December 31, 1976, the country's external public debt outstanding and un-
disbursed amounted to $167 million. Average debt service payments (including
short-term debt service) which amounted to about 4 percent of exports from
1971 to 1975, rose to about 19 percent in 1976 and are likely to remain at
that level over the next few years.
9.        In view of the country's low per capita income, the growing need
for external funding of priority projects in an expanding economy, and Togo's
exposure to widely fluctuating world market conditions, the major part of
foreign financing necessary to sustain economic growth should continue to
be provided on concessionary terms. Because Togo is expected to be able to
finance about 30 percent of its public investment program, foreign donors
should continue to provide on the average at least 70 percent of total project
costs including -- in appropriate cases -- some financing of local costs.



-4-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
10.       To date the Bank Group has extended six credits to Togo amounting
to US$51.9 million and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo and one of US$49.5
million to CIMAO). Three of the credits were for highway construction and
maintenance and three for agricultural projects. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank Group operations in Togo as of March 31, 1978, as well as
notes on the execution of the projects.
11.       The Highway Maintenance Project, the Bank Group's first lending
operation in Togo, was satisfactorily completed in November 1973. The Second
Highway Project evolved from preinvestment studies financed under the first
project and provided for the construction or upgrading of three highways and
the continuation of the maintenance program. This project is progressing
satisfactorily although, due to inflation, the scope of the road construction
component had to be reduced in 1976. The Third Highway Project which became
effective last September has, as its main objective, the improvement of two
important roads serving mainly agricultural areas, and the continuation of the
efforts begun under the two previous highway projects to build up an efficient
road maintenance service.
12.       The first agricultural project for which a credit was approved in
1974, covers part of a long-range program for the development of the Plateau
Region's coffee and cocoa potential. This project, which includes the plant-
ing and maintenance of 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee, is proceed-
ing well. The second agricultural credit, which was approved in June, 1976,
provides financing for a rural development project in the Maritime Region
geared primarily to increase foodcrop production and to provide support
services and rural infrastructure for 20,000 farm families.  Project implemen-
tation has begun on schedule. The third and most recent agricultural credit
which was approved by the Board last October supports a 5-year program to
increase cotton and foodcrop production by introducing improved cotton growing
techniques and encouraging cropping patterns in which foodcrops would benefit
from the residual effects of fertilizers applied to cotton.
13.       Togo is the host to the CIMAO project, one of the largest inter-
national industrial ventures so far undertaken in West Africa. Implementation
of this US$284 million clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other
official aid agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily.
14.       Present Bank Group disbursements account for about 10 percent of
Togo's disbursed and outstanding public debt (as of early 1978).  Service
payments to the Bank Group which are now less than 1 percent of total debt
service will remain at about this level over the medium-term. The future
lending program will include a follow-up agricultural project in the Plateau
Region, a rural development project, an education project, a highway project,
a DFC project and a second phase of the CIMAO project.



-5-
PART III - THE SECTOR
Agricultural Background
15.       Agriculture is vital to the Togolese economy.  It employs some
75 percent of the active population and provides nearly 40 percent of the
country's total export earnings.
16.       Togo's approximately 300,000 farm families work holdings that
average 2.5 ha. Cultivation is usually done by traditional techniques and
yields are low. Yams, maize, rice and sorghum account for over 80 percent
of agricultural output, the bulk of which is for subsistence. The main
export crops are cocoa and coffee (which together account for 75 percent of
agricultural exports), cotton, groundnuts, and copra. GDP per capita in the
rural sector is low, less than US$100.
17.       Responsibility for the agricultural sector is shared by two minis-
tries: the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and the Ministry of Rural
Works (MRW). The former is concerned with policy formulation and coordination
of production activities and the latter with rural infrastructure development
and support services, including rural engineering through the Rural Works
Department (Direction du Genie Rural, DGR). Responsibility for the planning
of rural projects rests with the Ministry of Plan.   Recently, the Government
established several cash crop-oriented autonomous agencies with responsibili-
ties ranging from supply of inputs and provision of extension services to
rural engineering, credit distribution, marketing and processing, such as
the Societe pour la Renovation du Cacao et du Cafe (SRCC) for cocoa and cof-
fee, and the Societe Togolaise du Coton (SOTOCO) for cotton. At the end of
1977, the Societes Regionales d'Amenagement et de Developpement (SORADs) which
were responsible for regional development were dissolved and replaced by
organizations more specifically oriented towards foodcrop production: the
Organismes Regionaux de Promotion et de Production des Cultures Vivrieres
(ORPVs).
18.       Growth of the agriculture sector has lagged behind the rest of the
economy. While GDP growth in real terms averaged 6 percent from 1960 to 1975,
agricultural production increased by only 3 percent per year. Agricultural
exports stagnated due to the Government's neglect of the agricultural sector
in the 1960's (both in terms of investments and in establishing effective
institutions), agro-climatic constraints, and socio-political obstacles such
as local overpopulation in some regions, migration and poor roads.
19.       In recent years, however, the Government has been increasingly
aware of the importance of the agricultural sector in the country's economic
development. The Third Development Plan (1976-80), which allocates 22 percent
of planned investments to agriculture, calls for substantial improvements in
agricultural performance both for industrial crops and foodcrops. For indus-
trial crops, the Government's objective is to restore traditional exports.
A major program for coffee and cocoa rehabilitation started in 1974 with IDA
assistance and should yield results by the end of the decade. A follow-up
project is under preparation. A five-year cotton development program supported



-6-
by IDA and The French Fonds D'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) has just begun.
There is scope for rehabilitation of traditional copra production, and pos-
sibilities for development of other products such as oil palm, sugar cane,
tobacco and cashew nuts are being examined. For foodcrops, the Government
hopes to slow down food imports and reach self-sufficiency in the eighties
through the improvement of yields and expansion of cropped areas. Recent
increases in official farmgate prices for export crops, higher producer prices
for foodcrops resulting from increased urban demand, improved credit and
support facilities for organized farmers, and easier access to markets should
help achieve these objectives.
The Transport System
20.       Togo's transport system consists of about 7,400 km of roads, 436 km
of railway, a deep water port, a phosphate wharf, an international airport
and five airstrips. Road transport is the predominant mode. The network is
most dense in the south. The country's two most important roads, which extend
from Lome north to the Upper Volta border (717 km) and east to the Benin
border (48 km), are paved, except for the last 200 km to the Upper Volta
border. Also, some 590 km of secondary roads are paved. The rest of the
primary and secondary networks (about 1,200 km) are all-weather gravel or
laterite roads. An estimated 5,000 km are mostly dry-weather feeder roads
and tracks.
The Road Transport Industry
21.       Togo's road transport industry comprises:  many small Togolese
transporters who own one to five passenger cars or trucks; two large foreign
companies which handle petroleum tanker traffic; the Togo railway which oper-
ates 6 passenger buses on the Lome-Palime-Atakpame route; and, since 1976,
Togo-Route, a semi-public company which is authorized to engage in inter-
national and domestic transport of both passenger and cargo, but has so far
limited its intervention to international cargo traffic. There are no re-
strictions on vehicle importation or entry in the transport business. The
Third Highway Project includes a study of current and future supply and demand
of transport with the objective of recommending measures to avoid overinvest-
ment in transport capacity. Transport on the feeder road network is handled
either by small private truckers or, in the case of cash crops, by coopera-
tives. The supply of transport is generally adequate with sufficient com-
petition between operators to ensure that most of the vehicle operating cost
savings from road improvements under the proposed project would be passed on
to the producer.
Highway Administration
22.       The Roads Division of the Public Works Department (PWD) of the
Ministry of Equipment, Public Works, Housing, Post and Telecommunications
(MEPW) is responsible for the planning, engineering, construction and main-
tenance of the primary and secondary road networks. The Roads Division has
five field subdivisions comprising 18 sections. All road equipment is main-
tained by PWD's Equipment Division in its main workshop at Lome and in an



- 7 -
annex up-country at Sokode. The Equipment Division has the capacity to
service equipment used on feeder roads by other Government agencies.
23.       Serious efforts to improve maintenance of the primary and secondary
road network began in 1968 under the First Highway Project, but fell short of
expectations (Project Performance Audit Report of June 24, 1977). This was
due primarily to an inappropriate diversion of maintenance resources and an
overestimation at appraisal of the quality of PWD staff and of the number of
counterparts available to consultants. However, the project provided the
basis for a Second Highway Project under which maintenance of primary and
secondary roads improved considerably following reorganization of maintenance
operations and training of PWD staff. This action is to be continued under
the Third Highway Project.
24.       Responsibility for the development and maintenance of feeder roads
is shared among three ministries - Interior, Equipment and Public Works,
and Rural Works, plus other agencies such as SRCC, SOTOCO and ORPVs. Coor-
dination between these agencies is poor and both planning and maintenance
suffer as a result. To remedy the situation, the Government intends to
reorganize and equip the Rural Works Department (Direction du Genie Rural,
DGR) of the Ministry of Rural Works, which presently carries out preliminary
engineering and design of feeder roads, to assume full responsibility for
feeder road development and maintenance. As a first step, the Government
would establish a Feeder Roads Unit within DGR under the proposed project.
25.       Employment conditions make it difficult to recruit and retain key
personnel in PWD and this could also apply to DGR. The Government has there-
fore agreed to undertake a study of employment conditions in PWD, DGR and the
private sector. The Government would discuss the study's recommendations with
the Association not later than June 30, 1979, and implement them thereafter
(Development Credit Agreement Section 3.01 (k)).
Financing
26.       Highway investments in the primary and secondary road networks
averaged US$7.0 million per year during the 1971-75 period, and were mostly
financed by the European Economic Community, IDA and the French Fonds d'Aide
et de Cooperation. Highway maintenance expenditures increased from $1.3 mil-
lion in 1971 to $2.2 million in 1975 and are provided almost solely by the
general budget which also finances minor improvements and small equipment
purchases. The level of these expenditures would be adequate, if the funds
were limited to financing mostly maintenance activities rather than major
betterment works as has been the case.
27.       Expenditures for feeder roads improvement are financed by the
Central Government budget, the agricultural product marketing and price
stabilization agency (OPAT), the European Economic Community and IDA. Main-
tenance expenditures have been small amounting to about $150,000 in 1976.
The cost of maintenance ranges between $120 and $200 per km. The total cost
of maintaining a network of 2,250 km of feeder roads (including the 1,000 km
of the proposed project), which is envisaged for 1982, would amount to
$300,000 per year. The Government will provide the necessary funds.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The project is described in detail in the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 1944-TO, dated May 2, 1978 and summarized at the beginning of this report.
Annex III contains supplementary Project data. The project is based in part
on a study financed by IDA under the Second Highway Project and carried out by
the French consultants BCEOM. Appraisal took place in July 1977 followed by a
post-appraisal mission in December, 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington
in April 1978. The Togolese delegation was led by His Excellency Mr. M. Kekeh,
Togolese Ambassador to the United States, and included representatives of the
Ministries of Planning, Finance, and Rural Works.
Project Description
29.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) a four-year program for the improvement and maintenance
of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, including purchase
of equipment, spare parts, workshop tools, materials
and supplies, and construction and repair of culverts
and bridges;
(b) technical assistance to establish the Feeder Roads Unit
within the Rural Works Department of the Ministry of
Rural Works, to implement the above program, to train
local staff and to improve the effectiveness of the
Public Works Department road brigades; and
(c) short-term consultant services for studying a follow-up
feeder roads program.
30.       The 1,000 km of roads to be improved were selected from about 4,000
km serving ongoing or planned agricultural projects. The proposed improve-
ments would consist of reshaping and regravelling selected road sections, and
building and repairing drainage structures. Road design standards have been
agreed upon with the Government (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.01
(h) and Schedule 4).
31.       In order to provide the necessary flexibility in planning and
executing the feeder roads program, only the first year program has been
defined in advance. The programs for the subsequent years would be prepared
annually by DGR and reviewed by an Interministerial Technical Working Group
which the Government has agreed to set up before February 28, 1979. The Group
would include representatives from the Ministries of Planning, Finance, Rural
Development, Rural Works, Equipment and Public Works as well as important
national and regional agencies with a direct interest in feeder roads. The
programs would be submitted to the Association for approval three months
before the works are scheduled to start. Assurances as to all of the above
have been obtained from the Government (Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.01 (c), (d),(e) and (f)).

32.       The Ministry of Rural Works through DGR would have overall respon-
sibility for the execution of the project. The Government has agreed to
establish not later than July 31, 1978 a Feeder Roads Unit within DGR (Devel-
opment Credit Agreement, Section 3.01(g)). However, DGR would carry out the
improvement of only 600 km of roads. The remaining 400 km would be subcon-
tracted by DGR to PWD. This arrangement would have the double advantage of
not overburdening DGR at an early stage of its expansion and increasing the
presently low productivity of PWD's equipment. The signing of a contract
satisfactory to the Association between DGR and PWD for PWD to carry out this
work and for its Equipment Division to maintain DGR's equipment would be a
condition of credit effectiveness (Development Credit Agreement, Sections
3.01(b) and 5.01).
33.       DGR would maintain the 600 km of roads that it would improve.  In
addition it would maintain 250 km of priority roads, which would eventually
be increased to 1,250 km to include the feeder roads already financed by IDA
in agricultural projects. The equipment purchased under these projects would
be progressively transferred to DGR. PWD would maintain the more heavily used
of the roads that it would improve during the project implementation period,
but it would transfer the maintenance of the less trafficked roads to DGR
after the first year.
34.       Physical execution of the project is scheduled to start in October
1978 for the PWD road brigades and March 1979 for the DGR brigades, and be
completed by December 1982 in accordance with an implementation schedule dis-
cussed with the Government during project appraisal.
35.       The possibility of using various mixes of labor and equipment for
the improvement work has been examined. The conclusion is that there is
little scope for use of labor-based technologies because of the limited
availability of unemployed labor in several areas, the nature of the works and
the higher economic costs. Consequently, improvement works would be carried
out as follows: DGR would employ one fully mechanized brigade where heavy
clearing or significant earthworks have to be done, and one intermediate
brigade elsewhere. PWD roads would be built by the existing PWD road better-
ment and regravelling units. The technology and plan of action for the
execution of maintenance works would be defined by the Feeder Roads Unit. DGR
would be provided with a maintenance road brigade to maintain priority feeder
roads and those improved under IDA credits.
36.       The primary function of the technical assistance for DGR (5 experts
for 77 man-months) would be to establish the Feeder Roads Unit, train local
staff, and assist the Unit in developing a strategy for both improvement and
maintenance of the roads, in defining annual programs and in preparing detailed
plans for their execution; it would also assist the unit with preparation of
bidding documents, procurement and supervision. Training would be provided
for the Unit personnel at all levels, including engineers, road technicians,
mechanics, brigade chiefs, foremen, equipment operators and drivers. The Gov-
ernment has agreed to prepare and submit by December 31, 1978 to the Associa-
tion for comments a comprehensive training program to be implemented promptly
thereafter (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.01 (j)).

37.       Ten additional man-months of technical assistance are provided to
strengthen PWD activities for the improvement of the feeder roads under the
proposed project. Funds are also included for short-term consultants (about
4 man-months) to supplement the efforts of technical assistance to study a
follow-up project. The Government has agreed to employ on or before Sept-
ember 30, 1978 experts whose qualifications, experience and conditions of
employment are satisfactory to the Association, and to attach local staff to
the Feeder Roads Unit (Development Credit Agreement, Sections 3.02 and 3.01
(i)). The proposed study for the follow-up project would be completed not
later than September 30, 1981 (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.01(a)).
38.       The economic, social and engineering aspects of the project would
have to be monitored closely by the Feeder Roads Unit to permit, if necessary,
modification of the project during implementation to improve its effectiveness,
to assess the long-term socio-economic impact of the program and to test some
of the assumptions underlying the engineering design. Arrangements for carry-
ing out monitoring activities have been agreed with the Government (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 4.02).
Cost Estimates and Financing
39.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$8.3 million net
of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange cost of US$5.9 million (71 per-
cent). Taxes and duties are estimated at $0.8 million. The proposed credit
of US$5.8 million would finance about 70 percent of total project cost net
of taxes, i.e., all foreign costs with the exception of those for maintenance.
The Government would finance the local costs (US$2.4 million) and US$0.1 mil-
lion in foreign exchange.
40.       Cost estimates for equipment are based on bids received in 1977 in
Benin for similar equipment. The cost of technical assistance is estimated
at $7,500 per man-month which corresponds to rates charged by firms working in
the region. The financial cost, net of taxes, of constructing and improving
roads, including equipment depreciation but excluding contingencies is about
US$2,500 per km for access tracks, US$4,200 for 4.0 m wide roads and US$6,700
for 5.5 m wide roads.
Procurement
41.       Equipment, vehicles, materials and supplies amounting to about
US$2.0 million (net of taxes) would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.  These items
would be bulked to the extent possible to make them suitable for international
competitive bidding. Goods manufactured in Togo would be allowed the standard
preference margin.  Contracts for equipment, vehicles, materials and supplies
costing under US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
following local procedures acceptable to the Association. The aggregate
amount of such purchases would not exceed US$400,000. Contracts for the
construction of drainage structures totalling about US$200,000 would follow
local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association. Consul-
tants for technical assistance and for the feeder road follow-up study would
be employed in agreement with and under terms of reference and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.



- 11 -
Disbursement
42.       The IDA Credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures of imported equipment,
vehicles, spare parts, office equipment, hired equipment, fuel
and lubricants, and 82 percent of the local costs (net of
taxes) of these items if purchased locally;
(b) 54 percent of total expenditures for civil works; and
(c) 80 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance
experts and consultants.
Project Benefits
43.       The development of an adequate feeder roads network is essential
to the development of the rural sector.   A road-by-road justification of
the first-year program has been made using as benefits road-user savings
and reduced produce spoilage. Benefits from induced increased agricultural
production during the first-year program were assumed to be insignificant
since these roads, even in their present state, provide access between farm
areas and the main road network. For the following project years, the eco-
nomic justification of the roads will take into account induced increases in
agricultural production as appropriate. The rate of return for the roads to
be improved in the first year of the project is estimated at 21 percent. For
the subsequent years, the roads would have to yield a minimum rate of return
of 10 percent to be included in the program.
44.       Distribution of project benefits would depend on the Government's
policy on producer prices for food and cash crops and the extent of competi-
tion in the transport industry. Approximately a third of the benefits from
increased cash crop production, mostly cocoa and coffee, would accrue to
farmers. OPAT and the Government would share the remaining benefits, part
of which would eventually be passed on to the farmers in the form of sub-
sidies and improved agricultural services. Farmers would gain most of the
benefits from foodcrops by selling more at a higher price. Benefits from
reduced transport costs on non-agricultural traffic would be shared by the
communities in the project area, the transporters and the traders.
45.       The benefits from institution building are of primary importance
and the project provides benefits in this area which cannot be quantified.
The establishment of a unit, which would ensure a comprehensive approach to
the planning and development of feeder roads, would avoid duplication and
lead to more rational use of scarce financial and human resources. The
training component would decrease the need for technical assistance in follow-
up projects. The establishment of the Feeder Roads Unit and the Interminis-
terial Technical Working Group would ensure that development of agriculture
and feeder roads is better coordinated.

Project Risk
46.       The main risk associated with the project would be that DGR may not
develop the necessary capacity to execute the project on schedule, despite
staff training and technical assistance. There is also some risk that con-
siderations which go beyond the criteria of selection agreed upon with the
Government may creep into the selection of the roads for the annual programs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Togo
and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
48.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are listed in Section III of Annex III. In addition, the following event is
specified as a special condition of effectiveness: that arrangements satis-
factory to the Association shall have been entered into between the DGR and
PWD whereby PWD shall be entrusted with (i) the improvement of 400 km of the
Project roads and with (ii) the maintenance of DGR equipment purchased under
the Project.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. Projects in Execution*
Credit No. 450      Second Highway Project; US$8.7 Million Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979;
Effectiveness Date: April 19, 1974
The project provided for the construction of one section of the main
south-north road axis (Blitta-Sokode) and two secondary roads (Sokode-Kambola
and Agou-Notse). The project is proceeding satisfactorily. However, due to
inflation, the scope of the road construction project had to be reduced: the
construction of the Agou-Notse road, one of the three roads to be constructed
under the project, was dropped. The economic re-evaluation of the project
shows that the economic return of Blitta-Sokode has increased from 22 percent
at appraisal to 29 percent, while the return of Sokode-Tchamba has slightly
decreased from 16 percent to 14 percent.
Credit No. 503      Cocoa/Coffee Development Project; US$6 Million Credit
of August 6, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: March 12, 1976
This project provides for the rehabilitation, planting and main-
tenance of 4,000 ha of cocoa and 4,400 of coffee in the Plateau Region.
The project is proceeding well and on schedule. Action has been initiated
towards the preparation of a follow-up project.
Credit No. 638      Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9.5 Million
Credit of June 16, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: October 26, 1976
The purpose of the project is to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop
lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation facilities for
existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastructure for about 20,000
farm families. The project is proceeding well despite a severe drought in
1977, which resulted in a drop in production which is expected to be made up
this year.
*    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1296 TO   of June 28, 1976; Closing Date:  December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: April 17, 1978.
The project is designed to produce 1.2 million tons of clinker for
delivery to cement grinding stations in Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. The
project consists of: (i) the industrial complex, comprising quarry, clinker
plant and related workshops, at Tabligbo, about 65 km northeast of Lome, and
(ii) related infrastructure components comprising a power link, a rail/port
terminal at Lome, a rail link and a township for CIMAO personnel. Execution
of this project is proceeding satisfactorily.

April 1, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: September 13, 1977
The project provides for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road (45 km), the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km), the provision
of technical assistance for improving transport planning and road maintenance
and preinvestment studies for a follow-up project. Bids are now being re-
ceived and works are expected to start on schedule.
Credit No. 741      Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$14 Million
Credit of October 5, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982;
Effectiveness Date: March 17, 1978
The project aims at increasing cotton production from 7,000 tons
to 34,000 tons and food crops grown in rotation with cotton from 40,000 tons
to 57,000 tons of maize and sorghum at full development. The credit became
effective on March 17, 1978 and is starting well.
1/   Amount of US$60 million covers the loans to CIMAO of US$49.5 million
and to the three member states (Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana) of US$3.5
million each.
