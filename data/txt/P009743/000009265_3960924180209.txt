PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Stlmmary
Introduction
Ile project covered by this PCR was the second project in the irrigation sector supported
by the BankDA1 in the State of Punjab. It evolved from the interest of the State and Central
Governments to maintain and improve productivity levels in one of India's most productive
agricultural areas.
The primary objective of the project was to upgrade the existing irrigation distibution
system through lining and moderni-ation, thus reducing seepage and operational losses and
simplifyin- maintenance. Secondary objectives were to improve the equity of water distribution,
and - thrugh pilot schemes - to test and introduce more advanced irrigation practices.
Implemntation ExenIence
The project was implernented in close accordance with SAR projections. Disbursements
were completed less than a year after the SAR estimate, due to some startup delays. The physical
works were well executed, to high standards of construcdon.
Results
The benefits of lining were measurable and well appreciated by the project beneficiaries.
Pilot studies have not yet led to significant changes in irrigation procedures in the state, although
some useful experience was gained. The potential for use of sprinkler and drip irrigation on field
crops was found to be limited.
Sustainabilitv
Most of the infrastructure provided under the project is well maintained, and remains in
good condition. In some areas, maintenance of lined water courses (a farmer responsibility) is not
adequate. This is partially due to the higher technical skills required to maintain the improved
structures. The Government is aware of the problem, and is in the process of introducing
legislation to oblige the irigation department to undertake necessary works at the expense of the
benefitting farmers.

Findings
The project was relatively simple, well conceived and well executed. Benefits wer close
to expectations - somewhat higher in physical terms of water saved, and somewhat lower in
economic terms due to faling international crop prices.

PUNJAB IRRTGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 889-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
Intrduction
1.   Irrigation development in Punjab was almost complete at the time of appraisal. Many of the
canal systems had been in opera-.,i9n for a century or more, and - due to the very limited supply of
water in relation to land - the major priority was improved efficiency in utlizing the available
iipgation resource. About 20% of the land area of Punjab is underlain by saline groundwater. In
these areas, seepage from canals and watercourses represent a double loss - first, because the
water canrot be reused by wells, and second because the rising water table threatens crop
production as it nears the surface.
ect Objectives
2.    The project was designed to meet the objective of generally increasing the efficiency of
water distribution, and, in saline areas, reducing losses to groundwater. The project had three
main components: lining of Departmentally-owned canals (54% of total costs); lining of farmer-
owned water-courses (45%); and studies and pilot demonstrations (1%).
roject Implementation and Achievement of Objecives
3.    Project costs were close to appraisal estimates during the originaly planned implementation
period. During the subsequent two years, construction costs increased sharply, leading to average
unit costs somewhat higher than projected. In spite of the substantial strengthening of the dollar in
reladon to the rupee, actual project costs were somewhat higher than project-d at appraisal in US
dollar terms.
4.    Canal lining performance in relation to targets in the SAR is illustrated below. By the
scheduled completion of the project, some 80% of the original target had been achieved. During
the extension period, the original target was -marginally exceeded.

initial years, but eventually exceed-d targets by some 25%.

6.   In both cases, delays were due to materials shortages (brick-makers were on strike for most
of 1983), compounded by power shortages to the cement industry. Shortage of funds (see para
11, below) were also a factor on occasion.
7.    The measured benefits of the lining and modernization works generally equalled or
exceeded SAR expectations, both in strictly physical terms of water saved, and in the increased
cropping resulting from this. The former measure is perhaps the best, because cropping intensity
varies from year to year due to variations in available water, and shifts among less- and more-water
demanding crops in response to market conditions.



- vii -
8.    The pilot studies and investigations were less uniformny successful. Work on water
scheduling, the use of saline groundwater for irrigation of fruit trees, and studies of the watertable
conditions, have produced useful results, and a worthwhile ongoing program. Other pilot studies
related to introducing sprinkler, and drip irrigation have failed to elicit much response from the
farmers.
9.    Of particular note is the extent to which quantitative data on the impact cf the project has
been assembled and presented so soon after implementation was completed. In part, this is
because the realization of benefits is very quick in a project such as this - primarily consisting of
lining existing channels in a well developed area suffering extreme water scarcity. Also, however,
it reflects a genuine interest on the part of many engineers in Punjab in the perfomiance of th&v
system, and the quality of the work they do. This in turn is strongly supported by the farmers: the
Punjab system of water distribution allocates the limited quantity of available water equally in
proportion to land; all farmers are thus short of water, and all are interested in the benefits of
water-saving investments.
10.   Farmer interest is fornalized by elaborate procedures to involve representadves in the
planning, design, and execudon of works. It is informally present at every stage in the works: it is
normal during the course of lining works to see farmers carefully watching how the work is being
done; during the period of severe cement shortages in the early 1980's, it was normal for farmers
to guard the cement stocks at night to ensure that the quality of the works would not suffer from
loss of scarce materials. In this environment, quality consciousness on the part of the engineers is
part of the systemn. The equity of water distribution in Punjab is higher than in other states ill
India. In suc.i situations interest in lining is substantial because every farmer knows he will get a
share of the "saved water".
11.   The well established and respected rules for system operation provide the basis for several
other important aspects of successful irrigation in the northwestern states: firstly, the infrastructure
has e rolved over time to meet specific operational requirements. This has allowed optimisation
and standardisation on well proven designs, leading to an efficient and competitive contracting
industry for irrigation construction. Secondly, the clear definition of responsibilities of officials at
all levels, and the responsibilities of the farmers, has minimised the scope for malpracdce.
Thirdly, the clearly defined rules for sharing water among the farmers allows government
intervendon and responsibility in system operation to cease at the gate controlling an area 1,000 ha
or more (while other states require interventions at the 40 ha level). Each of these factors
contributes to a system where performance is measurable in relation to known plans, fanners know
what to expect from the system, and officials have realistic responsibilities.
Economic Rate of Rettrn
12.   A reviser - te of return has not been calculated by the project authorities, but is likely to be
close to the original estimate the original estimate of 36%. The economic value of incremental
pnoduction is generally some 30% lower than projected at appraisal due to a sharp fall in
agricultural commodity prices. Against this, the depreciadon of the Indian rupee (from Rs 8.6C per
do'lar at the time of appraisal to over Rs 15 today) results in an offsetting rise in the rupee value of
the incremental production. The unit cost of project works (in Rupee terms) was as projected in
the SAR. In addition, the measured benefits of incremental area irrigated exceeded the original
targets well within the expected timeframe of seven years. The nature of the benefits from lining
are such that the slow overall progrers does not significandy affect the rate of return.
Sustainabilitv
13.   The responsibility for maintenance of watercourses rests with the farners, who
traditionally cooperate in cleaning and repairs. This was reladvely simple prior to lining, because



- viii -
only earthwork was involved. Now, however, repairs require more skilled attention - and hence
cash expenditures - and farmers are less able to agree on the sharing of responsibilities. As a
consequence, a number of older watercourses have deteriorated. In recognition of this problem,
GOP has now taken over responsibility for maintenance, and intends to charge the famers for the
cost of this work.
C2ther Jssmes
14. Two other issues are not touched by the PCR. The first relates to an integral part of the
project, namely the financing of the watercourse modernization program. As envisaged at
appra;sal, GOP planned to arrange institutional finance (on behalf of the farmers who own the
watercourses) from commercial banks to the semi-autonomous Punjab State Tubewell Corporadon
(PSTC) who were responsible for executing the works. These loans were in turn to be refinanced
by NABARD. In tl-e event, early experiences of cost recovery were good, but in later years,
debts were waived and recoveries ceased completely. GOP then took upon itself- and fulfilled
- the obligation to meet these debts. Thus while the commercial Banks and NABARD suffered
no losses, the credit system itself was f4rther damaged in terms of credibility, and GOP itself
incurred substantial and unexpected costsl.
15.   The second issue is the problem of drainage in Punjab, and the drainage basins of north
west India in general. At the time of appraisal, a substantial arainage component was to be
included, surported by technical assistance to assess the drainage needs of the state. At
negotiations the component was dropped due to failure to agree on the priority of this work and the
means to execute it. Subsequently, studies of the water table have taken place but little draira#e
work has yet been undertaken, and waterlogging continues to spread through south west Punjab,
and large ammas of Haryana and Rajasthan. The preparatiori process for the follow-up project to
C?redit 889-IN has placed heavy emphasis on the need to address this problem.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
16.   The project was a relatively simple, but high priority investment package in a well
developed, technically compe-tent State with high engineering tradidons, well organized
institutions, and knowledgeable farmers. The inmplementation delays resulted mostly from
problems beyond the control of the Irrigation Department, and were not easily foreseeable at
appraisal. The benefits of the project were fully achieved, and probably marginally exceeded on
the basis of already available field data, and the construction standards achieved were generally
excellent. The Government was fully committed to the project, and the established traditions of
irrigation in north west India provided a sound basis for defining technical innovations with great
assurance of success. The less successful aspect of the project, relating to credit discipline, is
consistent with general difficulties with agricultural credit in India.
1 GOP states that they made a conscious decision to waive recoveries of institutional
finance In view of the decline in agriculture prices and the subsequent decline In Income
of farmers. However, recoveries from farmers in terms of market cess, local
commodity taxes and other forms of indirect levies continued. Furthermore, GOP Is of
the view that ft would not be correct to conclude from this that there Is lack of
commiment on the part of the Govemment to enforce credit recovery.

PUNJAB IRRIGATION PROJECT
PHASE-I
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BACKGROUND
1.1       Punjab covers an area of about 5.036 M. ha. of which
about 4.189 M.ha. (83%) is under cultivation. The forest area
is only 0.211 M. ha.and this cannot be further reduced with-
out seriously disturbing the ecological balance. About 0.6
M.Ha. is uncultiable and is put to non-agricultural uses. Thus,
there is little scope of increasing the net cultivated area.
The cropping intensity (about 167% in 1984-85) is among the
highest in India. About 86% cropped area is under irrigation.
The primary source of supply of water to the irrigation channels
is the water from the rivers Sutlej, Beas and Ravi. Storage
Dam across Sutlej and Beas with Reservior capacities of about
7400 Mm3 and 6800 Mm3 respectively have already been constructed.
Storage Dam on river Ravt with capacity of 2500 Mm3 is under
construction. In addition to these storage4, two rivers links
Ravi Beas and Beas-Sutlej have been completed for interbasin
water,transfer for utilisation in Punjab, Haryana and
Rajasthan states as per their allocations. The total available
surface water for Punjab has already been harnessed and
developed for irrigation. Out of culturable command area under
the canal only about 2.77 million ha. is actually irrigated
because of scarecity of irrigation water in the canal system.
The farmers of the state are generally progressive
which is indicated by the high level fertilizers use, which has
increased from an average of 1 kg/ha in 1960-61 to 60 kg/ha.



:2:
in 1976-77 and subsequently   to 152 kg/ha in 1985-86 against
an all India consumption level of 54.5 kg/ha. Similarly the
No. of tractors has increased from 4935 in the year 1961 to
69307 in the year 1977 and 1,79,007 in the year 1983-84. A high
percentage of area of Major crops are sown with high yielding
varities and the yields,are well above the National average.
As a result of increase in Agricultural production, the state
of Punjab has contributed 6.167 millions tonnes of wheat to
Central pool which is 49.4%<of the total constribution and 3.9
million tonnes of Rice which is 63.3% of the total constribution
during 1985-86.
1.2       Inspite of rapid progress made during the peak years
of green revolution 1965-1970, the tempo slowed down considerably
due to the fact that easy benefits of Green Revolution based
on the use of High Yielding Varities (HYV) of Rice and Wheat
including in-puts etc. were reaped and further progress was
constrained due to limited availability of irrigation water
specially surface water and ground water resources. Therefore,
further increase in agricultural production is entirely dependent
upon better utilisation of irrigation supplies by modernising
century old irrigation system and improved drainage in areas
subject to seasonal flooding and water logging. This will
further increase intensity of cultivation and crop yields.
1.3       Surface water resources are fully developed at present.

IDENTIFICATION PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
1.5       Project preparation was carried olit in 1978 by
Punjab Govt. and assisted by the Project Preparation group in
the Central Wiater Conmission (CWC) Govt. of India. The Project
was appraised by the world Bank in March, 1979.

CHAPTER-III
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.1        The execution of the project was entrusted to
following organisations.
i)         Canal Administration of Punjab Irrigation Depart-
ment for execution of the work of modernisation
of channels;
ii)        Punjab State Tubewell Corporation for executing of
the work of Mcdernisation of watercourses;
iii)       Water Resources Administration of Irrigation
Department for execution of the work of studies s
Pilot Demonstration Schemes.
The work of Modernisation of channel was started
through the existing running Canal Circles. One construc-
tion Circle was created during the year 1977-78 exclusively
for lining of Channels at Bhatinda when a Composite Project
for Lining of Distys. and Minors was visualized and subse-
quently taken up in the year 1979-80 with the World Bank aid.
A separate set up consisting of four more new Circles
exclusively for lining work was created in June, 1980.
Running Canal Circle thereafter were permitted to ca_ryout
only residual works of completing the gaps and finalisation
of accounts. In Oct. 1981 one more Lining Circle was set-
up and now the Lining Organisation consists of six Cons-



*9:
truction Circles under a Chief Engineer. In the Head Office,
one Executive Engineer, 4 Assistant Design Engineer with allied
staff are posted exclusively for the design work of lining of
channels.
The Punjab State Tubeweli Corporation started the
work of Modernisation of Water courses, with two existing
circles at Ferozepur and Sangrur. Later on two more lining
circles were added during 1980. During the peak period of
lining of watercourses from 1.4.83 to 30.6.85, the Corporation
had 5 No. lininq circles with 18 No. lining division to cope with
the work of lining of water courses.
A separate Directorate came into being in the month
of August, 1979 to execute the work of studies and pilot demons-
tration schemes.
A Directorate of Evaluation was already functioning
under Canal Administration before signing of the Agreement with
World Bank. Monitoring and Evaluation Unit was also created in
Punjab State Tubewell Corporation and Water Resources Adminis-
tration in the month of August, 1979.
PHYSICAL PROGRESS
3.2-          The component of Modernisation of Channels consists
of Lining of 4060 kms. length of Channels having an area of 230
million sq.ft. The period of implementation was estimated as



: 10
5 years starting from 1979-80 to 1983-84. Implementation period
was however extended to June, 1986. A length of 4135 kms.
having an area of 222.5 Million sq.ft. was modernised upto the
extended implementation period. The year wise schedule and
actual progress is given as under :-

The component of Modirnw4 tion of Watercourses consistsing
of 15,200 Kms. Length (comprising of 2820 No. of watercourses)
were to be lined. However, in November, 1985, IDA with mutual
agreement re-alloca. ed the funds from lining of channels to
lining of water courses and the target was fixed as 19,477 KM
to be completed by 30.6.86.  At the date %  completion of Phase
I, length of l9,94OKMS was attained on 4125 No. watercourses
exceeding the target byLand 3640 No of watercourses were com-
pleted against target of 2830. The unfinished portion of on
going schemes was to be completed under other project extending
beyond 30.6.86. The yearise target and achievement is given as

The target of lining 15200 K s. length of watercourses
was completed by Dec., 1984. The lining of watercourses was
continued beyond the length evisaged in the project & additional
targets were fixed so that the watercourses of the channels lined
by lining administration are completed to get maximum benefits of
lining. The achievement during the extended period project is
as under :-

1986-87          956.70 Kms.
____________
8130.21 Kms.
Thus the total length lined under Punjab Irrigation
Project Phase-I was 19,940 Kms. (Upto 30.6.1986).
The third component consisted of No. of studies and
pilot demonstration schemes, the details of which are attached
as separate Annexure.
3.3      The physical progress was less than the target because
of the following reasons :-
i)  Shortage of funds in case of lining of channels
ii)  Shortage of bricks due to general strike by brick
kiln owners in the state from Dec., 1983 to Sep.,1984.
iii)  The shortage of cement owing to power cuts in the
cement producing states, from 1980-81 to 1982-83.
DESIGN SPECIFICATION AND QUALITY STANDARD.
3.4      Design and quality standards were adequate.  During the
period of shortage of bricks, Punjab State Tubewell Corporation
adopted the following types of lining :-
1) Conventional_brick_lining
Lining comprised of 4,1/2' thick brick masonry on side
walls and 3' thick flat brick masonry in bed using cement sand



: 13 :
mortar 1:5,finished with 3/8" thick cement plaster 1:3 both
in bed and sides (inside of).
2.  goomsit _cement _concrete and brick  as_onry lining
Lining consisted of 50 mm (2") thick cement concrete
1:3:6 bed laid over 100 mircron thickness or 400 gauage LDPE
film and 4, 1/2" thick brick masonry side walls constructed in
cement sand mortar 1:5. The inside and top of these vertical
walls are finished with 3/8" thick cement and plaster 1:3.
3. Cement concrete*,lining
Lining consisted of 5C mm (2") thick cement concrete
1:3:6 bed laid over 100 micron thickness of 400 gauge LDPE
film and 76 mm (3") thick cement concrete 1:3:6 side wall upto
1.5' height only.
It was however decided that preference should be given
for alternatives at 1 and 2 above and alternative No. 3 be
used when unavoidable. The beneficiaries were reluctant to the
use of composite section and all concrete section for the lining
of watercourses. Later on when the bricks become available in
abundance in the market, conventional type brick masonary
was again adopted.
For lining of Distys/Ninors under Phase-I Project,
cup shaped section has been adopted being economical and
hydraulically efficieLt. The construction of trapezoidal
section has been restricted to the conditions, where execution



: 14 s
of lining works posed some problems owing to deeper sections,
making the manual working difficult and slughing of side slopes
due to local saturation conditions. In areas with high water
table, the design had to be changed to trapezoidal section,
especially in head reaches of channels where discharges are
higher and local water logging conditions are faced.
The lining consists of 3U thick flat bricks in cement
sand mortar 1:3,1aid over 3/8" thick cement plaster 1:3,over
1/2" thick cement plaster 1:5 over well prepared subgrade.
The lined channels were constructed parallel to the
existing channels except in high filling reaches or in built
up areas, where the lined section was constructed within the
existing section. This had been necessitated because the
channels could not be closed for any appreciable period at the
cost of present day irrigation needs, and that the lining work
could not be planned and executed during short closures.
The new lined section was accommodated on the side of
the earthen channel. This results in saving of earth work,
saving in compaction and acquisition of extra land. This arrange-
ment also makes it possible to use the common bank as a service
Bank during the construction period. After the lined section
is completed and a stretch of lined channel was brought under
operation, a part of the unlined section was filled up and the
common bank was formed in to an Inspection Bank of proper
dimensions. The side slopes, free boards and widiha of banks



:15:
were designed as per departmental instruction contained
in the *Hand Book of Instruction for the design of lined and
unlined channels and Masonry Works" of Punjab P.W.D. Irrigation
Branch.
Keen interest was taken by the lining organisation to
examine the pros and cons of combination type of polythene lining
because it was felt that by switching over to polythene lining
there will not only be reduction in the cost per unit area of
lining and seepage losses but also in the consumption of cement
which was in short supply in the country. In this type of
lining black polythene film replaces the two plasters being done
for conventional type of lining. The results of polythene lining
carried out on experimental basis were encouraging. Therefore
concurrence/opinion of Central Water Commission was souqht for
switching over from experimental stage to actual use of polythene
lining. The Central Water Commission and also favoured the
progressive use of Black W PE Film of appropriate thickness
(UO0 micron or 400 gauge) projected by Earth or Brick/Tile lining.
Some of the lining was also done with polythene.
QJALITY CONTROL
3.4      In order to maintain the quality of work and ensure
proper compaction, field observations for finding dry bulk
density of compacted earth work are made for each layer of the
earth. The earth work is done by mannual labour because the Distys.
and Minors have generally a small section and earth has to be
put in layers. The compaction of earth work is done by sheep Foot



: 16
Roller driven by wheeled tractors. -he earth work for the
compacted zone is put in 225 cm (9") thick to specifications
to the desired dry bulk density. In narrow portion where Sheep
Root Rollers cannot work, compaction through hand rammers is
done. Extensive test checks on the field observations are
made by the Research and Quality Control Staff attached to each
lining circle. In addition, quality control checks are also
performed by the field Engineers to ensure good quality of the
work, Quality of the works remained good throughout the project
and the members of the World Bank Mission Team were satisfied
with the quality of work during their field visits.
PROJECT COST :
3.5      It was envisaged that a length of 4060 kms. having an
area of 230 M.Sq.Ft. of channels would be lined at a cost of
Rs. 1000.9 million. A length of 4135 kms. of channels having
an area of 222.5 million sq.ft. was lined upto 30.6.1986. The
average cost per sq.ft. works out to 5.80 per sq.ft. against
the average estimated cost of Rs. 4.35 per sq.ft. estimated at
appraisal.
A comparision of actual cost and cost envisaged at
appraisal is as under :-

The increase in cost has been due to following reasons;



: 18 :
i) The rise in the cost of bricks from Rs. 99%0 numbers
in 1979 to Rs. 325%0 numbers in 1985-86.
ii) The cost of cement increased from Rs. 20 per bag in
1979 to Rs. 57 per bag in 1985-86.
iii) Labour premium has increased from 170% on common
schedule of rates in 1979-80 to 550% in 1985-86.
iv) The cost of lubricants has also increased as under :-

DISBURSEMENT
3.6      The World Bank agreed to provide 129.00 millions U.S. $
It was decided that 100% of the foreign exchange spent on
directly imported equipment will be reimbursed. For locally
procured items, disbursements would be against the ex-factory
price, or where the ex-factory price is not readily available
against 70% of expenditure. Disbursements for civil works could
also be on a percentage basis (5S% of ARDC's refinance for works
financed through institutional credit, and 65% of cost for other
civil works). For project preparation, disbursements would
be made against foreign expenditures. The yearwise cumulative
targets and the amount actually reimbursed is given as under :-

PROCUREMENT
3.7      Prior to introduction of local Competitive Bidding
(LCB) on the advise from World Bank, the work of Lining of
Channels and Water courses was being executed on work order
basis. The main defect in work order system was that the
contractors were not bound by the agreement to finish the work
in time.
The lining of channels administration switched over to



: 20
LCB system from 2/85 onwards. Punjab State tubewell Corporation
started working on LCB system from 6/85.
The LCB system has following advantages/features :-
1.       All tenders are cautioned that tenders containing any
deviation from the contractual terms and conditions are rejected
as non-responsive.
2.       It provides a brief description of entire project, its
major components, its purpose and scheduled date for completion
of whole parts.
3.       It provides accurate information on work which has been
completed and work currently under consideration.
4.       Award is made to the Tenderer whose responsive tender
is determined to be the lowest evaluated tender and who meets
the appropriate standards of capability and financial resources.
5.       Alternative tenders are not accepted.
6.       It gives description of the project, scope of work
period of completion from the date of notice.
7.       Earnest money in the form and call deposit is valid
for a period of 90 days from the date of opening of tenders.
Tenders not accompained by Earnest money are rejected. If
during the tender validity period the tender withdraws his tender,
the Earnest money shall be forfieted and tender may be disquali-
fied from tendering for further works.



: 21:
8.       Within 30 days from the date of receipt of letter
accepting his tender, the successful tender shall furnish the
required security deposit and attend the office for execution
of the contract documents.
REPORTING
3.8      Regular progress reports in form of quarterly progress
report and quarterly implementation progress report were sent to
World Bank. Different informations required by World Bank were
also promptly supplies when ever desired.
COTIACE WITH COVENANTS
3.9      The position of the covenants  is attached as Annexure.
Perusal of the same indicates that all the covenents except for
which Govt. of Punjab is formulating a scheme for recovering of
operation and maintenance cost of lined watercourses from the
beneficiaries.

CHAPTER - IV
INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.1      The execution of the project was entrusted to
following organisations :
i)       Canal Administration of Punjab Irrigation Department
for executive the work of modernisation of channels.
ii)      Punjab State Tubewell Corporation for execution the
work of Modernisation of watercourses ;
iii)     Water Resources Administration of Irrigation Depart-
ment execution the work of Studies .and Pilot Demons-
tration Schemes.
The work of Modernisation of Channels was started
through the existing running Canal circles. One construction
circle was created during the year 1977-78 exclusively for lining
of Channels at Bhatinda when a Composite Project for Lining of
Distys. and Minors was visulized and subsequently taken up in
the year 1979-80 with the world Bank aid. A separate set up
consisting of four more new Circles exclusively for lining
work was created in June, 1980. Running Canal Circle thereafter
were permitted to carryout bnly residual works of completing
the gaps and finalisation of accounts. In Oct., 1981 one more
Lining Circle was setup and now the Lining Organisation consists
of six Construction circles under a Chief Engineer. In the Head
Office, one Executive Engineer, 4 Assistant Design Engineer with
allied staff posted exclusively for the design work of lining of



:23:
Channels. The Lining OrganIsation was set up to complete the
work in 5 years period. The staff and equipment which was
inpoistion for completion of the work in five year remained
under utilised for want or proper funding. The project would
have been completed in time, had the funds been available
sufficiently.
The delay in execution of project has resulted in ex-
calation of construction cost and defferred accrual of benefits.
4.2      Tke Punjab State Tubewell Corporation was responsible
for watercourses lining, Substantial expansion and reorgani-
sation was done to complete the modernisation of watercourses
conponent. Prior to Project, Punjab State Tubewell Corporation
had only one Chief Engineer acting as Managinq Director. After
the start of Project,the organisation was divided into two wings,
one for watercourses lining and other for tubewells development.
Each wing was headed by General Manager of the rank of Chief
Engineer (from the year 1980) with Managing Director heading
the two wings. The tubewell wing had initially one circle but
with the transfer of all state tubewells to PSTC, circle of
Irrigation Department dealing with tubewells was also merged
with the PSTC to have a uniform policy of groundwater exploitation
and water charges to be levied in respect of public tubewells.
In case of lining organisation the strength varied from two field
circles with six field divisions (in the year 1979) in the
initial stage of the Project to five field circles with eighteen
field divisions at the peak of the project. (from 1.4.83 to



: 24 :
30.6.85.) The field staff was quite sufficient to ac'ieve the
target. Management information Unit headed by a Financial
Advisor was also established for the accounting and budgeting
procedures so that timely and reliable information was made
available to PSTC Management and Financial Banks, and I.D.A.
4.3      A separate organisation was created to exeucte the
schemes of studies and pilot demonstration during August, 1979.
Some of the studies was contracted to Punjab Agriculture Univer-
sity Ludhiana, Irrigation & Power Research Institute, Amritsar,
Punjab State Tubewell Corporation.
ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING
4.4      The accounting unit in Irrigation Department is a
Division and accounts were maintained by each Division as per
codal rules. The accounts maintained were periodically checked
by the auditors of the Accountant General Punjab. No difficulty
was experienced in maintenance of accouats. The accounts main-
tained were generally satisfactory except that accounting by
detailed sub-heads was found deficient.
PSTC also submitted audited accounts checked by
independent auditor. The auditors confirmed proper management of
the funds allocated to the project.
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
4.5      Monitoring and Evaluation units were set up in (i)
Punjab State Tubewell Corporation, (ii) Irrigation Department



: 25 :
(iii) A small unit was also established in directorate of Project
Co-ordination. The functions of these units was to a) Monitor
the project implementation progress and cost of the works b)
establish base line survey of irrigation water supply and use,
ci,pping intensity, crop yield etc.

CHAPTER - V
AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
5.1      The increase in irrigation area can be established only
through proper comparison of base line data with the existing
data on areas irrigated with same quantum of supplies. It may
be added that it is not possible to find out effect of lining
of channels and lining of watercourses separately. The project
has been completed recently and it is not possible to evaluate
the project benefits so soon. The results founds so far are given
as under :-
5.2      Extension of irrigated area :
The main benefit of the project as envisaged is increase
in irrigated area. A study has been conduct on 84 Nos. dis-
tributaries/minors completed so far. The year-wise total area
irrigated is given as under :-
Sr.No.   Year               Area_irrigated in Ac.

The details of irrigated area channel wise is attached
as Annexure ---- ----. The comparison of irrigated area during
1975-76 and 1985-86 indicate that there is an increase of
8,92,912 acres (357,165 ha.), which is 25% more than 284,000 ha.
envisaged in the Staff Appraisal Report.

of these experiments are attached as Annexure TII. The losses
average out to 5.45 cusecs and 1.72 cusecs per million sft.
of wetted perimeters. The net savings in seepage losses after
lining, based on aforesaid emperical formulas and observed
seepage rates have been compared in this Annexure.Similarly
the observations were made on lining of watercourses. The
losses average out to 6.32% and 27.9% in lined and unlined
conditions res-ectively. The detail is attached at Annexure-IV

CHAPTER - VI
BANK PERFORMANCE
6.1      The Project was prepared by the Punjab Irrigation
Department. The Bank's appraisal of the project was of high
order and appraisal was well conceived which can be taken as
a model for future appraising of such projects. The appraisal
estimates in regard to the per unit costs have proved in-
adequate. The reimbursements by the Bank were regular and no
difficulty was experience on this account.
6.2      Bank Missions visited the project eighteeen times.
Valuable suggestions in regard to the methodology of construction
and evaluation were given by the Mission which helped in overall
execution of the project.

CHAPTER-VII
ISSUES AND LESSONS LEARNT
7,1      A hydraulic survey of all the channels to be taken
up for lining be jointly undertaken by canal administration
and lining administration. L-section and X-section be prepared
taking into consideration any improvements in canal command
and Disty. System as suggested by Chief Engineer/Canals. The
advanced planning for making structures/modernisations structures
be carried out depending up on hydraulic survey.
7.2      It is proposed to centralise the clearance of L-section
of the distys. minors and branches of the canals to be under-
taken for lining in Punjab Irrigation Project Phase-II.
7.3      Simultaneous completion of control and access structures
alongwith lining of channels needs to be effected. Delay in
completion of such structures causes problems of operation and
maintenance.
7.4      A separate design office under one Director. assisted by
three Senior Design Engineers and allied staff would be necesssary
to meet with the design requirements of lining work in future,
as branch canals are also involved under Phase-II.
7.5      Chief Engineer/Canals will indicate the locations
where metering structures are required in the distributary.
Possibility of adopting headless meter flumes as per site con-
ditions will also be explored.



: 33
7.6      Efforts will be made to complete the lining of
watercourses of the chanels lined by lining administration so
as to accure the maximum benefits of lining.
7.7      The lining infrastructure, staff and equipment was
under-utilised for want of proper amounts of funding. The
project could have been completed on schedule,hid the funds been
available sufficiently.
7.8      Detailed planning beginning from land acquisition for
additional strip of land where required; to the actual handing
over of the completed channel to the 0 & M wing of the irrigation
Department, needs to be carried out for all future works through
port-chart Techniques, and execution closely watched by the
monitoring agency. The coordination between different executing
agencies between themselves and with the 0 & M wing of the depart-
ment was very inadequate.
7.9      Polythene type of lining can be effectively laid and
this type of lining may be adopted increasingly in future.
7.10     The delay in execution of the project has resulted in
escalation of construction cost deferred accrual of benefits.
7.11     The approval of the L-Section of complete upto sub-
minor level be centralised so that irregular execution of the
works is avoided.
7.12     Under section 3.06 of the project agreement, the State
Government is committed to make adequate arrangements for



: 34 s
efficient operation sazd preventive mai-itenance of all irri-
gation works executed under the project. The need to make an
efficient agency for the operation and maintenance of water-
courses has been engaging attention of the Punjab Govt. Various
meetings have also been taken by the Secretary, irrigation and
Power, Financial Commission (Development) and Chief Secretary
to Govt., Punjab for working out various modalities involved
in the recovery of cost of maintenance from the beneficiaries
and for appointing agency for carrying out maintenance which
should be most economical and evoke maximum co-operation from
the beneficiaries.  After ttkough discussion, it has been
decided that the maintenance work may be done by the Canal
Department due to following reaosns :-
1)       The canal departnent has the necessary technical
capacity to ca ryout work on hydraulic structures.
2)       The staff already in position for the maintenance of
canals can also take up maintenance of water courses
with nominal increase in establishment at the junior
level.
3)       The canal officers have experience in the maintenance
of katcha watercourses & are well versed in the opera-
tion of canal & drainage Act aor effectively implement-
ting the maintenance details.
The canal department has submitted the proposals for
implementing the decision. It has worked out the probable cost



: 35
per acre of C.C.A. which will be the basis of recovery of cost of
maintenance. It has also been suggested some additional staff
may be required for the work of inspection and petty repairs.
The amendment to Northern India Canal and Drainage Act, 1873 has
also been proposed and the entire scheme is being examined by a
very high level committee consisting of financial commissioner
(Development) Secretary, Irrigation and Power, Secretary Planning
Secretary Co-operative and Finance Secretary to Govt. of Punjab.
The Govt. is very serious in saving the huge assets created for
the welfare of the farmers and is equally clear that the cost of
maintenance should be born by the beneficiaries.

STUDIES AND PILOT DEMONSTRATION SCHEMES
The World Bank highlighted the need in Punjab and through-
out India tc solve the practical problems of introducing Pilot
Demonstration Schemes on project scale under Indian conditions.
It was desired that these should be specially designed to examine
social, legal and institutional problems of introducing the new
technologies. In addition, the project scope should be expanded
to include demonstration of irrigation technology and-techniques
to provide a broad based chqice. The studies should include the
basic assumptions and objectives of design as well as demonstrate
advance irrigation technology, so that the farmers of the state
are prepared to adopt these technologies and techniques. The
scale of the studies should be such that they provide sufficient
information to enable full preparation of future projects. The
following studies were identified for taking up in Punjab
Irrigation Project Credit 889-IN.

ANNEX 5
Study at No.3 Evaluate present main canal scheduling
system, 8(i), Sprinkler, 9 Improved conveyance system in wa.er
course command and un-allocated study Benefit cost analysis of
various sources of irrigation have been completed. The other
studies are still to be completed and will take 1 to.5 year
for completion.
The position/findinq of the completed studies is
discussed as under:-
1.   Main cajial scheduling_system
Canal system have been designed on the basis of mean
year availability of water from rivers viz. Ravi, Beas and
Sutlej but the mean inflows are not available every year. In
the cycle of 1920 to 1980 i.e. out of 60 years, mean years
inflows were available for 21 year only. Thus, when the availa-
bility of the water is less than the mean year, the schedua.ng
of canal systems becomes necessary.
The requirements of water for a crop are not constant
throughout the crop period. No. disty. therefore, should
generally operate at full supply discharge for all days during
the entire crop period. The ratio which the operating period
of a Disty. bears with the total period of crop is called its
capacity factor. These capacity factors govern the operation
of the disty. w%hich vary from month to month. These are
highest during sowing and maturity period and lowest in other
periods. The average capacity factors in Bhakra and Sirhind
canal systems are 0.80 for Kharif and 0.72 for Rabi which
means that during these seasons, the distys. are to run with



: 60
ANNEX 5
partial discharge because its outlets will not draw their
authorised discharges. The improvements in the operation of the
system have been carried out from time to time to su.t the field
requirements. The main aim of the rotational programme is to
ensure optimum use of available waters when the availability
is less than the requirements.
It was basically a desk study and was followed by a
workshop organised by New Delhi Office of World Bank on December
5-6, l9V5. The workshop was attended by the Senior Officers of
the Irrigation Department in addition to Bank Officers concerned.
Major recommendations of the study were introducing
computer based system of canal Regulation and the procurement
of computer hardware. Two systems of Micro-processors Type I.
DM-PC XI and suitable to run software in d Based III also, have
already been procured and the training of personnel as well as
the development of software has been started and trials made
with the programme supplied by Dr. S.G.Naraynamurthy.
The other recommendations regarding setting up of
wireless system has also been achieved and 32 Nos. wireless
sets had been installec. at all major control points of B.M.L.,
Sirhind Canal, Perozxpur Canal and U.B.D.C. system. Action on other
recommendation required   to. inatal... self recording gauges,
to provide gates and hoists for cross-regulators, Head Regula-
tors and escapes, provision of more sophisticated radio communi-
cation system at important stations in the first slice of five
year period, is being taken under the proposed World Bank
Phase-II Project.



: 61 :
ANNEX 5
The study has high-lighted the urgency of closer, monitor-
ina of canal scheduling to minor level and frequent balancing of
supplies delivered to each system during critical periods of
crop growth ensuring equity in the distribution during short
supply period.
Close monitoring of shortages at the tails has not given
satisfactory results to meet the needs of the farmers in parti-
cularly at the tail ends. Some problems like incomplete gaps
and pending masonary works in Phase-I including inspection roads
have come to light and have been taken up for completion on
priority basis by the Lining Administration for systemwise
completion and deriving maximum benefits.. from modernisation.
The Canal scheduling with the responsive (dynamic',
method of allocation as advised by Mr.Naraynamurthy will be
considered/attempted on some channels in consultation with the
Agriculture Department during the proposed Punjab Irrigation
Project Phase-II.
2.    Improved conveyance system in watercourses command
(buried  _ige automatic valve system)
The improved conveyance system of laying underground
pipe lines is being tried on almost all direct irrigation deep
tubewells installed by Punjab State Tubewell Corporation in
the State of Punjab. For the distribution of water,delivery-
tank is built near to Tubewell into which Tubewell pumps in
water. Further distribution to the fields is done through
improved conveyance system. So far PSTC had been laying
(burried) U/G. RCC pipes for conveyance of water from the
tubewells to the fields but has also undertaken the most



: 62 :
ANNEX 5
modern technique of laying of U/G PVC pipeline with Automatic
valves in a loop system on experimental basis. In the U/G pipe-
line, number of control points are provided for distribution
of water at actual users fields through nakkas/outlets which
are vertical pipes put on horizontal.
As the controlling point is at the tubewell D-tank of
Elevated tank in case of automatic PVC system, all point in
the chak can be effectively commanded, which is not possible
with conventional gravity flow in open water course.
The system is highly suitable for undulating and sandy
tract of kandi area, which cannot be irrigated with open water
courses due to numerous rises and falls in natural ground levels.
Maintenance is minimised as there is no damage to under-
ground pipeline as compared to frequent damage to open water
courses by bullocks, animals etc.
As velocity is quite large in underground pipeline than
in open water coursed, travel time for water to reach fields
is reduced and thus improving command.
As the underground pipeline remain fully filled up,
time for initial filling(Bharai) and usual nikal is obviated
and thus wara-bandi becomes quite simple.
The development of irrigation of Tubewell where under-
ground pipeline is laid is much more and faster as compared
to Tubewells where such facility is not available.
The provision of underground R.C.C. pipeline in Tube-
wells schemes is made as per norms approved by NABARD which is



: 63
ANNEX 5
based on scientific studies carried out by Indian Council of
Agriculture Research (I.C.A.R.) Recently, a study was made to
know the effect of laying of underground R.C.C. pipe-system on
a set pipeline laid with Alfa-Alfa valve at the top which can
be closed or opened as per requirement. In addition bifurcation
tanks (B-Tanks) and Intermediate Tanks (I-Tanks) are also
provided on the pipeline as control points to change direction
in the pipe line as well as provided head for particular leg
of underground pipeline.
Airvent-up pipes of suitable dia are also provided on
the pipeline for release of air pressure at the time of filling/
release of water in the pipeline.
The improved conveyance system of burried pipeline has
following advantages over the conventional open water courses:
i)   As the pipe line is burried, underground 3-4 feet below
N.S.L., there is no wastage of fertile land, which is in the
case for open water course.
ii) No acquisition of land is necessitated.
iii) There is full movement of agricultural implements like
tractors, seed drills, combines etc. as there is no obstruction.
on account of raised embankments of open water courses;
iv) There is no evaporation and seepage loss of scarce
tibewell water, which is quite high in case of open water
courses in the range of 20-30% depending upon texture and type
of soil of tubewells installed in Kandi Areas regarding



: 64
AM  X5
improvement of irrigation on such tubewells. It has been
obsezved that on an average area irrigated on such tubewell
has undergone an improvement to the extent of 95% as compared
to area irrigated by the same set of tubewells before laying
of underground pipe line system.
3. SRgbkler_Irrigation_Schemes
The studies and pilot demonstration schemes have been
introduced in the State of Punjab under. IDA Credit 889-IN,
to test and evaluate the advanced irrigation technologies
and techniques which are either untried in the State of Punjab
or have been attempted on a minimal scale. To assist the GOP
in planning ahead for future developments, when the known
surface and ground water resources are fully committed and
further development of agriculture depends on the judicious
utilisation of available water resources for maximum return
per unit water. Sprinkler irrigation trials is the first
attempt in the series of such studies.
To date, 7 Nos. pilot sprinkler irrigation schemes
served:bysurface supplies (six of community size and one of
individual size scheme) have been installed. The location and
date of commissioning of each pilot sprinkler irrigation scheme
is given below:

Irrigation Intensities
The comparison of irrigation intensities have been drawn
in Appendix-I. It would be seen that irrigation intensities which
has registered a marked increase, but has set back due to
disturbed conditions in the State. There is now greater/aware-
ness among the farmers about the usefulness of sprinkler
irrigation schemes and these are becoming popular in the area.
Comparison of water used, input and yield for scrinkler
irrigation area which is undulating and flow irrigation areas which
is leveled     has been drawn in Appendix-II. It cam. be seen
that there is saving of 15% to 40% of water in the case of
sprinkler irrigation areas as compared to equivalent flow



: 66
AM=IE 5
irrigation areas. The saving of water in case of wheat crop
with the identical yield and input had been observed 20 to 26%.
This saving in actual comparison would be much more if due
weightage and consideration is given to the levelled land of
flow irrigation.
The study on sprinkler irrigation has been carried out
on seven sites having a culturable commanded area of 337 ha.
In this area previously there was only barani cultivation
with poor contents of plant nutrients and other essential
plant food elements. The soil texture will considerably change
with continuous irrigation with the passage of time. Side by
side fertilizer use and plant protection will increase consider-
ably. This will substantially increase the yield of crop per
acre.
However, on seven numbers sprinkler irrigation sites,
it has been observed that the agriculture produce/yield per
acre is as near as to canal irrigated field.
Economic Viability
The economic viability of each pilot sprinkler irrigation
scheme in operation has been worked out and has been given in
Appendix-Ill. The benefit cost ratio of existing 7 No. pilot
S.1. scheme has also been worked out as shown in Appendix-IV.
It reveals that sprinkler irrigation schemes are economically
viable on the basis of benefit cost ratio, being more than



: 67 :
AMNEX 5
one in most of the cases. It is increasing each year.
Conclusion
The studies carried out on the sprinkler irrigation
pilot demonstration schemes have revealed that there is 20 to
25%.saving of water with identical yield and input as compared
to flow irrigation. The scheme are economically viable on the
basis of benefit cost ratio worked out in the existing pilot
demonstration schemes. The saving of water by sprinkler irriga-
tion, in actual comparison, would be much more if due considera-
tion is given to the levelled land of flow irrigation.
3.    Benefit cost analysis of various sources of
irrigation in Puniab.
The objectives of the study are:
i)   To study the effect of various sources of irrigation
on the yield and cropping pattern of farm holdings.
ii)   To determine the benefit of water supply flexibility
represented by source of irrigation.
iii) To examine the cost and use pattern of irrigation and
other inputs in relation to water supply flexibility
and reliability.
iv) To study the input-output relationship for different
farm categories.
v) To work out the net returns per units of water from
different sources of irrigation.

ANNEX 5
The study has now been completed. The brief conclusion
are given as under:
In Punjab State, variety of systems of irrigation is
used. Apparently, there are three main sources of irrigation,
namely canals for using surface water, diesel tubewell and
electric tubewell for using ground water. In practice, these
& in
three sources are used individually/ various combinations of
these three sources are also frequently used resulting in many
differences in water supply flexibility.
It was observed, there were significant difference in
input used and output produced at the farms, using different
sources of irrigation. Water supply flexibility and pricing
of irrigation water were important factors in effecting the
efficiency and performance of various sources of irrigation.
The effect of Pricing of irrigation input was stronger in
Kharif season because nice was the main crop of Kharif season
and its water requirements were very high. However, during
Rabi season water supply flexibility was more important than
pricing of irrigation water in affecting the performance of
various sources of irrigation.
With the increase in the degree of water supply flexi-
bility and reliability, there was significant increase in the
productivity. In some cases, it was due to the increased use
of inputs resulting from complementary effect of irrigation
while in many other cases with the same area even with less
level of inputs, there was an increase in the output with the
increase in degree of control over water by the users. The



: 69
ANNEX 5
conclusion was supported by the data on individual crops as well
as aggregate of all crops. Findings of this study suggest that
increasing flexibility of irrigation systems would have substan-
tial benefits.
However, these benefits must be compared with the cost
of increasing flexibility.
Among the single sources of irrigation, the performance
of the farms using electric tubewell was much better compared
to diesel and canal farms. From social point of view, the
decision to replace the diesel tubewell by electric tubewell
should take into account additional cost of maintaining
electric tubewell and subsidy on electricity used for irriga-
tion, viz-a-viz the gain in total production. Wide scope
existed for increasing productivity and water use efficiency
of canal irrigated lands provided this sources was made more
reliable.
Economic cost of irrigatingper acre of land and the
cost per unit of irrigation water were many times more at
diesel tubewell compared to electric tubewell and canals. The
cost differential between canal irrigation and tubewell
irrigation may be justified by higher degree of flexibility
under tubewell irrigation compared to canal irrigation. But
the wide difference in irrigation cost of diesel and electric
tubewell enjoying almost same degree of water supply flexibility
is striking and it would have served implication for income
distribution against those who use diesel tubewells.

(b)  G2n2n!ctive_us__ surface water suDl_ and_ground water
The objectives of the study are as follows:
i)   To develop a simple parameter for judging the sodicity
hazard of irrigation water containing high concentration
of sodium, carbonate and bicarbonate ions.
ii)   To estimate the average root zone salinity of water
that is consumed by plant roots from different soil
layers.
iii)   To develop an appzoach for using saline under ground
water for irrigatCon under different rainfall and soil
textural conditions.
iv)   To test the relative tolerance of different crops to
saline irrigation water and soil salinity under farmers
field condi+-ions.
v)   To compare the effect of different conjunctive use
methodoloqy (alternate application of saline water and
canal water application of mixed canal and saline waters)
on soil properties and crop yields.
vi)   To predict the sodicity and salinity hazard of saline
irrigation water under different rainfall and soil
conditions.
vii)   To carry out the lysimetric and field studies with
synthesized saline water and natural saline water
respectively, by growing different crops such as wheat,
cotton, maize, raya etc.

ANNRX 5
viii)  To carry out bench mark survey of ground water quality
in some waterlogged tract of Paridkot District.
ix)  To see the effect of chemical amendments such as gypsum,
ferric sulphate for reducing the deterious effect of
high concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate in
irrigation water under field conditions.
The study comDrises of two parts (i) desk study,
(ii) experiment in the field. The desk study has been completed
and experiment in the farmers field at village Golewala are
being conducted. The interm results show that crops are most
sensitive to saline conditions during germination and early
seedling development stages. They usually tolerate saline
conditions at later growth stages. The yield of rice was
maximum with canal water alone, followed by alternate applica-
tion of canal water and saline water. The yield was minimum
when only saline water was used.
The effect of saline irrigation on crop yield and soil
deterioration :annot be judged by conducting experiments for
one or two years. In order to have the correct estimate of
soil deterioration long term experiment will have to be
carried out with same saline irrigation on the same soil and
with same crop.
(c)   Evaluation of droo irriaation
The objectives of the study are as under:
i)   To compare the drip irrigation system, pipe irrigation
system and traditional system in respect of-water

economy, water use efficiency and their effects on
plant growth and fruit bearing.
ii)   To study the economic feasibility of drip irrigation
system for citrus cultivation.
The layout of the experiment has been completed in all
respects. The comparison on the plant growth data shows that
under drip irrigation with fresh water, the treatment where
the water was applied at the rate of 75% of the ET shows
better growth than other treatments. Under pipe irrigation
also, the treatment where water was applied at the rate of
75% of the ET shows better growth than other treatments. The
fruiting of the Kinnow plant is yet to commence, after which
the affect of irrigation treatments on fruit yield will be
observed. The project need to be continued for another 5
years to fully realise the objectives of the project.
(d)   Studies an-1 relative performance of existing and
i-2-ro-ve-d-rrigation Practices_in Canal Command
The objectives of the study are:
i)   To carry out a bench mark survey on socio-economic and
agricultural aspects of the selected command area to
identify the water management and other problems of
the area.
ii)   To compare the improved irrigation schedules of major
crops with the existing irrigation practices in use
at the farmers fields.



: 74
AN  5
iii)   To determine optimum design criteria of border and
other methods of irrigation.
iv)   To improve the water use efficiency of crops through
adoption of improved farming practices other than
irrigation viz. balanced use of fertilizers, reclama-
tion on sodic soils etc.
v)   To study the effect of non-uniformity of topography
on field water application losses.
vi)   To devise appropriate cropping sequences for limited
supplies of water.
vii)   To find out relative role of 4 to 5 maior improved
farming practices viz. improved irrigation, improved
seed, balanced fertilizer use, preparatory tillage,
disease and pest control etc. in agricultural production
for rationalising use of constrained supplies of water
and other inputs.
viii)  To demonstrate the conjunctive use of saline under
ground water with canal water to check soil salinization.
ix)   To arrange mass adoption of improved irrigatiors and
other associated practices on entire holdings of
individual farmers of the outlet for improving water
use efficiency at the advanced stage of the programme.
The results of field demonstrations have following
indications:
i)     with normal rain, four irrigations to wheat acco;ding
to improved PAU irrigation time-table gave as much yield as



: 75 :
ANNEX 5
seven irrigation according to farmer's practice. Crops needed
more irrigation in an unusual dry year and when canal water
supplies were not timely available, Cotton gave high yield
with only four irrigations as compared to 6-7 irrigations
given by farmers.
ii)    Heavy presowing irrigation to wheat gave 100-200 kg/ha
higher grain yield of wheat than light presowing irrigation.
iii)   Optimum time for suspending last irrigation to cotton
was found 30th September, subsequent irrigation did not benefit
the crop.
iv)    With normal discharge of water course, optimum width of
the border was found 15 m for wheat and 18 m for cotton. When
discharge was subnormal, the appropriate width was 10 m.
v)     Alonqwith Nitrogen Phosphorus application is essential
for high yield of wheat. It increased water use efficiency.
But cotton did not need application of Phosphorus. Also cotton
required less fertilizer Nitrogen than the recommended rate.
A higher rate of Nitrogen only increase vegetative growth at
the cost of lint yield.
vi)    On sodic soils, application of 1½ to 3 tonnes/ha of
gypsum improved yield of wheat by 200-450 kg/ha and of cotton
by 50-100 kg/ha for same use of irrigation water. This practice
proved quite economical.
vii)   Lack of purchasing power,  inadequate  credit facilities
have been found as the major hinderances in the adoption of
improved agricultural technology.



: 76 :
ANNEX 5
The data collected so far indicates some useful improve-
ments in irrigation practices. It is proposed to continue this
study for another 3 years, so that it can be made popular with
the farmers of area.
(e)   Cro -Cu tina Exeriments
Some time in February, 1981, the World Bank experts
suggested to study the impact of canal irrigation and minor
irrigation on the yield of various crops and assessing the
utility of wara-bandi system in the State of Punjab. They also
wanted to develop objective indicators, which would help to
determine the optimal timing of investments for greater relia-
bility and flexibility of water supply from major irrigation
projects. A possible way to study this was by analysing the
data of crop cutting experiments being conducted every year by
the Agriculture Department Punjab both in Kharif as well as
Rabi season on major crops.
This study is very important for irrigation point of
view. The results obtained from this study may indicate approach
for saving of water and better management of the same and also
help in future planning of irrigation projects in the State of
Punjab. The basic data supplied by Agriculture Department is
being analysed with the help of computer. This study is likely
to be continued in Punjab Irrigation Project Phase-I1.

(f)   OrainaSe_and_Anti-water_logging
The study taken up consists of the following components:
(i)    Improvement in surface drainage system of about 4000 hec.
by constructing link drains and remodelling the existing
drains outfalling into river Sutlej.
(ii)   Construction of vertical drainage system by tu_ewells
on about 700 hec. with provision of the effluents to be
discharged either to waste in an existing open drain or
for blending with surface water in the canal.
(iii)  Construction of sub surface drainage on an area of 300
hec. with provision of the effluent to be-discharged to
an existing open drain.
(iv)   Construction of the drains to either side of 6 KM of the
Sirhind-Rajasthan Feeder canals and discharging to an
existing open drain.
(v)    Construction of net works of piezometers within the
pilot area for monitoring ground water levels.
The ProSress of otudY is as under:
Progress on the project component i.e. sub surface
drainage is slow due to non-supply of P.V.C. pipes by the
Rate Contract Firms in time and continuous dewatering of
sub soil water level to create workable conditions which put
this component behind schedule. The results of the study
are not available as the work for the same is in progress.

ANNEX -5
(i) Construction_of02oen Surface Drains
The Project provided for construction of 37 KMs new link
drains and 30.82 KMs remodelling of existing drains. Out of this
30.82 KM remodelling of existing drains has been completed. The
construction of 37 KMs new link drains is yet to start.
(ii) Construction of Surface Drains
The project provided for construction of sub surface
drains in 300 hect. area. This compor.ent was divided into two
parts as below:
(a) Construction of tile drainage system (using PVC drainage
and collector pipes) on an area of 200 hect. by lifting
the effluent into existing open drain or for blending
with water in a cnal.
(b) Construction of the file drainage system (using PVC pipes
drainage and collector pipe) on an area of 100 hect. with
provision to discharge the effluent with gravity in 6
existing open drain.
The progress and results of the study on soil test carried
out so far is described below:
(i)  Premeability_Tests
From the premeability values obtained, the area with
premeabi'ity values less than 1.0 m/day are the fine grained
soils and with premeability more than 1.00 m/day are coarse
grained soil. This information gives a broad distribution of
fine and coarse grained soils and will be helpful for locating
the new surface cum seepage drain in the area, in the Drainage
Department.



: 79 :
(ii)   Slin ity Status_of Soils
(a) E.C.Values
A study of results of the E.C. values reveals that the
salinity level in the soil in the study area is low to medium,
the values varying from 165 to nearly 2680 mmhcs/cm at 250C.
However, the average salinity in the soils is low and the order
of 610 mmhcs/cm at 250C. The results of the study show that
soils are not highly salin-.   at present in the study area.
The results of the soils study are being further co-related to
the field and the area of high salinity and their causes are
being investigated.
(b) PH Values
The PH values of the soil extract at all the test sites
reveal that the PH values is more than 7 and less than 9.50.
This shows a low to moderate alkalinity status of the soils
in the study area.
(iii) Soil Texture
The soil texture tests show a high degree of variation
of the sand, silt and clay fractions in the soils at different
sites. The soils in the study vary from sandy loam to clayey
loam to clay.
2. Ground Water guality_Tests
The water table in the study area was very low five
years earlier. The ground water in the shallower layer is built
up from fresh canal water. Therefore, the water in shallow
depth is expected to be of fresh and utilisable quality. To



: 80 :
ANNV1Y S
establish the same water quality tests were carried out on
water samples collected fr mn various depths below ground level
at 43 Nos. points in the study area upto 15 M depth. At each
site the water samples were collected from the depth of 4.5 M,
9M, 12 M and 15 M respectively. For collecting the water samples
at a particular depth, the hole was drilled up to that depth.
The water in the hole was bailed out. As soon as the water
aecummulated at the bottom of hole, the water sample was
collected and its quality was determined in the Central Testing
Laboratory. The increase of salinity in ground water quality
spreads from top layers to bottom layers. The study also shows
that upto 15 M depth, 70% of the ground water is of E.C.values
less than 2000 mmhos/cm at 25C -which has been recommended by
the PAU as utilisable water for direct irrigation of fields in
the area.
3. Puma Tests
5 Nos. pump tests on tubewells bores of 35 M depth and
S Nos. pump tests on 15 M deep bores were proposed to be carried
out in the project proposal. The following results were obtained
Zrom the test carried out so far.
(a) Pumg Test on 15 M Deer Ers
The pump tests were carried out on 2 Nos. sites. At both
the sites the test was a failure indicating that a normal single
.pipe tubewell is not possible for extracting water from 1S meter
tubewells. No more pump tests on bores up to 15 M depth are
proposed to be carried out.



:81:
ANNEX 5
It is proposed to design a multiple pipe bore tubewell
consisting of 4-6 Nos. 50 mm dia pipes connected to a single
central pumping unit for skimming good quality of water upto
15 M depth. Tests carried out by P.A.U. for such as design of
tubewell have revealed that it is possible to draw a discharge
of .3 to .5 cusecs from this type of tubewell. Some of the
farmers have already started installation of multi pipe tubewells
in the area. However, in the 2nd phase project it is proposed
to study the wo;king of the multiple pipe tubewells and to study-
the changes in the ground water quality on sustained pumping
from such tubewells. A successful design of skimming well of the
type described above will enable the installation of such tubewell
at farmer level and their extraction of ground water area on large
scale will prove a cheaper solution of water logging problem.
(b) Pump Tests on 35 M Deep Bores
2 Nos. pump tests have been carried out successfully on
35 M deep tubewells. The values of the transmissibility coeffi-
cient obtained at these sites, comes out to be 552.5 m2/day and
and 668.4 m2/day resoectively. At 3 Nos. more sites pump tests
will be carried on 35 M depth tubewells and results reported.

PROJECT COMPLETlON REPORT
Borrower Comments
TO GRAHAM DONALDSON, DIVISION CHIEF
AGRICULTURE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION, OED
PLEASE REFER TO YOUR LETTER OF FEBRUARY 23, 1989 REGARDING COMMENTS ON
THE DRAFT PCR FOR THE PUNJAB IRRIGATION PROJECT (CREDIT 889-IN). OUR
COMMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
PARA 10: THE LINING OF WATERCOURSES IS A NORMAL FEATURE OF INDIAN
PROJECTS AND THE FARMERS ARE NORMALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE BENEFITS OF
LINING.
PARA 14: A CONSCIOUS DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN BY GOP TO WAIVE RECOVERIES
AGAINST INSTITUTIONAL FINANCE IN VIEW OF THE DECLINE IN THE AGRICULTURE
PRICES AND THE SUBSEQUENT REDUCTIONJ IN THE INCOMES OF THE FARMERS.
RECOVERIES FROM FARMERS ON OTHER ACCOUNTS LIKE MARKET CESS, LOCAL
COMMODITY DUTIES AND OTHER FORMS OF INDIRECT LEVIES CONTINUED. GOP ARE
OF THE VIEW THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT TO CONCLUDE FROM THIS THAT
THERE IS LACK OF COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE
CREDIT RECOVERY.
PARA 15: WATER LOGGING AND SALINITY WERE NOTICED IN PUNJAB ONLY IN THE
LATE SEVENTIES. AT THE PROJECT FORMULATION STAGE GOP HAD FELT THAT THERE
WAS NEED FOR COLLECTION OF SUFFICIENT DP.TA TO ENABLE A FIRM VIEW TO BE
TAKEN. ALONG WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT PILOT STUDIES ON
SURFACE DRAINAGE, DEEP TUBEWELLS AND UNDER GROUND TILED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE WATER RESOURCES DIRECTORATE OF THE
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB. IT HAS ALSO BEEN FELT THAT A DETAILED STUDY WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE DATA ON TiE MOVEMENT OF THE WATER
TABLE AS A WHOLE. THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THROUGH
ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE WIDE GRID. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED
ACTION TO ADDRESS IT DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED PUNJAB
PHASE II PROJECT.
PARA 16: THE LAST SENTENCE QUOTE LESS SUCCESSFUL ASPEC  OF THE PROJECT
RELATING TO CREDIT DISCIPLINE IS CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL DIFFICULTIES
WITH AGRICULTURE CREDIT IN INDIA UNQUOTE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ANY
DOCUMENTATION EVIDENCE OR MATERIAL IN THE PCR. REGARDS.
