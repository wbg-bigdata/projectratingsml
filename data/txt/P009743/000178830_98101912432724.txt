INDIA
PUNJAB IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The State of Punjab, located in the northwestern part of India
was created in 1966 when the original Punjab was divided into two States:
Punjab and Haryana. Punjab economy is predominantly agricultural. Its
rapid agricultural growth rates have led to substantial expansion of agro-
industries and other supporting services. Generally, the State economy has
been well managed and Punjab has been the fastest growing state in India
since independence.
1.02      Most of the State's potential irrigation resources have been util-
ized. Thus, in order to maintain the tempo of past agricultural development,
high priority must be given to improvement of the existing irrigation systems.
The Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance to finance the
modernization of existing irrigation investments, which so far have yielded
returns that are below their potential. Project preparation was by GOP's
Directorate of Water Resources, assisted by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Program. A list of relevant reports by the State agencies and other related
documentation is given in Annex 4.
Agriculture in India
1.03      India covers some 3.27 million km2 of which 49% is cultivable and
about 11% irrigated. India's population of about 620 M is growing at an
annual rate of 2.0%. National income has grown at about 3.3% per annum since
1950 and the per capita GNP reached US$150 in 1975. Although average per
capita income has increased, in general there has been limited progress in the
living standards of the urban and rural poor which consist of some 250 M people
with annual incomes below the poverty line of US$70 per capita. Accordingly,
development plans of the Government of India (GOI) give priority to allevia-
ting poverty and creating employment, especially in rural areas.
1.04      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and con-
tributes about 45% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and
provides the base for about 60% of India's exports. During the last decade,
GOI development plans have emphasized agriculture and sought to raise food-
grain production by increasing the use of fertilizers, plant protection
chemicals, and improved seed varieties. In support of this, GOI has modern-
ized and expanded its agricultural credit institutions and accelerated the
development of irrigation.
1.05      Despite these endeavors and the impressive results of the Green Rev-
olution in some areas such as the States of Punjab and Haryana, annual overall
growth rate in foodgrain production over the last 15 years has been only about
2.3% or slightly above the population growth. Furthermore, India's agriculture



- 2 -
remains heavily dependent upon the weather and foodgrain production can vary
as much as 20% from one year to another. Major factors in reducing this
dependence would be the expansion of irrigation and the better use of exist-
ing irrigation facilities.
Irrigation in India
1.06      Up to 1964/65, the irrigated area increased at a rate of only about
2.1% per year, of which approximately two-thirds was from surface water re-
sources and one-third from groundwater. Since then, the rate of increase has
about doubled, mainly through an accelerated program of groundwater develop-
ment. At present, the irrigated area is some 50 M ha, about three-fifths of
which is surface irrigated and two-fifths served by groundwater.
1.07      The pace of surface water development remained relatively constant
at about 0.5 M ha per year until the end of the Fourth Plan (1969/70-1973/74).
During this period, the physical plan targets set by GOI for a more rapid
development of surface irrigation were never fulfilled. A major problem was
the pressure, mainly political, in the states to start as a large number of
projects as possible. Because of limited financial resources, this policy
resulted in long construction periods for projects and delayed benefits. In
recent years, however, budgetary allocations have grown and the authorities
have made concerted efforts to complete ongoing projects. As a result, the
irrigation potential created in 1976/77 was 1.1 M ha or more than twice that
achieved in any single year before the start of the Fifth Plan in 1974/75.
1.08      Actual utilization in many completed irrigation projects remains
significantly lower than the potential created. Some reasons for this are:
(i) water losses from the distribution system are significantly higher than
what is normally assumed when the irrigation potential is calculated; and
(ii) construction of watercourses and field channels below irrigation outlets
was left to farmers and often built to low standards. The Command Area Devel-
opment (CAD) programs, introduced in the early 1970s, attempted to improve
this situation by providing technical advice, organizational support, and
institutional finance to farmers in the command areas. Unfortunately, the
standards of water distribution still remained inadequate even under CAD
because costs of construction of watercourses and field channels are kept to
a minimum to encourage farmers to pay for these communal works. The vested
interests of farmers who, at present, benefit from inequitable water distri-
bution have also severely interfered with the CAD process. During recent
years, some states in India have adopted improved measures of irrigation
development, including: (i) construction of public irrigation systems down
to individual farms, or in the case of small holdings, as near as possible
to the farm; (ii) conveyance of water from the source to the farm outlet in
lined canals; and (iii) provision of controls in the system -- operated by
the project authority -- to enable a reliable and timely water supply to each
farm.
1.09      Groundwater development had been accelerated in the northwestern
part of India and in some states in the Deccan Plateau and in the South
(Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu); by 1976/77, about 85--90% of their
groundwater potential had been developed. Future groundwater development will



- 3 -
have to occur in the Eastern Region where about two-thirds of the potential
is to be developed and demand for tubewells appears to be relatively strong.
Bank Group Support
1.10      India's agricultural development efforts have been increasingly
supported by the Bank Group. In recent years, the Bank Group has been par-
ticularly active in the supporting of India's irrigation program. Private
groundwater development and other on-farm investments have been supported by
a series of agricultural credit projects in individual states and, more re-
cently, through lines of credit to the Agricultural Refinance and Development
Corporation (ARDC). Construction of irrigation infrastructure and land devel-
opment, designed to improve water use efficiency at farm level, have been
financed through a number of irrigation and command area development projects.
Marketing, warehouses, seed development, horticulture, cotton production,
dairying and the development of drought prone areas are other types of agri-
cultural projects that have received assistance. Recently, a new thrust to
increase production in rainfed as well as irrigated areas has been to provide
improved agricultural extension services. The Bank Group has approved credits
for improving extension services in six states and recently negotiated a com-
posite project covering a further three states. To ensure adequate research
backing for these projects, agricultural research at state level is to be
strengthened through the recently approved National Agricultural Research
Project (Credit No. 855-IN).
II. THE STATE OF PUNJAB
General
2.01      The State of Punjab, covering an area of about 5.0 M ha, has a
population of about 15.5 M (1978). The State is predominantly agricultural
with about 76% of the population living in rural areas. The agricultural
sector, which contributes about half of State income and employs about two-
thirds of the labor force, provides impetus to the State's impressive growth
record. Continuous economic progress is dependent largely on the removal of
constraints to further agricultural growth, particularly through expansion and
intensification of irrigation.
A. The Economy
2.02      Between 1960/61 and 1975/76, State income grew at an annual rate
of 4.8%, compared to an all-Indian growth of 3.4%. Per capita income, which
is about Rs 1,700 (US$200), grew at an annual rate of 2.8% compared to an
Indian average of 1.2%. Distribution of economic indicators by sectors is
as follows:

Primary sector has grown twice as fast as that in the rest of India, the
secondary sector 1.3 times as fast and the tertiary sector has grown slightly
faster than the national rate. In the primary sector, agriculture has grown
rapidly, and since its weight in the total State income is high (about 50%),
agricultural growth has influenced greatly the pattern of State income.

B. Socio-economic Conditions
Population
2.03      With a population of 15.5 M (1978), and an annual growth rate of
about 2%, Punjab ranks thirteenth among the states in India. It is India's
fifth most densely populated State with 269 persons per km2 compared to an
1971 Indian average of 167. Density is highest in the more developed Dis-
tricts of Ludhiana, Jullundur and Amritsar, which are also the most urbanized
parts in tihe State. About one quarter of the population belongs to the
Scheduled Castes. Unlike other parts of India, they are widely dispersed
throughout the State and they have shared relatively well in the benefits of
economic growth.
2.04      The labor force constitutes about 29% of the total population.
Female workers account only for 2% of the labor force and cultivators and
agricultural laborers for 43% and 20%, respectively. Mligrant workers are
available to meet construction needs and that of the peak agricultural season.

However, due to the lack of registration, it is not feasible to estimate the
extent of this seasonal migration nor to assess its impact on the employment
situation.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.05      The average farm size in Punjab is about 2.9 ha.  In the sub-montane
parts of the State, farm size is generally smaller than in the alluvial plains.
This is probably due to higher rainfall in the sub-montane area and the greater
population density. There are however, large variations in the distribution:

subdivision of the traditional family farm. The number of larger farms has
been greatly reduced and the number below 1 ha about quintupled.

2.07      There is evidence that the benefits of the Green Revolution have
reached all farmers 1/. However, the smaller farmers have benefited less
than larger farmers, due to, inter alia, higher risk aversion, lack of easy
access to institutional credit and more limited marketing opportunity.

2.08      Tenancy legislation, implemented since 1953, has been strictly en-
forced. Various related acts ensure the security of tenants. According to
the 1970/71 Agricultural Census, about 93% of all holdings were fully owned
and self operated, and 7% partly owned and partly rented.
2.09      Land reform was enacted in 1950 and revised in 1972 when ceilings
were imposed on family land ownership. On average, a family unit of five
persons can have either 7 ha of land which gets assured irrigation for at
least 2 crops a year, or 11 ha of land with one irrigated crop a year, or
about 21 ha of rainfed land.
Public Services
2.10      Punjab is well covered with a network of primary and secondary
schools. It is the first State in India which provides at least a primary
school in each of its villages. However, the literacy rate at 34% (1971
census) still lags behind the States of Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and
Maharashtra. Health centers are well spread throughout the State; each
serves about 20,000 people within a 5 km radius. The Government of Punjab
(GOP) has also been actively involved in rural drinking water supply. In
1977, about 39% of the villages in the State were provided with this service.
2.11      All of the villages in Punjab are electrified and agriculture
accounts for 42% of total electricity consumption. Annual per capita power
consumption is the highest in the country at about 230 kWh compared to a
national average of some 156 kWh. Well developed railway and highway systems
provide Punjab with good access to the rest of India. National highways are
connected by a comprehensive network of state highways and district village
roads. About 77% of the villages are already connected by all weather roads.
Development Strategy
2.12      The GOP strategy for the next five years will continue to stress
agriculture and rural development. The State Annual Development Plan for
1977/78 includes the following specific objectives:
(a) to continue the development of the main sub-sectors of
the rural economy, such as agriculture, irrigation and
electrification;
(b) to diversify the State economy by giving greater priority
to rural industries;
(c) to make adequate allocation for social services, such as
education and public health, with a view to maintaining
the existing rate of progress in these services;
(d) to create larger employment opportunities especially for
skilled and educated workers; and
(e) to promote investments designed to raise the standard
of living for the more backward rural communities [such
as the IDA-supported Kandi Watershed and Area Develop-
ment Project, presently under appraisal].

C.  The Agricultural Sector
General
2.13      Punjab farmers' are progressive and enterprising.  The State led
India in the "Green Revolution." In 1975/76, it produced about 7.2% of total
foodgrain production of India, while the net cultivated area was about 3% of
that of India. Productivity per agricultural worker and per hectare of
cultivated land is the highest in India.
Climate
2.14      The State has a sub-tropical monsoon climate characterized by wet,
hot summers and cool, dry winters. The average annual rainfall is 600 mm,
ranging from 900 mm in the northeastern parts of the State to 320 mm in the
southwest (Map 13873). About 85% of the annual rainfall occurs in the kharif
or monsoon season (June to early October). The rabi or winter season is cool,
extending from mid-October to early April. Some cyclonic rainfall occurs from
January to March, producing about 50 mm of rain in the southwest to about
100 mm in the northeast. This rain is valuable for the winter crops, espe-
cially where irrigation supplies are scarce. The zaid or hot weather season,
lasting from mid-April to mid-June, is dry with desiccating winds and occa-
sional dust storms. Temperature in the State can rise as high as 460C in
the summer months and fall to as low as 0°C in the winter.
Topography and Soils
2.15      Punjab divides naturally into two regions:  the sub-montane strip
and the alluvial plain. The former is located along the foothills of the
Shivalik range in the northeastern corner of Punjab. The southwestern region
of the State contains the alluvial plain which is part of the western portion
of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Soils in the sub-montane region have relatively
low fertility, consisting of beds of sand alternating with loams, clay and
loose gravel. The alluvial plain has more fertile land, varying from sandy
loam to loam, with some heavy clay occurrences in limited areas (Map 13874).



-8-
Land Use
2.16      About 4.2 M ha (84% of the total area classified for land utiliza-
tion) is under cultivation. During the last decade, the net area sown has
remained stagnant. The forest area is only about 0.2 M ha (4%), and cannot be
reduced further without seriously disturbing the ecological balance. About
0.6 M ha (12%) are uncultivable or put to non-agricultural uses. Thus, there
is little scope of increasing the net cultivated area in the State. The crop-
ping intensity (about 150% in 1975/76) is among the highest in India. About
4.1 M ha (65%) of the total cropped area is under foodgrains, 1.0 M ha (16%)
under cash crops, 0.04 M ha (1%) under fruits and vegetables and the remain-
ing 1.2 M ha (18%) under fodders.
Agricultural Performance (Annex 3, Table T1)
2.17      In the early sixties, prior to the Green Revolution (about 1965/66-
1969/70), the cropped area expanded slowly at about 1% per year. Foodgrain
areas remained relatively stagnant while areas under cash crops increased
slightly. Foodgrain production grew at a rate of 2.9%, slightly above popu-
lation growth rate of 2%. Cash crops performed better, particularly oilseeds
which grew at an annual rate of 15.8%. However, the increase was from a small
base.
2.18      During the Green Revolution, there were significant increases in
the areas under rice, wheat, maize, and bajra partly at the expense of barley,
pulses and cash crops. Yields increased for all crops, except for gram and
oilseeds. Foodgrain production grew at about 14.7% per annum as a result of
major technological breakthroughs in wheat and rice varieties. While the areas
under wheat and rice grew annually at 9.5% and 7.9% respectively, areas under
high yielding varieties or wheat and rice increased from a negligible amount
in 1965/66 to about 70% of the total area in 1970/71. Annual yield increases
were about 10% for wheat and 9.6% for rice between 1965 and 1970.
2.19      The tempo achieved during the teak years of the Green Revolution
has slowed considerably in recent years. From 1971/72 to 1976/77, foodgrain
production grew only at a rate of 3.5%, slightly above the pre-Green Revolu-
tion period.  However, rice production still retains its growth momentum with
area and yield increases at an annual rate of 7.9% and 5.4%, respectively.
Since 1971/72, wheat yields have largely remained stationary at about 2.5
tons/ha.  Barley production increased substantially at 16.5% per annum.  How-
ever, this is mainly due to a recovery in area which declined sharply during
the Green Revolution period to allow expansion of the area under wheat.  Ex-
cept for sugarcane, production of other cash crops has also grown at a slower
rate than that of the previous period.
2.20      The slowing down of agricultural production growth is attributed to
several reasons: (i) the weather -- 1972/73 and 1974/75 were extreme drought
years; (ii) increased cost of fuel has affected the profitability of tubewell
irrigation which was largely responsible for the rapid agricultural growth in
Punjab; (iii) increased cost of fertilizers in 1973/74 to 1974/75; (iv) non-
availability of high yielding varieties (HYVs) for crops other than wheat
and rice; and (v) groundwater potential has been nearly fully utilized.



2.21      While the slow down in agricultural production growth of recent
years is partly explained by unfavourable exogenous factors, it is clear
that the easy benefits of the Green Revolution have already been reaped.
Thus, further increase in the intensity of cultivation and crop yields is
increasingly dependent on better utilization of irrigation supply and
improved drainage in areas subject to seasonal flooding and waterlogging.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.22      Agricultural Research.  Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) is
responsible for agricultural research, which is undertaken at Ludhiana and at
regional centers located throughout the State. The research program is com-
prehensive, and aims at solving the problems of the farmer and at achieving
better utilization of farm resources. At the beginning of each cropping
season, a recommended package of practices is prepared for all important
crops; this includes crop varieties, tillage practices, planting dates,
fertilizer requirement, irrigation needs, and disease and pest control. Of
particular relevance to the proposed project is the Water Management and Soil
Salinity Program started at PAU in 1969 which recommends to farmers irrigation
schedules for the major crops. An efficient Department of Agricultural
Economics undertakes a wide range of farm management and marketing studies.
Agricultural research receives strong support from the State budget (about
Rs 8 million for 1977/78).
2.23      Agricultural Extension.  Agricultural extension is undertaken both
by the State Department of Agriculture and by the PAU. The Department of
Agriculture is represented at district level by a Chief Agricultural Officer
who is assisted by adequate staff including Subject Matter Specialists in
agronomy, plant protection and seed development. Additional support is pro-
vided by District Information and Statistical Officers, a Deputy Registrar
of Cooperative Societies, an Assistant Agricultural Engineer (Minor Irriga-
tion) and officers responsible for special projects (cotton, citrus, grapes,
land reclamation, etc.) depending on the particular requirements of the
district. At block level, there are normally from 3-5 Agricultural Inspectors
(graduates) under the Block Development Officer. At village level, Sub-
Inspectors of Agriculture are responsible for extension programs. Each Sub-
Inspector covers from 5-10 villages and supervises the Gramsevaks (Village
Extension Workers). Current staffing rates provide one village extension
worker for every 800 farming families. This staffing pattern is adequate.
2.24      In addition to normal extension activities, PAU provides a Farm
Advisory Service with 3-5 Subject Matter Specialists in each district who
organize farmer-training programs at district and block level as well as in
selected villages. Demonstration centers consist of the entire holding of
one farmer where the full package of practices for the different crops are
followed with the cropping pattern planned in accordance with the farmer's
resources. Adequate accounts are maintained and production is monitored
over the three year duration of the program. PAU provides a wide range of
specialized training courses for farmers, ranging from a few days to up to
one year. In addition, monthly journals for farmers in Punjabi and English



- 10 -
are widely distributed and there are radio broadcasts on agricultural matters
three times a day.
2.25      Agricultural Inputs.  Since 1960/61, there has been a large increase
in the use of improved seeds, chemical nutrients and mechanical power through-
out the State. Chemical fertilizer consumption increased from 5,000 to
373,000 nutrient tons between 1960/61 and 1976/77, or from an average of 1 kg
per ha to 60 kg per ha. There has been a three to four fold increase every
six years in farm power such as tractors, diesel engines and electric motors,
and pumping sets for tubewell irrigation. At present, the level of fertilizer
consumption is the highest in the country; there are about 8 tractors per
1,000 ha compared to the national average of one; and there are about 60
wells per 1,000 ha compared to an all-India average of 25.
2.26      To support the increased demand for inputs, GOP has organized an
extensive network for the sale of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers and
pesticides. Certified seed of all principal crops is produced and distributed
by the State Seed Corporation, which is assisted by a recent IDA credit (Credit
No. 816-IN). There are no shortages of seed for the main crops and adequate
amounts are produced to replace annually at least 10% of the statewide seed
requirement. The Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation
(MARKFED), an apex cooperative organization, to which service cooperative
societies are affiliated statewide, has the main responsibility for the pro-
curement and distribution of fertilizers, It handles about 170,000 tons of
nitrogen and 50,000 tons of phosphatic fertilizers annually and also covers
the sale of pesticides. In addition, there are numerous private distributors
which account for about 20% of fertilizer and pesticides distributions. As a
result, inputs are generally available within easy reach of all farmers.
2.27      Agricultural Credit.  Institutional credit organizations follow the
normal pattern for India. The cooperative banks, which provide short (up to
one year) and medium term (one to five years) credit at an annual rate of
interest of 12-1/2%, are organized on a three tier basis with the Punjab State
cooperative banks at the State level, 17 central cooperative banks at the
district level and 10,936 primary cooperative credit societies at the village
level. Recovery performance of the cooperative banks, which used to be ex-
cellent, has declined in recent years. Overdues of primary credit societies
were 17% of demand in 1967 and are now about 40%. The cooperative banks are
currently being rehabilitated by GOP. The Punjab State Land Mortgage Bank is
handling the long term credit (up to 15 years) at a rate of interest of 10.5% -
11% through about 43 primary land mortgage banks throughout the State. Per-
formance has been satisfactory, with a recovery rate of about 90% in recent
years. In line with recommendations from a study carried out by the Reserve
Bank of India at IDA's suggestion, GOP is presently considering a plan to
merge short, medium and long term cooperative credit institutions at all
levels. This would proVide an apex institution with 500 statewide branches
which would channel credit to 2,500 nucleus societies. Commercial banks
(CBs), which provide all three types of credit, have rapidly expanded their
lendings for agricultural purposes. In 1975/76, CBs issued about 15% of the
agricultural loans in the State. Private money lenders play only a relatively
minor role. Agricultural Credit is described in detail in Annex 8, Supple-
mentary Data Volume (SDV).

2.28      Marketing, Processing and Storage.  Punjab has a well developed
system of agricultural markets, processing and storage. Most of the trade is
through regulated markets which serve a specified area, covering about 100
villages within a 10-15 km radius. In addition, there are a number of pur-
chasing centers which operate seasonally (mostly in rabi) to limit the distance
between the farmgate and the marketing centers. Regulated markets operate
under the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act of 1961 through committees
comprising representatives of farmers, traders and local government bodies.
Produce is sold at open auctions and sellers are charged a market fee of 2% of
the value of produce sold. These fees provide for the operation of existing
markets, development of new markets and construction and improvement of farm
to market roads. At present, there are about 110 regulated markets and 470
sub-yards and purchasing centers in the State. About 80-90% of the total
market arrivals are foodgrains.
2.29      Most processing facilities in Punjab are privately owned.  There
are about 800 rice mills, 180 flour mills, 140 oil mills, 760 cotton ginning
factories and 6 sugar mills. In general, the present system of processing,
which is highly competitive, has responded quickly to increases of production.
2.30      Storage facilities are provided by five main agencies.  The Punjab
State Warehousing Corporation, MARKFED, the Food Corporation of India, the
Food and Civil Supplies Department and the State Government. At present,
total storage capacity is about 2.2 million tons. About 150 cold storages
have been established by the private sector for potato, fruits and vegetables.
D. The Irrigation Sub-sector
Surface Water Resources
2.31      The primary source of surface water in Punjab are the three Indus
tributaries: the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi Rivers (Map 13875r). The Indus Water
Treaty of 1960 between India and Pakistan, allocated to India the total
supply of these rivers which averages about 38,300 Mm3 (31 MAF) annually.
Since 1960, two major storage dams have been built: Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej
and Pong Dam on the Beas with storage capacities of about 7,400 Mm3 and
6,800 Mm3 respectively. The Thien dam, with a storage capacity of about
2,500 Mm3 is under construction on the Ravi River. When completed, the
ratio of reservoir capacities to average annual flow of the three rivers
would be about.40%. This would permit a reasonable degree of seasonal
regulation.
2.32      The surface water resources available to Punjab are almost fully
developed. At present, Punjab is served by a number of canal systems with
cultivable command area (CCA) and net irrigated area in 1975/76 as follows:

/a   Including the share of the State of Haryana.
2.33      Historically, the canal systems were designed for a cropping in-
tensity of only 78%, essentially to spread irrigation and thus to provide
"drought insurance" for as wide an area as possible.
Groundwater Resources
2.34      Statewide groundwater recharge is estimated at about 12,300 Mm3
annually of which about 1,800 Mm3 is lost to saline groundwater areas
(Map 13873). Present extraction by existing tubewells and open wells
(approximately 475,000 units in 1977/78) is estimated at about 7,000 Mm3 or
about two-thirds of the average yearly recharge. The majority of tubewells
are 'strainer" types with diesel or electricity driven centrifugal pumps,
delivering between 0.2 to 0.5 cusecs and irrigating 5 to 10 ha. These are
generally located within canal commands to supplement the available surface
water supply. Less than 1% of the tubewells are state owned. The watertable
has remained constant during the last few years, except for the southern part
of the State where there are localized areas of over exploitation.
Past Development
2.35      In 1960/61, the net irrigated command area in Punjab was 2.0 M ha,
or about 54% of the net area sown. By 1975/76, it had risen to 3.1 M ha, or
about 75% of the area sown. Over the same period, the irrigated cropped area
rose from 2.6 M ha to 5.0 M ha which represents an increase from 56% to 81% of
gross cropped area. Private groundwater development was slow from 1960/61 to
1965/66 but accelerated during the Green Revolution. From 1960/61 to 1975/76,
groundwater development, almost entirely in the private sector, accounted for
more than 80% of the increase in net irrigated command area as shown below:

2.36      Most major crops are irrigated.  Wheat alone accounted for about
70% of the increase in the irrigated cropped area during the period 1960/61
to 1975/76, with cotton and rice making up almost all the balance. The
general trends have been:

State Programs in Irrigation Development
2.37      Expansion of agricultural production is the cornerstone of Punjab's
development strategy. Since both surface water and groundwater resources have
been nearly fully utilized, Government recognized that expansion of production
would depend upon improved efficiency of water use. GOP is consequently
devoting an increasing proportion of its construction budget to that end.
2.38      Modernization of Canals.  The modernization of canals program was
initiated in 1974/75. So far, out of 14,480 km of the surface canal system in
the State about 960 km has been lined. GOP plans to modernize the remaining
distributaries and minor canals throughout the State by about 1988 at an esti-
mated cost of US$350 M (1978 prices). The primary objectives of the lining
program are to reduct seepage losses and thus increase irrigation supplies and
to help reduce waterlogging and drainage problems. Works completed under the
canal modernization program are of high technical standards (para 4.04).
2.39      Modernization of Watercourses.  The watercourse is the link channel
between the main canal system operated by the Irrigation Department and the
farm channels operated by individual farmers; each watercourse serves a com-
mand area or "chak" of about 220 ha which on average is farmed by about 40
cultivators (Map 13942r). Watercourses were constructed as earth channels.
They are the property of the chak cultivators (shareholders) who are jointly



- 14 -
responsible for operating and maintaining the system. This voluntary arrange-
ment does not work well. Poor maintenance has resulted in high water losses
and unreliable supplies. Also, at present there is no compensation for water-
course system losses when water supplies are allocated between farmers so that
operation becomes inequitable. Monitoring has shown that tail-end farmers can
receive as little as 50% of their allocation while upper reach farmers can
receive extra supplies. Lining of watercourses corrects most of these defi-
ciencies, saves water and improves distribution. GOP plans to line all water-
courses in the State (about 13,500) at an estimated cost of US$220 M; so far
about 1,100 channels have been lined.
2.40      Drainage and Flood Protection.  Punjab is divided into three main
drainage tracts bounded by the Beas and Sutlej Rivers. The land slopes to the
southwest with a large number of natural drains or "nullahs" traversing the
gently sloping plains. Surface flooding and seasonal waterlogging in the
State can be extensive due to poor natural drainage. However, the project
irrigation components are generally located on lighter soils with high infil-
tration rates and where drainage is not a serious problem. In addition to
surface flooding and drainage problems, inundation occurs in the flood plains
of the main rivers. After the disastrous flood of 1955, major drainage and
land reclamation works were started and accelerated in 1961 after a Statewide
Master Plan was prepared. The Plan was assisted by the Bank Group through
the Punjab 1/ Flood Protection and Drainage Project (Credit No. 15-IN) which
became effective in November 1961. The Project supported new river protection
works, the first phase construction and enlargement of about 2,400 miles of
drainage works, canalization of hill area torrents and purchase of heavy
engineering equipment. The project was successful and achieved its limited
objectives. Most areas in Punjab which are subject to prolonged flooding and
waterlogging are now protected sufficiently to ensure timely planting of the
rabi crop following floods in the preceding kharif season. The Drainage
Master Plan was updated in 1975 and proposed the construction of 1,160 km of
river embankment and completion of 11,270 km of drainage channels. By March
1977, about 790 km of embankments and 5,450 km of drainage channels had been
constructed. GOP proposes to continue this program with its own resources.
However, Bank Group support is being sought for the Kandi Watershed and Area
Development Project. This includes a generalized approach to catchment devel-
opment through reforestation, flood control, torrent canalization and reclama-
tion of protected land through soil conservation.
Project Formulation
2.41      The project would cover a five-year "time-slice" of the on-going
programs for the modernization of canals and watercourses. Present technical
practices would be generally adopted and some improvements would be introduced.
In addition, the project would undertake studies and pilot demonstrations in
selected areas in the State to test and evaluate advanced irrigation tech-
nologies.
1/   The project covered about 3.3 M ha throughout Punjab and Haryana which
has since succeeded as a separate State .

III. THE PROJECT AREA
Introduction
3.01      The project is mainly located in the saline groundwater areas south
of the Sutlej River in the districts of Faridkot, Bhatinda and Sangrur and
parts of Ferozepur District excluding the waterlogged and flooded areas (Map
13875r). Some project works would be implemented in the lower parts of the
Upper Bari Doab Canal command west of the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas
Rivers.
Topography and Soils
3.02      The project area forms the western part of the vast Indo-Gangetic
alluvial plain. The topography is gently graded and of low relief. In the
west, the plain slopes towards the Sutlej River and in the southwest towards
the desert adjoining Rajasthan. The plain is intersected by natural drainage
ways which are meandering and widely spread.
3.03      Soils are light in texture, varying from silty to sandy loams, with
some areas of dune sand in the southwestern portion of the project area.
There is little salinity except in areas with high water table. Almost the
whole of the area is already levelled, except for some sand dune areas which
are progressively being brought into production.
Climate
3.04      Climatological data for the project area is given in Annex 3,
Table T2. Annual rainfall averages about 380 mm with 85% occuring in the
kharif season. However, variations in timeliness and amounts of rainfall are
large which make irrigation necessary for reliable crop yields. While tempera-
tures seldom fall below OOC in the winter, ground frosts can occur in January
especially on sandy soils. This causes little damage to cereals, but more
sensitive crops like potatoes and mustard can be greatly affected. The pro-
portion of sunshine hours exceeds 50% in all months of the year.
Irrigation Supply and Use
3.05      The two main canal systems serving the project area are the Sirhind
Canal taking off from the Sutlej River at the Rupar Barrage and the Sirhind
Feeder which takes off from the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas Rivers at
Harike Barrage (Map 13875r). Annual allocations averaged about 5,700 Mm3 and
2,150 Mm3 during 1971-76 for the Sirhind Canal and Sirhind Feeder respec-
tively, but vary from year to year particularly in the rabi season (Annex 3,
Table T3). Where fresh groundwater is available, farmers have expanded the
irrigated crop area by private tubewell development. Present irrigated crop
intensity from all water sources averages about 124%. Water is the limiting
factor to any further increase in agricultural production. Accordingly, the
farmers practice light irrigation by conscious decision because this, in their
experience, provides the highest returns per cubic meter of water available to
them.



- 16 -
Land Holdings and Land Tenure
3.06      According to the 1970/71 census, the average farm size of the pro-
ject area is about 3.7 ha, somewhat greater than the State average of 2.9 ha.
About 65% were individual holdings and the remaining 35% jointly operated by
different households. Some 80% of the holdings were wholly owned and self
operated with the remainder partly owned and rented. Two forms of tenancy
are practiced: fixed rent and share of produce. All tenants are registered
according to the Security of Land Tenure Act (1953). The distribution of
holdings in the project area is similar to the pattern of the alluvial plain
region (para 2.05) with about 60% of holdings below 3 ha occupying some 20%
of the land.
Agricultural Development
3.07      Cropping Pattern.  The total cropped area is 2.3 M ha, which gives
a cropping intensity of 147% on a net cultivated area of 1.6 M ha. Wheat is
the main crop, accounting for 55% of the net cultivated area, followed by
cotton (26%). Other crops include fodder (15%), maize (11%), gram (10%),
bajra (7%), paddy (5%), barley (5%), oilseeds (4%), sugarcane (2%) and vege-
tables (2%). About 83% of the cropped area is irrigated. There is a sub-
stantial difference between rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Under rainfed
conditions and with traditional subsistence practices, the typical crop
rotation is bajra-gram. Due to the variable rainfall, crop failures are
common. Irrigation allows cultivation of a wide range of crops (Annex 3,
Table T4), with the two main crop rotations: Maize-wheat and cotton-wheat.
A paddy-wheat rotation is becoming increasingly important. The main agricul-
tural zones by dominant crops are shown on Map 13874.
3.08      Crop Yields - High yielding varieties (HYVs) of paddy and wheat
are the main foodgrain crops. Average irrigated yields per ha are 4.4 tons
for paddy and 2.5 tons for wheat. Wheat yields are still low compared to an
average of 3.5 tons per ha for demonstration plots. This may be due to late
sowing following cotton or paddy and a shortage of irrigation supplies in the
latter part of the season when water requirements are highest. Paddy yield
is also less than the average of 7 tons per ha on demonstration plots mainly
because rice tends to be grown in areas which are subject to local waterlogging
and flooding. Cotton yields are about 1.2 tons per ha for American varieties
and 0.8 tons per ha for Desi varieties; though double the all-India average,
these are still well below those obtained from irrigated areas in many other
parts of the world. Water shortages during the flowering and ball formation
stages are common providing ample scope for improving cotton yields with
better water supply. Yields of other cereal crops such as maize, bajra and
barley are relatively low since most of them are local varieties. Sugarcane
is grown on a small area, and the poor average yield of 50 tons per ha
reflects the low temperatures for two or three months during the winter.
3.09      Inputs Used.  Chemical fertilizer is widely used in the project area.
The average consumption in 1976 was about 50 kg of nutrients per ha compared
to 60 kg per ha for the whole State. Farm mechanization is also widespread.



- 17 -
There are about 10-12 tractors per 1,000 ha used mostly for land preparation
and threshing. There is a heavy reliance on migrant laborers from the States
of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh particularly during harvest season. At peak
periods there can be labor shortages and some harvesting of wheat and paddy
is mechanized.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.10      Extension and Research.  The pattern of extension services in the
project area is similar to that in the State (para 2.23). The existing staff-
ing pattern is adequate with a village extension worker serving, on average,
800 to 1,000 farm families. The Punjab Agricultural University has 3 research
regional centers and about 200 demonstration plots. Both basic and adaptive
researches receive adequate financial support and no additional funds would
be needed through the proposed project.
3.11      Credit and Input Supply.  The project area is served by 6 State
central cooperative banks and 3,294 primary cooperative credit societies for
short and medium agricultural credit, and 14 primary land mortgage banks for
long-term credit. Although the coverage of credit institutions is impressive,
the recovery performance has been inadequate in recent years. The overdues
rate for short-term agricultural loans was about 38% in 1976-77 compared to
the State average of 40%. The recovery rate of long-term loans was better
and reached about 80% in 1976/77. However, this is below the Punjab average.
The rehabilitation and reorganization of the credit institutions in Punjab
(para 2.27) will affect outlets in the project area and, inter alia, aim at
improving the recovery performance. There are about 95 branches of commer-
cial banks (CBs) in the project area and recovery rates are generally satis-
factory. Short-term lending by CBs to agriculture is limited but expanding.
3.12      Marketing and Processing.  The project area has about 40 regulated
markets, each serving between 50 and 100 villages. In addition, there are a
number of small purchasing centers scattered throughout the area. Deliveries
to markets are generally by bullock carts or tractors with trailers. Trucks
are used for transporting goods from markets to processing plants or distribu-
tion centers. Processing plants are widespread, consisting of about 190 rice
shellers, 210 cotton ginneries, 65 oilseed mills, 2 large flour mills and one
modern sugar factory. Most of the processing plants are privately owned.
Adequate funds and incentives appear to be available in the private sector for
any expansion in processing capacity which may become necessary in the project
area.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      Project components are formulated with the following objectives:
(a) to reduce seepage losses, improve operation and simplify maintenance in



- 18 -
the existing irrigation systems; (b) to improve water deliveries to farms
and minimize inequities in the distribution of water to farmers within the
command of the watercourses; (c) to introduce advanced irrigation techno-
logies on a pilot basis to enable future developments on a project scale;
and (d) to increase local capabilities in planning, implementing, monitoring
and evaluating.
Project Description - Summary
4.02      The project would include:
(a)  modernization of canals through lining of about 21.4
million m2 of canal surface (equivalent to about
4,060 km of distributaries and minor canals) and improv-
ing the canal structures within a command area of about
1.2 million ha.
(b)  modernization of watercourses through lining of about
15,200 km length of watercourse channel on about 2,820
watercourses serving some 620,000 ha.
(c)  studies and pilot demonstration schemes to test advanced
technologies for water distribution and on-farm works.
(d)  project monitoring and evaluation.
(e)  funds for technical assistance to GOI for preparing
irrigation projects in India.
Project Description - Detailed Features
4.03      Modernization of Canals.  The project would finance about 30% of
the on-going program (para 2.38). The following considerations would be taken
into account in establishing lining priorities: (a) seepage losses from the
existing unlined canals; (b) elimination of waterlogging adjacent to canals;
(c) control of water table in areas underlain by saline groundwater; and
(d) reduction of maintenance needs and improvement of operating efficiency.
Reduction of maintenance is of special importance in the canal commands served
from the Sutlej River below Bhakra Dam because the water supplies are rela-
tively silt free which encourages heavy weed growth. Existing earth channels
cannot be completely drained during canal closures and thus weeds proliferate.
4.04      Because of the relatively high cropping intensities which require
continuous irrigation, existing earthen channels cannot be closed for con-
struction purposes. Consequently, new lined channels would be built adjacent
to the existing unlined section. Most of these new channels would have dis-
charges below 200 cusecs and be aligned within the right-of-way of the exist-
ing channel. Lining would consist of a 1/2" layer of 1:5 cement-sand mortar
laid on the trimmed and compacted subgrade followed by a 3/8" layer of 1:3
cement-sand mortar. The 1:3 mortar layer would become the seepage barrier



- 19 -
protected by a single layer of 3" thick common bricks or baked clay tiles of
the same thickness laid in mortar. The lining would be extended up to a
maximum freeboard height of 1.5 ft capped by a concrete or brick coping to
prevent ingress of rainwater behind the lining. Previously completed lining
works are of high technical standards.
4.05      Some canal structures such as farm turnouts and check gates have
reached the end of their useful life; others are designed to standards which
do not enable the degree of regulation required today for the efficient dis-
tribution of water. Concurrent with the lining programs, about 3,500 struc-
tures and 5,000 outlets to watercourses would be remodelled or replaced to
improve operational control. Provision would also be made for more canal
escape facilities in areas where the drainage system is to be completed or
where existing drainage offers an outlet.
4.06      The unit rate for single clay tile lining is estimated at about
US$29.6 per 100 ft2. Canal modernization, including construction of new
structures or rehabilitation of existing ones, engineering and physical
contingencies would increase the unit cost to about US$39.5 per 100 ft2
(Annex 3, Table T5). Canal modernization is described in detail in Annex 5
(SDV).
4.07      Modernization of Watercourses.  The project would line about 2,820
watercourses of the on-going modernization program (para 2.39). Following the
evaluation studies by GOP on lined watercourses completed under the program,
the following design criteria have been agreed:
(a) the incremental production from the water saved by
reducing seepage from the channel must justify the
investment in the lining.
(b) no farmer in a watercourse command should have to
convey water for a distance in excess of 1,000 ft
from the end of a lined watercourse to his farm gate.
(c) the lining of any watercourse would be extended beyond
the limit described in item (b) above, in cases where
physical obstacles, such as depressio'ns or sand dunes,
make maintenance of an unlined channel difficult.
(d) the cost of lining should always be within the repay-
ment capacity of the farmers.
(e) after a watercourse has been lined, the water allocation
procedures or "warabundi" would be revised to compensate
for the faster transmission of water in the lined channels.
4.08      From experience gathered in the ongoing lining programs, and from
studies carried out on the effect of lining, the lower limit for lining would
be about 75% of the length of watercourse channel. However, if farmers



- 20 -
request it after being informed of the relative costs and benefits, the whole
length of the watercourse would be lined. An assurance has been obtained that,
on the basis of the guiding principles outlined above, GOP will prepare and
submit by December 31, 1979 to IDA for review, a design manual suitable for
use by the field staff responsible for design and implementation of works in
the watercourse command. A training program for field staff, based on the
guidelines expressed in the design manual, would also be carried out.
4.09      A typical channel section would have vertical walls made of brick
masonry on a brick slab over a sub-grade of a lean cement mortar mix. At
present, the brick lining is plastered with a cement-sand mortar finish which
increases the cost by about 15%. Studies on completed watercourses indicate
that the plastering has little or no additional benefit in terms of water
saving and might have the disadvantage that it can cover up defective brick-
work. Assurances have been obtained from GOP that by December 31, 1979,
PSTC will monitor and evaluate the present procedures and specifications for
plastering of watercourse lining and will prepare a report for IDA review to
recommend whether the practice should be continued. Farmers would be fully
informed of the additional costs and possible lack of benefits from plastering
before such works are implemented. Permanent farm outlets (or "nukkas") would
be provided with gates on both lined and unlined portions of a watercourse.
Permanent crossings over the watercourses would be constructed to permit
access by bullock carts or tractors to each holding.
4.10      The unit cost of watercourse lining is estimated at about US$2.2
per foot inclusive of minor structures, engineering and physical contingencies
(Annex3, Table T5). Field testing of various types of lining would continue
through the project period and specifications would be modified if improvements
to the design or implementation procedures are developed. Modernization of
watercourses is described in detail in Annex 6 (SDV).
4.11      Studies and Pilot Demonstrations.  On-going modernization programs
for canals and watercourses, including those to be financed under the project,
are based on established irrigation technologies and operating practices
presently used in Punjab. They constitute an intermediate technology which
can be implemented without risk or difficulty. However, when these programs
are completed and the known surface and groundwater resources in the State
are fully developed, new technologies will be needed to further improve the
efficiency of irrigated agriculture. To assist GOP in planning ahead for
such future developments, the project would undertake studies and introduce
and test advanced irrigation technologies and techniques, which are either
untried in Punjab or have only been attempted on a minimal scale. The follow-
ing activities to be tested have been identified and agreed with GOP:
(a)  advanced irrigation technologies on farms such as
sprinkler irrigation to improve water use efficiency
and to enable marginal land within the canal system to
be brought into command;



- 21 -
(b) alternative conveyance systems within the watercourse
command such as buried pipe systems;
(c) water storage by tanks or reservoirs for individual or
groups of farmers within the watercourse command area to
enable irrigation supplies to match crop water require-
ments;
(d) improved surface irrigation techniques and practices
on the farm;
(e) conjunctive use of marginal or saline groundwater
with surface supplies; and
(f) conjunctive use of fresh and saline groundwater.
4.12      Studies and pilot demonstrations to be implemented under the project
are given in Annex 3, Table T6 and detailed in Annex 7 (SDV). In addition
to technical considerations, the studies and pilot demonstrations would also
examine the social, legal, staffing and organizational problems which need to
be solved before introducing the works on a project scale. A special unit
would be established in the existing Directorate of Water Resources (para
6.09) to ensure adequate preparation, coordination, monitoring and evaluation
of the pilot schemes. Project support to this organization would include
equipment and vehicles (Annex 3, Table T7). An assurance has been obtained
from GOP that each individual study or pilot demonstration scheme to be
supported by IDA will be mutually agreed by the Association and GOP prior to
implementation.
Engineering Designs and Construction Methods
4.13      Present typical designs of irrigation work are acceptable to IDA.
However the nature of the project components are such that during the imple-
mentation period, designs can be reviewed on a continuous basis and improve-
ments introduced where necessary. Construction work would be generally labor-
intensive. Machines would be used for compacting earthworks for structures,
for concrete mixing and transportation.
Implementation Schedule
4.14      The project would be implemented in five years from July 1979 to
June 1984. The proposed construction programs for various components are
detailed in Annex 3, Chart C-1. The main construction season would be from
September to April although works can continue with minor interruptions
throughout the monsoon season. Since the rate of construction is based on
past experience, the proposed schedule is considered realistic.

V.  COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
Summary of Costs
5.01      Project costs, estimated at US$257.5 M equivalent, are summarized
below and detailed in Annex 3, Table T8. The cost estimates exclude taxes
and duties. The foreign exchange component would be about US$18.6 M equiva-
lent or about 7.2% of the project cost. Incremental annual operation and
maintenance (O&M) costs following completion of the project are estimated at
about US$0.9 M equivalent (or about US$1.5 per ha) for the watercourse lining
component.
5.02      Costs of civil works are based on existing unit rates (August 1978)
incurred in on-going programs. Unit prices for equipment and materials are
based on 1978 quotations, c.i.f. Bombay, with an addition for transportation
to Chandigarh or local procurement prices where applicable. Allowances have
been included for a five year supply of spare parts for equipments financed
under the project at a weighted average of 15% of the equipment costs.
Physical contingencies have a weighted average of 8.7% (Annex3, Table T8) and
reflect physical unknowns and the state of preparation of the designs. Price
contingencies are estimated at about 29% of the project cost based on the
following inflation rates:
Calendar Year        1978           1979         1980/83
Civil Works          8.0%           7.5%          7.0%

Financing
5.03      The proposed credit of US$129 million would finance 50% of total
project costs, including all foreign exchange cost and about 46% of local
costs. Modernization of watercourses in the project area would be financed
partly through institutional credit which would be refinanced by the Agricul-
tural Refinance Development Corporation (ARDC). Modernization of canals and
the studies and pilot demonstrations would be financed by GOP from its devel-
opment budget which includes a GOI contribution. The provisional financing
plan is given in Annex 3, Table T9. An estimated schedule of financing is
given in Annex 9 (SDV).
5.04      The credit would be made to GOI on standard terms and would be
channelled to GOP (US$82.3 M) on GOI's standard terms and arrangements for
development assistance to the states, and to ARDC (US$46 M). In addition,
US$0.7 M would be made available to GOI for technical assistance in the pre-
paration of irrigation projects throughout India. An assurance has been
obtained from GOP that GOP will include in its annual budgetary proposals



- 24 -
sufficient funds to execute the project in accordance with the implementation
and expenditure schedules for the five-year project period (Annex 3, Chart
C-1 and Table T10). An assurance has been obtained from GOI and ARDC that
funds made available to ARDC will be relent on terms and conditions given in
Annex 1.
Procurement
5.05      Civil Works.  Civil works, estimated at US$159.0 M 1/ would be
partly restricted to seasonal construction by the monsoon and would generally
be carried out through labor-intensive methods. Works would be relatively
small and scattered through the project area. Consequently, it is only feasi-
ble to group some works into contracts which might be suitable for inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB). For tendering purposes, civil works can
be grouped as follows:
(a) ICB Contracts (US$3.0 Million) 1/. This would include the main
structures in the modernization of canals. For practical reasons
and in order to encourage participation of local contractors,
tenders would be divided in ten sub-contracts and tenderers
would be permitted to bid for either one or more sub-contracts.
Also a preference limited to 7-1/2% of the contract price would
be extended to local contractors in evaluation of their bids.
Tender documents would specify this preference and the manner
of its application.
(b) Non-ICB Works on Canals and Drainage (US$54 Million) 1/.
Generally the works on the distributaries and smaller canals
to be modernized would be individually small, scattered over a
large area. They might have to be carried out intermittently
as determined by seasonal weather conditions and by the on-going
agricultural activities. These works would therefore be carried
out under small LCB contracts. They would be let after Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB).
(c) Unit Price Contracts and Force Account Works (US$102 Million) 1/.
Modernization of watercourses and some minor canals would have
to be implemented on a command area basis over a limited period
of time to minimize interference with crop production. Such
works would be awarded under small unit price contracts. Force
account would be used for works where quantities are difficult
to measure and would be limited to a maximum of 10% oL all civil
works. The department or agency responsible for implementation
usually procures key materials such as cement and coal (to
manufacture clay tiles and bricks for canal lining) through bulk
purchases following standard procedures of GOP. Materials are
supplied to contractors on a cost plus transportation basis.
1/   Cost of works, net of physical and price contingencies and administration
and engineering costs.



- 25 -
5.06      Vehicles and Equipment 1/:  The estimated cost of vehicles and
equipment for canal construction, the studies and pilot demonstration schemes,
and project management is US$5.2 M. Of this total, an estimated US$1.2 M
would be subject to ICB in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A prefer-
ence limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the prevailing
customs duty if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the eval-
uation of bids. Of the remaining US$4.0 M worth of vehicles and equipment for
which ICB is not considered appropriate, US$2.6 M represents groups of con-
tracts costing less than US$100,000 each, for which ICB would be unsuitable
and which therefore would be procured locally. The remaining US$1.4 M, mainly
of field vehicles, trucks and standard equipment, would also be procured
locally because of existing servicing and spare part supply facilities.
The local procurement procedures of GOP are acceptable to IDA.
5.07      A working group, with representatives from GOI, State Governments
and some contractors, has developed standard ICB and LCB procedures and guide-
lines to be used in all irrigation IDA-financed projects in India. An assur-
ance has been obtained that GOP would adopt ICB and LCB guidelines and proce-
dures satisfactory to IDA for procurement of civil works under the project.
Disbursements
5.08      The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment. For locally procured items,
disbursements would be against the ex-factory price, or where the ex-factory
price is not readily available, against 70% of expenditure. Disbursements
for civil works would also be on a percentage basis (55% of ARDC's refinance
for works financed through institutional credit, and 65% of cost for other
civil works). For project preparation, disbursements would be made against
foreign expenditures. Disbursements for force account works and for payments
of less than Rs 100,000 under civil works contracts and Rs 50,000 for equipment
and vehicles would be made against certificates of expenditure. Supporting
documents for these works would be retained by GOP and ARDC and made available
for inspection by IDA during review missions. Full documentation would be
made available by GOP and ARDC for other disbursements. The estimated schedule
of expenditures, the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit and a
schedule of disbursements are presented in Annex 3, Tables TIO, Tll and T12
respectively. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by July
1985, about twelve months after project completion. A condition of disburse-
ment for the modernization of watercourses component would be the preparation
of a Banking Plan by ARDC.
Accounts and Audits
5.09      Government departments and agencies would be subject to normal con-
trol and auditing procedures which are satisfactory. Assurances have been
obtained from GOP that agencies responsible for each project component will
maintain separate accounts on project expenditures; have these accounts
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; submit audit
1/   Cost, net of physical and price contingencies and administration
and engineering costs.



- 26 -
summaries to IDA within nine months after the close of their fiscal year;
and make available complete accounts and financial statements to IDA during
review missions.
5.10      Auditing procedures for ARDC are satisfactory.  Assurances have
been be obtained from ARDC that ARDC will require participating banks to main-
tain separate accounts for project lending, and that audit reports will be
submitted to IDA within four months after the end of the ARDC fiscal year
together with an audited ARDC statement on project lending to such banks.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization and Coordination
6.01      Punjab has a well structured administrative organization.  Under
the project, GOP would strengthen agencies responsible for project execution,
and establish procedures to monitor progress of project implementation as well
as to reinforce financial control. Project organization is detailed in
Annex 3, Chart C-2.
6.02      Overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with
the Financial Commissioner and Secretary for Irrigation and Power (FCSI). Two
agencies under his jurisdiction would implement the project: the Department
of Irrigation (ID) -- modernization of canals and the studies and pilot
demonstrations of improved irrigation technologies; and the Punjab State
Tubewell Corporation (PSTC), strengthened by staff seconded from the Soil
Conservation Department (SCD) -- modernization of watercourses.
6.03      A Project Coordinator (PC), reporting directly to the FCSI, would
be responsible for the day to day operations and coordination at the working
level between the participating agencies. The PC would head a small Project
Coordinating Unit which would: draw up annual development programs and the
necessary financial provisions for their implementation; collate expenditures
for reimbursement from IDA; prepare project reports and monitoring and evalua-
tion studies; and maintain an information link to project beneficiaries con-
cerning the project implementation schedule. Assurances have been obtained
that by July 31, 1979, GOP will create the Project Coordinating Unit and will
appoint a suitably qualified and experienced PC.
The Department of Irrigation
6.04      The Department of Irrigation (ID), with a staff of some 300 senior
engineers, is responsible for the planning, design, construction, and opera-
tion and maintenance of dams, hydro-electric power plants, irrigation systems,
and flood protection levees along the rivers and drains. Over the past 30
years, the ID has been mostly concerned with large-scale projects, such as
the Bhakra and Pong dams and the main canal systems. Completed projects are
functioning effectively. The ID consists of six Administrations (with two
additional Administrations proposed), each headed by a Chief Engineer (CE):



- 27 -
(a) the Canal Administration operates and maintains the sur-
face irrigation systems in the State and is presently
responsible for modernization of these systems;
(b) the Projects Administration undertakes investigation
and major construction of canals and hydel projects;
(c) the Drainage Administration plans and executes drainage
works. It is also responsible for the maintenance of
the drainage network;
(d) the Design and Research Administration is responsible
for designs of hydel plants and manages the Institute
of Irrigation and Power Research at Amritsar;
(e) the Thien Dam Designs Administration;
(f) the Thien Dam Construction Administration;
(g) the creation of a Canal Modernization Administration is
proposed by GOI for modernizing canal systems including
distributaries and minor canals throughout the State; and
(h) the creation of a Water Resources Administration is
proposed by GOP for groundwater investigations, special
hydrological and sedimentation studies. It will also plan
and design smaller projects that fall outside the juris-
diction of the other ID Administrations and provide plan-
ning and design services for other GOP Departments.
6.05      The Canal Administration (CA) is organized primarily on a canal com-
mand basis with five canal circles, one construction circle and one tubewell
circle. Each circle, headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE), consists of
about 4 to 6 divisions and about 25 sub-divisions. The main responsibilities
of the canal circles are O&M of the irrigation system. Since the improvement
works generally fall under maintenance, the CA is entrusted with the construc-
tion of lined distributaries and minors. In 1977-78, about Rs 85.0 million
was spent on modernization of canals through existing circles. The planning
and standard designs for modernization works are prepared by the circle
engineers and approved by the Directorate of Central Design, which is admin-
istratively under the Chief Engineer, Drainage Administration (see Annex 3,
Chart C-2). Their present work is adequate (para 4.04).
6.06      The Canal Modernization Administration (CMA).  The ID would expand
and reorganize the existing establishment within the CA to implement the
modernization of canals component. Experience has shown that one construction
circle can execute about Rs 30 million of canal lining works annually. To
match the project program, new construction circles would be created to a
provisional schedule as follows:

/a net of price contingencies.
In the year 1979-80, the existing operational circles in the CA would be split
to provide four circles specifically responsible for canal lining. These
circles would become part of a new Canal Modernization Administration (CMA)
headed by a Chief Engineer (Annex 3, Chart C-3). In the following years, as
the project program expands, the number of construction circles would be in-
creased to 6 by 1981-82.  The ID has sufficient resources available to staff
and service the expansion stage of the canal modernization program and create
the new CMA. There would be adequate existing facilities to ensure that the
new circles can become operational immediately so that the project schedule
can be maintained.
6.07      Operation and Maintenance of Canal System.  The Northern India Canal
and Drainage Act of 1873 (amended in 1975) and ID procedures provide comprehen-
sive rules and regulations for operation of all irrigation works throughout
the State. The CA is responsible for the O&M of the irrigation system up to
the watercourse outlets. Irrigation supplies are allocated to the farmers
within the canal command on a rotational basis (para 6.18) and follow well
established procedures. In 1976/77, the overall receipts of the ID from water
charges (US$10.3 M equivalent) exceeded the O&M costs (US$9.8 M equivalent).
An assurance has been obtained that GOP will make adequate arrangements for
efficient operation and preventive maintenance of irrigation works to
standards acceptable to IDA.
6.08      The Water Resources Administration (WRA).  While past emphasis of
the ID has been on construction of large-scale projects, GOP has recently
begun to give increasing attention to small-scale water development projects
and improved management of existing irrigation schemes. This change of
emphasis has required the collection of new data and development of new
planning skills. To meet this need, GOP has set up a Directorate of Water
Resources (DWR), presently reporting to the CE of the Drainage Administration
(para 6.04). In addition to collecting data, particularly for groundwater,
the DWR also undertakes the planning of smaller projects, particularly those
involving other GOP Departments. Under the Kandi Watershed and Area Develop-
ment Project, recently appraised by IDA, the Directorate would be strengthened
through the establishment of two new divisions: a Groundwater Investigation
and Trials Wing; and a Surface Water Hydrology, Sedimentation and Planning
Wing.



- 29 -
6.09      Under the present project, the DWR would be further strengthened
by the establishment of a Soil and Water Wing which would be responsible for
the studies and pilot demonstration schemes (para 4.11). Since the respon-
sibilities of the DWR have grown considerably compared to its original tasks,
GOP has decided that the DWR would become a separate administration of the ID,
to be called the Water Resources Administration (WRA), and headed by a Chief
Engineer. Initially, the WRA would be assisted in staffing through locally
recruited consultants, with specialties in water management, soil science,
agricultural economics, and agronomy. An assurance has been obtained that
by July 31, 1979, GOP will establish a wing in the Irrigation Department
responsible for the studies and pilot demonstration schemes.
The Soil Conservation Department (SCD)
6.10      Watercourse lining was initially the responsibility of the SCD
which was set up in 1969 as a branch of the Forest Department to deal with
on-farm development works. The SCD is empowered under the Land Improvement
Act (1963) to organize farmers within a watercourse command so that they can
obtain institutional credit for watercourse lining works. Farmers have to
agree to mortgage their lands though such works are communal. Participating
land development banks provide about 90% of the cost after the appraisal of
a scheme which is refinanced by ARDC; the remaining cost is contributed by
farmers (either in cash or by labor). Progress was slow because participating
farmers within a watercourse command have to agree to mortgage their land and
the majority of them have to approve a scheme before it can be implemented.
The Land Improvement Act was modified in February 1978 so that works could
be implemented if a majority of farmers approved a scheme. This has enabled
SCD to accelerate progress.
The Punjab State Tubewell Corporation (PSTC)
6.11      The PSTC was established in December 1970 as a corporate body em-
powered to utilize institutional finance. Its original responsibilities
included installation and management of deep tubewells and other works that
would improve irrigation efficiencies throughout Punjab. On formation, PSTC
was to take over all existing public tubewells, but to date, there are still
about 900 tubewells operated and maintained by the ID.
6.12      In 1974, GOP involved the PSTC in the watercourse lining program.
Under an amendment to the Canal and Drainage Act, the PSTC staff were given
powers to require farmers within a watercourse command to line their water-
course for its proper functioning. PSTC borrows funds from the credit insti-
tutions on behalf of the farmers. Participating commercial banks provide 80%
of the project cost which is refinanced by ARDC after scheme appraisal. The
remaining 20% of the cost is provided by PSTC from share capital and borrow-
ings from GOP. On completion of each watercourse scheme, PSTC sends a demand
list to the Revenue Department and the cost of improvements to the watercourse
is directly recovered from farmers after each seasonal harvest. Collections
made by the revenue authorities are transferred to PSTC to meet its obliga-
tions to financing banks.



- 30 -
6.13      Evaluation of Present Arrangements for Watercourse Lining.  Although
both the SCD and the PSTC have operated on-going programs satisfactorily, each
organization operates under different legal acts, financial arrangements, pro-
cedures and design standards. GOP has attempted to minimize the differences
by standardizing designs. However, certain differences between SCD and PSTC
cannot be eliminated; the most important being the different legal ordinances
and credit arrangements under which they operate. Even with amendments (para
6.10), reliance on the Land Improvement Act would mean that SCD's progress is
likely to remain slow and it might be difficult to expand operations to
meet a larger program. Under the Canal and Drainage Act, the farmers do not
have to mortgage their land, which overcomes the administrative difficulty
of clearing land titles and avoids the problem of a minority of farmers who
dissent from the command scheme. Thus, the PSTC operations are less cumber-
some and can easily be expanded. Consequently, GOP has decided that the
watercourse lining program under the project would be undertaken only by PSTC.
An assurance has been obtained that GOP will guarantee debt repayment by PSTC
for institutional credit for modernization of watercourses component in the
project.
6.14      Strengthening of PSTC.  Although PSTC operates on-going programs
satisfactorily, some improvement in management, better financial control and
additional staff would be required to handle the expanded work program under
the project. Additional staffing would be met by secondment of staff engaged
in watercourse lining from SCD to PSTC, from the ID cadre, and through direct
recruitment.
6.15      PSTC would have to undertake substantial expansion and reorganization
to implement the modernization of watercourses component. PSTC, headed by a
Managing Director, would have two operational wings, one for watercourse lining
and one for tubewell development together with some watercourses lining. Each
wing would be headed by a General Manager of the rank of Chief Engineer. The
field unit is a construction circle headed by a Superintending Engineer and
capable of lining about 400 Km of watercourses annually. PSTC would be ex-
panded by formation of new lining construction circles to match the project
program to a provisional schedule as follows:
Total No. of         No. of Circles       Additional
Year            Circles Required        in Position    Circles Requested
1977-78                 2                     2                   -
1978-79                 5                     2                   3
1979-80                 7                     5                   2
1980-84                 7                     7                   _
Expansion in 1978-79 would be achieved by secondment of staff in two existing
SCD circles and by forming a new circle to operate in the Faridkot District.
The structure of PSTC after this on-going expansion is shown in Annex 3,
Chart C-4.



- 31 -
6.16      PSTC would establish a Management Information Unit headed by a
Financial Advisor who would report to the Managing Director (MD). The func-
tion of the unit would be to modernize accounting and budgeting procedures
so that timely and reliable information is available to PSTC management and
financing banks. PSTC would also strengthen its existing Planning Directorate
to be headed by a Superintending Engineer who would report to the MD. Assur-
ances have been obtained from GOP that by August 31, 1979, the PSTC will:
(a) appoint a Financial Advisor with qualifications satisfactory to the
Association; (b) establish a Management Information Unit; and (c) submit to
the Association for its review and comments a management plan, together with
a schedule for its implementation, detailing the setting up of effective
accounting, budgeting and inventory control systems.
6.17      To promote progressive improvements in planning and design, PSTC
would build up a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit within its organization headed
by a Superintending Engineer (or an officer or equivalent rank from SCD),
qualified in this activity. He would be in charge of a multi-disciplinary
staff including an irrigation engineer, an agronomist, and an agro-economist
(para 6.19).
6.18      Operation and Maintenance of Watercourses.  Watercourse operation
is based on a time rotation or "warabundi" system with each shareholder in
turn taking the whole supply for a specific time based on holding size; the
ID only becomes involved in cases of dispute. Maintenance of watercourses
is the collective responsibility of the farmers but ID has the power to under-
take maintenance at the farmers' expense should they fail to act voluntarily.
Once a watercourse is lined, PSTC generally undertakes to maintain the channel
on a contract basis. Work is presently done at cost but PSTC intends to
standardize annual charges as an indexed percentage of the capital cost.
Unlined sections of watercourses are the responsibility of concerned farmers.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.19      Monitoring and Evaluation Units would be established in the Canal
Modernization Administration, the proposed Water Resources Administration of
the ID (paras 6.06-6.09), and the PSTC (para 6.17) to check project per-
formance. An assurance has been obtained that GOP will set up these units
by January 31, 1980.
6.20      These units would (a) monitor the project implementation progress
and costs of the works; (b) establish baseline surveys of irrigation water
supply and use, cropping intensity, crop yields, inputs used and farm incomes
in areas where the irrigation systems would be modernized; and (c) compile
annual changes in the above variables as a result of irrigation modernization
works. In addition, special studies such as the cost effectiveness of alter-
native technical and construction techniques and the evaluation of various
contracting methods would also be carried out under the project. These
studies and the monitoring data would form the basis for progress reports
and a project completion report to be prepared by GOP. Assurances have been
obtained from GOP that the progress reports will be submitted to IDA for review



- 32 -
semi-annually during the project implementation period and a draft project
completion report will be submitted within six months after the closure date
of the project.
VII. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
General
7.01      The project would accelerate agricultural development in Punjab by
modernizing the existing irrigation infrastructure. Through these means, it
would increase the production of foodgrains, oilseeds, cotton and other crops,
and provide additional year-round employment opportunities.
Cropping Pattern and Yields
7.02      Present cropping patterns and yields in the project areas are des-
cribed in paras 3.07-3.08. About 90% of the areas under wheat and paddy are
planted with HYVs and yields are well above the national average. In view of
this relatively high level of agricultural development in Punjab, no change
would be expected from the present situation under the future "without project"
condition. Modernization of canals under the project would reduce the convey-
ance and operation losses and thus would improve the reliability and quantity
of irrigation deliveries. Analysis of available data on lined distributaries
and watercourses indicates that water savings are used to expand the area
under irrigation rather than to intensify production. Thus, no change in crop
yields is assumed under the "future with project" condition. However, crop
yields on the incremental irrigated area resulting from the project are assumed
to build up uniformly over six years from about two thirds of average present
crop yields (Annex 2). This would moderately underestimate the benefits of
the project.
7.03      With the above assumption, the following shift in cropping pattern
is expected:

about 0.1 M ha from the 1.0 M ha where only modernization of canals would be
implemented. The annual incremental production at full development (about
mid-1980s), based on the estimated crop yield level (Annex 3, Table T4),
is expected as follows:

Sugarcane                                       546.8
Market Prospects
7.05      Punjab is a net exporter of agricultural produce, with the exception
of sugar of which it is a net importer. During recent years, foodgrain exports
have accounted for about 40% of total production. However, since India is
expected to remain marginally deficient in foodgrains and to continue import-
ing a significant amount of long staple cotton, the market prospects for all
major crops produced in the project area are favorable. The incremental
production would be readily absorbed in domestic markets. The State has a
well developed system for marketing, storage and processing of agricultural
produce (para 2.28) and no serious constraints to this system are foreseen.
Farm Incomes
7.06      The project area covers parts of the three major agricultural zones
in the State of Punjab designated by the dominant kharif crop: cotton, paddy
and maize (Map 13874). Three representative farm incomes for each zone have
been examined: (a) 2 ha, representing small farmers (60% of total holdings
and 20% of the area); (b) 4 ha, representing medium farmers (16% of holdings
and 17% of area); and (c) 7 ha, representing large farmers (24% of holdings
and 63% of area). Estimates of farm incomes are based on farm surveys, dis-
trict statistics, and the prevailing financial prices of inputs and outputs
(1978) and are given in Annex 3, Table T13. Financial crop budgets are pre-
sented in Annex 3, Table T14 and detailed analysis of farm budgets is given
in Annex 3, Table T15. The results are summarized below:

7.07      In calculating net farm incomes, cash payments for needs such as
fertilizers, plant protection, hired labor, rental charges of animal power
and tractors, and irrigation costs are included in production costs. The
project would increase net farm incomes on average by about 25-35%. Incre-
mental incomes per ha for various farm sizes would be:
---Incremental Incomes (Rs/ha)--
Zone             2 ha farm    4 ha farm         7 ha farm
Cotton              950           800             780

Cost Recovery
7.08      Capital and O&M Costs.  The capital costs of the project (less the
studies and pilot demonstration component) are estimated at Rs 1,709 M. The
investment in infrastructure works (modernization of canals) would amount to
Rs 783 M with O&M costs estimated at Rs 5.4 M annually. On-farm works
(modernization of watercourses) would amount to Rs 926 M with O&M costs
estimated at Rs 9.3 M annually.
7.09      Water Charges.  At present, different rates are charged for each
crop roughly corresponding to the amount of water utilized. The rates were
raised by 100% in 1974 from a previous level set in 1964/65 to reflect the
increased O&M costs and agricultural productivity. At present, the level of
charges is as follows:
Crop                  Rate (Rs/ha)
Paddy                       48.2
Wheat                       28.9
Other cereals               31.5
Pulses (gram)               22.1
Cotton                      33.3
Sugarcane                   81.5
Fodder                      18.5
Vegetables                  51.0



- 36 -
7.10      For a typical cropping pattern of the project area, the water
charge would average about Rs 35 per ha per crop.
7.11      Other Agricultural Taxes.  GOI is making a strong tax effort.  In
addition to water charges, the farmers have to pay land revenue at Rs 15 per
ha of irrigated land and Rs 2.5 per ha of rainfed land. Cash crops such as
cotton, oilseeds, and vegetables also bear a levy of Rs 15 per ha when cropped
on irrigated land and Rs 7 per ha on rainfed land. In addition, marketing
fees charged at 2% ad valorem of market arrivals, are effectively collected.
Based on the estimated incremental production of these crops at full develop-
ment, marketing fees resulting from the project would be about Rs 21.0 14
annually. Sales taxes also play an important role in the recovery process.
From the agricultural sector alone, the sales taxes are estimated at Rs 40.0 M
annually generated from a rate of 4% charged on foodgrains, pulses and cotton.
7.12      Repayment for On-farm Works.  Modernization of watercourses would
be financed by loans from the credit institutions. PSTC (para 6.12) borrows
funds from participating commercial banks on behalf of the farmers. The
lending banks would finance 80% of the cost of lining watercourses at not
less than 10.5% annual interest with a maximum repayment period of 10 years,
including 1 year of grace 1/. Loans provided by the lending banks would be
refinanced up to 80% by ARDC at not less than 7.5% annual interest with re-
payments to coincide approximately with expected collections from the ultimate
borrower. After a watercourse has been modernized, the State Revenue Depart-
ment would recover the cost of this investment from benefitting farmers as
arrears on land taxes and reimburse PSTC for its advance from the collections.
For a typical watercourse, annual payment by farmers is estimated at about
Rs 245 per ha of CCA. The annual O&M cost would amount to about Rs 15 per ha
which would be charged to benefitting farmers to give a total annual repayment
of about Rs 260 per ha.
7.13      Summary of GOP's Direct and Indirect Cost Recovery.  As a result of
the project, the level of cost recovery is estimated to be:
1/   This rate corresponds to the lending rate for the same purpose elsewhere
in Punjab. With an average annual rate of inflation of 2.1% during the
last three years, the real rate of interest would be 8.4%. Based on
long-term trends, the future annual rate of inflation is assumed to be
around 5%, which gives a real rate of interest of about 5.5%.

7.14      Farmers' Ability to Pay.  For the assessment of farmers' ability
to pay, the "project rent" has been estimated. The project rent is equal to
net incremental farm income less the necessary rewards to the farm family for
its labor, entrepreneurship and risk. The project rent, estimated for areas
covered by both watercourse lining and infrastructure works, ranges from
Rs 300-470 per ha for various zones (Annex 3, Table T16). For the purpose of
the analysis, a project rent of Rs 400 per ha is assumed. In areas covered
by both on-farm and infrastructure works, the water charges, repayment of
loans for watercourse lining and 0&M charges account for about 74% of the
project rent or about 40% of the incremental income. Thus, any further
increase in water charges may discourage farmers from participating in the
project.
Evaluation of GOP's Cost Recovery Policy
7.15      The adequacy of GOP's cost recovery policy should be evaluated in
terms of: (i) the usefulness of water charges to promote efficient use of
irrigation water; (ii) the need to generate public savings to finance future
modernization works in the State; and (iii) equity within the canal command
areas.
7.16      Promoting Efficient Water Use.  In general, volumetric water rates
promote a more efficient water use than acreage based water charges, but the



- 38 -
unlined watercourses existing at present, do not permit an accurate measure-
ment of the water supplied to each farmer. However, in Punjab, each farmer is
allocated a fixed amount of water, which depends on the size of his holding.
Because water is rationed, the farmer selects his crops and his intensity of
irrigation in such a way that he optimizes his return to water (para 3.05).
In the absence of major distortions in the relative price structure of major
crops, this allocation system generally leads to an economically efficient
use of water as long as the water rates per ha remain low.
7.17      Public Savings.  Although the water rates are relatively low and
contribute little to the State's revenue, GOP has made a strong effort in
resources mobilization by other means. Its revenues per capita is highest in
the nation at about Rs 207 in 1976/77 or more than double the national average.
Its tax revenues have increased from 7.8% of the State's income in 1970/71 to
8.4% in 1974/75. 1/ Since the State is predominantly rural and agricultural
income taxes are not levied, indirect taxes can be assumed to contribute about
90% of the total tax revenue.
7.18      GOP would directly recover 52% of project costs from the benefi-
ciaries. In addition, GOP would recover about 23% through sales taxes and
marketing fees on the incremental production resulting from the project.
This would bring the total cost recovery index up to 75% (para 7.13) and
imply that about 25% of the costs are met from the Government budget. How-
ever, this overestimates the net project impact on the Government budget
since the increased farm incomes would lead to a further increase in GOP
revenues through other indirect taxes. On the basis of agriculture produc-
tion and indirect taxes for the whole State during 1967/68 to 1974/76, it is
estimated that Rs 1.0 of gross value of production would generate about
Rs 0.05 in indirect taxes other than the agricultural sales tax. Under the
project, with a net value added of production estimated at Rs 450 M per year,
the indirect revenues generated would be about Rs 22 M throughout the life
of the project. Consequently, the net contribution from GOP budget would
at most be about Rs 230 M or about 16% of project cost.
7.19      Equity Within the Irrigation Command Areas.  The project would im-
prove water delivery to all farmers in the project area. However, as the
existing system favors some farmers, the incremental project benefits would
not be the same for all farmers. If the water charges are to be increased,
they have to be applied to all farmers in the command of the system. This would
not be politically acceptable to those farmers who would not benefit proportion-
ally from the incremental increase in the water supply resulting from the proj-
ect. If some other forms of cost recovery, such as a land betterment levy is
introduced, the assessment of the rate and its collection would be difficult
1/   The central taxes originating in the State should be added to obtain a
complete picture of the tax situation in Punjab. State-wide figures on
central taxes are not available but GOI's tax revenues amounted to about
11% of GDP in 1975/76. Thus, it can be assumed that the total taxes
collected at present in Punjab amount to about 20% of the State income.



- 39 -
due to the variation in benefits. Therefore, from the equity consideration,
other forms of taxes such as market fees would be more acceptable since, inter
alia, farmers who benefit most from the project would have to pay more through
increased marketable surplus.
7.20      Conclusions.  In summary, GOP's efforts in mobilizing resources to
finance ambitious programs in rural development have been commendable. However,
there are considerable problems involved in achieving equitable cost recovery
in all future irrigation modernization projects and a problem of generating
additional resources to finance these works. Since an area based water charge
might adversely affect production if it is set at too high a level, GOP should
investigate other alternatives to recover the investment cost while promoting
the acceleration of agricultural production. One alternative would be to
charge for water on a volumetric basis. This would allow farmers to vary
their irrigated area to maximize net returns to water irrespective of the
level of water charges. The modernization of watercourses would make it
technically feasible to establish volumetric water charges since water
deliveries to farmers would become reliable and can be measured easily and
accurately. Against this background, an assurance has been obtained from GOP
that it will undertake a study which would include: (a) alternative methods
of collecting water charges in modernized irrigation projects with special
emphasis on volumetric pricing; (b) the adequacy of the direct or indirect
taxes generated from the project; and (c) the effects of the irrigation sector
on the State's budget. The study will, inter alia, analyze farmers' ability
to pay water charges and other related direct and indirect taxes while main-
taining the need for farmers' production incentives. The study would be
submitted to IDA for review by August 31, 1981.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
General
8.01      The project would modernize the existing systems.  Thus, the project
would enable expansion of areas under irrigation in Punjab where surface water
resources have been fully exploited and only limited groundwater resources
remain unused.
8.02      Organizational arrangements under the project would strengthen
local capabilities for planning, design, monitoring and evaluation of project
components and thus lead to a general improvement in the technical and economic
viability of future projects in the irrigation sector. The project would
also undertake studies and introduce pilot demonstration schemes on advanced
irrigation technologies. These schemes would provide valuable information for
planning future works in irrigation and thus help accelerate agricultural
development in Punjab.
Summary of Benefits
8.03      The overall impact of the project at full development can be
summarized as follows:

Value of water at watercourse outlet (Rs/m3)                 0.60
Economic Analysis
8.04      The two main components of the project are independent from each
other and thus their economic evaluations can be undertaken separately. The
overall project economic benefits and costs would be the sum of the two main
components. Detailed analysis and basic assumptions for the economic evalua-
tion are given in Annex 2. The results are summarized below:
8.05      Modernization of Canals.  Lining of distributaries and minor canals
would (a) reduce seepage losses and thus increase water supplies to the pro-
ject area; (b) alleviate waterlogging problems; (c) reduce maintenance prob-
lems including weed growth; and (d) improve canal operation. Of these benefits,
only the reduction in seepage losses can be estimated. This depends on soil
types, the wetted perimeter of the channel section to be lined and the operat-
ing hours of a canal. The dominant soil type in the project area is silty
loam which gives seepage rates of about 5.0 to 6.0 cusecs per million square
feet of unlined channel surface. The seepage rate for lined channel is con-
servatively estimated at 2.0 cusecs per million square feet. Wetted peri-
meters are based on typical cross sections of lined and unlined channels with
capacities ranging from 10 to 260 cusecs. Canals are assumed to operate on
average over any year for 75% of the time. With these assumptions, the annual
water savings of the project are estimated at about 680 Mm3 or about 15%
increase in present irrigation supply at watercourse outlets. Since addi-
tional water is assumed to be used extensively (para 3.05), this would equate
to a 15% increase in irrigated area. The cost and benefit streams for this
component are given Annex 3, Table T17. The economic rate of return (ERR)
is estimated at 43%.
8.06      Modernization of Watercourses.  Lining of watercourses would reduce
seepage losses, provide more reliable water supply and ensure equitable dis-
tribution of water within the watercourse command. Economic evaluation of
this component is based on performance of existing lined watercourses in
Punjab. A sample of 18 watercourses shows that after lining about 50% of
the channel length, the average increases in irrigated area have been about
18% in kharif and 23% in rabi, or about 20% annually. Under these assumptions,
the ERR is estimated at 28%. The cost and benefit streams are detailed in
Annex 3, Table T17. Since the watercourses under the project would be lined
to at least 75% of the channel length, the ERR would moderately underestimate
the benefits.



- 41 -
Project Economic Rate of Return
8.07      The economic cost of all civil works, equipment, administration and
engineering, and operation and maintenance of the project have been included
in the derivation of the project ERR. Build-up rates of project benefits
differ for each component and give an aggregate pattern as follows:
Year              1      2     3      4     5    6   7-30
Benefits (%)      0      7    22    41    64   88   100
Since the works implemented under the project would have immediate benefits,
the rate of build up would be rapid.  The cost and benefit streams for the
project are given in Annex 3, Table T17. Discounting costs and benefits
over a 30 year period, the ERR of the proposed project is 36%.
Environmental Effect
8.08      The project would have no adverse environmental effects.  Some
benefits would accrue through reduction of salinity and waterlogging from the
canal and watercourse lining. As a result, there would be some improvements
in locations which are malaria prone.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.09      Several tests were made to determine the sensitivity of the project
to different assumptions in the following variables:
Economic Rate of Return

Variable       Change    of Canals   of Watercourses    Project

The results show that the viability of the project and its components is more
sensitive to exogenous decreases in output prices or delay in full benefits
than to an increase in construction costs or delay in ponstruction. Assumptions
on SCF and labor wage rates only show slight sensitivity. The project would
remain viable, even with an extreme combination of a 25% increase in construc-
tion costs, 25% decrease in expected benefits (which could reflect assumptions
on crop yield levels or incremental irrigated areas under the future 'with
project' situation), and a 25% decrease in output prices.
Project Risks
8.10      The overall risks associated with the project are those normally
associated with irrigation projects in India. All components to be financed
under the project would be implemented by agencies with proven experience.
Where weaknesses have been identified, the project provides for measures to
strengthen the capabilities of the participating agencies. Consequently,
the risks associated with the project is acceptable.
8.11      The northern fringe of the project area contains fresh groundwater
and lining of channels in this area would reduce groundwater recharge and thus
pumping potential. Analysis of the groundwater balance before and after
lining shows that the reduction in seepage losses from canals will reduce the
local groundwater recharge by less than 5%. Therefore, any reduction of
groundwater recharge within the project area is likely to have negligible
impact on tubewell development. The marginal cost of tubewell pumping has
been considered in the project justification. Comparison of benefits from
lining and the value of water that can be extracted from groundwater recharge
shows that lining is still justified in fresh groundwater areas (Annex 2).

ANNEX 2

PUNJAB IRRIGATION PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic Analysis
General
1.        The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs and inputs
are derived from the IBRD projected 1985 world market prices expressed in 1978
currency value with appropriate adjustments for freight, handling and process-
ing (Annex 2, Table 1). The projected economic prices for non-traded foodgrains
are based on the historical ratios between these crops and that of wheat and
paddy. The projected economic price of Cotton Desi (which is non-traded) is
based on long-term historical ratio between this crop and Cotton American.
The pricing assumptions are described below.
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
2.        Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was officially valued at a fixed
Pound Sterling rate. Since then it has been fixed against a "basket" of cur-
rencies. As these currencies are floating, the US dollar/Rupee exchange is
subject to change.. Conversions of financial prices have been made at US$1 to
Rs 8.60, which represents the projected exchange rate over the disbursement
period of the credit.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
3.        The benefits of the project components are evaluated at world market
prices which measure what India would have to pay for imports or receive
for exports. Most of the costs, however, are for items that are not traded
on the world market.  Tariffs and trade restrictions introduce a distortion
in the prices relationship between traded goods (valued at world market prices)
and non-traded goods (valued at local prices). Thus, the costs are not directly
comparable with the benefits. In crder to make them comparable, an SCF is
applied to the price of non-traded goods and consumption. In the absence of
trade restrictions, the SCF can be approximately calculated using the formula:
X + M
SC   -        X+ Sx  + M + Tm   1/
1,   X = fob value of exports at the official exchange rate (OER); M = cif
value of imports at OER; Sx = export subsidies; Tm = import duties



-49-
ANNEX 2
Page 2
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives an SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restrictions,
it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian Planning Commission
recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects the use of conversion
factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods that implicitly give a SCF
of about 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this estimate, a SCF of
0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
Prices of Agricultural Outputs
4.        The economic prices for major traded goods such as rice, wheat,
maize, cotton and sugarcane are based on their border prices at the OER. The
domestic cost components (i.e., local transport and marketing charges) are
adjusted by the SCF of 0.80. The economic prices for non-traded foodgrains
such as bajra, barley and pulses are derived by applying the historical price
ratios between these outputs and wheat to the economic price of wheat. De-
tailed derivation of the economic prices for major traded goods is described
in Annex 2, Table 1. A summary of all projected economic prices is presented
in Annex 3, T13.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
5.        Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world market price.
Tractor power, pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded,
and prices are adjusted for taxes and duties. The financial prices of
bullocks and miscellaneous charges have been multiplied by the SCF to express
them in economic terms.
6.        Analyses of farm labor supply and demand in various Indian irriga-
tion projects typically give an economic shadow wage rate for farm labor in
the range of 1/2 to 2/3 of the average financial wage rate. Due to high crop-
ping intensity all year round in Punjab, unemployment or underemployment in
rural Punjab is insignificant. Thus, the shadow wage rate is approximately
equal to the market wage rate. The economic cost of migrant labors (para
3.09), whose opportunity cost of labor is lower than the market wage rate,
would also include the cost of migrating. This is difficult to estimate due
to lack of reliable data. For the purpose of the economic analysis, the
shadow wage rate of migrant labor is assumed to be approximately equal to
market wage rate. With a SCF of 0.8, the economic wage rate of farm labor
is estimated at 0.79 of the average financial market wage rate.
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
7.        Various components of the project would use different mixtures of
equipment, skilled and unskilled labor. The following CCFs are estimated:

Modernization of Watercourses   0.08           0.53            0.19         0.80

/a   Traded items would have a conversion factor of 1, non-traded items
0.8, and unskilled labor 0.79.
Foodgrains Conversion Factor (FCF)
8.        The FCF can be estimated with the following formula:
Q rice x PE rice + Q wheat x PE wheat
Q rice x PF rice + Q wheat x PF wheat
Where Q:   Punjab production
PF: economic price
PF: financial price
In theory, all foodgrains should be included in the formula. However, since
rice and wheat account for 80-90% of Punjab's production, this formula is
accurate enough for all practical purposes. For an average of production
costs and prices from 1975/76 to 1977/78, the FCF is estimated at 1.28.
Build up of Project Benefits
9.        The estimated economic benefits of the project are based on average
cropping patterns which are representative of the project impact area. At
full development, the economic benefits are estimated at Rs 2,680 per ha in
the kharif season and Rs 1,860 per ha in the rabi season for incremental
irrigated area resulting for the project works. It is assumed that these
economic benefits build up as follows:
Years after       Modernization of Canals   Modernization of Watercourses

5               2,400       1,650            2,400           1,650
6               2,540       1,750            2,540           1,750
7               2,680       1,850            2,680           1,850

ANNEX 2
Page 4
There is substantial data to support the assumption that for modernization
of watercourses, full benefits would be achieved in the first season after
completion of the works in terms of incremental irrigated area. However,
there is no conclusive evidence to confirm that this equates to an equivalent
increment in agricultural production. Thus crop yield assumptions are con-
servative. The impact of the additional water supplies from modernization
of canals is more difficult to estimate; the deciding factor is likely to be
the amount of additional water in each canal command. If the increase in
water supplies is small, the farmers would be slow to expand the irrigated
area since they would need to establish that the additional water is to be
reliable and not simply a seasonal variation. However, for those farmers who
do not expand their irrigated area, it can reasonably be assumed that water
use per cropped ha would intensify and thus crop yields would increase.
Therefore, the assumptions on build up of benefits conservatively under-
estimate the impact of both modernization of canals and modernization of
watercourses.
Justification of Lining in Fresh Groundwater Area
10.       Although most of the project area is located in the saline ground-
water part of the State, fresh groundwater is available in some limited areas.
These areas contain only shallow aquifer. The installation cost of a typical
tubewell with an annual capacity of 50,000 m3 would be about Rs 10,000. At
an interest rate of 10% for 7 years, the annual capital cost for a well would
amount to about Rs 0.04 per m3, and maintenance cost would be about Rs 0.03
per m3 per year. Efficient pumping would give an average annual cost for
shallow tubewell water of Rs 0.12 per m3.
11.       The Central Groundwater Board of GOI has estimated that between one-
third and half of the water lost through canal seepage becomes absorbed in the
upper soil profiles in areas close to the canal where it is lost through
evaporation or non-productive evapotranspiration. Of the remaining quantity
that reaches groundwater table, only about 70% of the recharge can be drawn
locally. The rest of the recharge regenerates elsewhere where it may or may
not be useable. Thus, it can reasonably be assumed that between 35% and 67%
of the seepage losses can be productively reused. For the purpose of this
analysis, it has therefore been assumed that 50% of the seepage losses can
be utilized through pumping of groundwater.
12.       Evaluation of lining in fresh groundwater area is based on the com-
parison of the net present value of water saved through lining canals and the
value of that amount of water which could be lost to groundwater and be pro-
ductively used minus the pumping cost. Under the project, the net present
value of water saved through canal lining is estimated at about Rs 4,500 mil-
lion. This is compared with about Rs 2,200 million from pumping the water
saved (about 50% based on the assumptions in para 11) minus the pumping cost
of about Rs 200 million. Thus, lining in fresh groundwater areas, is justi-
fied from the economic point of view.

According to the report of Punjab Agricultural University on farm incomes (1976/77) entitled
"An Analysis of Income and Expenditure Pattern of Punjab Farmers", the following factors
would be applied to the weighted average to estimate net farm incomes of three
representative groups of farm size:
Farm      Size (ha)    Factor
Small         2.0          1.15
Medium        4.0          1.00
Large         7.0          0.90
Net Farm Incomes (CRs) for various farm sizes are as follows:
Zone/Farm      Small (2 ha)         Medium (4 ha)    La g  (7 ha)

1/ At full project development with weighted average of various far.ni sizes expressed in
Rs/ha (see Table T-15).
2/ Some studies of farmers' behaviour show that a simple approach can be adopted to take
into account the farmers' risk aversion by estimating a certainty equivalent valuie (CE) of
the expected value. The formul]a used is:
CE = EV - n x s
Where s: the standard deviation
n: a factor that explains the farmers' risk
aversion
The studies indicate that farmers' choice of cropping pattern and production techniques
can be predicated for values of "n" in the interval 1 to 2. For this analysis it is
assunmed thiat n = 1, since average farm size is relatively large (3.7 ha) and mostly
irrigated. The variation of the gross returns are assumed to be within 107 c,f the
average values.
V/ Valued at market wage rate.
4/ The reward for special skills that farm management requires and is assumed to
vary within 10% of the net returns.
