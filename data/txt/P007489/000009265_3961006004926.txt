TAX ADMINISTRTION REFORM PROJET
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrowr.Q    Jamaica
B_iefidarn:  Ministry of Finance
Amount;      US$13.20 million equivalent
Ters:        Payable in 17 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the standard variable interest
rate.
Qhjves:   The project aims at raising revenues without increasing tax rates by: (i) broadening the tax
base; (ii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration by (a)
strengthening the organization and management of tax department, (b) improving control
of tax evasion and (c) improving tax collections; and (iii) encouraging improved voluntary
compliance.
Desjiotio:.  The project would finance consulting services, training and equipment to: (i) Broaden the
Tax Base by increasing the n'.mber of registered taxpayers and reducing the number of
deductions, exemptions and concessions granted by the tax laws (US$1.1 million, or
2.6% of total project costs of US$42 million); (ii) Stbngthen the Organizotion and
Manage_ent of Tax Administrtion by restructuring the tax departments, introducing
modem management systems and improving training and remunerton structure (US$2.8
million or 6.7% of total project costs), and by constucting new Revemle Centers and
refurbishing existing tax offices (US$21.7 million or 51.6% of total project costs); (iii)
Improve the Control of Tax Evasion by strengthening the investigation, auditing and
assessment capabilities of the tax departments (US$3.8 million or 9.1% of total project
costs); (iv) Inprove Tax Collections by introducing new coUection systems and
improving recovery of tax arrears (US$6.5 million or 15.5% of total project costs); and
(v) Fadltate Voluntury Compliance by improving the equity, fainess and efficiency of
the tax system and reducing the cost of compliance (US$1.5 milion or 3.4% of total
project costs). Project coordination, including project management and cross-component
support for training, computerization and modificatons of the relevant laws, will cost
US$1.0 miUlion or 2.5% of the total project costs. Provision for price and physical
contingencies amounts to US$ 3.6 million, or 8.6% of total project costs. The project
would be implemented over a six year period starting mid-1994. Significant project
preparation activities have been financed by a PHRD Fund Grant of 51.5 million Yen
equivalent to about US$494,000.
Bendm .      The project will help to bring a large number of unregistered potential taxpayers in the tax
net and, thus, spread the tax burden more evenly. The number of registered taxpayers is
expected to increase by 10% in the first year and by 5% for every subsequen year of
project implementation. Elimination of loopholes in tax laws will reduce distortions in
economic decision making, besides increasng tax collections. The reorganization of tax
departments on functional lines wiU eliminate duplication of effort, improve information



v
flows and coordination, foster specialization and reduce administrative costs. A minimum
annual reduction of 5% in the administrative cost per J$ of tax collected and of 20% in
processing time for tax receipts is expected from the third year of project implementation
to the end of the project. In addition, a perception of increased organizational
effectiveness in critical areas, amongst the management and staff of the tax administration,
is expected to emerge from three organizational surveys planned during the project. The
construction of new Revenue Centers will extend the reach of the tax authorities and make
compliance more convenient for taxpayers. The refurbishing of existing offices will
improve efficiency by creating a better working environment. Modernization of
management systems, computerization, strengthening of the legal framework, training and
improved field operations will enhance the tax administration's capability to implement the
tax laws effectively and check tax evasion. A 10% increase in revenue collected per audit
and in the number of penalties levied and prosecutions launched for tax evasion is
expected beginning with the third year of project implementation. Further, 80% of
current tax demands are expected to be collected from the third year onwards, with the
current collection percentage increasing to 90% by the end of the project. Furthermore,
a 10% annual reduction in tax arrears is expected from the third year of the project up to
project completion. Reduction of the cost of compliance, improvement in the fairness and
equity of the tax system and vigorous enforcement will raise the level of voluntary
compliance. A more positive taxpayer perception of the tax administration is expected to
be reflected through surveys planned as a part of the project. Also, it is expected that
90% of total revenue collections will flow from self-assessment from the third year of
project implementation onwards, indicating improved voluntary compliance. The overall
effect of these improvements will be to increase revenue collections without increasing tax
rates. Over the medium term, increased revenues will er able GOJ to further improve the
tax structure and lower the tax rates.
Project Risks: The major risks to successful project implementation relate to scarce governmental
managerial and technical resources, and to the tax departments' limited capacity to absorb
change. To reduce these risks, external overseas and local consultants will be hired to
implement various components of the project along with local counterparts. Also, a
carefully phased work plan will ensure that changes are introduced in step with
organizational strengthening. Finally, a training program covering all revenue-related
functions will be organized to enhance the ability of managers and staff to implement and
sustain the reforms.

A. The Macroeconomic Eniroment
1.1          Janmaica, a Caribbean island country, Ls a total area of 11,000 square
kilometers, 45% under agriculture; its population, growing at about 1.2% per year, now totals
2.4 million, S5 % living in urban areas. Jamaican is well-endowed with natural resources and
had a per capita GNP of US$1,340 in 1992. It has a relatively well-educated and skilled
labor force, and possesses a well-developed financial system. The economy is highly
sensitive to international price and demand changes, and is entirely dependent on imported oil
for commercial energy consumption. The principal economic activities are bauxite mining,
alumina production, tourism, nmanufacturing, and, in terms of employment, agriculture.
Together, these sectors account for about 55% of the country's GDP, 50% of its employment
and 75% of its foreign exchange earnings.
1.2          From its independence in 1962 and up to 1973, Jamaica enjoyed steady
growth, with GDP expanding at 5% per year on average. After 1973, and through 1980, the
economy experienced a period of sustained contraction resulting from external shocks and the
domestic policies pursued at the time. Increases in petroleum import costs, the impact of the
recession in the industrial countries in the mid-1970s on sugar and alumina receipts, and the
increase in international interest rates, all affected Jamaica negatively. Government policies to
tackle unemployment and enhance the role of the State in the economy led to an over-
extended public sector and a disruption of production. At the same time, an increasingly
populist approach by the Government eroded private sector confidence, contributing to a
reduction in investment and an outflow of capital and skilled manpower.
1.3          By the early 1980s, the economy had clearly become non-viable. Its
excessive regulation and inward orientation for nearly a decade had led to severe losses of
output, employment and revenues. To remedy that situation, Jamaica embarked on a series of
reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy, developing exports and raising domestic savings.
In the first half of the 1980s, however, there was no economic growth. During the second
half of the 1980s growth averaged 3% per annum.
1.4          During the 1990s, the economy has become more open and buoyant. The
export base has changed, with non-traditional agriculture and manufactured items, tourism,
and other non-factor services becoming more prominent than bauxite, alumina, sugar and
bananas. Led by a turnaround of public savings, domestic savings are now well over 20% of
GDP. compared to around 15% a decade ago. Since 1989, the Government of Jamaica (GOJ)
has pursued a bold program of reforms, including a stepped-up privatization program, tax
reform, liberalization of the trade and exchange rate regimes, and containment of the fiscal
deficit. The present administration was re-elected by a large majority in March 1993 and has
reaffirmed its intention to sustain and accelerate the reform effort toward the goals of moving
the economy to growth rates of around 5% per annum over the medium term and improving
social conditions.
Macroeconomic Prosects
1.5          Real GDP growth projections for 1993-95 are initially in the low range as the
immediate focus is on the completion of the stabilization process. However, GDP growth rate
is expected to rise gradually to 4.5% in 1995. The challenges facing GOJ remain great in
view of its large debt obligations. Nevertheless, provided that the on-going adjustment effort
is carried through successfully, the economy shoudd emerge as more competitive and efficient.

main investment initiatives would be taken by the private sector, responsibility for developing
social services and much of the economic infrastructure would remain with GOJ. Barring
unforeseen negative external shocks, and assuming both the maintenance of sound
macroeconomic policies and the consolidation of GOJ's reform agenda, adjustment policies
should lead to a strengthening of the current account of the balance of payments. Projections
indicate a progressive narrowing of the current account deficit from 4% of GDP in FY92/93
(excluding grants) to under 2% in FY93/94 and to further reductions in subsequent years. On
the capital account, net direct foreign investment is projected to increase as the most recent
reforms are consolidated. Despite the narrowing of the current account deficit, Jamaica's
external financing needs will remain substantial (even after debt rescheduling). If this external
support can be obtained primarily in the form of grants and concessional loans, Jamaica's debt
overhang, and its debt service ratios, could be substantially reduced by the mid-1990s.
Main Economic Issues and Policy Agenda
1.6          Maintaining stability is critical to support GOJ's goal of rapid and sustained
growth. Domestic prices and export competitiveness are both closely linked to the exchange
rate; therefore sustaining stabilization requires maintenance of the exchange rate at
competitive levels. This implies running tight demand management policies, including the
achievenment of surpluses in the public sector's overall operations. GOJ is fully aware that
structural reforms must support these efforts. It believes that the most important structural
changes needed for this purpose are trade liberalization and the reform of the public sector,
particuiarly tax administration.
Fiscal Police
1.7          The keystone of the improved macroeconomic framework in Jamaica has been
the improvements in its fiscal operations. Public sector borrowing requirements, which had
risen from 5.4% of GDP in FY87/88 to 12.8% in FY88/89 (pushed up by the cost of
rebuilding after Hurricane Gilbert), declined to 6.3% in 1989/90 and to almost even balance
in FY91/92. GOJ greatly tightened its fiscal stance in the first quarter of 1992 and ended FY
91/92 with an overall public-sector deficit of only 0.4% of GDP (excluding divestment
proceeds and net of Bank of Jamaica losses). In FY92/93, GOJ achieved a small surplus for
the overall public sector. The central governmuent led in these improvements by moving to a
4% surplus position, but the rest of the public sector also improved its position. GO) planned
to increase the overall surplus to 2.5% of GDP in FY93/94, relying on a strong surplus from
the public sector outside the central government.
1.8          With this end in view, GOJ undertook additional fiscal efforts in FY93/94 to
provide for the large wage awards granted prior to the March 1993 election. These increases
were retroactive to April 1992, but were scheduled to be paid only in FY93/94. Their
combined effect was to leave an anticipated shortfall of 5.5% of GDP. To close this gap,
GOJ passed a budget package designed to increase tax revenues. Two thirds of the extra
revenue was expected from the General Consumption Tax (GCT), partly from an increase of
the rate from 10% to 12.5%, but mainly from closing loopholes (exemptions and zero rating).
The tax measures, estimated to yield 4.6% of GDP in FY93/94, substantially narrowed but
did not completely bridge, the gap. They, nevertheless, raised public concerns that the tax
burden is too heavy. Further increases in tax rates in the future do not appear to be
politically viable or economically desirable. Improvement in performance of tax
administration is needed to help GOJ meet its fiscal targets.
1.9          Over the past four years, GOJ has also made significant cuts in expenditures.

were the subject of study and recommendations as well, these taxes have not been
significantly altered in recent years. Import tariff rates are currendy being simplified and
reduced in accordance with the CARICOM Common External Tariff (CET).
Cgmnoggtion of Tax Revenues
1.11         In FY92/93, total receipts
of the Central Government amounted to
31.8% of GDP. Tax revenue, at 25.7% of
GDP, constituted 80.9% of total receipts,
as indicated in Fig. 1 above. Taxes on
income and profit amounted to 45.2% of                 (      4L6S)
total tax revenue in FY92/93, while taxes
on consumption, international trade and
property had shares of 30%, 24.5% and
0.4%, respectively. Fig. 2 gives the                    cr &Sr (313%)

are incorporated into general revenues.

B. Weaknesses in Tax Administration
1.16         Although substantial reforms in tax policy were carried out in Jamaica in the
past decade, tax administration continues to suffer from three interrelated problems which lead
to major constraints in revenue mobilization. These are: (a) the narrowness of the tax base;
(b) the weaknesses of tax departments, particularly in assessment and collection; and (c) low
voluntary compliance. These problems are discussed in detail in this section. The proposed
strategy for overcoming them is presented in Section C.
I. Narrow Tax Base
1.17         The tax policy studies of the mid-1980s found that about half of potential
individual income tax revenues were not collected '. Although the reform extended the
income tax net, and the introduction of a broad based general consumption tax (GCT)
improved indirect tax collections, the tax base continues to be narrow and there still remains a
significant gap between actual and potential collections.
1.18         The existence of a large number of unregistered potential taxpayers is a long-
standing problem. As illustrated by Table 1.1, there are an estimated 124,000 self-employed
persons outside agriculture, of which 102,000 are estimated to be above the standard
deduction level.2 According to the Income Tax Department, however, there are only 77,000
Table I.1: Individal Income Tax: SIf-Employed(FY91/92)
Number of Self-Employed: Non-Agriculture3                                  124,200

Number Registered4                                                          77,338
Number Filings                                                              23,000

registered self-employed persons and only about 23,000 of these filed tax retums in 1992.
Consequently, only 15% of the potential income tax collections from the self-employed were
actually collected. It is estimated that collections from the self-employed would double if only
30% of the non-registered taxpayers are brought into the tax system. The posidon in respect
of other taxpayers is understood to be similar.

1.19         The other major reason for the narrowness of the tax base is the large number
of exemptions, deductions, and concessions granted by the tax laws. These operate to reduce
significantly the amount of revenue collected (Annex 4).
H. Low Performance of Tax Administion
Deficiencies of the Orgaizational Structure
1.20         Tax administration is supervised by the Financial Secretary, who reports to the
Minister of Finance. The line organization is divided into six departments (Fig. 5), each headed
by a Conmmissioner. These departments are: the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) which
collects all taxes, except stamp duty, transfer tax and GCT on imports, as well as contributions
for the Human Employment and Resource Training Trust and the National Insurance Scheme;
the Income Tax Department (ITD), the General Consumption Tax Department (GCTD), and the
Stamp Duty and Transfer Tax Department (SDTTD) and the Customs Departmnent, which
administer the taxes and duties that their names imply; and the Land Valuation Department
(LVD) which conducts land valuations for the purpose of collecting Property Taxes.
1.21         Four other units reporting to the Financial Secretary have functions related to
taxes. The Revenue Board (RB), a statutory body, has a coordination role, besides carrying out
some central functions, such as legislation, prosecution, issuance of tax compliance certificates,
training and comprehensive audits. The Taxation Policy Unit (TPU) at the Ministry of Finance
carries out studies and analyses of tax policies with some assistance from the Revenue Board.
The Revenue Protection Division (RPD) looks after Customs Duty evasion as well as anti-
corruption work relating to the Customs Department. Electronic data processing is centrally
managed by a government-owned public company, Fiscal Services Limited (FSL). Table 1.2
gives the current staff distribution in various departments and agencies of the tax administration.

1.22         The organization of administrative departments on the basis of taxes has led to
the following administrative problems:
a.    Although many operational activities relating to different taxes, such as taxpayer
registration. tax auditing, investigation of tax frauds, collection and public
relations, have much in common, each department undertakes these activities
independently. This leads to duplication of effort and inefficient use of scarce
administrative resources.
b.    The tax-specific organizational structure has caused a fragmentation of
enforcement efforts. Each department owns a part of the information relating to
taxpayer activities and does not normally exchange it with other departments.
This prevents the tax administration from taking an integrated view of taxable
transactions and reduces its ability to detect tax evasion.
c.    Inefficiency caused by the dispersion of information hampers adequate
performance monitoring as well as formulation of strategies for institutional
development such as those pertaining to staff development, harmonization of
operational procedures, or the design of common records management.
d.    The centralization of data processing with Fiscal Service Limited creates
difficulties for the user departments in accessing information and correcting
errors (Annex 5).
e.    The multiplicity of tax departments increases compliance costs for taxpayers as
they have to satisfy the procedural formalities of each. These costs create
opportunities for misconduct within the tax administration.
f.    The current structure does not provide for an independent unit to prevent
Corruption in the tax departments other than Customs.
1.23         In sum, the organization of tax administration on the basis of individual taxes has
led to wanee in management, serious shortcomings in information systems, and inefficiencies
in ovell tax operations, particularly in taxpayer registration, assessment and collection.

Flgure 5: Existing Organizational Structure of Tax Administration
Skortcomings in Management
1.24         Staff Shortages. All departments are operating at well below their required
staffing strength. The fTD has an authorized staff of 489, but has filled only 274 of these
positions with full time staff. The GCTD, with 303 employees, needs an additional 50 Revenue
Agents. The IRD is also experiencing acute staff shortages. The Stamp Duty and Transfer Tax
Office is grossly understaffed. For example, there are only 6 officers to handle all verification
of declared land transfer values, and not one is a trained valuer. Only 12 officeis work in over-
the-counter stamp transactions. In June 1992 alone, they received 47,000 documents for
processing. In all the departments many managerial positions have been filled by insufficiently
qualified staff in acting assignments.
1.25    .    The shortage of personnel leads to work overload for staff and management,
administrative bottlenecks, inadequate auditing and investigation, poor follow-up of non-filers,
neglect of important management and house keeping activities, and irregularities in day to day
operations. For instance, in FY92/93, against 130,000 taxpayers on the ITD's records, only
32,000 actually filed retums. The Delinquent Investigation Unit could pursue only 18,000, i.e.
18% of the non-filers. Furthermore, against 32,573 returns pending, the departnent could audit
only 812 i.e. 2.5 %. Staff shortages also, inevitably, cause hardships to taxpayers.
1.26         Inadequacy of Skills and Training. Given the complexity of tax statutes and tax
administration, existing skills are insufficient. At the management level, training in planning,
budgeting, personnel management and public relations is inadequate. At the technical level,
knowledge and expertise in accounting, financial analysis, law, investigation, use of conmputer



9
tools are low. At the clerical level, skills in office procedures, processing of forms, maintenance
and management of records are deficient.
1.27         The government's Comprehensive Training Plan for 1992-1995 indicates the need
to train additional 120 Revenue Agents during this period. Although quite detailed in the design
of single training programs, the plan is not based on a deficiency analysis which takes into
account job profiles and functions. Training seems to be organized according to available time
rather than any definite career development plan for staff and is, thus, not perceived to be an
integral part of persomel management (Annex 6).
1.28         Insuficdent Incentives. In the past years Jamaica has experienced a substantial
decline in quality in civil service employment due to poor and declining real incomes. In 1991,
civil service salaries were significantly upgraded but not to required levels, and not for all civil
servants. Salaries in the higher grades increased much more than those in the lower grades.
Although this increased the compression ratio from 4:1 in 1982 to 8:1 in 1992, the same is still
below standard: a compression rate approaching 15:1 would be preferable in order to attract and
retain properly qualified managers. The differential between private and public sector salaries
(3-5:1) also greatly impairs GOJ's ability to recruit skilled individuals for tax administrationjobs.
At the same time, the low salaries tend to erode the integrity of tax administration employees
whose day to day decisions have major monetary implications for taxpayers.
1.29         In addition to low salaries, the existing performance monitoring and incentive
systems are inadequate, and career development is unsatisfactory. These difficulties affect the
management's ability to motivate staff. As a result, staff identification with the administration's
goal and the sense of belonging to an "elite" group, which is important to revenue agencies to
avoid widespread corruption, are low.
1.30         Lack of Adequate Managenient Information Systems. Management of the tax
departments is hampered both by inadequate information and poor utilization of available
information. This is the result of the fragmentation of information mentioned earlier as well as
the lack of efficient data collection and dissemination systems. Since most information is
manwally processed, accurate information to facilitate decision making is often not available when
needed. This affects the quality of planning, budgeting, accounting, personnel management,
monitoring and quality control.
1.31         In addition, lack of access to reliable data makes it difficult for policy analysts
at the MOF to accurately estimate the impact of structural changes or to forecast revenue yields
with any degree of accuracy. This increases the probability of taking policy decisions that lead
to distortions and inequity in the tax system.
Weaknesses in the Control of Evasion
1.32         Revenue collection decreases when taxpayers perceive that the risk and cost of
non-compliance are low. Not enough emphasis is currently being given to enforcement, which
is the only way that tax evasion can be checked and voluntary compliance encouraged. Very few
field audits are conducted. Not much use is made of the information available with other public
agencies. Investigation and auditing appear to be exclusively based on returns filed and
documents produced by taxpayers. There is very little effort to collect original evidence about
tax evasion. Audits are conducted after notifying the taxpayer and surprise visits to taxpayer
premises, which can be immensely effective in collecting evidence of tax evasion, are not
undertaken at all. No physical verification of inventories of business taxpayers is carried out.
Only six appeals are pending before the Revenue Court, there are very few cases of imposition



10
of penalties for substantive non-compliance, and no pending case of prosecution for tax evasion
(Annex 7).
1.33         Many factors seem to have contributed to this state of affairs.  The legal
framework, comprising of the Revenue Administration Act, the laws concerning individual taxes,
the Banking and Financial Institutions Act, and other general laws impacting on the administration
of taxes, does not provide adequate enforcement powers to the authorities (Annex 8). Some of
the tax laws prohibit exchange of information between departments, while other laws prohibit
banks and financial institutions from providing case-specific information to revenue officers. The
tax administration does not have an adequate system to manage and effectively utilize internal
information available to it. Its capability to collect information from third parties is also very
limited. The low level of computerization, further aggravates the situation. The deficiencies in
information lead to an indiscriminate and, mostly ineffective selection of cases for audit and to
a poor quality of the audit itself.
1.34         The organizational structure allows for little coordination between departnents
administering different taxes, as mentioned before. This prevents them from undertaking joint
actions against tax evaders and pooling their expertise and resources. As already indicated, due
to the low wage levels prevailing in the civil service the departments find it difficult to recrut
or retain competent staff, such as tax auditors having the legal, accounting and investigative skills
needed to conduct in-depth audits. Finally, field operations are hampered by the lack of transport
and other infrastructural support.
1.35         Weaknesses of Land Valuation. Jamaica has approximately 600,000 parcels, of
which 300,000 are registered in the Titling Office; the remaining 300,000 are held using a variety
of informal systems. The Land Valuation Departnment has mapped every parcel and it is the only
office in Jamaica to have this information. Although this data is computerized, it is kept in files
in the FSL's computers. Ad hoc reporting has to be requested from FSL, which is inefficient
given today's relatively inexpensive technology and user-managed approach to the use of
information.
1.36         The Land Valuation Department only values the land, the actual assessment and
collection ef property taxes is done by the IRD. There is no procedure to revalue property
parcels automatically. Revaluations are taken up approximately once in every decade: earlier
revaluations were done in 1974 and 1983 and another revaluation was completed in 1993. Given
the emotionally-laden context of property taxation in Jamaica, there is a reluctance to increase
the rate of tax in lieu of a revaluation. For these reasons, contribution of property tax to tax
revenues fell from a peak of 4.9% of total tax collections in FY77/78 to 0.4% in FY92/93.
Weaknesses in Collections
1.37         Collection of taxes is carried out by the IRD through 27 offices, called
collectorates. Only three collectorates are computerized. This, combined with staff shortages
and the legal constraints indicated in Annex 8, reduces the efficiency of the collection process.
The IRD takes about a month to prepare information on collections. Notifying a taxpayer of
noncompliance may take up to 6 to 12 months (Annex 9).
1.38         Even operations of the computerized collectorates are subject to major constraints.
Each collecting teller uses a terminal connected to a local area network to process the day's
collections, generating a file with information regarding collections by teller and by tax. This
is sent weekly to FSL in a diskette for further data processing and distribution of the information
to the appropriate departments. FSL, however, faces various problems such as obsolete
equipment, old and inflexible programs and high staff mrnover which affect its efficiencv.



11
1.39         Tax returns and checks are submitted by taxpayers to the Inland Revenue
personally or through the post. In both cases they are ordered and sent to the appropriate
departments to be input into magnetic files through terminals connected to the FSL computers.
However, for various reasons, many errors are introduced into the files. The nature of the
systems used at FSL is such that the some departments may consult their files, but not modify
records directly. This considerably delays correction of the errors.
1.40         In addition to slow collection of current revenues, the tax administration faces
major problems in collection of arrears. Since the records of delinquents are mostly kept
manually, it is difficult to know how much a taxpayer owes for past years. In fact, the tax
departments lack precise information on the total tax arrears to which the govermnent is entitled.
HII. Low Voluntarr Compliance
1.41         fTD and GCT statistics show a low level of voluntary compliance. As Table 1.3
illustrates, the Income Tax Department has about 77,000 registered self-employed taxpayers, but
only about 30% of these filed returns in 1992. Comparable rates for employers filing on behalf
of PAYE taxpayers and for companies are 45.7% and 20%, respectively. Sirnilarly, out of the
about 29,000 enterprises registered for GCT, currently, only 19,000 are taxpayers and 10,000
claim to be below the threshold. Large enterprises have a compliance rate of 83% to 87% under
GCT, while smaller enterprises have a compliance rate in the low 60% range. It is estimated that
there are about 12,000 additional businesses that could be taxed. Thus, there is a substantial gap
between the number of taxpayers liable to file returns and those who actually do so. This
inevitably translates into a gap between actual and potential tax collections, although the gap may
not be the same as in filing of returns because some PAYE employers pay taxes, but do not file
returns.

1.42         Low voluntary compliance is the result of three factors.  First, the tax
administration does not have a regular machinery to educate taxpayers about their legal
obligations, assist them in complying with the onerous procedural requirements of the tax laws,
and attend to their grievances. Second, the cost of compliance is high. Taxpayers face long lines
at the Inland Revenue Department when they pay their taxes. The filing and payment
requirements relating to withholding taxes are very complicated. Tax officials are understood to
make arbitrarily high initial assessments which force taxpayers to engage counsel and file
avoidable objections. To obtain a Tax Clearance Certificate, taxpayers need to first get clearance
from all the tax departments, excluding GCT, separately. Refunds for excess taxes paid are not
issued automatically, but need to be applied for. Thirdly, the need to raise revenues in an
environment marked by low voluntary compliance and administrative ineffectiveness forces GOJ
to raise tax rates from time to time. High tax rates, coupled with uneven enforcement of tax
laws, tend to aggravate the perception of inequity of the tax system and increase incentives for
evasion and avoidance.
C. Strategy for Reform of Tax Administration
1.43         Narrowness of the tax base, poor performance of the tax administration and low
level of voluntary compliance reinforce each other negatively and lead to a downward spiral of
ineffectiveness, inefficiency and inequity of the overall tax system. In order to achieve a
turnaround, a multi-dimensional strategy to deal with these problems will be adopted. This
strategy will accordingly aim at: (i) broadening the tax base; (ii) improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the tax administration; and (iii) facilitating voluntary compliance.
I. Broadenin the Tax Base
1.44         For a sustainable expansion of the tax base, efforts will be made to increase the
number of registered taxpayers as well as strengthen the legally-defined tax base by plugging
loopholes.
Increasing the Number of Registered Taxpayers
1.45         The first step in increasing the number of registered taxpayers would be the
nationwide introduction of a unique Taxpayer Registration Number (TRN). By amendment of
the Revenue Administration Act (RAA), every person having transactions with any revenue
departnent will be required to obtain a TRN. Since most potential taxpayers would have to deal
with one revenue department or another at some point of time, this requirement will help to bring
them into the tax system. In addition, revenue authorities will be legally empowered to allot a
TRN to any person who, in their opinion, needs to be registered in view of his likely liability to
pay tax. This would enable the tax administration to be proactive in spreading the tax net. The
TRN will become a taxpayer's permanent identification and he will be required to quote it while
filing tax returns, selling property. registering contracts and so on. Not only will the TRN help
to bring potential taxpayers on the tax rolls, but also help tax authorities to identify, consolidate,
cross-check and track their taxable activities thereafter. In designing the TRN, the exisding
identification numbers will be integrated into the TRN. Allotment of the TRN and recording of
taxpayer particulars will be done in a decentralized manner in the IRD collectorates, which will
be connected to a central computerized database located in FSL. Presentation to Parliament of
the aforesaid amendment to the RAA is a condition for disbursement.
1.46         linplementation of the TRN and expansion of the taxpayer base will be initiated
in the first year of project execution. To this effect, external surveys will be organized, in



13
phases, throughout the country. The surveys will be conducted under guidance of experts by
teams composed of revenue staff as well as persomel hired for this purpose. Four survey
operations will conducted.
1.47         Another strategy to bring potential taxpayers in the tax net will be to make use
of the information about taxable activities that is available with various agencies of government
and outside parties. It has not been possible for tax administration to effectively follow this
approach in the past due to legal constraints relating to information flow (see Annex 8) as well
as lack of computerization. Modifications of the relevant acts carried out through the project will
allow freer exchange of information and also enable tax authorities to obtain information from
banks and financial institutions, subject to appropriate safeguards. The planned computerization
of the collection and assessment functions and strengthening of the FSL would enable proper
collation, classification and analysis of information, which would help in identifying and
registering taxable persons who remain outside the tax system. Internal surveys of this type will
begin with cross-checking of information available within the tax  administration.  As
computerzation of taxpayer information proceeds and organizational capacity develops, more and
more information will be processed for this purpose.
Strengthening the Coverage of the Tax Base
1.48         With a view to minimize exemptions, deductions and other concessions that erode
the legal tax base, the tax policy unit in the Ministry of Finance will be strengthened.
Computerized models for statistical analysis, along with sample data bases, will be developed to
enable the unit to advise GOJ on the true impact of these tax benefits on the economy and the
revenue. Also the staff of the TPU will be trained in tax policy analysis and in design and use
of computer models. It is expected that this would significantly improve the quality of budgetary
decision-making and help eliminate loopholes in the tax base. In addition, the project will finance
a series of reviews of the tax structure in selected areas, such as the Company Income Tax and
Capital Gains Tax, to identify weaknesses and propose remedial actions.
II. Imyro,n  the Efflciency and Effectivens of Tax Adminision
1.49         Three broad initiatives are proposed to be taken to improve the performance of
the tax departments. These are: (i) strengthening of the organization and management; (ii)
improving the mechanisms to control tax evasion; and (iii) modernizing collection systems.
(a) Strengthng Organization and Mwwgement of the Tax Amnstration
1.50         OrganIzatonal Restucturing. To exploit potential synergies, the operational
departments of the tax administration will be restructured along functional lines. The nland
Revenue will collect all taxes and penalties. The Income Tax, GCT and, possibly, Stamp Duty
and Transfer Tax departnents will be reorganized to form an Assessment Department which will
be responsible for monitoring taxpayer activity, auditing returns under different taxes, conducting
investigations into tax frauds and prosecuting tax evaders. The Land Valuation Departnent will
have the sole responsibility for valuation of properties. In addition, to ensure a clean and
transparent tax administration, the jurisdiction of the Revenue Protection Division will be
enlarged to include investigation of allegations of misconduct and corruption against officials of
the tax departments.
1.51         The reorganization will be preceded by the development of a comprehensive
Master Plan which will define in detail the activities and schedule for the transition to the new
structure. The development of the Master Plan will be financed with a PHRD Grant awarded by



14
Japan. Agreement on the terms of reference for the Master Plan and on the short list of
consultants to prepare it was a condition of negotiation. Completion of the Master Plan is a
condition of disbursement. The reorganization itself will be carried out in two phases to
minimize disruption. The consolidation of Inland Revenue, the Assessment Departnent, FSL and
the Revenue Board into one Tax Department would be considered after the successful
strengthening of tax administration, on the lines indicated above.
1.52         Improving Human Resources Management. Staff shortages will be addressed
throughout the life of the project. Improvement of incentives, modernization of functions,
including computerization; better working conditions; and enhanced prestige and job satisfaction
flowing from improved organizational effectiveness would make employment in tax administration
more attractive to qualified individuals. Besides external recruitment, extensive in-house training
will help existing staff to fill posts involving higher levels of skills and responsibility. To bridge
the skills gap, a comprehensive program to address the training needs of management and staff
will be undertaken.
1.53         A revised salary scale will be implemented along with an improved incentive
scheme tied to objective performance evaluation and career progression. The introduction of
salary increases would be phased in, paralleling the expected revenue increases. GOJ, with Bank
assistance, is preparing a comprehensive Public Sector Reform Project which would include
salary revision. Given the importance of the tax administration reform to the sustainability of
the envisaged public sector strengthening, agreement by GOJ to the review of the compensation
structure in tax administration was a condition of negotiation.
1.54         In addition, human resource management will be significantly improved through
re-definition of functions at all levels; establishment of recruitment standards that ensure high
quality at induction; delineation of clear career development paths; and adoption of modern
practices to motivate staff.
1.55         Strengthening Management Systems. A thorough review of management
practices and systems will be carried as part of the Master Plan activities and suitable changes
will be introduced to tone up administrative efficiency. In particular, strategic planning, goal
setting, monitoring and performance evaluation policies will be revamped. Internal audit and
quality control functions will be strengthened to maintain a high level of organizational
performance. The Revenue Protection Division will be strengthened to enable it to investigate
allegations of misconduct and corruption against officials of all tax departments, in addition to
its present functions. Computerized administrative systems for planning, budgeting, accounting
and personnel management will be introduced. Security procedures will be put in place to protect
the integrity and confidentiality of computerized data. Operational manuals will be revised and
updated in line with organizational changes.
1.56         The management information system will be thoroughly redesigned to ensure
effective flow and exchange of information within the tax departments as well as between them
and the MOF, the Customs Department and other organizations.
1.57         Civil Works. In order to enable the tax administration to effectively monitor
taxpayer activity as also to provide better service to taxpayers, new Revenue Centers will be
constructed at Montego Bay, Spanish Town, Central Region, May Penn and Morant Bay. Also
to improve working conditions the existing tax offices will be refurbished. The entire cost of
these civil works will be borne by GOJ out of its own resources.



15
(i) Improvng Control of Tax Evasion
1.58         Creation and Strengthening of the Assessment Department.  As already
mentioned, the new Assessment Department will have the primary responsibility for controlling
tax evasion. The merging of the functions of the Income Tax, GCT and Stamp Duty and
Transfer Tax departments will end the fragmentation of information pertaining to taxable
activities. It will give the tax administration a broader perspective which will enable it to combat
tax fraud more effectively. The pooling of auditing and investigation expertise will make it
possible for the Assessment Department to simultaneously investigate the tax liabilities of a given
taxpayer under different tax laws. The department will be provided with computers and
analytical tools to investigate cases of suspected tax evasion. A comprehensive taxpayer database,
readily accessible to the department, will be maintained at FSL. In order to improve the
productivity of tax audits, an objective audit selection policy will be devised. Officials in-charge
of anti-evasion work will be thoroughly trained in tax laws, accounting, financial analysis and
investigation techniques so as to equip them for dealing with sophisticated tax frauds.
1.59         To enable the tax administration to move from desk-bound audits to high-visibility
field operations and a vigorous enforcement of tax laws, the administrative provisions of the tax
laws (Income Tax Act, GCT Act, Transfer Tax Act, etc.), the provisions of the Banking and
Financial Institutions Act governing supply of information to tax authorities and the other laws
related to tax enforcement will be amended (Annex 8). Tax authorities will be given powers of
search and seizure, impounding of original incriminating documents, and requisitioning of
information from third parties including banks and financial institutions. Legal prohioitions on
exchange of information between tax departments will be removed. Their powers to survey
business premises and impose penalties for non-compliance will be enhanced and the penal
provisions of the tax laws will be reviewed to ensure that these have adequate deterrent effect.
Presentation to Parliament of amendments to the administrative and procedural provisions of the
tax laws, as agreed with the Bank, is a condition of disbursement. In addition, during project
execution further examination of tax statutes will be carried out to harmonize their provisions,
streamline assessment procedures, limit administrative discretion in determination of tax liability,
and improve the appellate structure.
1.60         To increase the mobility of enforcement officials, vehicles will be purhased. In
order to free GOJ from the significant recurring burden of maintenance, insurance and drivers'
salaries and also improve the attractiveness of employment in tax administration with a view to
hire and retain qualified individuals, a substantial number of vehicles would be leased to staff and
managers of the tax departments engaged in field operations. The lessees would be required to
use these vehicles primarily for official work and would be respopsible for their maintenance and
insurance. In case a staff member ceases to work in tax acinimistration, the lease will be
cancelled. The lessees will have the option to buy the vehicles after a stipulated period of not
less than 4 years. The adoption of a leasing program, satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition for
disbursement of the related expenditures. In addition to the leased vehicles, multi-passenger
vehicles will be procured for use by the tax departments.
1.61         Arrangements will be worked out to ensure adequate physical protection to staff
engaged in field operations. To improve the targeting of field operations, revenue intelligence
networks will be strengthened by establishing systems for the purchase of information and for
rewarding informants. In view of the wide-spread impact of effective field work on overall levels
of voluntary compliance, it will be given central importance in the work strategy of the
Assessment Department.
1.62         Since the gain to government from effective investigation and auditing will be
crystallized only if assessments are upheld on appeal, officials of the Assessment Department will



16
be trained in proper marshalling of evidence and drafting of orders to ensure that the additional
taxes assessed by them are sustained in court. To upgrade the level of representation on behalf
of the government before the appellate and judicial authorities, the legal unit v ill be strengthened
by recruiting lawyers, upgrading the legal library and developing a legal database.
1.63         Strengthening the Land Valuation Department. Valuation of properties has
significant tax implications. Therefore, the Land Valuation Department will be strengthened by
providing it with computers and by creating a database that will enable flexible and rapid queries
and reports and, thus, increase the efficiency of the department. The staff of the department will
be further trained in valuation techniques.
1.64         In order to solve the problem of land valuations becoming outdated due to
infrequent revision, the feasibility of introducing automatic revaluation mechanisms in the law
will be considered.
(c) Modernizng Collection Systems.
1.65         The collection efficiency of the Inland Revenue Department will be markedly
increased through a comprehensive computerization of its operations.  One option is to
commission two types of systems. The first type would have two modules: the Large Taxpayer
Collection Module (LTCM), which would process returns and payments of the 15-20% of
taxpayers who contribute more than 80% of total revenue and thus require close monitoring,
would be installed at the larger collectorates beginning with St. Andrew and Kingston. The
Generalized Taxpayer Collection Module (GTCM), which would collect somewhat less
information but for a much larger number of small taxpayers, would be installed in the 10 largest
collectorates to control returns and payments of such taxpayers within their respective areas. The
second system, the Remote Taxpayer Collection System (RTCS) would capture information for
both large and suiall taxpayers and would be installed in the 17 smaller collectorates. Unlike the
first system, the RTCS would not verify arithmetic, taxpayer identification number, amounts
outstanding, etc., but would merely capture data which would be periodically sent to a designated
collectorate (one of the 10 largest) for processing. Information from the databases of the ten
largest collectorates, which would include information received from the smaller collectorates,
will be periodically aggregated at headquarters for use by all departments through
telecommunication links.
1.66         The collection systems described above, as well as the aggregation system, have
been developed and are being successfully used in Argentina by the General Tax Directorate
(DGI). The Government of Argentina has indicated its willingness to enter into a transfer-of-
technology agreement with GOJ to enable it to modify and use these systems. An official request
for transfer of the Argentine Systems, in the form of a letter from the Ministry of Finance to the
Director General of the Argentine Tax Authority, was a condition of negotiation. Modification
of the Large Taxpayer Collection Module to fit the requirements of Jamaica (including
translation into English) would be financed by the PHRD Grant. The system would be evaluated
by the Inla.nd Revenue Department. If it proves suitable, the additional systems will be modified
and installed, otherwise, new systems would be designed. Evaluation of the Argentinean tax
collection system and other alternatives and selection, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, of
the system to be implemented is a condition of disbursement.
1.67         The introduction of new technology would be accompanied by training of the
Inland Revenue Department staff in the use of the systems as well as office refurbishing to
accommodate the equipment and create better work space for the staff. To enable FSL to
perform efficiently its role as the central repository of computer data and the main EDP support
unit for user departments, its functions will be revised to make more efficient use of available



17
resources by eliminating in great part its system development responsibilities in favor of user
support and training. FSL will also be strengthened through additional equipment, software and
training.
1.68          In order to collect the estimated large amount of tax arrears, data from the files
of delinquents will be computerized, where necessary, and the collectible arrears will be
segregated from the non-collectible. Concerted efforts would then be made to realize the
collectible arrears. Delinquents would be informed of their outstanding arrears and given a
reasonable time to pay. After this, coercive actions, such as attachment of bank accounts,
distraint and sale of property and filing of recovery suits in the courts would be taken. Arrears
that are established to be non-collectible would be written off in accordance with established
procedures.
iII. FaciIitatinu Voluntar, Compliance
1.69          More effective enforcement of the tax laws, resulting from  the initiatives
discussed above, will automatically push up the level of voluntary compliance for, in the tax
evaders' perception, the chances of getting caught and severely punished will increase. However,
deterrence is not enough for sustaining high levels of compliance and needs to be complemented
by other measures.
1.70          First, it is necessary to reduce the costs of compliance and actively assist law-
abiding taxpayers to fulfill their legal duties. For this purpose, tax laws will be modified to
simplify their procedural requirements. In particular, collection, assessment, refund and tax
clearance procedures will be streamlined to reduce wastage of the taxpayers' time and the need
for them to visit a number of offices. Returns and remittance forms will be redesigned to
eliminate repetitive filings. Taxpayers assistance units will be set up to educate taxpayers about
their rights and obligations, answer their queries and help them in filling up forms. Facilities in
public areas of tax offices will be improved.
1.71          Second, it is important to reinforce the perception of taxpayers that the tax
administration is fair, reasonable and transparent. To achieve this, grievance units, reporting to
the respective head of department, will be set up in each department to attend promptly to any
genuine problems that taxpayers may face in their dealings with tax authorities. Further, as
already mentioned, discretionary powers of tax officials will be restricted and their conduct will
be more effectively reviewed. Furthermore, it is proposed to strengthen the appellate machinery
so that tax assessments are not ordy fair, but are also a seen to be fair. An information campaign
will be conducted to acquaint taxpayers with the efforts made to improve the equity and
transparency of the tax administration. In order to develop public support for the reform, a
National Task Force on Taxation comprising of public and private sector leaders has already been
formed. Finally, laws will be reviewed with the object of enhancing there fairness, equity and
efficiency.
1.72          To maintain compliance at a reasonably high level, consideration would be given
to the reduction of tax rates so as decrease the incentive for evasion. It is expected that this will
become possible once tax administration productivity improves.
Activities Not Covered by Project
1.73          GOJ is already engaged in bringing about improvements in the working of the
Customs Department through computerization and investigation of smuggling, as well as
corruption amongst Customs personnel, through the Revenue Protection Division. In order not



18
to interfere with the ongoing efforts and also to keep the scope of the project within manageable
limits it was decided to exclude the Customs Department from the scope of the project. Further,
instead of installing a dedicated teleconimunications network for information exchange between
tax departments, the general telephone system will be used. A more efficient network could be
put in place later as the computerization of the offices increases the need for information
exchange.
D. Bank Lending Experience
1.74         As of May 1994, the Bank had approved 57 loans for Jamaica totalling US$1.14
billion, after cancellations. Of that, an amount of about US$210 million is yet to be disbursed.
Adjustment lending has accounted for about one third of total Bank lending to Jamaica, including
three structural adjustment loans (FY82/85), and four sector adjustment loans for the public
enterprises sector (FY87/88), trade and financial sector (FY87/88) and (FY91/92), agriculture
(FY90/91), and Private Sector Development (FY92/93).
E. Lessons from Bank Experience
1.75         Lessons drawn from Bank experience applicable to this project fall into three
categories: (i) those concerning difficulties in the implementation of tax administration projects;
(ii) those concerning critical issues for sustainability; and (iii) best practices in tax administration.
1.76         In the first category, the most important lesson is the need for political
commitment by Government to the reform and their active support for its implementation. The
Minister of Finance needs to support the Tax Administration in withstanding powerful vested
interests affected by a vigorous enforcement of tax laws. The Financial Secretary needs to support
the organizational and personnel reforms which are an intrinsic part of tax reform. Support from
Parliament is crucial for enacting necessary changes in the legal framework and the tax structure.
1.77         Second, because revenue collection is the most visible function of tax
administration, a tendency to over-emphasize computerization vis-a-vis other important areas like
organization and management, human resources, training and taxpayer auditing, has been noted.
This needs to be avoided because lasting improvements in tax administration performance are
possible only if all critical institutional weaknesses are addressed.
1.78         Finally, the far-reaching nature of tax administration reform requires competent
leadership in implementation and close supervision by Government, usually with substantial Bank
support. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) staff should be carefully selected, an experienced
Project Director hired, and PCU staff trained in project administration before implementation
starts.
1.79         In the second category, the most important lesson (noted in particular in PCR
2507-JM), is that inadequate modifications of conditions of pay and career development causes
severe damage to the sustainability of institutional efforts. Attracting and retaining qualified staff
depend on a compensation system that is competitive with the private sector (without necessarily
entailing total parity) and an attractive career path tied to training and objective performance
measurement. Efficiency in the public sector requires that the compensation policy include both
rewards for good performance and sanctions for non-performance.
1.80         Similarly, the encouragement of voluntary compliance has not received sufficient
importance. Only a small amount of the collection can be directly controlled, and the remainder
depends upon the taxpayer's perception of the faimess and equity of the tax system, as well as



19
of the costs of non-compliance. It is therefore necessary to improve the quality of services
provided by the tax administration to the taxpayers and introduce grievance redressal and
appellate mechanisms that enhance the transparency and accountability of tax administration.
1.81         In the third category, a number of best practices followed by tax administrations
world-wide have been identified. These include: (i) institution of a unique taxpayer registration
number for effective monitoring of taxpayer activity and compliance (ii) organization of tax
administration based on functions, instead of individual tax laws; (iii) delegation of responsibility
and authority to middle management, accompanied by training and better management systems;
(iv) prioritization of assessment, investigation and collection activities (v) development of a single
current account for each taxpayer; (iv) strengthening of the legal framework to facilitate
enforcement of tax laws and streamlining of procedures; and (vii) carrying out of an effective
public relations campaign to educate taxpayers regarding their legal obligations.
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.82         The development agenda for Jamaica, reflected in the GOJ's Medium-Term
Policy Framework Paper (MTFP) for FY92/93-FY94/95 and in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) presented to the Board on March 25, 1993, recognizes that macro-economic stability is
critical to the attainment of GOJ's goal of rapid and sustained growth. The proposed project is
fully consistent with the CAS. The reform of tax administration will directly contribute to macro-
economic stability. Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax departments will
enable them to combat tax evasion and collect an increasing proportion of taxes due to
government. This will make additional domestic resources available, on a sustainable basis, to
finance budgetary needs and reduce Jamaica's dependence on external debt. Tax Administration
reform will also help in private sector development, which is another strategic goal. Improved
resource mobilization will enable GOJ to eventually reduce tax rates to spur private investment.
In addition, it will facilitate tax policy reforms to eliminate provisions that create distortions in
economic decision-making. Further, the broadening of the tax base to cover the informal sector
and a more even enforcement of the tax laws will create level playing fields for private
enterprises. Finally, by improving the functioning of one of the important public sector entities,
the reform will contribute to GOJ's public sector modemization objective.  The Bank's
participation will have a catalytic role in initiating and supporting the reform which involves
wide-ranging organizational changes. Experience in similar projects in Latin America would
enable the Bank to provide the needed technical guidance and to support the implementation and
sustainability of the reform.
H. THIE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.1.         The proposed project aims to raise revenues without increasing tax rates by: (i)
broadening the tax base; (ii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration
by (a) strengthening the organization and management of tax departments, (b) improving control
of tax evasion and (c) improving tax collections; and (iii) encouraging improved voluntary
compliance.



20
B. Project Description
2.2.         The project would finance consulting services, training and equipment to: (i)
Broaden the Tax Base by increasing the number of registered taxpayers and reducing the
number of deductions, exemptions and concessions granted by the tax laws (US$1.1 million, or
2.6% of total project costs of 42 million); (ii) Strengthen the Organiaion and Man ent
of Tax Administration by restructuring the tax departments, introducing modem management
systems and improving training and remuneration of personnel (US$2.8 million or 6.7% of total
project costs) and by constructing new Revenue Centers and refurbishing existing tax offices
(US$21.7 million or 51.6% of total project costs); (iii) Improve the Control of Tax Evasion by
strengthening the investigation, auditing and assessment capabilities of the tax deprtments
(US$3.8 million or 9.1 % of total project costs); (iv) Improve Tax Collections by introducing
new collection systems and improving recovery of tax arrears (US$6.5 million or 15.5% of total
project costs); and (v) Facilitate Voluntary Compliance by improving the equity, fairness and
efficiency of the tax system and reducing the cost of compliance (US$1.5 million or 3.4% of total
project costs). Project coordination, including project management and cross-component support
for training, computerization and modifications of the relevant laws, will cost US$1.0 million or
2.5% of the total project costs. Provision for price and physical contingencies amounts to US$
3.6 million, or 8.6% of total project costs. The project would be implemented over a six year
period starting mid-1994. Significant project preparation activities have been financed by a
PHRLD Fund Grant of 51.5 million Yen equivalent to about US$494,000.
Broaden the Tax Base
2.3.         This component will fund consulting services, training and acquisition of
equipment for the definition of a Taxpayer Registration Number (TRN), modification of the
appropriate tax acts, development of a computerized system for assigning the TRN and recording
information on the registered taxpayers, setting up appropriate organizational units and training
staff in the management of the system, carrying out periodic surveys to detect unregistered
taxpayers, gathering of data from various institutions for detection of additional non-registered
potential taxpayers, dissemination of information to taxpayers on the TRN, and studies to
facilitate broadening of the tax base by reduction of exemptions, deductions and concessions.
Strengthen Organization and Management of Tax Administaton
2.4.         This component will finance consulting services, training and acquisition of
equipment to address the organizational and managerial weaknesses of the tax administration
departments in three sub-stages.
2.5.         In the first stage, a Master Plan, financed by the PHRD grant, will define the new
mission, organization and high-level functions of the tax departments and associated units. The
Master Plan will also define the information requirements of the various tax units, Customs and
the Revenue Protection Division and outline an overall MIS plan to ensure the efficient flow of
information. Further, it will assess the management systems, human resources, training and
equipment needs of the tax administration.
2.6.          In the second stage, a detailed Transition Plan to give effect to the Master Plan
would be drawn up. It would include, inter alia, definition of the new functions, grading scheme,
performance linked incentive system, salary ranges and career paths; evaluation of existing staff
skills and reclassification of posts; design of management information systems; cost estimates for
implementing the Master Plan; sequencing of organizational changes etc.. A subset of activities
in this stage will concentrate on supporting management through training and technical assistance.



21
2.7.          The implementation of the Master Plan will constitute the third stage for this
component. Activities in this stage will include the re-deployment of organizational resources;
implementation of management systems (budgeting, accounting, monitoring, quality control,
among others); strengthening of important functions like internal audit, data processing, record-
keeping, information security and investigation of allegations of misconduct against tax officials
and training. In addition, computerized MIS will be developed to facilitate exchange of
information among the tax departments, and with Customs and the MOF.

2.8.          This component will finance consulting, training and acquisition of equipment and
vehicles to improve the detection of tax fraud and evasion, in two sub-components.
2.9.          The first sub-component will include introduction of legislative changes to
strengthen the enforcement powers of the tax authorities and improve their access to information;
installation of computerized systems in the Assessment Department to assist in detection of non-
compliance and tax frauds; design and implementation of new audit selection, assessment and
investigation methodologies; training of auditors and investigators, including training in detection
of computer fraud; and establishment of intelligence collection systems. Vehicles will be
acquired to enable the tax authorities to undertake field operations to check tax evasion.
2.10.         The second sub-component, applicable to the Land Valuation Department, will
finance the acquisition of computer equipment and software packages for database-driven
cartographic processing and record-keeping; and training of staff in valuation and use of the
computerized systems.

2.11.        This component will finance consulting, training and acquisition of equipment
to improve the control of the tax returns and payment of taxes, in two sub-components.
2.12.        The first sub-component will finance the introduction of computerized collection
systems linked to headquarters by telephone lines in all collectorates as well as training of staff
in the use of these systems.
2.13.        The second sub-crmponent will finance consulting services to define and assist
in implementing a plan for detection, quantification, evaluation and substantial clearing of existing
arrears as well as training in collection.
Facilitate Voluntary ComDliance
2.14.        This component will finance consulting services, training and acquisition of
equipment to help taxpayers meet their legal obligations, reduce the cost compliance and improve
the their perception of the tax laws and the tax administration. Voluntary compliance will be
facilitated by improving services, simplifying forms and procedures, disseminating information
relating to tax regulations and assisting taxpayers in comnplying with the law. A grievance
redressal procedure will be established and the appellate structure will be strengthened. Sample
databases will be prepared and studies will be conducted to enable the modification of tax laws
to enhance fairness, equity and efficiency. Periodic taxpayer satisfaction surveys will be
conducted to fine-tune efforts in this area as well as measure their success.
C. Project Costs and Financin
2.15.        Total project costs are estimated at US$42.00 million equivalent (Annex 10:
Project Costs). The Bank loan of US$13.20 million (31% of total project costs) would cover
95%  of foreign exchange costs and 4% of local costs. The Government would provide
counterpart funding of US$28.80 million (69% of total project costs), which would cover 5 % of
foreign costs and 96% of local costs. Project costs are based on similar costs for other projects.
Significant project preparation activities have been financed by a PHRD Grant of 51.5 million
Yen equivalent to about US$494,000 awarded by the Government of Japan. Retroactive
financing of an amount not exceeding US$100,000 would be provided to cover expenditures after
December 1, 1993 and up to the date of signing of the Loan Agreement. The project is expected
to entail recurring costs of about US$ 800,000 for equipment maintenance and US$ 100,000 for
training per annum, in addition to building maintenance costs. Salary increases in the tax
administration will also involve recurring costs whose magnitude would be deternined after the
new compensation system for tax administration is finalized as part of the project. Tables I. 1,
11.2 and 11.3 indicate the Estimated Project Costs; the Financing Plan; and the Financing Plan by
Category of Expenditure, respectively.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Agencies Involved
3.1.         The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for this project,
through a Steering Committee composed of the heads of the tax departments, the Chief
Parliamentary Counsel and officials of the MOF and FSL. The Steering committee will report
to the Financial Secretary.
B. Project Execution
3.2.         The proposed project would be completed in six years. Annex 11 describes the
Key Project Activities and bnplementation Schedule which will be firther refined as the project
advances. Annex 12 describes project performance indicators. Specific training programs will
be submitted for approval to the Bank on a yearly basis. The Steering Committee, which is in
operation since November 1993, will be supported by a Project Coordination Unit composed of
a Project Director, a Deputy Project Director and an administrative unit. The PCU will be
strengthened by other consultants, including procurement specialists, on short-term or fixed-term
contracts and the MOF will provide clerical, office and related support to the PCU. An
Operational Manual describing the organization of the PCU, its functions and responsibilities as
well as report formats and administrative steps to be followed in implementing and monitoring
the project will be prepared by the PCU. Creation of the PCU, selection of personnel agreed
with the Bank, and completion of the Operational Manual is a condition of effectiveness. The
Steering Committee and the PCU would be maintained by GOJ until completion of the project.
3.3.          Within six months of project completion the MOF will prepare a Project
Implementation Report (PIR) to assess the success of the project, including the achievement of
its institutional, administrative, operational, and financial objectives and goals, and general
evaluation of the lessons learnt from project experience.
C. Procurement
3.4.         Procurement of goods under the proposed project will be carried out in
accordance with "Guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by
the Bank in May 1993. Consulting services would be selected and employed in accordance with
the World Bank: "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank
as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981. The Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents modified as appropriate would be used for all ICB procurement.
3.5.         Procurement of Goods: The bulk of the goods to be procured consists of
medium-sized computers and telecommunications equipment and system software for an estimated
US$3.79 million which will be procured through ICB, using mainly a 2-step bidding procedure,
in packages valued at not less than US$500,000. Supply contracts will include installation,
maintenance and technical assistance for at least one-year after the first year of warranty provided
by the manufacturer. Personal computers, peripherals, microfilm recorders, training equipment
etc. estimated to cost US$ 2.73 million will be acquired through ICB in packages of $500,000
each. Database Management Software (DMS) for the adaptation of the Argentine Collection
Systems, estimated at US$200,000 may be acquired through sole-sourcing, if pilot test confimis
suitability of such system to GOJ's needs. If the system is not found suitable, an alternative



26
DMS would be developed with the assistance of consultants. Vehicles for a total of US$1.4
million will be acquired through ICB in packages of no less than US$250,000 each.
Miscellaneous equipment, supplies, books, software etc., estimated not to exceed US$25,000 per
purchase, may be procured through shopping. The aggregate value of such goods would be
US$120,000. CARICOM regional preference may apply for all equipment acquisitions. If
applicable, a margin of preference may be applied in bid evaluation in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.
3.6.         All contracts for procurement of goods to be awarded through ICB or sole-
sourcing would be subject to prior review by the Bank and the remaining goods would be subject
to ex-post review by supervision missions.  The Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation will cover all major procurement steps (invitation to bid, advertising, bidding
documents, evaluation methodologies and reports, award recommendations and contracts).
3.7.         Civil Works: The total cost of construction of new Revenue Centers and
refurbishing and maintenance of existing tax offices will be financed by GOJ and procurement
will be made according to the local procedures, acceptable to the Bank.
3.8.          Procurement of Consultin  Services: A plan for hiring consultants would be
submitted to the Bank for review and approval as part of the annual Action Plan before
consultants are hired. The first three consulting contracts valued below US$50,000 and all
contracts above US$50,000 will be submitted to the Bank for prior review. The Bank will
comment on each step in the process by which the borrower selects the consultants. These steps
include: (a) preparation of the terms of reference and budget; (b) choice of selection procedure;
(c) preparation of the short list (if not single source) and the Letter of Invitation; (d) submission
of the winning proposal and the evaluation report; and (e) negotiation of the draft contract, i.e.
conditions of employment. Below the threshold of US$50,000 (except for the first three
contracts) the Bank will review ex-ante, the corresponding terms of reference, and ex-post the
supporting procurement documentation on a selective basis. However, this exception to Bank's
review shall not apply to assignments involving the employment of individual consultants, to
single source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by
the Bank or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or
above. The Bank will review the results of all consulting assignments. Consulting firm services
valued below US$50,000 would not exceed US$1.5 million in aggregate.
3.9.         The limits established for prior Bank review of procurement decisions will result
in a coverage of about 90% of Bank-financed contracts.
3.10.        The borrower's procurement regulations and procedures have been reviewed by
Bank staff in the context of previous projects and have been found generally consistent with Bank
guidelines.
3.11.        Tables 1I. 1 overleaf summarizes procurement arrangements.

D. Dsbursement and SpecialAcon
3.12.        The Borrower's Financial Administration and Audit Act, as amended up to July
1992, has been reviewed during appraisal and has been found acceptable for use with a Special
Account.
3.13.        In terms of total project costs, the proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed
against: 97% of foreign consultants and 21 % of local consultants; 95% of foreign equipment and
14% of local equipment; and 84% of foreign training. The Loan, including retroactive financing
of US$100,000, is expected to be disbursed by the end of the sixth year of project
implementation. By effectiveness, the Project Coordination Unit should have prepared an
Operational Manual identifying steps and times for administrative processes. A special account
in US dollars with an authorized allocation of US$400,000, equivalent to an estimated four
months of average disbursements, would be established at the Central Bank or a commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs) for which detailed documentation evidencing expenditures would be reviewed by the PCU
and made available for the required audit as well as to Bank supervision missions. The use of
the Special Account and Statement of Expenditures was agreed to at Negotiations. Table 11.2
indicates the estimated disbursement by fiscal year and Table 11.3 gives the disbursement
schedule.

E. Accounting and Audits
3.14.        The PCU will maintain records for each project component, and consolidate them
into the project accounts and SOEs. Supporting documentation will be maintained by the PCU
and made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. This was agreed to
at negotiations.
3.15.        Project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, will be audited annually
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles applied by external private independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by the
Bank. Cost of the consultant services to be employed for the annual audits (US$10,000
equivalent through the life of the project) will be eligible for financing under the loan. Audit
reports will be furnished to the Bank within three months after close of the Government's fiscal
year (March 31).



29
F. Project Monitoring
3.16.        The Steering Committee and the PCU will be responsible for the timely
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of project activities. Specific tasks of the PCU will
include: (a) preparing semiannual project implementation reports to be submitted to the Bank by
June 30 and December 31 of each year, with the latter report also including a draft Annual Work
Plan for the upcoming calendar year for Bank approval; (b) carrying out, along with the Bank,
an amual review of the progress made in the implementation of the project by January 31 of each
year, except 1997; (c) conducting a mid-term review of the project, along with the Bank, by July
31, 1997; and (d) preparing the P:oject Implementation Report. These responsibilities and tasks
were agreed to at negotiations.  To facilitate monitoring, Key Project Activities and
Inplementation Schedule have been indicated in Annex 11. Project performance indicators
specified in Annex 12 will be used to track the progress made.
3.17.        Monitoring by the Bank will be carried out through semiannual visits (July and
January) to review the progress in the implementation of the project and discuss modifications
to the Action Plans and allocation of resources. In the first two years, two short supervision
missions are planned around February and October in addition to the regular missions. An
extensive mid-term review will be carried out in the third year of execution of the project.

THE TAX SYSTEM IN JAMAICA1'
1.1          The Government of Jamaica implemented a comprehensive tax reform of its individual
and corporate income taxes during the period 1986-87. This was followed, in 1991 by the introduction
of a value-added tax, known as the General Consuumption Tax (GCT) to replace the various consumption
duties, excise duties and retail sales taxes. Both initiatives drew upon the work of the Jamaica Tax
Structure Examination Project' , which produced a major analytical study of the existing tax system
with recommendations for reform. Although a number of smaller taxes including the payroll levies,
property tax, transfer taxes and stamp duties were the subject of study and recommendations by the Tax
Project, these levies have not been altered significantly in recent years.
1.2          The ratio of tax revenue, excluding payroll levies and bauxite levy, to GDP in 1991/92
was 22.9%. Tax revenue increased substantially in 1992/93 to 25.7% primarily because the GCT was
fully operational for the entire year. Increases in customs duty receipts arising from the depreciation of
the Jamaican dollar also helped to buoy aggregate tax revenue. As part of che Jamaican authorities' plan
to achieve macroeconomic stabilization during the current fiscal year, tax revenue is targeted to rise to
32.5% of GDP. Assuming only a marginal growth in payroll levies as a result of public sector wage
increases, the combined impact of tax revenue, payroll levies and bauxite levy is projected to reach
36.8% in the current fiscal year. Jamaica's program with the International Monetary Fund calls for a
slight drop in tax revenues to 29.4% and 28.7% of GDP in 1994/95 and 1995/96, respectively. These
targets are consistent with a slight real decline in PAYE receipts associated with more moderate public
sector wage increases and a relative decline in trade tax yields arising from an expected stabilization of
the exchange rate and a phased liberalization of the common external tariff rate by the CARICOM
community.
1.3          Taxes on income and profits rmake up the most important component of tax revenue,
accounting for 11.6% of GDP or 45.2% of central government tax revenue in 1992/93. Next in
importance, in terms of revenue contribution, are taxes on consumption and production, which accounted
for 7.7% of GDP or 30% of tax revenue in the same year. Trade taxes, including the GCT collected on
imports, accounted for 6.3 percent of GDP or 24.5 % of tax revenue. Property taxes have accounted for
an inconsequential amount of revenue in recent years, but are expected to contribute 0.7 percent of GDP
in 1993/94 as a result of site revaluations. The bauxite levy, which is a production royalty tied to the
international trading price of bauxite, accounted for 2.2 percent of GDP in 1992/93.
1.4           Wages and other income from employment are subject to four payroll levies. Three of
these levies take the form of compulsory contributions to funded social programs. The revenue generated
by employee and employer contributions under these schemes, accounting for 1.7 percent of GDP, is not
included in central government revenues. However, the proceeds from the fourth levy, the education tax
are incorporate into general revenues.
As of December 1993.

1.5          Since its introduction in fiscal 1991/92 the General Consumption Tax (GCT) has been
the fastest growing component of tax revenue. The GCT and Special Consumption Tax (SCT) receipts
have risen from 5.3% of GDP in 1991/92 to 8.1 % in 1992/93 and are projected to rise to 11.8% of GDP
in the current fiscal year as a result of increase in the rate of GCT from 10% to 12.5% and base-
broadening measures. During the period 1989/90 to 1992/93 PAYE tax receipts averaged 4.7 percent
of GDP without any discernable trend. However, PAYE revenues are expected to rise sharply in the
current fiscal year as a result of a major wage increase including a retroactive component, which will
more than double aggregate wage payments of public sector employees.
INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX 3'
1.6          Individuals, who are both resident and domiciled in Jamaica, are subject to individual
income tax on their world income. Individuals, who are resident but not domiciled, are subject to
taxation only on Jamaican-source income and on foreign income remitted to Jamaica. Nonresident
individuals are taxed on their Jamaican-source income usually through final withholding. Income from
employment is subject to a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax withheld at source. There are a number of
exemptions and deductions, amongst which are income derived by non-residents on investments or
deposits in building societies, housing schemes, approved public utilities and hotel enterprises. In general
capital gains arising from the sale of both physical and financial assets do not form part of taxable
income. An exception to this rule exists in the case where capital gains are realized from the sale of
shares and other securities on the Jamaican Stock Exchange, to the extent that they constitute 50 percent
or more of an individual sharable income. Provisions exist for the exemption of the following kinds of
income: dividends from approved investments, including from firms receiving tax holidays; proceeds
from approved pension schemes up to J$15,000; income from prescribed agricultural activities; and
proceeds from life insurance policies. A deduction is allowed in calculating taxable income for
contributions below certain limits to approved superannuation funds and approved retirement schemes.
Pensions paid out of such schemes are included in taxable income.
1.7          Every individual receives a standard exemption of J$18,408, with the exception of those
who are 65 years of age or older. Individuals in this group receive a standard exemption of J$48,408,
if they are also pensioners, and J$33,408, if they are not. Deductions can be claimed for all expenses
incurred in earning business income including business losses. In the case of wage and salary earners,
deductions may be claimed for some employer-provided allowances including those for uniforms and
laundry, where the employee is required to wear a uniform. The deductions are capped at J$5,739 per
annum in the case of uniforms and J$ 3,395 in the case of laundry.
1.8          In 1986/87 Jamaica undertook a major individual income tax reform. The graduated
individual income tax rate schedule with a maximum marginal rate of 57.5 percent was replaced by a flat
rate of 33 1/3 percent (recently reduced to 25 percent). In addition, 16 tax credits admissible to
individual taxpayers were substituted by a standard deduction; fringe benefit type allowances were made
taxable as ordinary income, with a few exceptions; the preferential treatment of overtime income was
eliminated; and interest income above a threshold was made taxable and withholding tax on interest
payments was instituted.

1.9          Despite the substantial progress made in improving individual income tax law, many
deficiencies still remain. The uniform, laundry and housing allowances continue to erode the tax base
and benefit upper income employees more than lower income ones. The value assigned to the benefit
of an employer-provided automobile, which is added to an employee's income, does not appear to fully
reflect the advantage derived by the employee. No tax is charged on the benefit derived by an employee
from concessionary loans advanced by the employer. It is estimated that bringing all allowances into the
tax base would increase revenue yield by 13 %4.
1.10         The threshold above which individual income becomes taxable is not automatically
indexed for inflation. Discretionary increases in the standard exemnption are periodically legislated, but
these have not kept pace with the rate of inflation since 1990. Consequently, individuals with low income
have become liable to tax and the administrative workload has increased without measurable
improvements in yield.
1.11                In general, capital gains are exempt from tax. However, in cases where an
individual realizes capital gains on shares or other securities traded on the Jamaica Stock Exchange during
a year amounting to more than 50 percent of income from other sources, these gains must be recognized
as taxable income. The sum of Stock Exchange gains on shares and other securities is compared to the
taxpayer's chargeable income of the two preceding years of assessment in order to determine whether
they constitute more than half of his total income. The Income Tax Act does not establish specific rules
for the computation of taxable capital gains. This deficiency suggests that in practice capital gains are
not declared by taxpayers even when their gains exceed 50 percent from other sources. The capital gains
exemption creates opportunities for tax avoidance through the conversion of ordinary income into tax free
capital gains and discourages corporations from declaring dividend on after tax profits. It also encourages
equity financing: thus acting as a counterweight to the lack of personal and corporate tax integration.
1.12         Both resident and non-resident individuals are subject to withholding tax on interest and
dividend received at the general rate of 25 percent. In the case of resident individuals, the withholding
tax is creditable against their global income tax liability. Where a tax treaty exists between Jamaica and
the country of residence of a foreign interest or dividend recipient, the specified treaty rate supersede the
general rate. Most treaties including those with Canada, the United Kingdom, and United States reduce
the withholding tax rates on portfolio dividends to 15 percent and on interest to between 12.5 to 15
percent. In exemption from income tax is provided for interest paid from the following sources:
investments in a building society, Jamaican Government loans, deposits in foreign currency accounts
known as "B" accounts.
1.13         The company income tax and PAYE receipts, at 31.6% and 43% respectively, account
for the dominant proportion of total income tax collections, with other individual income taxes and
interest and dividend withholdings accounting for the rest.
1.14         Taxes on other individual income are derived primarily of the self-assessed returns of the
self-employed and the income of unincorporated business enterprises. While about 102,000 individuals
are estimated to be a part of the self-employed earning income in excess of the standard exemption, only

23,000 or 22.5 percent filed in 1992193.
COMPANY INCOME TAX5'
1.15         The company income tax was also the subject of a major reform effort in 1988. Company
income is taxed annually at a rate of 33 1/3% (down fronm 45%). The base is income accrued in or
derived from Jamaica; for resident companies, income accrued elsewhere is also included, irrespective
of whether the income is remitted to Jamaica. Building societies are taxed at 30.0 percent and life
insurance companies at 7.5 percent.  As part of the 1988 reform, the previous dividend imputation
system was abolished and replaced by the separate entity or classical approach; that is profits are taxed
at a rate of 33 1/3 percent and the subsequent dividend payouts at a rate of 25 percent in the case of
resident shareholders. In designing the company income tax reform, the authorities rejected a proposal
from the Tax Structure Examination Project that dividends received by individuals be exempted from
additional taxation'.
1.16         There are a number of exemptions from company income taxation under the Industrial
Incentives Act, the Export Industry Encouragement Act, the Hotel Incentives Act, the Shipping Incentives
Act, the Motion Picture Industry Encouragement Act, the Jamaica Export Free Zones Act, the Foreign
Sales Corporations Act, the Cooperative Societies Act, and the Resort Cottages Act, and the Income Tax
Act itself, in the cases of agricultural and venture capital incentives. Exemptions for a specific number
of years, otherwise known as tax holidays, are commonly given to investors in the manufacturing and
tourism industries. Specifically, a tax holiday of up to ten years may be granted for new investments in
the certain types of manufacturing, approved farm enterprises, approved exporters, the hotel and resort
cottage industry and the motion picture industry.
1.17         The hotel tax incentives are particularly generous.7' Convention hotels with 350 rooms
or more may be granted a fifteen year tax holiday. Smaller hotels operating in special development areas
designated by the Minister of Tourism may receive a tax holiday of between 11 and 15 years. Dividends
paid out of profits by companies or branches which have received an income tax exemption, are not
taxable if paid to a Jamaican resident or a person resident in a country where they receive dividend
income tax relief. Where a shareholder is liable to tax on such dividends in her country of residence,
she is relieved from as much of the Jamaican income tax as exceeds her liability to tax in her county of
residence.
1.18         The dividend exemption provision effectively provided relief from double taxation and
indeed from any income taxation for upwards of 15 years on hotel investmert,s by Jamaican residents.
Similar incentives for a tax holiday of up to seven years are enjoyed by investors in resort cottages.'
The impact of these incentives is clearly to create greater investment in the tourist and hotel sector by
resident Jamaicans than would otherwise occur in their absence. Consequently, investment in this sector

is likely to be expanded to the point where the gross-of-tax rate of return is less than in other sectors of
the domestic economy.
1.19         In an effort to encourage the growth of Jamaica as a financial center, the GOJ enacted
the International Financial Companies (Income Tax Relief ) Act 1971, which gives special tax treatment
to companies engaged in financial transactions. Qualifying companies pay income tax at the rate of 2.5
percent on their profits from prescribed financial operations and withhold dividend tax of 2.5 percent on
dividends paid out to nonresident shareholders.
1.20         These partial or complete exemptions have been employed as instruments of industrial
policy designed to attract investments to Jamaica which might not occur otherwise. The analysis
conducted by the Tax Structure Examination Project found that these incentives, operating in concert with
payroll tax contributions, generated a bias against labor and in favor of capital-intensive technology.
1.21         Life insurance companies are subject to income tax at a rate of 7.5 percent on their
investment income, including health insurance premiums less management expenses. In addition, life
insurance companies are subject to tax on their premium income from Jamaican policy holders. The rate
of premium tax is 0.5 percent for "regionalized" companies and 2 percent for others. As announced in
the June 17 budget, insurance commissions and interest earned from investment insurance policies will
now be subject to tax.
1.22         Companies are not permitted to deduct accounting depreciation, but receive capital cost
allowances instead. These consist of an initial allowance of 20 percent deductible in the year of
acquisition and an annual allowance based on the declining balance method. Eligible assets include plant,
machinery, and industrial and other non-residential buildings. The initial allowance reduces the asset
value used in calculating annual allowances. Additional special allowances are given to companies and
unincorporated persons carrying on a trade in certain qualifying industries including food processing and
other specified types of manufacturing. Among these are investment allowances, which are separate from
the capital allowance system described above. Deductions taken as investment allowances do affect the
written down value of an asset for the purpose of calculating annual allowances. An investment
allowance of 20 percent is granted for the purchase of new plant and equipment in most nufurig
industries. The rate applicable to the investment allowance given for investment in sugar manufacturing
and cane farming is 40 percent of the expenditure incurred. If an investment allowance is claimed, no
initial allowance may be deducted for the same expenditure.
BAUXITE LEVY
1.23         Production levies are imposed on bauxite and alumina producers, banana growers, sugar
cane farmers and sugar manufactures. The revenues from these levies are not part of the Government's
consolidated public revenue. Of these levies, only the one on bauxite, raises substantal revenue.
1.24         The bauxite production levy accounted for 2.2 percent of GDP in 1992/93 and contributed
6.9 percent to total revenue plus grants. The bauxite production levy and royalty is authorized by the
Quarries Control Act, 1983 and the Quarry Control Resolution Act, 1990. The royalty rate is US$0.50
per ton of extraction tax. The production levy is US$5.25 per ton of bauxite subject to an escalation
clause. The escalation price is tied to the trading price of alumina. Because alumina is a well-defined

commodity quoted on an international exchange such as the London Metal Exchange it has been possible
to establish a production levy tied to the international price.   However, the observed commodity
exchange price is for a refined commodity many stages removed from the stage at which the resource is
priced for intra-firm trade. In this case, adjustment should be made for the down stream value-added
associated with refining and transportation. A failure to make the necessary adjustments for intermediate
value-added may produce serious tax distortions and discourage production 9
GENERAL CONSUMPTION TAX to
1.25          In 1991 a major step was taken in the reform of indirect taxation with the introduction
of a multi-stage, consumption-type value-added tax, the General Consumption Tax. The new tax replaced
a number taxes including the previous retail sales tax, excise duties, CARICOM duty, consumption duty
(other than that replaced by the Special Consumption Tax), telephone service tax, entertainment duty,
additional stamp duty levied on the importation of goods (with some exceptions) and the hotel
accommodation tax. The GCT currenly has a single rate of 12.5 percent. Prior to the June 1993
budget the rate was 10 percent.  Nevertheless, a combination of a credit and a deduction for hotel
operators reduces their effective rate to 5.9 percent.
1.26         The base of this tax consists of imports, the value added of domestic manufacturers and
large distributors. Some services are also included and construction activity has been added by the June
1993 budget. Small traders, whose annual sales or turnover is less than J$144,000, are exempted. Credit
for the purchase of capital goods is not given immediately, but is phased in over a 24 month period from
the date of purchase. Exporters are zero-rated as are health, most agriculture, religious and charitable
organizations, sellers of reading material and local government".  Since zero-rating requires
maintenance of proper records by the concerned entities and their verification by the tax authorities, it
complicates compliance and administration. This treatment rather than exemption leads to loss of
revenue. Extensive use of zero rating complicated administration. The tax changes made in FY93/94
attempt to partially overcome these problems. They include the following in rough order of their revenue
importance: converting processed foodstuffs, printing and packing materials to exempt from zero-rated
status; modifying rebates for tourist vacation package sales; and rebuilding of motor vehicles; and
broadening the base to include excisable alcohol and tobacco commodities, but not excisable petroleum
products.

SPECLAL CONSUMPTION TAX12'
1.27         The Special Consumption Tax (SCT) is levied on the manufacture for sale in Jamaica and
importation of prescribed goods including alcoholic beverages, tobacco and petroleum products. These
goods are subject to specific rates stated in the GCT Act. The consumption taxes on these commodities,
known as the Special Consumption Taxes (SCI) are effectively excise taxes. SCT payments are not
normally creditable against GCT, except in a few cases where SCT taxable goods are used to manufacture
GCT taxable goods. As a result of the current year's budget, the rate of SCT applicable to alcohol and
tobacco products has been reduced and the SCT inclusive price of these conumodities has been included
in the base of the GCT. Petroleum products remain subject to the SCT but not to GCT. Gasoline is
taxed at J$2.2387 per liter for leaded and J$2.3705 per liter for unleaded. Many of these levies had
previously been stated in Jamaican dollars without indexation to inflation. The FY93/94 Budget
converted the remaining specific or unit tax rates under the SCT into ad valorem rates.
PROPERTY TAX
1.28         Property Tax in Jamaica is a central government levy and local governments do not
explicitly share in the revenue yield. The tax is based on the unimproved market value of the land.
Value of structures on the land is not included in the tax base. However, the valuation of a parcel of land
takes into account its potential use for commercial, industrial and residential purposes. A study carried
out on 1000 parcels '3' found this method adequate given existing valuation capabilities.
1.29         As of April 1993 the following rate schedule was in effect:
Unimjp  ed Values  Rate of Tax
Up to $20,000        $50
$20,001 - $50,000      0.1%

1.30         Reliefs from property tax are statutorily granted under the Land Taxation (Relief) Act for
agricultural land. Until recently, land used for agricultural purposes paid only 25 percent of the tax

payable; this rate has been increased to 50 percent. Derating relief is granted on a case-by-case basis and
only for three years at a time.
1.31         Jamaica has approximately 600,000 parcels, of which 300,000 are registered in the Titling
Office; the remaining 300,000 are held using a variety of informal systems. The Land Valuation
Department has mapped every parcel and it is the only office in Jamaica to have this information.
Although this data is computerized, it is kept in files in the Fiscal Services Ltd.'s computers. Ad hoc
reporting has to be requested from FSL, which constructs the reports using COBOL. Access to the
information and ease of use could be improved by using database tools and a Geographic Information
System running on a small minicompu.r in the offices of the Department.
1.32         The Land Valuation Department only values the land; it does not monitor compliance.
Currently, there is no easy access to information on land sales, which must be registered at the Stamp
Duty and Transfer Tax Department; the usefulness of this information in keeping the valuation current
is obvious.
1.33         The contribution of property tax to the revenue fell from the peak of 4.9 percent of total
tax collections, in 1977/78, to 0.46 percent in 1992-93. This was due to the infrequency of revaluations
which are undertaken once in every decade and a reluctance to increase the rate of tax in lieu of a
revaluation. Revaluations were carried out in 1974, 1983 and 1993. More frequent revaluations or the
adjustment of the rate of tax to achieve a target level of real revenue would seem to be indicated. it
would be advisable to modify the appropriate acts and regulations to ensure that revaluations are
constantly and systematically carried out. Alternatively, the authorities might follow the U.S. municipal
practice of establishing a revenue target each year and adjusting the rate of tax to ensure that the target
is attained.
1.34         The revaluation being carried out at present, at a cost of J$40-50 million, and has now
been completed. With this revaluation and adjustment to inflation, the authorities expect revenues from
the property tax for Fiscal Year 1993 to increase to J$500 million or 0.7 percent of GDP. The 1992/93
collections were J$88 millions. If the burden of the property tax increases significantly as a result of the
anticipated 6 fold increase in revenue, the progressivity feature of the rate structure will encourage the
breaking up of large holdings in order to attract a lower rates.
TRANSFER TAX' 14
1.35         Both transfer taxation and stamp duties are administered by the Stamnp and Transfer Tax
Department. The property transfer tax consists of three components, an inter vivos tax, a tax on transfers
at death, and a tax on capital distributions. Approximately 92 percent of the total revenue collected from
this category of taxation is attributable to inter vivos transfers. The tax is payable on land, buildings,
securities of private companies incorporated in Jamaica and beneficial interests in these types of
properties. Shares of publicly traded companies are exempt from the tax. The tax is imposed on the
seller and is paid by the purchaser, who deducts it from the consideration for the transfer.

Annex I
Page 9 of 13
1.36                 The general rate of this tax is 7.5 percent of the transfer price except in the case
of transfers at death. In the case of land, the property transfer tax is applied to the fair market value of
land rather than sales price paid by the purchaser to the vendor '5. However, if the sale price of the
property is greater than its acquisition price, the seller must remit 7.5 percent of the market value or 37.5
percent of the nominal capital gains realized in the transfer, whichever is less.
1.37          In the case of transfers arising from the death of a taxpayer, mortis causa transfers, a
progressive tax is applied to the aggregate property transfers of the deceased. The first J$10,000 may
be transferred free of tax, the next J$30,000 attracts a rate of 10 percent , the subsequent J$60,000 at
12.5 percent and the remainder at 15 percent. Life insurance policy payments to the estate or heirs are
not subject to this tax. There are a number of exemptions and reliefs, including the value of crops on
agricultural property.
1.38          For taxpayers with a desire to leave bequests, the exemption of life-insurance policy
payments provides a strong incentive to shelter accumulated wealth, which they hope to bequeath, in the
form of life insurance policies. The discrimination between the tax treatment of public and private
companies under this tax, appears to impose an excessive penalty on privately incorporated companies
as a form of business operation. In combination with the rate differential between company and
individual rate, this discrimination may be predicted to lead Jamaican businesses to operate either as
unincorporated enterprises or as publicly-traded companies, while discouraging businesses to incorporate
as private companies.
STAMIP DU i J 1ES61
1.39          Jamaica has a great many stamp duties which are imposed on a wide variety of
transactions and govermnent services. Specific rates are used to levy most of the rates, though most of
the major revenue generating components are defined ad valorem.   Stamp duties are applied to
conveyances, company share transfers, notes, leases, checks, insurance policies, mortgages , licenses,
deeds, deeds, bonds, contracts, foreign exchange transactions, bills of exchange and all other credit
instruments. The Jamaican Tax Structure Examination Project proposed that all stamp duties be removed
other than those on travel and for the receipt of a government service where the benefit principle of
taxation would warrant retention. Under this proposal, stamp duties or equivalent registration fees should
still be charged for such services as the granting of marriage licenses and the recording of property
transfers.
1.40          Stamp duties on imports, known as duties on inward warrants, have been used to perform
the role of import excise levies. Prior to the introduction of the GCT and SCT, stamp duties on imports
were employed to fill the gap between the burden of customs duties on imports and the burden of indirect
taxes, including commodity specific taxes, excised on domestically produced goods. The role of stamp
duties is being reduced as part of the liberalization of trade policy. Consideration should be given to
replacing the stamp duties on imports entirely by Specific consumption taxes (SCT), which would be
IN     Transfer Tax Act Sec. 4(1). As cited in Christine A. Gore, "Taxation Of Foreign Investment In Jamaica", Bulletin For

administered by the SCT authorities operating out of the General Consumption Tax and Excise
Department.
1.41         Stamp duty is paid at the time of execution of any instrument creating a security,
conveyance, lease, settlement, transfer, assignment, contract and others, at a schedule which varies
between J$1 per 200 (for mortgages) to a maximum of J$1000 for inland bills of exchange and
promissory notes of value J$50,000 and above.
1.42         A total of J$1.2 billion is collected for stamp and transfer taxes (1.6 percent of GDP).
A 5% tax on the registratAon of all physical property at the time of transfer, known as conveyance duty,
accounted for 38.6 percent of all stamp duty revenue in 1992/93. Next in importance are miscellaneous
stamp duties, which accounted for 28.7 percent of total stamp revenue. Customs warrant duty, which
applies to imports, contributed 23.5 percent of total stamp revenue. The smallest contribution of 9.2
percent arises from stamp duties on travel tickets.
1.43         Other duties include: a one percent of the value of a leases and a one percent tax on the
sale of private companies incorporated in Jamaica.
1.44         The Stamp and Transfer Department, which administers this tax, suffers from an
antiquated administration and a badly designed information storage system. As well, the large number
of special categories of transactions and financial instrument subject to tax impeded the attainment of
productivity improvements in tax administration.
1.45         The combined impact of the property transfer tax and stamp duties for the transfer of
physical property generates a 12.5 percent tax burden on property sales transactions. This high burden,
in combination with the recent application of the GCT on construction activity, is expected to discourage
new real estate and plant construction. In addition, the high effective tax rate on transfers is likely to
generate a significant "lock-in" effect, which impedes the sale of physical property. A reduction of the
combined effective burden on property transfers could be expected to unlock some of the pent up demand
for property acquisition and sale. Hence the percentage decline in revenue arising from any lowering
of rates could be expected to be less than the percentage fall in the effective rate.
BhLTING TAX 17'
1.46         A tax on betting, gaming and lottery winnings, is charged as follows: 10 percent on
winnings; a bookmaker's levy of 7.5 percent on the first J$2 million; 5 percent on balance of all betting
receipts arising from overseas sales; 10 percent on all bookmaker's bets plus a flat charge of J$80; and
15 percent of all pool bets. Lotteries conducted for charitable purposes or incidental to bazaars and fairs
are exempt.

TRANSPORTATION TAXES
1.47         A number of taxes exist on motor vehicle and drivers licenses in addition to the excise
taxes on gasoline. Together these may be thought of as constituting a transportation tax system. Motor
fuels are subject to specific consumption tax rates which vary between 63 cents per liter for aviation fuel
and much higher rates for motor fuel.
1.48         Unleaded fuel is more heavily taxes than leaded fuel, thus encouraging the use of the
more environmentally hazardous fuel. Specifically, the rate of tax on leaded motor fuel is J$1.17 per liter
plus 52 percent of the manufactures price above J$2.36. The corresponding rate for unleaded motor fuel
is J$1.32 per liter plus 55 percent of price above $2.37.
1.49         Motor vehicles are subject to ad valorem commodity taxation under the General
Consumption Tax Act. The rates of taxation vary with engine displacement of the vehicles. Rates vary
from 13.7 percent for vehicles with less than 1000 cubic centimeter (cc) engines to 177 percent on
vehicles with greater than 3,200 cc engines. Vehicles imported by dealers bear slightly less tax than
vehicle imported by consumers.
1.50          The scheme of transportation taxes needs to be examined to ensure that these taxes are
designed to contribute to efficient financing and utilization of roads and highways. The relative reliance
placed on taxes on purchase against those on annual registration also requires further study.
1.51         The travel taxes consist of the cruise ship tax and a departure tax collected by the carriers
and levied on travellers to destination outside Jamaica. The rate on cruise ship passengers was raised to
US$15.00 per passenger as of October 1, 1993 from the previous rate of US$10.00. This tax is required
in order to recover the cost of improved security, as well as for the provision of docking infrastructure.
The general rate of the departure tax is J$200 per traveller other than cruise passengers. In addition, a
stamp duty tax is levied at the time of sale of tickets in Jamaica, as noted above.
PAYROLL TAXES
1.52         Five payroll taxes use wages as the base for the contribution. These are: Income Tax
through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) scheme, mentioned above; Education Tax; National Insurance
Scheme (NIS) contributions; Human Employment and Resource Training (HEART) contributions; and
the National Housing Trust (NHT) contributions.
1.53         These taxes have diverse provisions regarding bases, floors, deductibility in computation
of income tax, rates and schedules. This has created a welter of rules and agencies which needlessly
complicates compliance. There is considerable scope for harmonizing the rules and simplifying the
structure of these taxes. The strengthening of collection of payroll taxes from the self-employed,
consolidation of the administration of these taxes under one organizational unit and merging the education
tax with individual income tax are some of the other issues that need in-depth study. Further, as would
be clear from the discussion that follows, payroll taxes impose a heavy burden on wages paid in the
formal sector. For a typical employee, the employer is required to pay 11.5% of emoluments as his
contribution and the employee 31.5%  (25%PAYE + 6.5%  other payroll deductions). Thus, the
employee gets only about 60% of what the employer spends on wages. This, heavy burden creates an



- 42 -
Annex 1
Page 12 of 13
incentive for keeping employment in the informal sector. The possibility of reduction of payroll taxes
needs to be considered. The features of payroll taxes, other than PAYE, are indicated below.
National Insurance Scheme Contributions
1.54               Initiated in April 1966, these are contributions by employees (2.5 percent of
taxable emoluments) and employers (2.5 percent): the self-employed pay 5 percent. The minimum
contributions payable by the employee and the employer are J$7.25 per week per employee based on
weekly emoluments of J$290 and J$31.40 per month per employee based on a weekly emolument of
J$290 and J$31.40 per month per employee based on monthly emoluments of J$1,256. Both employees
and employers may deduct NIS contributions from their income subject to tax. Contributions are only
made on employment emoluments by both employees and employers up to a ceiling of J$15,080 per
annum. The imposition of such a low ceiling makes the tax highly regressive assuming its economic
incidence falls on labor. The contributions finance the National Insurance Scheme, an autonomous body
administered by the Ministry of Pensions and Social Security. Benefits provided by the scheme are old
age, widows, widowers, children and invalid's pensions, lump sum and funeral grants, and payments for
certain employment-related accidents and certain diseases.
1.55         In the case of the participation in the NIS by the self-employed as stamp card system is
used whereby individuals purchase the appropriate number of NIS stamps at the post office on a weekly
or monthly basis and submit their card to the MIS administration once a year. At present, only 4,000
self-employed individuals participate in the NIS.1'
National Housmin Trust Contributions
1.56               Started in January 1976, these compulsory contributions by employees and
employers accrue to the National Housing Trust, an autonomous body, which finances low-cost housing.
Contribution based on gross wages (including overtime but excluding allowances) is 2 percent for
employees and 3 percent for employers and 3 per cent for the self-employed. Those w!io make less than
the minimum wage, which would be equivalent to annual earnings of less than $3,120, are not subject
to NHT contributions.
1.57         The NHT was established to alleviate a shortage of affordable low and medium income
housing by providing low interest mortgages. The program also provides cash grants or repayments to
contributors. As such the program functions both a compulsory saving scheme and as a subsidized
mortgage co-operative. Much of the initial impetus for setting up the program came from the trade union
movement, which wants to improve housing conditions for lower income Jamaicans. The cash grants
are usually received upon retirement or in the eights year after contributions have commenced. Cash
payouts are based on the employee's contributions and a three percent annual rate of interest. As such,
the contributions of the employee, but not of the employer are vested in the employee. Priority for
mortgage loan applicants is assigned on the basis of a point system tied to the income of the applicant and
the number of years the applicant has been a contributor. The maintenance of records for the mortgage
and cash grant entitlement purposes irnposes a substantial reporting burden on employers. The formula
for determining contributions is also more complex than for other payroll levies. This is so because a

temporary freeze on the Jamaican dollar value of all contributions to the NHT announced in 1985 was
never rescinded, unlike similar freezes for other payroll taxes.
1.58          While the self employed are expected to contribute 3 percent of gross income to the
NHT, their effective participation of the self-employed is very small.
Human Emplovment and Resource Train Contributions 19'
1.59         These contributions, amounting to 3 percent of emoluments, are payable by the employer
to the HEART Fund which uses them to finance the development of opportunities for trainees. The
payments are deductible by the employer. Certain employers including government departments and most
parastatals are exempt. The HEART Fund is intended to assist young labor force entrants in acquiring
on-the-job training and to encourage their employment by participating employers during a transitional
training period when their productivity may be low. Participation in this program by both employers and
employees appears to be moderately high. In 1991 approximately 2,500 enterprises participated in the
program. Of these, 1,630 firms hired trainees. In 1991 approximately 2,200 trainees found placements
under the program. HEART funds are also used to finance the costs of training provided by various
government sponsored training schools. Approximately 5,500 trainees were enrolled in these in school
training programs during 1990/91 .'
1.60         Inland Revenue has assumed some primary responsibility for ensuring the compliance of
employers. The design of the program appear to reflect an application of the benefit principle, with the
benefits being shared by employers and program trainees.
EAucation Tax
1.61         This levy, authorized by the Education tax Act of 1987, is a tax on earnings of individuals
charged at the rate of 2 percent of emoluments from employees and 3 percent from employers, and at
the rate of 2 percent of earnings from self-employed persons. Although designated as education tax, it
is not earmarked for education and flows into the general revenues. In the case of the employee, the tax
base is identical to that of the PAYE except that a standard exemption is not provided.

IMPROVING ADMINISTRATION OF WITHHOLDING TAXES
AND CONTRIBUTIONS
2.1.         Employers are required to withhold income tax (PAYE) from emoluments paid to their
employees. They are also required to withhold Education Tax, and contributions to National lIsurance
Scheme (NIS) and National Housing Trust (NHT) from employee emoluments. In addition, they are
liable to pay, on their own account, a percentage of the emoluments as Education Tax, and contributions
to Human Employment and Resource Training Fund (HEART), NIS and NHT. The self-employed are
required to pay income tax, education tax and contributions to NIS and NHT based on their total
eamings. Further, persons making payments of interest, dividend, income from Unit Trusts, certain
rental income, or making payment to non-residents are required to withhold income tax from these
payments. All these taxes and contributions totalled J$ 6,729 millions in 1992-93, which was 33% of
the total tax revenues (excluding International Trade Taxes collected by Customs) and contributions
collected in that year. The high proportion of withholding taxes and contributions in total collections
underlines the need to give special attention to their collection and enforcement.
2.2.         The present administrative arrangements are indicated in Table I' below:

PAYE
CoDlection
2.3.         It can be seen from the Table I that the IRD has the responsibility for collecting most of
the withholding taxes and contributions. The NIS also uses the Post Offices to collect contributions from
the self-employed, domestic workers and voluntary contributors through the sale of NIS stamps. The
NHT does not rely on the IRD for collection, but uses the commercial banks instead.

Annex 2
Page 2 of 5
2.4.         The NHT authorities are satisfied with the collection arrangements with the Banks. The
HEART and NIS, which rely on the IRD, however, face several problems. First, there is considerable
delay in the flow of funds collected by the IRD into the accounts of HEART and NIS, which creates cash
flow problems. Second, there is uncertainty whether all funds collected on behalf of these bodies have,
in fact, been remitted to their accounts. Third, there is delay in the forwarding of deduction statements,
and errors and omissions in crediting payments in the accounts of specific contributors. This creates
problems when entitlements have to be distributed or credits allowed. Fourth, depositors appear to be
facing long lines at the IRD. This acts as a disincentive to making payments regularly. Similar problems
may be faced in connection with collection of Income Tax and Education Tax.
2.5.         There does not appear to be mitch difficulty in the present structure of the collection
machinery. Collection is already centralized to a considerable extent and economies of scale expected
to be achieved through assigning this function to one agency are already being realized. The NHT
remains out of the centralized collection arrangemenits. However, considering that the commercial banks
are doing a cost-effective job of collection, it would not be desirable to have NHT use the IRD as its
collection agency.
2.6.         The problems related to collections are actually related to the operational weaknesses of
the IRD. These will be adequately addressed through the use of Unique Taxpayer Registration Number
and by strengthening the IRD's data processing and management capabilities through the prcJect.
Enforcement
2.7.         The critical problem in the administration of withholding taxes and contributions lies in
the area of enforcement. The most frequent problems are: (a) withholders do not file returns; (b) tax or
contributions deducted are either remitted late or not at all; (c) the self-employed do not file returns or
pay their liabilities; (d) the provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to reporting obligations of persons
deducting tax at source, on payments other than salaries and wages, are weak and create monitoring
problems. At present, the machinery available to detect these defaults and collect the outstanding dues
is inefficient and inadequate.
2.8.         The same database is needed to monitor compliance of PAYE, Education Tax, HEART,
NIS and NHT by employers. Yet, the auditing for these taxes is done by six agencies viz. ITD, IRD,
RB, HEART, NIS and NHT, with each looking at compliance regarding only one particular deduction.
A single agency could easily verify compliance with all liabilities at one go. Similarly, to monitor
compliance by the self-employed the basic data needed is the total annual income. At least in the case
of the self-employed who file income tax returns, this data is available centrally with the ITD. But for
the self-employed too ITD, IRD, NIS and NHT conduct separate audits for different payments.
2.9.         An additional problem is the lack of effective information exchange between the
enforcement agencies within different organizations. Although they ought to be working with common
databases, each agency has its own, often imperfect, database. The database used by agencies other that
fTD is not updated regularly to take into account increases in the base figures for emoluments or total
earnings resulting from additions made during income tax audits. This leads to a loss of revenue.
2.10.        The level of auditing skllls in different agencies is highly variable. For instance the NIS



- 46 -
Annex 2
Page 3 of 5
seeks to enforce compliance through inspectors who have no accounting background. The number of
auditors available in each agency is also inadequate for a comprehensive coverage of all payers.
2.11.        The level of non-compliance by the self-employed is generally accepted to be low.
However, the different agencies do not appear to have adequate manpower and resources to individually
undertake tracking down of delinquent self-employed.
2.12.        Finally, the current fragmentation of enforcement puts an undue burden even on
taxpayers. As each agency tries to ensure compliance with its own particular requirements, the taxpayer
is faced with multiple visits and enquiries from compliance officials of different agencies seeking basically
the same information. This imposes avoidable compliance costs on the taxpayers which is detrimental
to voluntary compliance.
2.13.        Enforcement can be significantly improved by consolidation of auditing resources of all
agencies in the proposed Assessment Departnent (AD). This departnent would develop and constantly
update comprehensive databases of employers, other withholders, employees, persons eaming interest and
dividend income, recipients of unit trust income and rent under section 40A of the IT Act, non-residents
and their representatives, and the self-employed. Since much of the data will come from tax returns and
assessments, the AD would be in a good position to develop the database. The auditors from various
agencies can be transferred to or sent on deputation to the AD. Along with the PAYE auditors currently
at the ITD, these auditors will form a Withholding Tax and Contributions Auditing Unit (WTCAU) at
the AD. The pooling of manpower would enable this unit to effectively monitor all withholders and the
self-employed. The payments found to be in default would be intimated by the WTCAU to the IRD
which will have responsibility of enforcing collection. The auditors assigned to the WTCAU will be
given special training in auditing techniques relevant to their work.
2.14.        The problem of large scale non-compliance by the self-employed in respect of education
tax, NIS and NHT is linked with the larger problem of their non-compliance with income tax and GCT
as well. The main strategy being followed by them is simply to remain off the records of the tax
administration. This would be mitigated, to some extent, by the enactment of legislation which requires
all persons having dealings with revenue authorities to register and obtain a taxpayer identification
number. This requirement will compel many self-employed to make themselves visible to the tax
authorities. In addition internal and external surveys would be conducted to register potential tax and
contribution payers.
Records Management
2.15.        The present system results in a proliferation of records which causes serious record
management problems. An employer is required to send every month a remittance card for Education
Tax, a remittance form for HEART and a deduction statement for NIS to IRD. In addition he is required
to send a deposit form to the commercial bank collecting NHT. Further, he is required to maintain, for
each employee, a tax deduction card for Education Tax and a deduction card for NIS. At the end of the
year, he is required to file a return for Education Tax with tale IRD, and a combined return for NIS and
NHT with the Ministry of Labor, Welfare and Sports. The self-employed have similar onerous filing
requirements.



-  47  -
Annex 2
Page 4 of 5
2.16.        It is evident that the numerous deposit documents and returns can be conveniently
consolidated by using forms which simultaneously indicate all deductions and payments. These forms
can have multiple copies which can forwarded to the user agencies by the collecting agency. For NHT
separate forms would have to be used for remittances through banks. But the annual return for NHT also
can be combined with that for other deductions and payments. The consolidation of information would
enable the creation of a masterfile at the collecting agencies which would become the source record for
reference by all agencies. At the same time, this measure would significantly reduce the compliance
overload on assessees.
Communication
2.17.        As indicated above, there is a need to improve communications between the IRD and the
agencies on whose behalf it collects taxes and contributions. With the centralization of the enforcement
function with the AD there would be the additional need to build effective communications between the
WTCAU and its client agencies. Each beneficiary of collections should be able to access information
regarding its taxpayer or contributor base, the amounts collected on its behalf, amounts credited to its
account, amounts in default and the enforcement measures being taken to enforce collections. This aspect
would be addressed by building effective data sharing and access systems as part of the project.
Summarv of Recommendations
(i)    Strengthen reporting requirements for all persons responsible for deducting tax
or contributions at source.
(ii)   Centralize all auditing functions relating to withholding taxes and contributions
with the Assessment Department.

ESTIMATED GAPS IN REVENUE COLLECTION
3.1.         While neither the Income Tax Departnent (ITD) nor the General Consumption Tax
Deparunent (GCT) have any estimate of the total number of taxpayers in the system, indirect evidence
exists. Both fTD and GCT have estimates of taxpayers who have registered to pay at one time or
another, and those who have filed in the most recent tax year. The results show that there is a wide gap,
about 35 percent of those registered actively filed, as reported in Table 1. This is an overstatement of
non-filing to the extent that many of the firms on the registered list are inactive, but it is an
understatement to the extent that many companies are not registered. The approximate magnitude of the
under-reporting, however, squares with the estmates made in connection with the tax reform studies in
the mid-and late 1980s.

3.2.         Consider first the self-employed sector. It has been estimated that there are 124,000 self-
employed, non-agriculture entities, 101,844 of which are above the standard deduction level3 (see Table
2). According to the Income Tax Department, there are 77,000 registered self-employed entities and
approximately 23,000 of these filed a return in 1992. Using data from the labor force survey, it is
estimated that self-employed income above the standard deduction was J$4,665 million in 1992. At a
33.3 percent tax rate (the applicable rate in 1992), total tax payments from the self-employed should have
been J$1,554 million. Actual collections, however, were only J$234 million in FY91/92, i.e., only 15
percent of potential collections are received from the self-employed. The calculations reported in Table 2

imply that income tax collections from the self-employed can be doubled if only 30% of non-filers are
brought into the system.
3.3.          There is also a substantial gap between actual and potential revenues from the company
income tax. As shown in Table 3, the estimate of the potential base is made from the National Income
Accounts for Jamaica. By subtracting estimates of total compensation and interest expense from total
gross domestic product, an estimate of the maximurn corporate profits subject to tax can be derived.
Assuming this level of profit, corporate tax with full compliance and no tax concessions would have a
base of J$26.1 billion.(excluding agriculture). At a tax rate of 33.3 percent, this would result in
corporate tax revenues of J$8.7 billion--3.8 times current corporate tax revenues. The current exemptions
and allowances, and special incentive treatment for certain industries, reduces this amount by about 8
percent.4 In this case, potential corporate tax revenue is J$8.0 billion, or 3.4 times actual collections in
1992. A doubling of corporate revenues could be obtained if the government brought the compliance rate
up from its present 30 percent level to 45 percent.
3.4.          The potential tax base for the GCT is more difficult to estimate because of the number
of complicated input and output exemptions. Using data from the National Accounts, the potential tax
base for the GCT may be calculated, taking account of the exemptions, as presented in Table 4. Total
value-added by sector is presented in the first column. The second column contains an estimate, by
sector, of the taxable receipts included in the GCT base; the third column contains an estimate of the tax
on inputs by sector; the last column contains an estimate of GCT liability. These estimates were obtained
from actual payment data provided by the GCT department. Rebate and zero-rating rules are included
in the estimates of taxable receipts and input tax. Finally, the value-added that is attributed to small
enterprises, a total of J$360 million5 should be subtracted. Using these procedures, the potential local
GCT revenue in 1992 is estimated to be J$2.4 billion, while actual local GCT revenue in 1992 was
J$1.99 billion.
3.5.   The results of this analysis are that the revenue increase from capturing non-filers could be
significant. If only a 25 percent increase in compliance on the part of non-filers is assumed, then the
revenue increase would be J$2 billion or 15 percent of actual revenues collected in FY91/92. To this,
one might add the increase in compliance for the other payroll taxes, though some of these are earmarked
or contribution programs and so it is not clear how much of the increased revenue would be available for
the general budget. All of these estimates assume that an improved registration system can reach all
potential taxpayers and that once in the net, all entities comply fully with the tax law. Hence the benefits
of registration, automation, improved audit procedures and better staffing are captured in the above
estimates. Table 5 sunmmarizes the estimated gaps in collection of the Individual Income Tax: Self
Employed, Company Income Tax and GCT.

Chapter 12).
This estimate is based on GCT data on the number of small enterprises.

TAX POLICY ISSUES
Introduction
4.1.       This section presents a discussion of tax policy issues that need to be resolved to improve
the efficiency and equity of the Jamaican tax system. It also provides a set of specific tax policy
recommendations and a list of policy studies which the authorities should undertake themselves or
commission over the medium term future. This discussion draws upon recent reviews of the Jamaican
tax system by Prof. Charles McLure and by Mr. Hernando Garz6n, as well as the fmdings of the
Jamaican Tax Structure Examination Project.
4.2.       The general approach taken has been to identify tax policy changes which will simplify
the Jamaican tax system while, at the same time, improving efficiency, fairness and revenue generating
capacity. In turn, greater simplicity is intended to improve the effectiveness of tax administration.
4.3.       The proposals for tax policy reform have important sequencing implications in terms of
revenue losses, revenue offsets and transition from one form of taxation to another. Among outstanding
tax policy issues which have sequencing implications are: the harmonization of the basis of payroll
taxes; the proposal to make credits for purchased capital goods under the GCT immediately refundable;
the inter-relationship of any future capital gains tax with the current property transfer tax; and the
impacts of implementation of the phased reduction in the CARICOM common external tariff.
Pyroi Taxes
4.4.       The various payroll taxes need to be harmonized in a way which will permit rate reduction
and make the overall tax system more progressive. At present, the first dollar of wage income is
subject to a tax rate of 16% from payroll taxes alone. This first dollar rate discourages labor force
participation in the tax-complying economy and encourages participation in the underground economy.
Base-broadening, measures such as removing ceilings on contributions, would permit revenue-neutral
reduction in the contribution rates for the various payroll levies. More intensive effort should be put
into ensuring that the self-employed contribute as required by law.
4.5.       Currently, the self-employed are required to contribute 5% of "remuneration" up to a
ceiling to the National Insurance Scheme, 2% of "total emoluments" to the National Housing Trust,
and 2% of "statutory income", as defined in the Income Tax Act, to the education tax. Lower rates
and a consolidated administration for the payroll taxes would foster improved compliance.
4.6.       Consideration should be given to abolishing the education tax, which has almost the same
base as the PAYE but no standard exemption. The revenue shortfall could be made up by raising the
individual income tax rate or by increasing the tax collections from the self-employed. If the authorities
judge that the time is inappropriate for a removal of the education tax, then consideration might be
given to adopting the standard deduction level under the PAYE as the floor for education tax
contributions and to extending its coverage to non-wage income. Such a measure would still improve
the progressivity of the entire tax system, and reduce the tax burden on the first dollar of employment
income, at one third the revenue cost of a complete abolition.

Annex 4
Page 2 of 13
4.7.       A common base might then be established for the remaining payroll levies consisting of
all wages and other emoluments, including allowances that are currently tax exempt.  The
administration of payroll taxes should also be centralized, particularly with respect to audits. This
option could ensure revenue neutral funding for the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) and National
Hosing Trust (NHT) with reduced contribution rates.
4.8.             The ceiling on NIS contributions, currently set below the PAYE tax free amount
at $15,080 per annum or J$290 per week, should be repealed. This measure would enhance
progressivity. According to estimates made in a recent study of the Jamaican tax system i revenue-
neutrality could be maintained with employee and employer contribution rates of 1.05 percent,
assuming all allowances are brought into the tax base. The same study finds that the employer and
employee contributions for the NHT could be reduced to 2.8 and 1.8 percent, respectively, while
retaining revenue-neutrality.
4.9.       As a general proposition, tax incidence analysis predicts that, for a small open economy,
the entire burden of payroll taxes will fall on labor in the long-term. If a substantial non-complying
underground economy exists and labor is free to work in either the tax-complying or the underground
economies, then some of the incidence of the taxes in the complying economy will be shifted to owners
of capital. Assuming some splitting of the economic incidence, high payroll taxes will both discourage
the labor force participation in the taxpaying sectors of the economy and encourage business to
substitute capital for labor in the organization of production. For this reason, low rates of payroll
taxation on as broad a base as possible are to be favored. By the same reasoning, payroll tax
administrators should devote more administrative resources to enduring payroll tax compliance by the
self-employed.
4.10.      Though the long-term incidence of the payroll taxes is deternined by the supply and
demand conditions in factor markets, the legal incidence of these levies is relevant to the short-term
economic incidence. A reduction in the amount of payroll taxes formally payable by the employer will
initially affect the companies after-tax profits and cash flow and will not be passed on fully to the
employee. Therefore, if the government wishes to ensure that the short-term economic benefits of
payroll tax reform in terms of reduced burden are received by employees and not by employers, it may
wish to phase in the reduced employer contributions or time the reform so that it occurs shortly before
major labor negotiations with trade unions.
Individual Income Tax
Indexaion
4.11.      The tax free basic exemption, known also as the tax free amount, which is currently about
US$600 per annum, should be indexed for inflation. This proposal is advocated primarily because
discretionary adjustments to the basic exemption have not kept pace with inflation since 1990.  A
higher basic deduction operating in concert with a flat rate, set somewhat higher than the current 25%,

University, 1992). p.iv.

would impart substantial progressivity to the tax system in terms of the shape of the average tax
schedule.
Rate Schedule
4.12.      While implementing a second individual income tax rate would increase vertical equity
and improve buoyancy, these advantages would have to be purchased at the price of less simplicity and
of more uncertainty about economic incentives. A second rate would also encourage more intensive
use of income splitting techniques by families, which would likely be policed ineffectively using current
income attribution rules. For these reasons a second rate should be avoided.
Non-taxaton of Fringe Benefits or Employer Provided Perquisites
4.13.      Simplification and base-broadening are needed in the individual income tax to ensure the
success of the tax administration reforms.
4.14.      Recently, the individual income tax base has been subject to erosion due to employers
providing their employees with an increasing proportion of compensation in the form of untaxed fringe
benefits. It is recommended that exclusion from the tax base of employer-provided allowances be
repealed or phased out over time. These nontaxable allowances or perquisites include: uniform and
laundry allowances, housing allowance, concessionary loans and a very low imputation of income for
employer provided automobiles. The exclusion from the tax base for allowances is limited to a
maximum of J$5,739 per year for uniforms and J$43,395 per year for laundry. The tax free allowance
for housing is limited to the lower of 15% of other (taxable) emoluments excluding rent payments and
the annual value of the rent payment. Nevertheless, this remains a highly regressive tax concession
because the recipients of housing allowances are typically upper income Jamaicans. The provision for
tax-free housing allowances encourages employers to pay inflated rents in lieu of higher salaries.
4.15.      If the authorities judge that it would be difficult to completely repeal this measure, then
a dollar cap should be placed on housing allowances. The cap might initially be set at a level that
would not affect 90% (or more) of the population. This cap should not be indexed for inflation, so that
it would fall in real terms to the point where the allowance could be eliminated with a minimum of
disruption to taxpayers.
4.16.      The Income Tax Act correctly recognizes the principle that the imputed income associated
with the services of employer-provided automobiles should be included in the tax base. However, the
amounts to be recognized as imputed income, as set out on the schedule for vehicles less than five years
old, are much too low. Hence, the schedule should be revised to reflect the true value of the benefits
provided.
4.17.      The interest advantage or imputed income associated with concessionary loans to
employees should also be taxed.
4.18.      The provisions for exempting income earned under approved productivity schemes and
approved gratuity schemes in the tourist industry should also be abolished. There is little reason to
believe that the tax system can monitor and measure productivity better than employers. Therefore the
rewarding of productivity improvements should remain entirely the responsibility of employers. The



-  57  -
Annex 4
Page 4 of 13
provision that permits owners of tourist facilities to establish programs, under which tax-exempt wages
may be paid by designating them as "gratuities", should be abolished. This provision is inequitable.
It also lowers the relative tax burden on a sector of the economy which contributes relatively little direct
tax revenue to the government because of the many other tax concessions it enjoys.
4.19.       Relatively little effort is made to police non-taxable allowances, because of the inherent
difficulty of doing so. Auditors working in the Income Tax Departnent typically do not have detailed
information on non-taxable allowances paid by employers. Acquiring such information would usually
require an " on site" audit. Although ceilings have been placed on some non-taxable allowances such
a uniforms aad laundry, employers are not required to report the nature of their allowances to the
Income Tax Commissioner. To the extent that there are abuses in the granting of allowances and that
the incidence of allowance recipients rises as income rises, the tax system is made more regressive by
lax administrative practice.
4.20.      If it is believed that taxpayers will not report income in kind, then a blunter tool may be
needed to discourage this form of compensation. This would take the form of disallowing the costs of
providing such perquisites as a deductible expense by the employer. Such disallowances have been
successfully employed in other developing countries.
4.21.      The measures proposed above would also help to foster a public perception of improved
fairness. Though the housing, uniform and laundry perquisites are widely provided, they are not
universally provided. It is estimated that 60 to 70% of all employees receive the uniform and laundry
allowances. The percentage of employees receiving employer-provided housing allowances is much less.
Repealing these exclusions would simplify auditing and tax liability checking within the Income Tax
Department. Bringing all allowances into the tax base would also increase revenue yields by 13% or
more according to the findings of a PAYE tax simulation study for 1992.
Other Exclusions
4.22.      Exclusions from income tax are provided for interest paid from the following sources:
investments in a building society; interest-bearing deposits of life insurance companies held for three
or more years; Jamaican Government loans; and deposits in foreign currency accounts known as "B"
accounts. These exclusions should be repealed. Permitting non-residents to receive interest on tax-free
foreign currency accounts may be an effective inducement to attract foreign savings and to prevent the
supply price of foreign debt financing from rising. However, this exemption from interest withholdings
should not be available to Jamaican residents. The availability of these tax-free savings vehicles for
residents discourages Jamaicans from saving through taxable accounts and segments the domestic
savings market. Any marginal loss in the supply of domestic savings arising from such a measures can
be compensated for with additional foreign borrowing.

Inme Taxation of the Sedf-Emuloved
4.23.      Taxes on other individuals are derived primarily of the self-assessed returns of the self-
employed and the income of unincorporated business enterprises. While about 102 thousand individuals
are estimated to be a part of the self-employed work force earning in excess of the basic exemption,
only 23,000 or 22.5 percent of this group filed tax returns in 1992/93. Consequently, more than 3/4
of the self-employed with taxable income are out of the tax net. The resulting maldistribution of tax
burdens is compounded by the low compliance of the self-employed with payroll taxes. More
administrative resources need to be devoted to raising compliance rates among this group. This is
discussed in greater detail in Annex 2.
Companv Income Tax
4.24.      In the context of Jamaica's emphasis on privatization and attraction of foreign direct
investment, the overall design of the company income tax needs to be reviewed. Among corporate tax
issues which require attention are the double taxation of dividends; the tax treatment of capital gains;
instituting appropriate depreciation rules; plugging loopholes used to avoid taxes through leasing
transactions; the treatment of transactions with tax-exempt organizations like pension funds; transfer
pricing rules; and overcoming the effect of the differential between company tax rate (33 1/3%) and
individual tax rate (25%) on debt-equity ratios. Therefore, a detailed study is needed on the combined
issues of the best tax treatment for capital gains and dividends. This study or ancillary studies should
review the tax treatment of leasing, life insurance companies, financial institutions, pension funds and
capital cost allowances. Much analytical work has already been done in the cases of life insurance and
financial institutions taxation which, along with the appropriate updating, could provide the basis for
legislative reform in these areas.3
Rates
4.25.      The rate differential between the individual income tax rate, currently 25 % and company
income tax rates of 33 1/3% should be reduced to achieve greater neutrality in the choices between debt
or equity fiancing and between operating a business in a corporate or unincorporated form. The
higher corporate rate provides an incentive for companies to increase borrowing while using the
resultant funds to buy back shares or otherwise reduce capitalization. A narrowing or elimination of
the gap might be achieved by raising the income tax rate to compensate for the abolition of the
education tax, as discussed above.
Capital Cost Allowances
4.26.      Ideally, deductions for the cost of plant and equipment should be spread over the period
they produce income, so that tax depreciation is limited to the true loss in value of plant and equipment
over the tax year. An approximation to this ideal is to select a system of capital cost allowances which

Page 6 of 13
would produce a discounted present value of claimable allowances equal to the present value of
economic depreciation experienced by the asset.
4.27.      When inflation increases, the real present value of depreciable allowances, based on
historical costs, falls and investment is discouraged. The Jamaican Income Tax Act attempts to
compensate for high rates of inflation by providing for initial and investment allowances as well as
annual allowances. Recent high rates of inflation have reduced the present value of allowances below
the present value of economic depreciation.
4.28.      There are three possible solutions to this problem other than stopping inflation. They are
permitting full expensing, revaluing assets, and adopting a scheme of accelerated depreciation. None
of these solutions is ideal. Full expensing or immediate deduction of all capital expenditures is costly
to the government in terms of foregone revenue, and will lead to tax arbitrage oppornmities unless
interest deductibility is abolished or severely curtailed. Revaluation of assets or inflation adjustment,
while sometimes appropriate after a bout of chronic inflation, is nevertheless very demanding on tax
administrative resources. Thus, accelerated depreciation is an attractive option.
4.29.      However, equality between the discounted stream of accelerated depreciation allowances
and the present value of economic depreciation can be achieved at only one rate of inflation.
Therefore, an appropriate scheme of accelerated depreciation needs to be considered in the context of
the expected future rate of inflation. In addition, the system of capital cost allowances needs to be
simplified by pooling different types of plant and equipment into a few broad classes or categories of
assets based on their expected useful lives. To ensure the workability and effectiveness of any new
system, the authorities may wish to appoint an advisory group with representatives of the accounting
community and business to consider alternative accelerated depreciation designs.
4.30.      The current system, with its profusion of rates and special categories, is undoubtedly
difficult for officials of the Income Tax Department to admiinister. Complexity is also created by the
provisions which enable enterprises in some specified industries, known as "basic industries" to claim
either an initial allowance, which reduces the basis for the annual allowance, or an investment
allowance, which does not reduce the basis for the annual allowance. Both neutrality and easy of tax
administration would be enhanced by extending the same provisions to business in all sectors of the
economy. The authorities should also repeal the discretionary power of enterprises in basic industries
to select either the initial or the investment allowance. A simpler system based on the pooling of all
assets into a few classes would make it easier for tax auditors to police recapture iules.
Capital Gains Taxation
4.31.      Previous studies of the Jamaican tax system have recommnended the taxation of capital
gains as a substitute for the property transfer tax.4 The preferred design in these proposals is the
inclusion of inflation-adjusted capital gains in the income tax base as is done in Australia and the U.K..
If such a design is not feasible for Jamaica, due to administrative complexity, some ad hoc recognition
should be given for inflation such as that found in the Indian system and pre-1986 U.S. tax system.

4.32.       At present, nominal capital gains arising from the sale of assets are not included in the
tax basis of individuals or enterprises unless, in the case of individuals, gains on shares amount to more
than 50 percent of income in the current year.
4.33.        The capital gains exemption creates opportunities for tax avoidance through the
conversion of ordinary income into tax free capital gains and discourages corporations from declaring
dividend on after-tax profits. It also encourages equity financing; thus acting as a counterweight for
the lack of personal and corporate tax integration.
4.34.       Introducing a capital gains tax, while repealing the property transfer tax or applying it only
to large estates and gifts, would be a desirable reform objective for imnplementation over the next five
years. Such a reform should be undertaken in combination with a review of the tax treatment of
dividends. The authorities should be aware, however, of the problems associated with such a strategy.
4.35.       First, the taxation of capital gains, either as part of a comprehensive income tax or as a
separate schedular tax, would likely yield very little revenue in the first few years after implementation.
Revenue yields will be particularly meager if the valuation date for the cost base of an asset is set on
the tax's implementation date rather than on the asset's acquisition date. In most countries that have
initiated the taxation of capital gains the former approach has been adopted. In other words, only gains
arising after the taxes implementation are taxed. Experience in Australia and Canada suggests that,
under this approach, it takes between five to eight years for the revenue yield to reach its mature
contribution state. 5
4.36.       If gains are indexed to remove inflation-induced gains from  the base, the primary
remaining source of real gains will be retained earnings of corporations and real estate gains in urban
or tourist areas arising from increased demand and scarce supply. These real gains may provide a very
small tax base relative to the transfer taxes which they would supplant. For example, while the
inclusion of indexed capital gains in the Australian income tax base contributed only 0.5% of total tax
revenue in 1989/90, the Jamaican transfer tax yielded J$412 million or 2.2% of total tax revenues in
1992/93. There might, however, be some offsetting increases in dividend payouts with a corresponding
increase in dividend withholding tax revenues.
4.37.       However, an option exists for the transition to the taxation of capital gains, which would
sacrifice less revenue. 6 Under this option the present inter vivos property transfer tax, which provides
a "lesser of " rule for taxation based on nominal capital gains, would be transformed into a full-fledged
component of the income tax with inflation-adjusted gains from the date cf acquisition included in the
base. At present, the transfer tax is equal to the lesser of 7.5% of the fair market value of the
transferred property or 37.5% of the nominal capital gains realized as a result of the transfer. (Note
-5 Australia unnecessarily reduced its taxable capital gains base by enacting the provision under which only
assets acquired after 1985 would be taxed. This concession introduced a strong lock-in effect on assets
acquired before 1986. Tax receipts attributable to capital gains realizations were only 0.3 percent of total tax
revenue in 1989/90 and 0.5 percent in 1990/91. Rick Krever and Neil Brooks, A Capital Gains Tax For New
Zealand, (Victoria University Press, Wellington, N.Z, 1990), p. 35.

that the tax has a capital gains base only when nominal gains are less than 20% of the value of the
asset. In the current inflationary environment, the capital gains tax base criterion is unlikely to be met
for assets held for more than two years.) The cost basis which prevails under the current property
transfer tax might be carried over into a new taxation of capital gains as part of a comprehensive
income tax or as part of a schedular capital gains tax. Hence, a premature abolition of the property
transfer tax should be avoided, if the authorities wish to explore further the viability of this option.
4.38.      Another argument for caution is the difficulty of designing and administering a fair and
effective tax treatment for capital gains. At a minimum, it requires that the cost bases of capital assets
be adjusted for inflation, that restrictions be imposed on the deduction of net capital losses against
ordinary income, and that the tax burdens on dividends and capital gains be approximately equivalent.
The authorities should examine carefully the experience of Australia, which introduced the taxation of
indexed capital gains as part of its income tax in 1986. If the authorities decide to tax nominal (i.e.
non-indexed) capital gains, the marginal effective tax rate on capital would likely rise substantially and
discourage investment.
4.39.      Jamaica's status as a small open economy without a major financial market indicates that
residents might execute most of their purchase and sales of capital assets abroad. Voluntary reporting
of capital gains realizations would be very difficult to monitor by the revenue authorities under these
circumstances. The tax administration authorities would have the adequate documentation for detailed
audits of reporting compliance only in the case of capital gains arising from the sale of local real estate.
4.40.      Opportunities for tax arbitrage through the conversion of ordinary taxable income into tax-
free capital gains can be closed off or curtailed to some extent, even if capital gains are not made
taxable. Currently, taxpayers can deduct nominal interest payments on debt incurred to buy and hold
assets which yield a tax-free capital gain. Restrictions such as those on the deductibility of interest,
which exist in the U.K., or those on passive investment losses, which exist in the United States, might
be adopted to curtail interest deductibility. Tax administrators would need a basic grounding in
corporate accounting and a sound appreciation of the stratagems likely to be employed by taxpayers,
if they are to be effective in policing tax arbitrage.
4.41.      The highly capricious current taxation of capital gains under the 50% rule should be
abolished. The authorities are unlikely to gain any revenue from the current rule.
4.42.      Any decision to proceed with a capital gains tax in the future should be preceded by
extensive advance planning and careful consideration of drafting issues. In the meantime, the
authorities might wish to consider an interim strategy of abolishing or reducing stanp duties on most
property transfers, while retaining the property transfer tax and devoting more resources to auditing
declared fair market valuations.
Transfer Taxes and StamR Duties
4.43.      The combined impact of the property transfer tax, levied at a rate of 7.5% and stamp
duties for the transfer of physical property, levied at a rate of 5.5% generates a 13% tax burden on
property sales transactions. The property transfer tax in transfers at death and inter vivos transfers
generated J$ 402 million or 0.54 percent of GDP in 1992/93. The corresponding yield of the 5.5%



- 62 -
Annex 4
Page 9 of 13
stamp duties on conveyances was J$ 283 milliorn or 0.38% of GDP. This high burden on a narrow
base of transfers, in combination with the recent extension of the GCT to construction activity, is likely
to discourage new real estate and plant construction. In addition, the high effective tax rate on transfers
is likely to generate a significant "lock-in" effect, which impedes the sale of physical property.
Consequently, these combined rates discourage the efficient allocation of property. Sales of property
to the potential buyers who can make the best use of these asset are forestalled, and absentee landlords
are discouraged from selling property, which they cannot use efficiently. A reduction of the combined
effective burden on property transfers could be expected to unlock some of the pent up demand for
property acquisitions and sales. The combined revenue of the transfer tax and the stamp tax should not
decline by the full amount of the drop in stamp tax rates due to the supply-side response of the "lock-
in" effect working in reverse. In other words, lower rates should increase the volume of transactions,
as long as the government does not announce an intention to lower the tax burden even further in the
future.
4.44.      Only 6% of transfer taxes are collected from the transfers mortis causa. This low
contribution suggests that both undervaluation of assets and legal tax avoidance practices are widely
used to circumvent the tax which has a top marginal rate of rate 15% on estate values in excess of
J$100,000. One effective method of tax avoidance is to make provision for bequests in the form of
life insurance policies, whose benefits are exempt. Another method is to consolidate wealth in the form
of shares and securities sold on the Jamaican Stock Exchange which are also exempt. Including the
value of life insurance policy payments above a floor or de minimis level and the value of all stocks,
including those traded on the Jamaican exchange, in the taxable value of estates would be an effective
base-broadening measure.
4.45.      The discrimination between the tax treatment of public and private companies under this
tax, appears to impose an excessive penalty on privately incorporated companies as a form of business
operation. In combination with the rate differential between company and individual rate, this
discrimination may be predicted to lead Jamaican businesses to operate either as unincorporated
enterprises or as publicly-traded companies, while discouraging businesses to incorporate as private
companies.
4.46.      The administration of transfer taxes and stamp duties is antiquated. It is not effective at
detecting tax evasion. Auditing activity needs to be focused ensuring that the reported prices for
transfers are fair market value prices. Very little of the Stamp and Transfer Tax Department's
resources are devoted to such activity, even though the registry of property values used for property
tax assessments is maintained by this Department. For example, only six officers are available to handle
all verification of state land transfer values and only four officers are assigned to dealing with estate
duty issues. This departnent need to rationalize its resources by concentrating on the administration
of fewer taxes with simpler structures.
4.47.      Consideration should be given to removing most stamp duties except those associated with
travel and the receipt of government services, where the benefit principle of taxation should apply. For
example, registry fees should still be charged for the recording of property transfers and for
maintenance of parish registry offices.
4.48.      Other modern taxes now apply to financial institutions and life insurance companies. The
GCT is now applied to selective value added activities of banks, trust companies and other financial

Annex 4
Page 10 of 13
institutions. Domestic stamp duties consist of both specific and ad valorem taxes applied to legal
documents, fnancial transactions and to the provision of miscellaneous government services, such as
the granting of marriage licenses.
4.49.      Under this strategy, some of the more complex stamp taxes and ones, which constitute
major nuisances to doing business, should be targeted for repeal. One example of a nuisance duty is
the $1.00 tax on foreign exchange transactions. Time consuming effort must be assigned to recording
dutiable transactions even when collection is done by the "composition' method. This method implies
that the financial institution or travel company is appointed as the government's agent to undertake a
consolidation of the amount of duty owed and to periodically remit revenue to the Stamp Duty
Department. However, the authorities do not have the resources to verify the accounts of their agents
or to improve collection and enforcement of the variety of different taxes and fees which they oversee.
The potential revenue losses from reducing the number of dutiable transactions could be offset through
administrative improvement in compliance and imiproved auditing.
4.50.      The rationalization and curtailment of stamp duties is a strategically important reform,
which should be sequenced before an overhaul of the property transfer tax. First, the Government
would only have the opportunity to implement the option of using the current transfer tax as a stepping
stone to the taxation of capital gains outlined above if the former tax is retained. The government may
wish to retain property transfer tax on inter vivos gifts and bequests after the introduction of the
taxation of capital gains. If so, more time will be needed to design and implement a coherent wealth-
transfer tax on estates and gifts.
4.51.      Second the stamp tax regulations and administrative practices would appear to be less
difficult to reform than those of the transfer tax administration, because of there are so many different
categories of taxation in the case of stamp duties. As of 1988, domestic stamp duties were applied to
conveyances, company share transfers, notes, leases, checks, insurance policies, mortgages, licenses,
deeds, bonds, contracts, foreign exchange transactions, bills of exchange and all other credit
instruments. Over two dozen separately identified items were subject to fixed taxes, usually at very
low rates, while another dozen were subject to graduated rates, usually at fixed amounts. The stamp
duty office is swamped by collections recording paperwork and appears to carry out no significant
enforcement work.
4.52.      A sub-category of stamp taxes known as duties on inward customs warrants are collected
by the Commissioner of Customs and Excises along with other taxes on imports. In the past, they have
been used has a partially-hidden form of protection even on imports exempt from customs and as a
means of ensuring that imports of excisable commodities bear the same burden exclusive of customs
as locally produced excisable conunodities. Commodities subject to these duties include condensed
milk, corn and soya been and other agricultural commodities. These should be converted into excise
duties where their domestic counterparts are excisable. Others should be removed. The excisable
component would be administered by the GCT Department to ensure harmonization of the consumer
price of selective imports with their locally produced counterparts.
4.53.      Finally, removing the paper burden of the stamp duties might be viewed as a measure to
enhance the competitiveness of Kingston as a Caribbean financial center.

General Consumwion Tax
4.54.      The GCT, as it operated before the June 1993 Budget, contained more exemptions and
zero-rated sectors than are normally found in a value-added tax. The Budget proposes to implement
some base-broadening measures and an increase in the general GCT rate from 10% to 12.5%. Among
the measures adopted by the budget are: the elimination of most zero-ratings on non-export
commodities including unprocessed foods, printing and packing material and limiting zero rating in
agriculture; the extension of coverage to construction, assembling and rebuilding of motor vehicles and
the provision of certain financial services; broadening the base to include most excisable commodities
except petroleum products. These measures are expected to yield an additional J$ 2.4 billion in 1993.
During the implementation of these reforms administrative difficulties need to be monitored carefully.
Consideration should also be given to expanding the base to cover all excisable commodities taxed
under the SCT, including petroleum products, while making the appropriate adjustments to the rates
of SCT.
4.55.      Once the GCT administration has solved all problems relating to the implementation of
the new measures, consideration should be given to making additional classification reassignments of
sectors and commodities from zero-rated to exempt status as proposed in the recent McLure Report.
Capit Goods Credit Refunding under the GCT
4.56.      At present, the credit for GCT paid on capital goods, is spread over two years, prorated
on a monthly basis as GCT returns are filed. This restriction does not apply to exporters.
Consideration should be given to allowing the entire tax credit on capital goods to be taken
immediately. This approach is administratively optimal. Nevertheless, this approach might lead to
large, costly, and unexpected refunds. By contrast, it is sometimes suggested to governments
introducing a value-added tax that they not provide immediate refunds, but adopt a carry-forward
procedure instead, except in the case of exports. The carry-forward approach also provides the revenue
authorities with time to audit large capital good credit claims before they are fully paid out.
4.57.      It has been estimated by the authorities that the amount of capital goods GCT credit which
could be claimed immediately over a twelve month period is J$720 million using 1992 prices. The
value of the interest free loan foregone on the amount of tax credit by permitting immediate refunding
rather than a write off over a 24 months is equal to the amount of interest which would have to be paid
on a debt instrument with the same income stream . Using discount rates of 15 and 25 percent, the
present values of the interest payments on such an asset are estimated to be J$192 million and $292
milion, respectively.
4.58.      Because of these considerations, the iummediate-refund proposal should be introduced only
when all the recent changes to the GCT are operating effectively and when overall revenue targets can
stIll be attained despite this measure.
Transportation Excise Taxes
4.59.      The authorities should reexamine in a comprehensive fashion the design of taxes relating
to automobile transportation, including taxes on fuel, annual vehicle registration fees, and taxes on the
purchase price of vehicles. While the June 93 budget has increase road and license fees substantially



- 65 -
Annex 4
Page 12 of 13
to generate an expected additional J$213 million in 1993, a review of transportation taxation is still
warranted. This review should consider revenue generating potential, the impact on progressivity of
proposed changes and the scope and desirability of earmarking revenues for road improvement.
Environmental Taxation
4.60.      The authorities should consider comtnissioning a study of the scope for enviromnental
taxes including their domestic economic impacts, revenue-generation capability, impacts on
competitiveness, and administrative implications. Environmental damage arises, in part, because of
the underpricing of environmental resources relative to their social cost. Environmental taxes could
provide potential polluters or producers using environmentally destructive production techniques with
the right social cost prices.
ProUert Taxation
4.61.      The property tax has declined steadily as a proportion of total tax revenue in the recent
past. This decline has occurred due to the impact of inflation on the real value of assessments and the
failure to carry out revaluations and implement them in a timely fashion. The authorities should
consider the American municipal property tax practice of determining the property tax rate, known as
the mill rate, annually and setting it equal to the ratio of the desired revenue target to the tax base.7
This could be done by scaling up the entire rate schedule or adopting a single flat rate. Alternatively,
indexation could be applied to update the valuation rolls between general revaluations.
4.62.      When the new site revaluation schedule is adopted, it is expected that the tax will
contribute 2.3% of total tax revenue in 1994/95 or 0.6% of GDP. Its historical contribution has been
as high as 5% of total revenue. Derating of certain properties including agricultural should be
discontinued, so that the contribution of the property tax may be increased.
4.63.      A well-administered and buoyant property tax would create fewer economic distortions
than a tax on property transfers. As noted previously, the self-employed, many of whom are major
property owners engaged in agriculture, escape the income tax net. The property tax can be viewed
as a potentially more effective instrument for taxing the self-employed than the income tax.
4.64.      The relative burden of the property tax can more readily be judged by converting rates
from a tax on land to a tax on the income generated by land. A widely accepted assumption is that real
estate produces a real return of 5 to 6% of value. For a property taxed primarily at the 1.5 rate,
because it is valued in the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range, the equivalent income tax rate on property
income is in the range of 25 to 30%. For properties taxed prinarily at the 0.3% rate, because they are
valued in the range $50,000 to $100,000, the equivalent income tax rate is in the range of 5 to 6%.
However, for property with a site value in excess of $5 million, the marginal equivalent income tax
falls in the range of 50 to 60%. These rate can be contrasted with the 25% PAYE tax or the 33 1/3
tax on corporate earnings. It is apparent from these compaisons that, even if the authorities wish to

- 66 -
Annex 4
Page 13 of 13
retain progressivity in the rate structure, a substantial compression is the range is warranted. A single
flat rate of 1 percent. with a concessionary rate or total exemption for very low valued properties,
would remove the incentive to subdivide land holdings in order to escape the higher rates. A single
rate with a de minimis exemption would permit a productivity enhancing reassigmnent of administrative
resources. If the authorities have a strong conviction that a progressive rate schedule must be retained,
then the degree of progressivity should be small with a minimum rate no less than 0.7% and a
mnaximum rate no greater than 1.3%.
Tax Amnesties
4.65.      Tax amnesty schemes should be avoided because they do not improve future compliance.
Though a short term improvement in revenue may be experienced as a result of a one- time amnesty,
the evidence from a number of counties, including Argentina, Colombia, and India, suggests that such
improvements have not been sustained.8 An amnnesty for taxpayers, who have violated exchange
controls, is not without its own risks. Such an amnesty might create the expectation that the authorities
will sanction a broader amnesty in the future and hence discourage ,urrent compliance.
Sequencina and MaMzrgte revenue issues.
4.66.      Over time, improvements in tax administration of efficient and equitable taxes can make
up the revenue shortfall resulting from removing inefficient, badly-designed taxes. Presumably the
strategy of abolishing inefficient taxes and broadening the base of relatively efficient taxes through
administrative improvements would be executed contemporaneously. However, given implementation
problems which may be associated with certain measures such as the projected 6 fold increase in
property tax, the authorities may have no choice but to retain inefficient taxes until such time as the
tax administration reforms have done their work.

EXISTING COMPUTERIZATION OF THE TAX ADMNISTRATION
5 .1 .       Computerization of the tax administration departments has been the responsibility of Fiscal
Services Limited (FSL), a state enterprise created in 1985. It is located in a building in the outskirts of
Kingston specially adapted to hold large computers and telecommunications equipment; all data processing
and managerial staff are housed in the same building. Equipment is mostly Digital.
5.2.         The hardware and physical layout reflect a philosophy that user departments should come
to FSL to get their electronic data processing done. This has not worked, and technological advance is
moving in the opposite direction. In systems that work well today, the hardware, software and data are
all in the hands of the users. A computer technology unit is still necessary, but with a role of helping
users improve and better utilize their systems. FSL would need to reorient itself in this way.
5.3.         FSL has almost 170 staff engaged in the development and maintenance of the Tax
Administration and Customs collection and control systems. The various departments are connected to
FSL through terminals, maintain their own databases and are responsible for the integrity and
completeness of their databases.
5.4.         The availability of powerful microcomputers and local area networks, as wcil as that of
relatively inexpensive multiuser computers have resulted in a world-wide tendency towards decentralized
operations under direct user control. Whereas this is quite effective for single-user applications, multi-
user applications, especially transaction-oriented systems, require training and professional data processing
discipline which most users have no reason to develop. There is therefore an important role for quality
support by central data processing staff in organizations such as Tax Administrations.
5.5.         FSL is at present not well positioned to provide this quality service. It has a number of
old systems, labor-intensive and inflexible by modern standards which it must nevertheless continue to
service. Its equipment is to a large extent old, few development tools are available, and it suffers from
budget constraints. It also operates under a centralized approach with emphasis on terminals connected
to mainframes (or, in its case, clusters). Many of its brighter staff are employed in routine maintenance,
or have left the company. The result is dissatisfied clients and unmotivated FSL staff.
5.6.         A new role must be determined for FSL, to allow it to make full use of its valuable
resources, not least among which are its staff. Several strategies can be considered for leveraging FSL's
potential. First, its function as "Facility Manager" should be strengthened. As the logical "hub" for the
revenue departments telecommunications network, and repository of central shared databases, FSL could
"sell" hardware resources to its clients, who would be responsible for the data contained therein and the
programs used to process it. Accounting packages for such machine use are common, and they would
relieve FSL to a large extent from the thankless task of allocating priorities for equipment use.
5.7.         Another FSL function which should be strengthened is that of conceptual analyst or data
processing advisor. Assisting users in designing and testing applications, although the responsibility of
FSL, should be contracted out when appropriate. In-house program development has been very difficult
to mantain in the past, and although attempts to operate as a business have been tried in every country,
it does not work very well in government. Also, the client is not usually free to "vote with his feet" and
find another provider of service; on the other hand, the software developer cannot compete with the

Annex 5
Page 2 of 2
private sector as it is generally not paid for its services, and cannot therefore make capital investments,
upgrade equipment, hire staff freely, etc. Whereas this situation is not exactly that of FSL, it is
nevertheless in an uncomfortable middle ground between the private and public sectors in its modus
operandi.
5.8.         Yet another FSL function which should be emphasized is that of trainer, not only in the
use of the systems developed, but in the use of automated tools for operational functions in the tax
administration such as assessments and detection of taxpayers through cross-checking information.
5.9.         There are many other specialized functions which FSL could provide that would greatly
benefit the tax administration as well as provide a more satisfactory career progression for FSL personnel.
These would go hand in hand with the operational decentralization of systems and the training of users
in their care. To this effect, FSL should participate in the review of the organization of the tax
departments to be carried out under the project. This would help in identifying and meeting its training,
equipment and software requirements.

TIAINING
Training Resources and Facilities Available
6.1.         The training of employees of the Revenue Departments is authorized by the Revenue
Board Act, 1981. Section 4(d) of this Act empowers the Board to design and conduct training programs
for employees of Tax Departments. The Board develops policies and guidelines to address the needs of
the Departments for employee through the Training Branch.
6.2.         The Revenue Board facilitates the participation of staff in programs which are directly
related to the duties of the employees, through sponsorship of self-development programs or training in
institutions. The Board's Training Branch is responsible for plaming, improvement, co-ordination and
evaluation of training activities in the various Tax Administration Departments, assisting the Departments
in the development of programs and financial plans for training, establishing inter-departmental training
facilities, identifying functional areas in which new or expanded training activity is needed, conducting
training and providing for the identification and dissemination of findings in training technology.
6.3.         Each Department is responsible for determining its training needs, establishing training
programs (which may be attended by employees of other revenue agencies) and evaluating the
effectiveness of interdepartmental and other training programs attended by staff. There are training units
in the Inland Revenue, Customs, and Income Tax Departments; Land Valuation, Stamp Duty and
Transfer and GCT Departments do not have training units.
6.4.         The Training Branch also makes use of the Finance and Accountants College of Training
(FACT), according to an agreement between the Ministry of the Public Service and the Revenue Board.
The Branch has well established links to national and international management and tax specialists and
to institutes in Jamaica (e.g. the Jamaica Institute of Management, the Institute of Management and
Production, Pyramid Personnel Services), in the US (particularly IRS), and in CARICOM- and EC-
member states.
6.5.         There is currently a cadre of about 50 revenue employees trained in basic instructional
skills, 12 of whom have received advanced instructor training overseas, offering training occasionally
under the aegis of the Revenue Board. Several Commissioners teach in-house in their Departments as well
as in other Centers, e.g. in Kingston (FACT), in Montego Bay, or in Mandeville.
6.6.         A Comprehensive Training Plan (1992-1995) has been developed by the Revenue Board
to deal with the major tax measures implemented in recent years. This three-year plan sets out the
training requirements of the Revenue Services, and concentrates mostly on: i) the Revenue Agent
Program; ii) the General Training Program; and iii) the Electronic Data Processing Training. It makes
use of FACT, and training facilities at the Inland Revenue Department, the Income Tax Department,
Customs, and the Training Branch. Included in the General Training Programs are training alternatives
which supplement formal classroom training such as on-the-job training.

budget includes lunch, books & stationery, instructors fees, per-diem, and overseas training for 4000

of 140 Revenue Agents. Currently, 47 RAs are under training. The training program is constrained by
a lack of funds and is not closely linked to the career-path in tax administration in the form of obligatory
and/or consecutive training modules.
Training Resources and Facilities Reunired for Strengthening the Tax Departments
6.8.          Training will be of utmost importance in view of the proposed reorganization and
consequent changes in functions contemplated, through the project. The Training Branch is well aware
of the fact that many of the tax administration's current staff already need intensive training to keep up
with existing requirements, to properly deal with tax reforms implemented in the end 80s, and to improve
current performance. Training activities totalling US$ 0.6 have been planned under the project.
6.9.          As organizational restructuring will thoroughly affect current job functions, tasks and
responsibilities, the new work environment will impose numerous challenges to individuals. While some
staff may appreciate such process as immediately beneficial to them, most staff is likely to perceive
organizational transition as a phase of increased insecurity and consequently react with skepticism and
reluctance to change. Significant losses in productivity and resources may result from such behavior and
jeopardize the success of organizational reform. Besides adequate mechanisms of staff information and
participation, training facilities are of prime importance to address these issues, before and during this
process. A strong orientation to and investment in the development of human resources is needed, to
assure that the new structure is accepted and receives sustained support by its staff.
6.10.         Given the different stages of the strengthening operations, training plans need to be
elaborated, reflecting each stage's priorities, the new organizational structures developed, the new scope
of functions in divisions and departments, and the new staff skills required - to be identified in the
Master, Transition and Inplementation Plans (please refer to Annex 12 for further details). There is
therefore a need for sequenced training plans, distinguishing between short-, medium- and long-term skill
and job requirements.
6.11.         Intensive training will be required for most staff, both in the transition phase as well as
in the new organizational structure of tax administration, particularly in assessment and collection, to:
(i)    develop new skills required by new laws, rules and regulations;
(ii)   upgrade existing technical skills to the levels required in the new structure;
(iii)  improve current performance in areas of efficiency and productivity of work
organization;
(iv)   provide employees with opportunities for new career paths related to new job
descriptions.
6.12.         Given the magnitude of training requirements, training-of-trainers programs need to be
designed to make full use of and expand existing capacities. Middle-management in current tax
administration constitute a primary source for these purposes.
6.13.         Given the additional burden on management needed during transition and for the regular
operation of restructured tax administration, existing management skills need to be evaluated and
inproved. Comprehensive training plans to enhance and develop management skills are of particular
importance in the early stages.
6.14.         Although the Training Branch is staffed with qualified personnel, closely identified with
their work and with numerous contacts to national and international scholars, trainers and training
facilities, the Branch, in its present form and with its present staffing (including technical support staff),
will not be able to fully perform the encompassing training activities needed. As part of overall
organizational reform, considerable strengthening of the Training Branch is needed, specifically in its

coordinating and supervising function, providing it with appropriate and up-to-date teaching materials and
the physical infrastructure required.
6.15.         Besides training facilities currently provided in the offices of the Branch, other options
in the nearby Jamaica Conference Center and in the current departnents need to be reassessed and a
decentralized approach considered to minimize travel time and costs. Current training deficiencies in the
departments, particularly in Land Valuation, Stamp Duty and Transfer, and GCT need particularly to be
addressed.
6.16.        To provide information management, and plan training on a more permanent base, there
is a need for ongoing evaluation and monitoring of staff performance, staff skills and skill requirements.
Staff in the Training Branch may serve such a function and also provide data to assist the formulation of
an appropriate recruitment strategy.

TAXPAYER AUDITING
7.1.         The Jamaican tax system is designed to work primarily on the basis of voluntary
compliance. Taxpayers are required to file their returns on time, disclosing all relevant taxable
transactions fully and truly. They are expected to compute their tax liability themselves and pay the tax
on the prescribed dates. Further, many third parties have been delegated the responsibility of deducting
tax at source from payments made by them to existing or potential taxpayers and depositing the amounts
collected with the Inland Revenue within the specified time. For the system to function as intended, the
level of voluntary compliance has to be high. One of the principal means of ensuring that it is so, is
taxpayer auditing.
7.2.         Taxpayer auditing serves two purposes. First, it enables the tax authorities to scrutinize
returns and correct mistakes in classification, computation or claims of deductions and exemptions;
examine books of accounts and other evidence produced by the taxpayer; conduct field investigations to
detect tax frauds; and in cases where fraud is established levy penalties and/or prosecute the tax evaders.
Successful tax audits usually lead to additional revenues for Government.
7.3.         The second, and more important, purpose of taxpayer auditing is to create a deterrent
against tax evasion. Effective auditing accompanied by swift penalties for defaults warns taxpayers and
withholders in general that their returns are likely to be examined and if these are found to be incorrect
serioxus monetary and crininal consequences could follow. This induces taxpayers to declare and pay
their tax liabilities honestly and promptly. Taxpayer auditing is, thus, the key to voluntary compliance.
7.4.         The tax administration in Jamaica, as indeed anywhere else, does not have the resources
to audit each and every taxpayer. Therefore, the auditing effort has to be limited to a small percentage
of taxpayers. But, for it to have the desired impact on voluntary compliance, this limited audit has to
be well targeted, comprehensive and incisive. It has to oriented towards detecting concealment of taxable
transactions, attempts at reduction of tax liability by manipulation of transactions, and attempts at non-
payment or delay in payment of taxes. Above all the audit has to be accompanied by a commitment on
the part of tax authorities to relentlessly pursue tax evaders.
Current Status of Auditing   d Investigation
7.5.         The Jamaican tax administration currently faces the problems and constraints discussed
below:
Fragmentadon of Audng Resources
7.6.         Four operational departments, Income Tax, GCT, Stamp Duty and Transfer Tax, and
Inland Revenue, carry on taxpayer auditing. While the first three audit returns pertaining to their
assigned taxes, the Iland Revenue conducts audit in respect of Education Tax and HEART contributions.
The Revenue Board has a Comprehensive Audit Unit which carries out audits covering more than one
tax in a few important cases. There is, thus, considerable fragmentation of auditing activities. This has
had the effect of spreading the limited auditing resources available in each department too thinly over the
entire population of taxpayers handled by that department. Further, there is a lot of duplication of effort
as, very often, the same set of transactions gets repeatedly audited by different departments, with each
examining only the part that relates to the particular tax being administered by it. Furthermore, due to



-  73  -
Annex 7
Page 2 of 5
legal prohibitions or administrative bottlenecks and autonomy, there is little exchange of information or
coordination between departments. As a result of these factors, the tax administration is unable to adopt
an integrated approach towards taxpayer auditing. The divided efforts fail to produce the desired impact.
Legal Hurdles
7.7.          As discussed in detail in Annex 8, the tax administration is severely handicapped in its
auditing and investigation work due to legal prohibitions or lack of requisite powers. The major
prohibitions relate to exchange of information between tax departments and obtaining information relating
to taxable transactions from banks and financial institutions. The lack of powers is most seriously felt
in respect of search and seizure, survey, impounding of books and imposition of penalties for many
defaults. These legal hurdles prevent the tax authorities from reaching incriminating evidence that would
help them to establish and penalize tax evasion and, thus, set up a credible deterrent to spur voluntary
compliance.
Inadequacy and Inefficient Use of Infomaion
7.8.          Good information is critical to effective taxpayer auditing. A lot of it is available
mnternally from returns and documents submitted by taxpayers as well as from departmental studies,
reports and statistical analyses. In addition, substantial information needs to be collected from external
public and private sources. Even more important than the availability of information, is its timely and
optimal utilization. This requires storage of the information in a form that allows its quick retrieval, and
availability of tools to compile, classify, analyze and interpret it for the purpose of tax audit.
7.9.          The current tax audit machinery in Jamaica, suffers from both the inadequacy of
information and the inability to efficiently process information that is available. The legal hurdles
mentioned above deny tax auditors access to incriminating evidence in possession of taxpayers and third
parties. The lack of a unique Taxpayer Registration Number, makes it impossible to relate disparate
transactions to the taxpayers concerned. Further, there is no system for collection of intelligence relating
to tax evasion. The tax departments do not have any Secret Service Fund to purchase information from
informants, or reward informants who, suo motfo, supply information leading to detection of evasion.
On account of these circumstances, most audits have to be conducted with partial information and are,
therefore, ineffective.
7.10.         The inefficiency in the use of available information stems mainly from the lack of
computerization. Most of the work of the income tax department is done manually. Even where
computerized data is available it is not easily accessible, or is in such a form that it cannot be easily used
for audit purposes. The tax departments also lack analytical tools to conduct industry analyses, study
trends in tax evasion, or pin-point suspicious transactions.
7.11.         The information-related constraints affect the selection of audit cases as also the depth and
coverage of the audits. These constraints appear to be, to a large extent, responsible for the poor impact
of tax audits and insignificant detection of serious tax evasion.

Annex 7
Page 3 of 5
Inadequate Auditing and Invesigaton Skills
7.12.        The tax administration has an on-going Revenue Agents Training Program. This is
intended to impart training in auditing, accounting and tax laws. 140 Revenue Agents trained under this
program are working in different tax departments. However, considering the auditing work load, a large
part of the audit work is being handled by other officials, who have not received the same training. Even
the training of the Revenue Agents appears to be inadequate in certain essential areas, such as
investigation techniques and intelligence gathering.
7.13.        The total absence of prosecution for tax evasion suggests that Revenue Agents and other
auditors do not possess the skills needed to tackle sophisticated tax evasion. Also, the lack of field
investigations indicates that the auditors are not well-versed in investigation and the collection of evidence
to establish tax frauds. At present, audit efforts appear to be concentrated on finding mistakes in records
produced by the concerned taxpayers. Needless to say, the probability of finding evidence of evasion
through such records, which in all probability are sanitized before presentation to revenue authorities,
is minimal.
Lack of Transport Facites
7.14.        The effectiveness of tax audits is also reduced on account of the non-availability of official
transport to auditors and their subordinate staff for conducting field enquiries and surveys. This
reinforces the tendency to conduct desk-bound audits.
Attitudinal Problems
7.15.        Partly because of the handicaps created by factors discussed above and partly due to other
reasons, there appears to be a lack of will to take vigorous action to combat tax evasion. Tax authorities
seem to have a extremely diffident attitude while dealing with taxpa ers. Compromise and negotiation
with the taxpayers, rather than vigorous enforcement of the tax laws appears to be the dominant approach.
Audits are, invariably, conducted after notifying the taxpayer. Surprise visits to taxpayer premises, which
can be immensely useful in collection of evidence of tax evasion are not undertaken at all. No physical
verification of inventories of taxpayers carrying on business is carried out. Only six appeals relating to
the quantum of tax liability determined after audit are pending. There are very few cases of imposition
of penalties for substantive non-compliance. And there is no case of prosecution for tax evasion.
Strena   g_ Tamaver Auding
Consolidating the Audit Function
7.16.        To avoid the problems caused by fragmentation of the auditing efforts of various
departments it is proposed to merge the Income Tax, GCT, and Stamp Duty and Transfer Tax
Departments into a single Assessment Department (AD). This department would look after the auditing
for all taxes. The AD would also carry out field intelligence operations and investigations.
7.17.        The auditors from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), who currently are responsible
for audit of Education Tax and HEART contributions would be transferred from the IRD to the AD.
Consequently, the IRD would cease w. perform audit functions and would concentrate only on collections.



-  75  -
Annex 7
Page 4 of 5
7.18.        Consolidating the audit function would lead to a better sharing and utilization of
information; enable the audit of liabilities under different taxes at one go; and mend holes in the tax net.
Also, pooling of auditors from different departments would increase the percentage of taxpayers covered
by the audits. This would increase taxpayers' risk of being audited and would encourage voluntary
compliance. Finally, an integrated auditing organization would help in building up audit and investigation
skills as auditors would be exposed to the totality of a taxpayer's economic activities as against only a
part thereof.
Removng Legal Hurdles
7.19.        As indicated in Annex 8, a number of areas where legislative amendments would help
in improving taxpayer audit quality have been identified and agreed to. The necessary amendments are
expected to be enacted in the early phases of the project.
Zmproing Information Systems
7.20.        Information availability and its utilizati-n for audits would be improved by equipping the
AD with appropriate computer hardware and software. Using these systems, as well as those to be
installed at the IRD for returns and collections, the AD auditors would be able to readily access
information furnished by taxpayers under different taxes and detect discrepancies, if any. They would
also be able to, simultaneously, determine liabilities arising under various taxes for any given taxpayer.
Easy cross-verification of information furnished by taxpayers having transactions with each other, or
related to each other, would be facilitated.
7.21.        The systems would, further, enable the AD to collect information from external sources
on a regular and systematic basis. Utilities (electricity, gas, telephone), Registrars of companies,
professional societies, clubs, Registrars of property, Government license departments, real estate agencies
and so on would be asked to supply information relating to taxpayers having dealings with them, along
with the TRN of the concerned taxpayers, in magnetic form and the same would be incorporated in the
department's data bases.  The AD would itself compile tax-related information through market
intelligence, radio and television advertisements, newspapers, trade and industry journals, telephone
directories etc..
7.22.        The improved information would be used to select cases for audit on the basis of objective
criteria to increase the transparency of selection process as well as to create an element of randomness
which is essential for heightening the risk perception in the minds of potential tax evaders. At the same
time, the new systems would enable the auditors to identify cases in which the chances of finding
significant evasion are high. This would increase the productivity of audits in terms of additional revenue
generated.
7.23.        To enhance the auditors's ability to use available information, the AD would be provided
with software to conduct computerized analysis of financial statements, trends in economic activity and
taxpayer behavior. This would help in pin-pointing areas that need special attention and investigation.
Enhancent of Audng SkiUls
7.24.        The training program  for Revenue Agents would be tloro ghly reviewved and



- 76 -
Annex 7
Page 5 of 5
strengthened. Investigation and evidence gathering techniques would be made an integral part of the
program. All auditors who have not received the requisite training would be put through rigorous
training courses in batches. Recruitment of trained auditors, as well as of computer specialists and
economists to handle specialized tasks would be undertaken to plug skill gaps that cannot be filled up by
existing personnel.
Improvement of the Management of Taxpayer Auditing
7.25.        In order to improve the management of auditing activity in the AD, detailed procedures
and systems would be developed to plan and execute audits. Performance indicators would be established
to measure the effectiveness of audits conducted by each auditor or audit group. To motivate tax auditors
to adopt an aggressive approach towards tax evasion, so as to maintain the integrity of the voluntary
compliance based tax system, the incentive system in the AD would be so constructed as to reward
detection of tax fraud and prosecution of tax evaders. Apart from monetary rewards being based on
amount of concealment detected, promotions and recognition would also be predicated on performance
in this area.
Faciatng neld Work
7.26.        In order to encourage auditors to undertake field enquiries, they would be provided with
official transport by acquiring new vehicles. In order to free GOJ from the significant recurring burden
of maintenance, insurance and drivers' salaries and also to improve the attractiveness of employment in
tax administration, with a view to hire qualified individuals, a substantial number of vehicles will be
leased to the staff and managers of the tax departments engaged in field operations. The lessees would
be required to use these vehicles primarily for official work and would be responsible for maintenance
and insurance. In case a staff member ceases to work in the tax administration, the lease will be
cancelled. The lessees will have the option to buy the vehicles after a stipulated period of not less 4
years. In addition to the leased vehicles, multi-passenger vehicles will be procured for use by the tax
administration.

Annex 8
Page 1 of 8
TAX ADMNSTRATION LEGAL FRAMEWORK
8.1.         A review of the administrative provisions of various tax laws indicates that the current
legal framework has a number of shortcomings which contribute to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in tax
administration. The most serious deficiencies lie in the area of enforcement where tax authorities do not
have certain basic powers that are needed to ensure compliance. In addition, the prescribed procedures
for assessment of tax liability seem to encourage high initial assessments, as well as delays. Deficiencies
in provisions relating to collection of taxes appear to cause an avoidable increase in tax arrears and induce
payment delays by taxpayers. Further, there appears to be a need to strengthen the appellate machinery.
Finally, there is considerable scope for harmonizing procedures under different taxes to simplify
compliance and for limiting administrative discretion to improve the transparency of the system.
Imurovig Enforcement of Tax Laws
Making Regisrton Complsory
8.2.         At present, there is no unique Taxpayer Registration Number (TRN) in use. Such a
number is essential for monitoring taxpayer activity, determining tax liability under various tax laws, and
collecting taxes. GOJ has indicated its agreement to the introduction of a TRN for all taxpayers.
Amendment of the Revenue Administration Act to make the registration of all taxpayers compulsory is
under active consideration.
8.3.         The amendment would need to be backed up by administrative instructions to all
departmnents dealing with taxes, duties, rates and fees to revise the forms in use to request the TRN, and
ensure that it is given. Such instructions would not only help in properly identifying transactions of
registered taxpayers, but also encourage unregistered taxpayers, such as those needing to obtain a
driver's license upon payment of the requisite fee, or to purchase stamp paper for entering into a contract,
to get themselves registered.
Facitatng Exchange of Information Between Revenue Depainents
8.4.         Section 4 of the Income tax Act (ITA) requires every income tax official to regard all
information relating to the income of a person as secret and confidential. It prohibits communication of
such information to any other person without the authorization of the Minister, or otherwise than for the
purposes of the ITA.
8.5.         This provision is apparently intended to the protect the privacy of the taxpayer. But in
its present form, while preventing leakage of information about a taxpayer's income to private parties,
it also prevents the Income tax Department from sharing the information in its possession with other tax
departments. This seriouslyjeopardizes the efficiency of tax administation, because information relating
to the income-earning activities of a person can be of vital importance to the determination of his liability
under other tax laws. Section 4, therefore, needs to be amended to authorize income tax officials to share
information relating to the income of a taxpayer with other revenue departments. Similar amendments
to Section 37 of the Transfer Tax Act and any other Revenue Acts which contain such provisions would
also be needed. The General Consumpton Tax Act (GCTA), which permits communication of
information relating to GCT to other tax departments can be used as a model for the purpose.

Annex 8
Page 2 of 8
Empowenng Tax Authorities to Obtain Infonnation from Third Parties including Banks and Finanal
Institutons:
8.6.         A major barrier which keeps tax authorities from accessing information relevant to the
assessment and collection of taxes and duties is the secrecy provision of the Banking and Financial
Institutions Act which prohibits banks and financial institutions from supplying information relating to
transactions of their clients to the tax authorities.
8.7.         Modem economic activity involves extensive banking and financial transactions. While
many of these transactions are disclosed by taxpayers in their returns to the tax authorities, many others
are concealed. In order to enforce the tax laws and curb tax evasion, it is imperative that revenue
authorities have access to information relating to all transactions. Therefore, the power to requisition
information from banks and financial institutions needs to be granted to tax authorities. In order to
prevent indiscriminate use of this power and minimize infringement of privacy, adequate safeguards may
be built into the law. For instance, this power may be made operable only in cases that are selected for
intensive tax audit, or where the information is needed for the investigation of cases of senous suspected
tax evasion. As a further safeguard, subordinate officers may be required to take the written approval
of the Commissioner before calling for the information.
8.8.         There appears to be no constitutional impediment with regard to allowing tax authorides
to requisition information from banks and other financial institutions. The proposal is also consistent with
the provisions of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act which enable the Minister to obtain Banking
information about taxpayers when such information is required by Jamaica's Double Taxation Treaty
partners.
Strengthening Field Operations:
8.9.         One of the most important factors contributing to the weakness of tax administration in
Jamaica is the inadequacy of field operations designed to check tax evasion. At present, due to various
legal and administrative constraints, tax authorities are virtually desk-bound and operate on the basis of
whatever information the taxpayer chooses to provide them. This has the effect of keeping, practically,
the entire black economy out of their reach, with grave consequences. First, the Government suffers
massive loss of revenues. Second, the failure to detect and punish tax evasion adversely affects voluntary
tax compliance since taxpayers perceive the costs of non-compliance to be minimal. Third, unchecked
evasion creates a feeling of inequity amongst taxpayers, such as employees subject to withholding tax,
who pay their taxes. The legislative changes indicated below are needed to strengthen field operations.
Search and Seire
8.10.        Search and seizure is an extremely effective measure for combating tax evasion and
creating a credible deterrent to encourage voluntary compliance. It is extensively used by the tax
administrations in a number of countries. It enables access to evidence of concealed transactions, which
is not likely to be produced before tax authorities in regular audit proceedings. Further, it helps to
unearth unaccounted assets acquired through such transactions and facilitates tax collection.
8.11.        The powers to search premises of suspected tax-evaders and to seize evidence of tax fraud
found during the search need to be provided to authorities under all the major tax laws. Search and



- 79 -
Annex 8
Page 3 of 8
seizure powers are already available under the Customs Act (CA) and the General Consumption Tax Act
(GCTA). Thus, the concept is not new. It only needs to be incorporated in other tax laws, especially,
the Income Tax Act (ITA). While doing so, the adequacy of powers under the CA and GCTA also needs
to be reviewed. In addition, adequate checks and balances need to be designed to ensure that there is no
unwarranted invasion of the law-abiding taxpayer's privacy.
Survey
8.12.        Section 91(2) of the ITA allows authorized persons of the I.T. Departnent to enter the
premises of a taxpayer during certain hours and inspect and copy any books or documents relating to
assertions made by the taxpayer about his income. The powers available under this section are
inadequate. While they enable some verification of past transactions, they allow no checking of current
transactions and verification of cash and other business assets which very often embody evaded income.
The survey powers need to be considerably strengthened.
9.13.        The ITA does not also allow general survey of taxpayers for the purpose of detecting
unregistered taxpayers. In order to bring all potential taxpayers in the tax net and, thereby, develop a
broad tax base it is necessary to empower Income Tax authorities to visit taxpayer premises in order to
obtain information about their income-earning activities.
8.14.        While strengthening survey powers under the Income Tax Act, those under the GCT Act
also need to reviewed in terms of their adequacy and appropriate amendments to section 51 of the Act
need to be made simultaneously.
Impounding of Incninaing Records
8.15.        Under the ITA and GCTA, the tax authorities can only make copies of a taxpayer's books
of accounts and documents. They have no power to impound and retain them in their custody. This
seriously affects their ability to prosecute tax evaders. To remove this deficiency, tax authorities need
to be empowered to impound incriminating documents.
8.16.        It may be mentioned that section 52 of the GCT Act already gives powers to GCT
authorities to impound original documents found during search and retain them for a limited period of
time. This suggests that granting impounding powers to other tax authorities would be legally feasible.
The power under the GCT Act, however, needs to be broadened to cover non-search situations. While
the revenue authorities may be allowed to retain impounded documents in their custody for a specified
period initially, provision may be made for them to seek extension of the retention period from a
competent court or from the Commissioner.
Imposition of Penalties for Non-compliance
8.17.        The current scheme of the tax laws makes tax authorities highly dependant on the
judiciary for securing compliance with even the procedural provisions of the laws. A large number of
routine defaults like not filing returns, not furnishing requested information, or failing to appear before
a tax authority when summoned, have been made offenses punishable by fines and imprisonment terms.
While on paper this appears impressive, in practice, it leads to ineffective enforcement. The fact that a
particular default is an offense implies that for punishment of the defaulter the tax authority has to file



- 80 -
Annex 8
Page 4 of 8
a case before the court: by itself it can do nothing. Reliance on the courts in this respect creates many
difficulties. First, formal court procedure results in long delays. In an inflationary enviromnent, a
reasonably well-advised taxpayer can often prolong his case indefinitely. This takes the sting out of the
punishment that may be, eventually, meted out to him. Second, the judiciary has its own backlog of a
variety of other cases and it is not possible for it to assign a special priority to tax cases. Third, tax laws
are highly technical and complex. As a result it is not always possible to have tax cases heard by judges
who fully appreciate the implications of the defaults. Finally, the degree of evidence required to secure
a conviction in a court of law is very high and many cases fail because it is not always possible to prove
an attempt to flout tax laws, beyond a reasonable doubt.
8.18.        In order to strengthen the tax administration in enforcing compliance with the tax laws,
the present system for penalizing various defaults needs to be carefully re-examined. Tax authorities need
to be given direct powers to impose monetary penalties for most defaults. The present prosecution
proceedings may, if considered necessary, be retained for use only in serious cases of tax evasion.
Making Tax Proceedings Quasi-judkial
8.19.        In order to enhance the impact and effectiveness of proceedings before tax authorities,
it would be desirable to give them the status of quasi-judicial proceedings. Tax authorities may be
granted the same powers as the civil courts in respect of discovery and inspection of documents,
enforcing attendance of witnesses, recording evidence on oath and issuing commissions.
Indexaion of Penaltes for lnulaiion
8.20.        Most of the penalties that can be imposed under the tax laws have been stated in absolute
Jamaican Dollar amounts. When originally enacted these amounts may have been significant enough to
deter the relevant default. However, inflation appears to have steadily eroded the deterrent effect of the
penalties. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the penalties, it is important to index them for
inflation.
Improvig Efficiency of Assesment of Tax Liabilitv
Shortening the Period of Initia Assessment:
8.21.        The ITA and the GCTA allow the Commissioner to make an initial assessment of a
taxpayer's liability within the year of assessment or the following six years. The Transfer Tax Act (TTA)
contains no time limit for the initial assessment. For efficient tax administration, the initial assessment
needs to be completed expeditiously. For, the availability of evidence to prove tax evasion rapidly
declines with time. Also, the collection of additional tax demand, raised as a result of assessment,
becomes more difficult as the addresses, businesses or circumstances of taxpayers change as time elapses.
In order to make meaningful tax audits, it is essential that the initial assessment should be completed
within one or two years after the relevant assessment year. The time limit should be legally stipulated
so that tax officials do not procrastinate. Early finalization of assessment is also good public policy as
it resolves the uncertainty surrounding a taxpayer's liability more quickly and gives the Govenmment a
better idea of the taxes due to it.

Streamlning Assessment Procedure
8.22.        The assessment procedure prescribed under the ITA, GCTA and TTA requires the making
of a unilateral assessment of tax liability in the first instance. Only at the second stage, if the taxpayer
objects to the assessment, does the Commissioner embark on a verification of facts by calling for evidence
or summoning witnesses. Since any material increase in a taxpayer's liability is likely be challenged, the
second stage would, presumably, need to be gone through in most cases. This leads to unnecessary
duplication of work. In order to avoid the consequent delays in finalization of assessment and collection
of taxes, it would be better to require verification of the return before the initial notice of assessment is
issued.
Making Assessment More Objective:
8.23.        The wording of the assessment powers of authorities under the ITA, GCTA and TTA
gives them too much leeway. For instance, under the ITA, in any given case, the Commissioner may
refuse to accept a return and may make an assessment to the 'best of his judgement' at an amount at
which the taxpayer 'ought' to be charged. In the same vein, under the GCTA, if a return 'appears' to
the Commissioner to be incomplete or incorrect, he may make an assessment of the amount that 'in his
opinion' the taxpayer ought to have paid. And where he is not satisfied with the calculations or the return
of the taxpayer, he may assess the tax at an amount that he 'thinks' the taxpayer ought to have paid.
8.24.        Such broadly phrased powers can lead to arbitrary, unreasonable and subjective
assessment of tax liability. This adversely affects the perception of the tax administration's fairness in
the eyes of the taxpayer and, thus, voluntary compliance. Subjective assessments also lead to avoidable
litigation. Finally, the lack of the need to base assessments on concrete facts promotes slipshod orders
which, eventually, get knocked down in appeal.
8.25.        Suitable amendments need to be made in the assessment provisions to require tax
authorities to pass speaking orders, clearly indicating the basis and rationale of their conclusions. Best
judgement assessments should be allowed only in those cases where the taxpayer does not file a return,
does not cooperate in the assessment proceedings, does not maintain proper books of account, or where
the books cannot be relied upon for the purpose of assessment. Even then, the basis of estimating the
taxpayer's liability should be required to be explicitly stated.
Improving Tax Collection
Making Payment of Income Tax Defcency Along with the Return Compulsory:
8.26.        The ITA does not require the taxpayer to make good the deficiency, in tax calculated on
the basis of the returned income, that remains payable after accounting for tax deducted at source and
estimated tax paid, along with the return. The unpaid tax is left to be collected by the Internal Revenue
Department. This imposes an avoidable burden on the tax collection machinery and also delays the actual
collection of the tax. Section 67 needs to be amended to make it mandatory for a taxpayer to attach proof
of payment of the full amount of tax due on the basis of the returned income along with the return.
Failure to pay the full tax should be made punishable by a suitable penalty.

Annex 8
Page 6 of 8
Increasing Estimated Tax Collections
8.27.        To increase the collections of estimated tax under the ITA, the following amendments
need to be considered to sections 65 and 66 thereof:
(i)   Include the last assessed income as one of the bases for determining estimated tax
liability, if it is more than the income returned for the immediately preceding year.
(ii)   Provide for a penalty for furnishing a false declaration of estimated tax and for
non-payment of estimated tax.
Indexing Interest for Inflation:
8.28.        At present interest chargeable for delayed payment of taxes is not indexed for inflation.
In an inflationary situation, the interest charged does not adequately compensate Government for the delay
in receipt of revenues due to it. In fact, if the interest is less than inflation, it induces taxpayers to
postpone payments to Government. To eliminate this problem, interest, like penalty amounts, should be
indexed for inflation under all taxes. Alteratively, the interest rate should be set at the Government T-bill
rate.
ImPjMa the Appelate Structu
8.29.        The current IT, GCT and TT laws allow a taxpayer to file objections against an
assessment made by the Commissioner to the Commissioner himself. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied by
the decision of the Commissioner on the objection, he may appeal to the Revenue Court. Other decisions
of the Commissioner may also be challenged in the Revenue Court. Appeal from the judgement of the
Revenue Court may be taken to the Court of Appeal.
8.30.        The present appellate system appears to require restructuring. The difficulties experienced
by exclusive reliance on the judicial machinery for the imposition of penalties, discussed above, also
apply to settlement of tax disputes. Lack of expertise relating to tax matters amongst judges dealing with
general law, and inordinate delay in disposal of cases can be extremely costly to Government, when it
comes to tax appeals.
8.31.        While the need to maintain the judiciary's pre-eminence in deciding questions of law
cannot be over-emphasized, it may be desirable to have technical and factual issues decided by quasi-
judicial authorities manned by tax law experts. These authorities could also adopt more flexible
procedures which would quicken the pace of disposal of appeals.
8.32.        The current system of filing objections to the Commissioner against assessment does not
really amount to a first appeal, because the objections are filed before the very officer who made the
assessment. This also militates against the fairness of the tax system. The filing of objections can be
altogether eliminated if, as suggested above, verification of facts is mandated in the very first stage of
assessment proceedings, rather than after the 'initial assessment'. In that case, the taxpayer's viewpoint
would have been duly considered by the assessing authority before coming to a decision and only one
assessment order would be needed. In place of the opportunity to file objections, the taxpayer should be



- 83 -
Annex 8
Page 7 of 8
allowed to file a regular appeal against the assessment. This appeal should be heard by a Commissioner
(Appeals) who would be a senior revenue officer conversant with the intricacies of the tax laws, but
independent of the administrative Commnissioner. He would have the mandate to decide appeals strictly
on merits, in a judicial manner. This procedure will enhance the perception of faimess of the tax
administration in the minds of the taxpayers.
8.33.        An appeal from the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) may be allowed to the Revenue
Court. However, cases in the Revenue Court should be heard by benches comprised of members of the
judiciary and general lawyers, on the one hand, and tax lawyers, chartered accountants or senior revenue
officers, on the other. The Revenue Court should be made the last fact finding authority.
8.34.        Appeals from the decisions of the Revenue Court may be allowed to the Court of Appeals
and thereafter to the Privy Council, as at present. But these should be restricted to questions of law only.
Other Lea Areas
HarmonizAion of provisions of vanous tax statutes:
8.35.        Various tax statutes need to be systematically studied to harmonize their provisions
relating to collection, assessment and enforcement, especially, in following areas:
(i)    Procedure and timing of payment of taxes.
(ii)   Interest to be charged for delayed payments.
(iii)   Procedure regarding filing of returns.
(iv)   Requirements regarding maintenance of books of accounts and other records.
(v)    Procedure for assessment of tax liability.
(vi)   Procedures for filing and disposal of objections and appeals against assessments
and other orders of tax authorities.
(vii)  Procedures for search, survey, requisitioning of information from third parties,
impounding of documents and their retention periods, allowing inspection of
seized or impounded records etc..
(viii)  Definition of offenses and defaults.
(ix)   Quantum of penalty and/or punishment that can be imposed for similar kinds of
defaults and offenses.

8.36.        The discretionary provisions in various statutes need to be examined to eliminate the
possibility of arbitrariness, corruption, and harassment of the taxpayer.

TAX COLLECTION
Curnt Status
9.1.         The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) is in charge of collection of taxes, contributions,
fees and traffic fines.  It does not collect stamp duties, customs duty or the consumption taxes on
imports. The most important taxes and contributions collected by the IRD are the following:
Income Tax
General Consumption Tax
Special Consumption Tax
Property Tax
Transfer Tax
Education Tax
Production Levies
Betting Tax
Transportation Taxes
National Insurance Scheme (NIS) contributions
Human Employment and Resource Training (HEART) contributions
9.2.         Tax returns and payments are received by the IRD either directly from the taxpayers or
through the post. At the collectorates located at Kingston, St. Ann and St. Andrew these are processed
using computerized tellers connected to a local area network and the payments received are classified by
tax and teller. In the other 24 collectorates, processing is manual. In all the collectorates, a summary
report is produced every day. Every week the computer files are sent to Fiscal Services Limited (FSL)
for processing and the manual files are batched and sent to the Departments for inputting into their
computer systems using terminals connected to PSL equipment.
9.3.         The current system has the following drawbacks:
(i)    FSL, which  is responsible for centralized  computer operations and
communications, is handicapped by obsolete equipment and a high staff turnover
(for more information please see Annex 6). Due to the old fashioned software
and programming techniques used, processing time for collections is very long:
the Income Tax Department, for example, prepares information on collections
with a delay of a minimm of one month, and it takes 6-12 months to notify a
taxpayer of non-compliance.
(ii)   Bad telephone line quality introduces many errors in the computerized records.
The user departments, however, cannot correct these errors, because the system
allows them to only consult, not modify, their files. This considerably delays
correction of taxpayers' accounts and, in turn, slows down collection.
(iii)   Collections of different taxes are processed using different application systems
and databases for each tax, although all systems run on the same Mainframe.
Thus, the programs and files for GCT are different from those for Income Tax.



- 86 -
Annex 9
Page 2 of 7
While, technically, the systems could exchange information, legally the Income
Tax information cannot be provided to other tax departments. Since information
about a taxpayer's liabilities under different taxes is not processed in an
integrated manner, the present system allows taxpayers to default under one tax
while complying under another. Also, the total amount due from a particular
taxpayer is not readily available. Consequently, the monitoring and recovery of
arrears is very inefficient.
9.4.         To strengthen the revenue collection machinery improvements in both the administration
and the collection systems of the IRD are required.
bpprovlnf IRD Admintration
Redefining the Functions of the IRD
9.5.         To improve collection efficiency, the IRD's efforts need to be focussed exclusively on
collection of revenues. This would require freeing the IRD from all its existing audit responsibilities,
which would be assigned to the proposed Assessment Department. In the field of collection, however,
the IRD needs to be given complete and exclusive responsibility. The IRD would not only collect what
taxpayers pay voluntarily, but would have the sole responsibility of enforcing collection of outstanding
dues. As mentioned elsewhere, a unique Taxpayer Registration Number (TRN) is to be issued to all
taxpayers. Since the IRD is the department that comes most in contact with taxpayers, it should also have
the responsibility of managing the allotment of TRNs to existing and future taxpayers. The IRD's revised
charter of duties, therefore, needs to include the following:
(i)    Receipt of all tax returns and other remittance documents.
(ii)    Receipt of all payments mentioned above.
(iii)   Maintenance of up-to-date record of liabilities of taxpayers under all taxes,
including liabilities on account of self-assessed tax, estimated tax and additional
tax, penalty and interest found payable upon assessment.
(iv)   Ensuring the filing of tax returns. For this purpose, the IRD would levy
penalties for non-filing and delayed filing of returns.
(v)    Ensuring the timely payment of all amounts due from taxpayers. For this
purpose, the IRD would promptly detect defaults in payment; levy penalties for
non-payment, compute interest payable for delay in payment; notify the defaulters
of total amounts due from them on all accounts; and take all non-coercive and
coercive steps needed to enforce payment.
(vi)   Filing and following up court cases, wherever necessar, to secure subnussion
of returns and recovery of arrears.
(vii)  Allotment of the TRN to all existing and future taxpayers.

Creating Functional Units within IRD
9.6.         In order to enhance the efficiency of the IRD, it needs to be organized into two main
functional divisions: Planning and Operations.
9.7.         The Planning Division, at IRD headquarters, would be responsible for the following
activities:
(i)    Carry out or commission studies to improve collection procedures and taxpayer
services; define and introduce the requisite systems and technologies; and
develop internal rules and regulations to ensure the smooth and efficient
functioning of the IRD.
(ii)   Formulate the Collection Plan for each collectorate, identifying the human,
fimancial and material resource requirements.
(iii)   Carry out periodic evaluations of the execution of the collection procedures, and
the Collection Plan by each collectorate.
(iv)   Develop systems for the administration, updating and control of taxpayer
infonnation, prepare rules and procedures for the use of the systems; periodically
review the operation of the systems and make improvements as required.
(v)    Design all forms to be used for allotment of TRN, filing of returns and
collection; control their production and distribution; and weed out obsolete
forms.
ODerations
9.8.         The Operations division would deal with taxpayers in all the 27 collectorates on a day
to day basis. It would allot TRNs; receive tax returns, remittance forms and payments; manage the cash
flow and ensure promnpt credit of collections to the account of the Government or the NIS and HEART
Trust, as the case may be; maintain records of all taxpayer liabilities and payments; review accounts in
default on an on-going basis; take necessary steps to effect recovery; and facilitate timely payment and
registration by taxpayers by reducing delays and providing prompt service.
Svstemic Inmprovements
9.9.         As indicated above, the present data processing system being used by the tax
administration in Jamaica is causing serious problems. In restructuring the system, it would be useful
to keep in mnind the best practices for use of computer technology being followed currently in other
countries. These are:
(i)    Decentralization of responsibility for automated systems to the units which have
direct functional duties, such as collection and taxpayer registration.

Annex 9
Page 4 of 7
(ii)   Introduction of a multi-vendor, open-architecture hardware platform by selecting
a very portable operating system, for example DOS for microcomputers or UNEX
for local area networks and multi-user computers. This facilitates keeping up
with new technology regardless (to a large extent) of the vendor.
(iii)   Adoption of a standard database mar.gement system, which can be used on any
of the machines in the selected hardware platform. This is accompanied by a
fourth generation language (for easy report production by users) and CASE-type
development tools (for fast development of programs). These tools permit quick
and effective maintenance of the application systems, both in error correction as
well as in response to changes in the systems resulting from policy directives.
(iv)   Introduction of telecommunications to enable data transmission between data
banks, queries from users and collation of information at Headquarters for
decision-making.
(v)    Modification of the functions of data processing personnel to eliminate program
development and application system operation. The first is contracted out and
the second is the responsibility of the users. The functions of the data processing
personnel are:
a.    Preparation of specifications for new systems, terms of reference for
consuiting firms, evaluation methodologies for the selection of firms and new
packaged software, and acceptance testing for software and hardware.
b.    Providing support to _sers through training in the use of applications
software and trouble shooting.
c.    Operation of central equipment
d.    Preparation of guidelines for disaster recovery and supervision of their
execution.
e.    Carrying out basic maintenance.
9.10.        Changeover to a system incorporating the above characteristics may initially appear to
be expensive. However, experience indicates that from a medium and long-term perspective the
cost/benefit ratio is very low.
9.11.        The modenization of the IRD's collection machinery will involve introduction of new
collection systems, creation of new databases and installation of appropriate computer and
telecommunication hardware. The system would work on the principle of distributed operation,
centralized informaton.

Annex 9
Page 5 of 7
New Collection Systems
9.12.        One of the options for the new collection systems that need to be established is to adapt
the Argentinean tax collection systems. These systems have been functioning successfully and the
General Tax Directorate (DGI) of Argentina has agreed to grant a license to GOJ to modify and use them
in Jamaica. This option will be evaluated along with other alternatives available and, if it is found to
be suitable, the new collection systems will have the following broad features. The first system will have
two modules:
(i)    The Large Taxpayer Collection Module (LTCM), as its name suggests, would
be used to control payments due from large taxpayers. This system would be
initially installed at the St. Andrew and Kingston Collectorates: it is estimated
that the 1000 largest taxpayers in these two collectorates - -count for upwards of
60% of total collections. The system would, subsequently, be extended to eight
other large collectorates. The LTCM would be an on-line, real-time system
running on a multi-user computer and would be used to maintain the Taxpayer
Master File and process tax returns and payments. It would gather more data
than the other two systems mentioned below to permit a more thorough control
of Large Taxpayers liabilities.
(ii)   The Generalized Taxpayer Collection Module (GTCM) would be a batch system
to control collections from all taxpayers other than the large taxpayers. It would
be installed in the aforesaid ten collectorates along with the LTCM and would
run on the same computer.
The second system, the Remote Taxpayer Collection System (RTCS) would be a data
capture system with two options, one for large taxpayers and another for all other taxpayers. It would
be used in the remaining 17 small collectorates. The data collected by this system would be sent to one
of the larger collectorates of the region for processing. It would run on a large personal computer.
9.13.        In case the Argentinean systems are not found to be suitable to the requirements of
Jamaica, other systems will be developed.
9.14.        The new systems would take 12 to 18 months to develop, fine-tune and install. For this
purpose it would be advisable to engage a software development firn with experience in tax or banking
systems. In the course of designing the system all manual procedures and forms would be reviewed and
modified, as required.
9.15.        Computerization would also be accompanied by thorough training of all personmel
concerned. Data processing staff from the FSL and the IRD would work alongside the software firm to
ensure that the know-how is transferred and that maintenance and user support is handled by in-house
personnel. In addition, staff of each collectorate would be trained in data capture, operation, query and
management. Supervisors would also be trained so that they are able to ensure the efficient use of the
new systems.



- 90 -
Annex 9
Page 6 of 7
Telecommunications
9.16.        The decentralization of information processing will require a telecommunications network
to link the 17 smaller collectorates with the processing collectorates and the processing collectorates with
headquarters. The network would permit queries on a taxpayer by one collectorate from another or by
the Assessment Department, and for electronic mail for transmission of directives and information as well
as messages. Until the network is installed, transfer of information would be done via diskettes.
Adequate linkage between the IRD and the other tax departments would be developed to ensure that
information regarding changes in the liabilities of taxpayers, as a result of assessment or collection, is
constantly exchanged.
Databases
9.17.        The collection system would use four main elements to control collections. First, the
Taxpayer Registration Number would be used to classify all information coming into the system and link
it to specific taxpayers. Second, a Taxpayer Master File would be established and would contain all
essential information relating to taxpayers to be used for pursuing recovery. Third, a Current Account
of each taxpayer would be maintained to give up-to-date information regarding all his liabilities and
payments under various taxes. Fourth, using the information contained in the current account, a Liability
Vector for each taxpayer would be calculated to ascertain his outstanding liability at any given time.
9.18.        A consolidated database would be created using a relational database management system
with a simple query language for easy and fast creation of reports for effective management. It would
gather data periodically from the ten major collectorates, including that relating to the 17 smaller ones.
System Oneration
9.19.        The collection system would work in the following manner:
(i)    All taxpayers would present tax returns and payments in the collectorates
assigned to themn according to their addresses.
(ii)   Large taxpayers would be controlled in 'real time', that is, their record would be
accessed and updated upon presentation of the tax return and payment. Tax
returns will be validated if found in order and rejected if errors are detected.
There would be no delay between presentation of information, its storage in the
database, and its receipt by the respective tax department.
(iii)  Information pertaining to other taxpayers would be input into the system in
batches. Only essential information, such as TRN, tax due, amount paid etc.
would be captured.
(iv)   Each collectorate would maintain a Taxpayer Database containing the four
elements referred to above, in respect of each taxpayer in its jurisdiction. To
create and maintain a good Taxpayer Database it would be necessary that the
responsibility for it be assigned to a single unit or section as its only
responsibility. This unit would complement information received from the



- 91 -
Annex 9
Page 7 of 7
taxpayer with information obtained from other sources to maintain the database
current. The unit would use a standard code for economic activity, and request
it from the taxpayers.
(v)    Aggregate information from  each collectorate would be gathered in a
Consolidated Database at headquarters.  This database would also have
summaries of collection performance by collectorate, economic activity, tax, and
other predefined classifications. This would improve accountability, and enable
analyses to detect bottlenecks and to prioritized enforcement actions.
9.20.        Given the improvements mentioned above, it would be possible to notify large taxpayers
of non-compliance the day after the due date, and other taxpayers within 7 to 10 days. This would make
it possible to initiate recovery actions very quickly. Improved databases and telecommunications will
enable more extensive and fruitful use of available information by different organs of the tax
administration. Decentralized use of computers will lead to a diffusion of computer literacy and skills
through out the organization. Finally, the close monitoring of payments would create a salutary
psychological impact on taxpayers and prompt voluntary compliance.
Short-tenn Action Plan
9.21.        Two activities, dovetailing into the long-term plan, need to be taken up immediately.
While having a significant impact on revenue collections, they would prepare the ground for the more
extensive improvements to come. These activities are: allotment of TRN, and collection of arrears and
creation of a Taxpayers-In-Arrears Master File.
AUotmnent of TRN
9.22.        Since the TRN would be the starting point for building up the collection system, allotment
of the TRN has a. very high priority. Legislation to make taxpayer registration is already under
consideration. As soon as the relevant amendment is passed, work should be begun to convert the BENO
and PINO numbers into the TRN for existing taxpayers and to allot TRNs to new taxpayers.
CoUection of Arrears and Creation of Taxpayers-In-Arrears Master Fie
9.23.        Collection of arrears is an area in which special efforts are likely to yield substantial
results. Starting with the most recent arrears and working backwards, arrears demands should be
identified, consolidated taxpayer-wise, ranked according to amounts due, and segregated as collectible
or non-collectible. This will require some effort on the part of the Income Tax Department, as it is not
computerized; GCT should be able to produce such a ranking very quickly. This process will result in
the creation of Taxpayers-In-Arrears Master File containing complete updated information about the
accounts of defaulters.
9.24.        Concerted efforts would then be made to recover the collectible demands. Delinquents
would be informed of their outstanding arrears and given a reasonable time to pay. After this, coercive
actions, such as attachment of bank accounts, distraint and sale of property and filing of recovery suits
in the courts would be taken. Arrears that are established to be non-collectible would be written off in
accordance with established procedures.

14.2.        Component performance would be measured by the following Indicators:
I.     Broadening of the Tax Base would be measured by the increase in the number of
registered taxpayers. The expected increase is 10% in the first year, and 5% for every
subsequent year of implementation.
II.    Improvement in Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Tax Administration would have
three categories of indicators:
i) Strengthening  of the  Organization  and  Management of   Tax
Admiistion would be measured by:
(a)    the reduction in the administrative cost per J$ of tax collected.
The minimum expected reduction is 5% at the end of the third
year, and 5% for every subsequent year of implementation.

(b)   three surveys indicating increased organizational effectiveness in
critical areas as perceived by staff and management.
(c)   reduction in the processing time for tax receipts. The minimum
expected decrease is of 20% after the third year of
implementation.
(d)    by the expenditure incurred each year on civil works and the
progress made in construction and refurbishing of tax offices.
ii)    The Improvement in the Control of Tax Evasion would be measured
by the increase in revenues collected per audit/investigation; the increase
in the amount of penalties levied; and the number of prosecutions
launched for tax evasion. The expected annual increase is 10% in each
of these areas beginning with the third year.
iii)   The Improvement in Tax Collections would be measured by the
percentage of current taxes due collected and the reduction in the tax
arrears. The minimum expected percentage for current taxes is 80% in
the third year increasing up to 90% at the end of the project. The
expected reduction in tax arrears is 10% in the third year and every
subsequent year of project implementation.
M.   Facilitation of Voluntary CompLiance would be measured by the improvement in the
perception of the fairness, equity and helpfulness of the tax administration amongst taxpayers and
the increase in the revenues through self-assessment. Taxpayer perception would be measured
through surveys. The expected amount of tax collected through self-$sessment is 90% of the total
revenue collected starting with the third year of project implementation.
