                                SCHEDULE 4
                   Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.      Procurement of Goods
Part A:   International Competitive Bidding
1.  Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods shall be procured under
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set
forth in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines).
    (a)   For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in
paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is
delayed beyond the original bid validity period, the successful bidder's bid
price will be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed
correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign
currency components and the other to the local currency component of the bid
price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in bid evaluation.
    (b)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A the
Borrower shall use relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank,
with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be
necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard
bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
standard bidding documents based on other internationally recognized
standard forms agreed with the Bank.
2.  To the extent practicable contracts for:
    (a)   goods other than vehicles shall be grouped into bid packages
estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more; and
    (b)   vehicles shall be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the
equivalent of $250,000 or more.
Part B:   Preference for Domestic Manufacturers and Regional
          Manufacturers
1.  For the purposes of evaluation and comparison of bids for the supply of
goods: (a) bidders shall be required to state in their bid the c.i.f. (port
of entry) price for imported goods, or the ex-factory price for
domestically-manufactured goods; (b) customs duties and other import taxes
on imported goods, and sales and similar taxes on domestically-supplied
goods, shall be excluded; and (c) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight
and other expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of
their use or installation shall be included.
2.  For goods manufactured in Jamaica and in member countries of CARICOM,
the Borrower may grant a margin of preference in accordance with, and
subject to, the following provisions:
    (a)   All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly
indicate any preference which will be granted, the information required to
establish the eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following
methods and stages that will be followed in the evaluation and comparison
of bids.
    (b)   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the
following groups:
          (i)   Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Jamaica, if
                the bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of
Page  13
                the Borrower and the Bank that the manufacturing cost of
                such goods includes a value added in Jamaica equal to at
                least 20% of the Ex-factory bid price of such goods.
         (ii)   Group B: all other bids offering goods from within Jamaica.
        (iii)   Group C: bids offering goods manufactured in a country,
                other than Jamaica, which is a party to CARICOM and
                entitled to preferential tariffs thereunder.
         (iv)   Group D: bids offering any other goods.
    (c)   All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared among
themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import taxes on goods to
be imported and any sales or similar taxes on goods to be supplied
domestically, to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group. The
lowest evaluated bid of each group shall then be compared with each other,
and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A or group B is the
lowest, it shall be selected for the award.
    (d)   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) above, the
lowest bid is a bid from group C or group D, all group C and group D bids
shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A or
group B after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods offered
in each group C and group D bid, for the purposes of this further comparison
only, an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties
and other import taxes which a nonexempt importer would have to pay for the
importation of the goods offered in such group C or group D bid; or (ii) 15%
of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and taxes
exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid or a group C bid is the lowest
in such further comparison, it shall be selected for the award.
    (e)   If, as a result of the further comparison under paragraph (d)
above, a bid from group D is the lowest, all group D bids shall be finally
compared with the lowest bid from group C, as determined under paragraph (c)
above, after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of goods to be imported offered
in each group D bid, for the purposes of this final comparison only, an
amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the difference between the amount of
customs duties and other import taxes which would actually be payable for
the importation of goods offered in such group D bid and for the importation
of goods offered in the group C bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of
goods to be imported offered in such group D bid. If the lowest bid in such
comparison is the group C bid, it shall be selected for purposes of award;
if not, the lowest bid from group D, as determined under paragraph (c)
above, shall be selected for purposes of award.
Part C:   Other Procurement Procedures
1.  Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $25,000 or less per contract,
up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $120,000, may be procured under
contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations obtained
from at least three suppliers eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance
with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
2.  Database management computer software contracts for the TACS, up to an
aggregate amount equivalent to $200,000, may be procured by direct
contracting, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Part D:   Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.  Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
    (a)   With respect to each contract for goods awarded under Part A
hereof the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the
Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out
of the Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that the
two conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank
pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the
making of the first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such
contract.
    (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding
Page  14
paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to
the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made
out of the Special Account, said procedures shall be modified to ensure that
the two conformed copies of the contract together with the other information
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to
paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
2.  The figure of 10% is hereby specified for purposes of paragraph 4 of
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.
Section II.  Employment of Consultants
1.  In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out of the Project, the
Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms
and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such
consultants shall be selected in accordance with principles and procedures
satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines).
For complex, time based-assignments, the Borrower shall employ such
consultants under contracts using the standard form of contract for
consultant's services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall
have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract documents
have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use other standard forms
agreed with the Bank.
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the
provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or
approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of
invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to
contracts estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each. However, this
exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of reference for
such contracts nor to the first three contracts for consultants' services
to be financed with the proceeds of the Loan, to the employment of
individuals, to single source selection of firms, to assignments of a
critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank, and to amendments of
contracts raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above.
                                SCHEDULE 5
                              Special Account

    (a)   the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and (2) set
forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
    (b)   the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of
the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and tobe financed 
out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to
the Eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement; and
    (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to
$400,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
Eligible Expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as
follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account
Page  15
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
    (b)   (i)          For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                       Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                deposits into the Special Account at such       intervals
                as the Bank shall specify.
         (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence
                required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the
                payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank
                shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been
                shown by said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under
the respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was
made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account
in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
Eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for Eligible Expenditures.
6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment
or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account
shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c)
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
