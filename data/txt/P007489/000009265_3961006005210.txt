MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA
FOR A TAX ADMINISTRATION REFORM PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of US$13.20 million to help finance a project for tax
administration reform. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace,
2.           Background. As part of its overall macroeconomic objectives, the Governme.1t of
Jamaica (GOJ) has been pursuing tight fiscal policies supported by an active privatization program.
These policies sharply reduced the overall public sector deficit to 0.4% of GDP in FY91/92. In
FY92/93 the deficit turned into a surplus of 2.2% of GDP, in line with the Government's fiscal
target. Tax revenues amounted to about 26% of GDP and 81% of total central govermnent receipts
in that year. Taxes on income and profit made up 45.2% of total tax revenues, while taxes on
consumption and taxes on international trade had shares of 30% and 24%, respectively.
3.           Large wvage awards granted to selected groups of govermnent employees (mainly
police and teachers) shortly before the general elections in March 1993 created considerable budgetary
pressure. The net cost of these awards was estimated to be equivalent to 5.5% of GDP in FY93/94.
To help keep public finances on track, GOJ adopted a tax package in June 1993, mainly comprising
of increases in the rates and coverage of indirect taxes and fees. Ls estimated yield of 4.6% of GDP
in FY93/94 substantially narrowed, but did not completely cover, the budgetary gap. Total tax
revenues are expected to decrease relative to GDP from FY94/95 due to a phased reduction of import
tariffs under the CARICOM Common External Tariff (CET) and contraction of the tax base
attributable to an anticipated decline in nominal interest rates paid by financial institutions and a
decrease in the growth of wages, which make up an important segment of the tax base.
4.           The anticipated downward trend in revenues combined with an expected increase in
expenditures requires GOJ to mobilize additional resources. However, public reaction to recent tax
measures makes it politically difficult to increase tax rates further. It is, however, possible to
increase revenues by improving the effectiveness of tax administration, which suffers from three
interrelated problems. First, tax collections are made from a narrow tax base. Second, at the
operational level the perfonnance of tax departments, particularly in assessment and collection, is
weak. Third, voluntary compliance is low as taxpayers do not perceive the tax system to be fair and
equitable; the cost of compliance is high; and, due to weak enforcement, the risk of getting caught for
tax evasion is minimal. The combined effect of these factors is that revenue collection is well below
potential. A comprehensive reform of tax administration would significantly improve its revenue-
raising capability and help GOJ to achieve its fiscal objectives.
'.            Tax administration is supervised by the Financial Secretary, who reports to the
Minister of Finance. The line organization is divided into six departments: Inland Revenue; Income
Tax; General Consumption Tax; Stamp Duty and Transfer Tax; Customs; and Land Valuation. Four
other units reporting to the Financial Secretary have functions related to taxes. The Revenue Board, a
statutory body, has a coordination role, besides carrying out some central functions, such as
legislation, prosecution, issuance of tax compliance certificates, training and comprehensive audits.
The Taxation Policy Unit at the Ministry of Finance carries out studies and analyses of tax policies
with some assistance from the Revenue Board. The Revenue Protection Division looks after Customs



2
Duty evasion as well as anti-corruption work relating to the Customs Department. Electronic data
processing is centrally managed by a government-owned public company, Fiscal Services Limited
(FSL).
6.            Lessons from Previous Bank Exnerience. Lessons drawn from Bank experience
indicate that for successful implementation of tax administration reforms strong government
commitment and competent management of the implementation process are imperative. Further, it is
necessary to address the various factors that contribute to administrative ineffectiveness in a
coordinated and systematic manner and not restrict the scope of the reform to mere computerization
of collection systems. Experience has also revealed a number of best practices for tax administration.
These include: (i) institution of a unique taxpayer registration number for effective monitoring of
taxpayer activity and better management of tax returns and collections; (ii) thfe organization of tax
administration based on functions, instead of individual tax laws; (iii) development of a single current
account for each taxpayer; and (iv) strengthening of the legal framework to facilitate enforcement of
tax laws and streamlining of procedures. Finally, it has been established that, since the success of the
reforms depends to a large extent on the quality of human resources in the administration, it is
essential to institute effective compensation systems, career development plans and training programs
that would enable the tax administration to attract and retain qualified individuals and continuously
upgrade their skills. These lessons have been kept in view while designing the project under
consideration. GOJ has indicated its firm commitment to the proposed project. The project has been
developed with the active participation of the concerned administrative officials to ensure support at
the operational level. In formulating the project, an integrated approach, incorporating current best
practices, has been adopted to bring about improvements in all critical areas affecting the performance
of tax administration. To strengthen human resources, itnprovement of the incentive system, career
path and training of tax officials have been made an integral part of the project and GOJ has agreed to
review the salary structure and incentive scheme for the staff of the Revenue Services.
7.            Rationale for Bank Involvement. The development agenda for Jamaica, reflected in
the GOJ's Medium-Term Policy Framework Paper (MTFP) for FY92/93-FY94/95 and in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 25, 1993, recognizes that macro-
economic stability is critical to the attainment of GOJ's goal of rapid and sustained growth. The
proposed project is fully consistent with the CAS. The reform of tax administration will directlv
contribute to macro-economic stability. Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax
departments will enable thlem to combat tax evasion and collect an increasing proportion of taxes due
to government. This will make additional domestic resources available, on a sustainable basis, to
finance budgetary needs and reduce Jamaica's dependence on external debt. Tax Administration
reform will also help in private sector development, which is another strategic goal. hnproved
resource mobilization will enable GOJ to eventually reduce tax rates to spur private investment. In
addition, it will facilitate tax policy reforms to eliminate provisions that create distortions in economic
decision-making. Further, the broadening of the tax base to cover the informal sector and a more
even enforcement of the tax laws will create level playing fields for private enterprises. Finally, by
improving the functioning of one of the important public sector entities, the reform will contribute to
GOJ's public sector modernization objective. The Bank's participation will have a catalytic role in
initiating and supporting the reform which involves wide-ranging organizational changes. Experience
in similar projects in Latin America would enable the Bank to provide the needed technical guidance
and to support the implementation and sustainability of the reform.

8.           Project Objectives. The project aims at raising revenues without increasing tax rates
by: (i) broadening the tax base; (ii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax
administration by (a) strengtheniing the organization and management of tax departments, (b)
improving control of tax evasion and (c) improving tax collections; and (iii) encouraging improved
voluntary compliance.
9.           Project Description. The project would finance consulting services, training and
equipment to: (i) Broaden the Tax Base by increasing the number of registered taxpayers and
reducing the number of deductions, exemptions and concessions granted by the tax laws (US$1.1
million, or 2.6% of total project costs of US$ 42 million); (ii) Strengthen the Organization and
Management of Tax Administration by restructuring the tax departments, introducing modem
management systems and improving training and remuneration structure (US$2.8 million or 6.7% of
total project costs), and by constructing new Revenue Centers and refurbishing existing tax offices
(US$21.7 million or 51.6% of total project costs); (iii) Improve the Control of Tax Evasion by
strengthening the investigation, auditing and assessment capabilities of the tax departments (US$3.8
million or 9. 1 % of total project costs); (iv) Improve Tax Collections by introducing new collection
systems and improving recovery of tax arrears (US$6.5 million or 15.5% of total project costs); and
(v) Facilitate Voluntary Compliance by improving the equity, fairness and efficiency of the tax
system and reducing the cost of compliance (US$1.5 million or 3.4% of total project costs). Project
coordination, including project management and cross-component support for training,
computerization and modifications of the relevant laws, will cost US$1.0 million or 2.5 % of the total
project costs. The project would be implemented over a six year period starting mid-1994.
10.          Project Implementation. A Steering Committee, reporting to the Financial Secretary
and composed of the heads of the tax departments, the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, officials of the
Ministry of Finance and FSL has been created for the implementation of the project. It will be
supported by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) composed of a Project Director, a Deputy Project
Director, consultants, including procurement specialists, and administrative staff. Key project
activities have been defined and an implementation schedule specified to facilitate project
management. Progress will be monitored through specific performance indicators for each
component, which have been defined. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared by the PCU for
review by GOJ and the Bank. Project implementation will be also be supported through two
supervision missions by the Bank every year and joint annual and mid-term reviews. In the first
year, two additional supervision missions will be undertaken to help in the initiation of the project.
11.          Cost and Financine. Total project costs are estimated at US$42.00 million. A Bank
loan of US$13.20 million (31% of total project costs) would cover 95% of foreign exchange costs and
4% of local costs. The Government would provide counterpart funding of US$28.80 million (69% of
total project costs), which would cover 5% of foreign costs and 96% of local costs. Retroactive
financing of an amount not exceeding US$100,000 would be provided to cover expenditures after
December 1, 1993 and up to the date of signing of the Loan Agreement. Provision for price and
physical contingencies amounts to US$ 3.6 million, or 8.6% of total project costs. Significant project
preparation activities have been financed by a PHRD Fund Grant of 51.5 million Yen equivalent to
about US$494,000.
12.          Project Sustainability. The project is designed to deal systematically with the root
causes of tax administration ineffectiveness so as to bring about lasting improvements in its
performance. As already indicated, senior managers of the entities likely to be affected by the reform



4
have been extensively involved in formulation of the project in order to ensure local ownership. The
project places due emphasis on the enhancement of the quality of personnel in tax administration to
make sure that improvements made in systems and technology are translated into permanent gains in
operational efficiency. In order to develop public support, which is crucial to the sustainability of the
project, a National Task Force on Taxation comprising public and private sector leaders has been
formed by GOJ.
13.          Environmental Assessment. This project does not have explicit environmental
components or effects and has, therefore, been classified as Category C.
14.          Project Objective Categories. The primary project objective category is Public Sector
Management (PB).
15.          Poverty Category. The project does not have a direct poverty reduction objective.
16.          Project Benefits. The project will help to bring a large number of unregistered
potential taxpayers in the tax net and, thus, spread the tax burden more evenly. The number of
registered taxpayers is expected to increase by 10% in the first year and by 5% for every subsequent
year of project implementation. Elimination of loopholes in tax laws will reduce distortions in
economic decision making, besides increasing tax collections. The reorganization of tax departments
on functional lines will eliminate duplication of effort, improve information flows and coordination,
foster specialization and reduce administrative costs. A minimum annual reduction of 5% in the
administrative cost per J$ of tax collected and of 20% in processing time for tax receipts is expected
from the third year of project implementation to the end of the project. In addition, a perception of
increased organizational effectiveness in critical areas, amongst the management and staff of the tax
adiinistration, is expected to emerge from three organizational surveys planned during the project.
The construction of new Revenue Centers will extend the reach of the tax authorities and make
compliance more convenient for taxpayers. The refurbishing of existing offices will improve
efficiency by creating a better working environment. Modernization of management systems,
computerization, strengthening of the legal framework, training and improved field operations will
enhance the tax administration's capability to implement the tax laws effectively and check tax
evasion. A 10% annual increase in revenue collected per audit and in the number of penalties! *ied
and prosecutions launched for tax evasion is expected beginning with the third year of project
implementation. Further, 80% of current tax demands are expected to be coliected from the third
year onwards, with the current collection percentage increasing to 90% by the end of the project.
Furthermore, a 10% annual reduction in tax arrears is expected from the third year of the project up
to project completion. Reduction of the cost of compliance, improvement in the fairness and equity
of the tax system and vigorous enforcement will raise the level of voluntary compliance. A more
positive taxpayer perception of the tax administration is expected to be reflected through surveys
planned as a part of the project. Also, it is expected that 90% of total revenue collections will flow
from self-assessment from the third year of project implementation onwards, indicating improved
voluntary compliance. The overall effect of these improvements will be to increase revenue
collections without increasing tax rates. Over the medium term, increased revenues will enable GOJ
to further improve the tax structure and lower the tax rates.
17.          Project Risks. The major risks to successful project implementation relate to scarce
governmental managerial and technical resources, and to the tax departnents' limited capacity to
absorb change. To reduce these risks, external overseas and local consultants will be hired to support



5
local counterparts in implementing various components of the project. Also, a careftlly phased work
plan will ensure that changes are introduced in step with organizational strengthening. Finally, a
training program covering all revenue-related functions will be organized to enhance the ability of
managers and staff to implement and sustain the reforms.
18.          Agreements Reached. At negotiations, it was agreed, inter alia, that: the project
special account will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Bank and the audit statement
would be submitted to the Bank no later than three months after the end of GOJ's fiscal year; and that
the PCU will provide semiannual project implementation reports to the Bank by June 30 and
December 31 of each year, with the latter report also including a draft Annual Work Plan for the
upcoming calendar year for Bank approval; carry out, along with the Bank, an annual review of the
progress made in the imzplementation of the project by January 31 of each year, except 1997; conduct
a mid-term review of the project, along with the Bank, by July 31, 1997; and prepare the Project
Implementation Report. The creation of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), selection of personnel
satisfactory to the Bank and adoption of the PCU Operational Manual is a Condition of effectiveness.
Conditions for disbursement are: for the 'Broaden the Tax Base' component, presentation to
Parliament of the amendment to the Revenue Administration Act to require compulsory registration of
taxpayers, as agreed with the Bank; for the 'Strengthen the Organization and Management of Tax
Administration' component, preparation of a Master Plan for organizational improvements,
satisfactory to the Bank; for the 'Improve the Control of Tax Evasion' component, presentation to
Parliament of amendments to the administrative and procedural provisions of tax laws and other laws
related to tax enforcement, as agreed with the Bank and, in respect of the expenditures proposed to be
incurred on vehicles to be leased to staff and managers of the tax administration involved in field
operations, the adoption of regulations, satisfactory to the Bank, for the leasing program; and for the
'Improve Tax Collections' component, evaluation of the Argentinean tax collection system and other
alternatives and selection, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, of the system to be implemented.
19.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
