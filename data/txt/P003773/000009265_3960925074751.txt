INDONESIA
SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 785-IND & LOAN 2011-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.        This is the first Project Completion Report (PCR) on two small scale
enterprise (SSE) projects (SEDP I - Credit 785-IND; and SEDP II - Loan 2011-
IND) implemented in 1975-84. A third SSE project, SEDP III (Loan 2430-IND),
which is scheduled to close in March 1988, will be reviewed in a separate PCR
during FY89.
2.        The industrial sector in Indonesia is characterized by two main
segments: (a) a few hundred capital intensive large enterprises, mostly
Government owned, producing basic commodities; and (b) millions of labor
intensive small scale enterprises (SSEs) producing traditional goods and
services. In the 1970's, the GOI invested a substantial part of its oil
revenues in the capital-intensive industrial subsectors. Private investors
were also attracted to large scale industry due to government incentives, low
cost credit, and generous protection policies for heavy industries. Although
these projects generally increased manufacturing value added, they did not
raise employment significantly. By the mid-1970s, the GOI began to realize
that SSEs could be much more eWicient at employment generation than a few
large enterprises, and a new GOI strategy was launched to allocate significant
resources to the SSE sector. The principal means by which the GOI supported
SSEs was through the KIK/KMKP program, a credit program operated by Bank
Indonesia.
3.        The main objectives of Credit 785-IND (SEDP I) and Loan 2011-IND
(SEDP II) were to increase the volume and improve the quality of lending under
the KIK/KMKP program through:
(a) strengthening the program's management and supervision at BI's Head
Office and at its  regional branches;
(b)  improving loan administration by the handl.ng Banks through the
provision of training and technical assistance to improve their
systems and procedures; and
(c) supplementing BI's rediscount resources for KIK lending.
4.        The delivery network of the KIK/KMKP program under SEDP I consisted
of approximately 600 bank branches of the five state banks and the regional
development banks located in three provinces. Under SEDP II, the coverage was
extended to 1,100 branches located in 13 provinces. All productive activities
in agriculture, industry, trade, transport and services were eligible for
financing under KIK/KMKP. An eligible enterprise's net worth could not exceed
Rp 20 million for SEDP I and, later, Rp 40 million for SEDP II. Loans were



l I                                               v
authorized for investment purposes (KIK) or for working capital (KMKP) with a
maximum loan size of Rp 15 million. Bank funds in SEDP I and II financed only
investment lending or KIK loans. Under SEDP I, the handling banks contributed
20Z of their own funds for KIK loans and 252 for KMKP with the balance being
provided by BI at 32 interest. Under SEDi II, BI continued to rediscount 802
of KIK and 75% of KMKP at 32 but relent the IBRD loan proceeds to the HBs for
the remaining 202 of KIK at 9.62. The interest rate to the final borrower
under SEDP for KIK was 10.52 (later raised in June 1983 to 122); for KMKP the
rate was always 122.
5.        Insurance coverage on KIK/KMKP loans was provided automatically by
the Government-owned P.T. ASKRINDO for a one-time fee varying between 32 and
52 depending on the loan's maturity. ASKRINW) insurance covered 752 of the
original loan value.
6.        Training and technical assistance provided by the project for SEDP
was accomplished by LPPI, the 'nuonesian Banking Development Institute. Under
SEDP II, when over 5,000 loan officers had to be trained due to the program's
expansion, LPPI passed on some of the training functions to the handling
banks. In order to provide SEDP with project management and technical assist-
ance, two major project entities were established: (a) the Central Project
Management Unit (CPMU), located at the Head Office in Jakarta, responsible for
overall management and monitoring of the program; and (b) the Regional Project
Management Units (RPMUs), located at 13 provincial locations, which provided
on-the-job training to handling bank staff, developed project profiles, and
assisted HBs to improve banking techniques. Each RPMU was typically staffed
with four consu..i::ants.
7.        In 1978-79, under SEDP I, loan portfolio arrears were high, but
manageable, at approximately 202. Loan supervision was marginally adequate
with a loan officer handling an average of approximately 25 loans. Overall
execution of the program needed improvement, but improvement did seem
possible. However, in 1980 when SEDP II was started and the number of RPHUs
was increased from 3 to 13, severe problems were encountered, including: (a)
the staffing of the CPMU Head Office was inadequate effectively to manage and
control the RPMUs; and (b) HBs claimed that the inadequate spread under the
KIK/KMKP program prevented them from increasing staff in direct proportion to
the project's expansion and thus the loans to loan officer ratio increased to
upwards of 70 to one. In reality, the generous ASKRINDO coverage (75% of the
loan) made it too easy for the HBs to cease collection efforts and seek claims
under their insurance. Annual loan disbursements of KIK loans increased from
Rp 20 billion in 1978 to Rp 53 billion in 1979 to an eventual high of Rp 176
billion in 1981. Loan portfolio arrears gradually increased to a very
unsatisfactory 60% level by 1984. By 1984, borrowers obviously viewed
KIK/KMKP as a Government program where repayment (especially during an
economic downturn) was not really required.
8.        Nevertheless, field surveys conducted at the sub-borrower level
indicate that KIK/KKKP funds had a positive economic impact. Under the KIK
(investment loans) program, the surveys indicate that it took an average of Rp
3.2 million (approximately US$3,200 at the average exchange rate in 1983-84)
in investment to produce one full-time job. Applying this job generation



- vi -
ability to the total KIK disbursements during 1978-84 (over Rp 700 billion),
the total number of full-time jobs created due to KIK was somewhere in t.he
vicinity of 300,000 jobs.
9.        Although SEDP I and II at least partly achieved their main
objectives of channelling credit to SSEs, training HB staff, developing
indigenous entrepreneurs, and generating new jobs, they did so at great
expense. In 1978-85, the program's annual interest rate subsidy, HB operating
losses, unrecoverable assistance costs and loan insurance losses averaged 12%
of the outstanding loan portfolio and produced a total loss to the Indonesian
Government of over Rp 800 billion. Under the current constrained budget, the
KIK/KMKP program, which gained the reputation in the late 1970s as a program
to distribute Indonesia's once plentiful oil earnings, is no longer
appropriate. However, the program probably cannot be termirated abruptly due
to its high political profile. Hence, GOI's best strategy seems to be to de-
emphasize and gradually phase out the KIK/KMKP program, substituting other
financially viable programs in its place.
10.       With hindsight, BI should have discouraged the continued expansion
of the KIK/KMKP program without an increase in the HB staff assigned to the
program sufficient to maintain and improve standards of client selection, loan
appraisal, and delinquent loan collection. BI's passive administration
prompts the conclusion that the main objective of the program in the early
1980s may have been to subsidize an important socio-political segment of the
population rather than to promote small scale entrepreneurship and generate
employment on a cost-efficient basis. Seen in this light, the KIK/KMKP
program was not so much a legitimate SSE program but rather a financial sector
vehicle for distributing a subsidy.
11.       The Bank's participation in SEDP I and II contributed less to
improving the cost effectiveness of the KIK/KMP program than should have been
expected. The deficiencies of the program were recognized explicitly by
successive supervision missions, but remedial measures, especially for the
complex technical assistance component, were not pursued with enough
determination and careful supervision.
12.       Among the general lessons from the two projects and the Bank's
involvement in the KIK/KMKP program, the main ones are:
(a)  SEEs offer one of the lowest-cost methods to generate industrial
employment. Impact studies done at the sub-borrower level in SEDP
indicate that it took only Rp 3,200 (approximately US$3,200) in
investment to generate one full-time job;
(b)  Government-sponsored loan programs are very difficult to rehabil-
itate once they gain a reputation for being socially directed or
subsidized; and
(c)  technical assistance programs, even if carried out by competent pro-
fessionals, must receive regular, effective supervision to insure
that the original objectives are achieved. (In the case of SEDP,
the costly and complex RMPU system, staffed with consultants from



- vii -
widely varied backgrounds, could not be adequately supervised by the
Central Project Management Unit's staff due to the distances, poor
communications and lack of qualified supervisory per-onnel. As a
result, there was considerable duplication of effort in the
performance of feasibility studies, and RPMU staff were largely left
to themselves to interpret their work programs).



INDONESIA: SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       T7 RIKIK/RMKP I/ program, consisting of two complementary small scale
enterprise - credit lines, was initiated by Bank Indonesia, Indonesia's
central bank, in December ;973.  The program, which operated through handling
banks (MBs), soon became the main official channel for credit to SSEs in
Indonesia. At about the same time that the KIK/KMKP program was starting
(1974), the Bank was pursuing a potential small scale industry project with
the Ministry of Industry (MOI). However, preparation work accomplished by the
Bank during 1975 and 1976 ultimately resulted in a project concept that
channelled Bank financed credit and technical assistance exclusively through
Bank Indonesia (BI), not through MOI. This report reviews, assesses and
evaluates the accomplishments of the implementing agency (Bank Indonesia) and
the HBs as related to the Small Enterprise Development Project (SEDP) I and
II.
II. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1       Progress of the Economy During 1975-1984.3'  The COI invested a sub-
stantial part of its oil earnings in the mid-1970s in large capital intensive
industries such as cement, steel, fertilizer and petrochemicals. Private
investors were also attracted by Government incentives and the overly protec-
tive policy framework in the heavy industries. As a whole, the Indonesian
economy grew by a substantial average annual rate of 6.4% during the 1970s and
early 1980s. Manufacturing value added during the mid 19705 grew by an annual
average of 8.4%. In 1978, when SEDP was started, the manufacturing sector was
growing at 92 a year. Given Indonesia's large, growing population (140
million in 1978, with an average annual growth rate of 2.6%) and the
underdevelopment of the economy, unemployment was a major structural
problem. However, agriculture grew only 3.2% a year during the mid-1970s. In
the early 1980s, the worldwide economic recession and the global oil glut
helped to cut growth in the economy to an average of only 3X a year. The best
prospects for employment had to be in industry.

2.2       Government Policies Related to SSEs.  Although Indonesia in general
has achieved the production targets and physical objectives set out in the
First (1969-1974) and Second (1974-1979) Five Year Development Plan, it has so
far not been able significantly to improve the employment situation. Starting
with the Second Five Year Plan, the Government gave more emphasis to
employment generation and income distribution by deploying resources for the
development of SSEs. In general, medium and large scale enterprises,
individually or collectively, are better equipped than SSE's to protect,
promote and lobby for their interests in the economy. In terms of influence,
the SSEs (especially those of indigenous Indonesians) are too numerous, too
unorganized, too differentiated, too dispersed, too lacking in technical know-
how and skill, and too far removed from adequate training and financial
facilities. However, by the mid-1970's, the Government began to realize that
the task of providing employment for the growing unskilled labor force would
be better accomplished by the traditional labor-intensive sector rather than
by the much smaller modern sector. It was apparent that more jobs could be
created per unit of investment in the SSE sector. In 1974, the GOI initiated
two major programs to develop the SSE sector: 'a) the KIK/KMKP lending
program channelled through Bank Indonesia; and (b) the BIrIK program, a
Government technical assistance service to SSEs provided by the Ministry of
Industry.
2.3       Characteristics of SSEs.4/  There are approximately 20 million SSEs
in Indonesia employing over 85Z of the labor force. Three quarters of these
enterprises are found in the agricultural sector, where they are typically
small farms responsible for the bulk of staple food production but also
accounting for a significant production of export crops such as: rubber,
coffee, oil palm and pepper. In manufacturing industry, approximately 1.7
million SSEs employ over 80Z of the 4.4 million persons engaged in
manufacturing activities. Manufacturing SSEs' greatest contribution is in
domestic resource-based industries, such as rattan and wood furniture, wood
carving, rice milling, bakery products, bricks and roof tiles. Productivity
per full-time worker in the SSE manufacturing subsector is low, only one-tenth
of that in large and medium industries. In transport, SSEs represent a
significant portion of the subsector with private operators of trucks, buses,
and minibuses, which account for much of the transport of goods and people
between villages and towns and between home and work. In particular, the
rapid expansion of competitive, low-fare, minibus services has increased the
rural population's mobility and increased their access to markets and work
opportunities. Small wholesale and retail traders, which account for 13% of
the work force, generate about 15% of GDP. They act as the essential
intermediaries between producer and consumer; in many cases, financing and
stocking the needed raw materials and finished goods. Finally, the SSEs are
well represented among the other services, which range from professionals such
as accountants and dentists to maintenance services such as repair shops and
laundries.

World Bank estimates (SEDP III SAR). They cover both agricultural and
industrial enterprises.

2.4       Indonesian Financial System.  Until recently the Indonesian finan-
cial system was tightly controlled by the authorities. The Government chan-
nelled its financial resources into the banking system through low interest
liquidity credits (refinancing facilities) by Bank Indonesia. BI in turn set
the deposit and lending rates of the State Banks (which accounted for about
801 of total deposits), established credit ceilings for all banks, and guided
tha allocation of credit through the liquidity credit mechanism (whereby BI
approved refinancing on a case-by-case basia). BI also employed pervasive
administrative controls and moral suasion to influence most aspects of banking
activities and institutions. The state commercial banks in this system became
highly protected to the detriment of the development of the private banks.
Competition in the sector was minimal.
2.5       In June 1983, a reform package was introduced.  State Banks were
allowed to set their own deposit and lending rates, credit ceilings were
eliminated for all banks, and the number of priority programs was reduced.
These measures led to greater competition for deposits and loans and to
substantially higher interest rates. However, the system continues to be
substantially regulated and competition is still inhibited. Priority schemes
such as KIK/KMKP still exist. BI's informal but strong pressure on the banks
to follow its policies is unabated. The State Banks remain protected in a
number of ways. In particular, BI imposes no constraints upon their
capital/asset ratios, but does improve stringent requirements for the prival:e
banks. The State Banks and BAPINDO still have access to BI funds at highly
preferential rates. As well, while the normal market rules for performance
and the costs of failure apply for the private banks, up to now the State
Banks have been largely exempt from these sanctions. Because of these
factors, the June 1983 reform can only be seen as a first step in dismantling
the regulatory structure of the Indonesian financial system.
2.6       The Financial System and Its Relationships to SSEs.  Prior to the
start up of the KIK/TKP program, qualified SSEs as well as medium and large
enterprises were able to draw upon two BI-backed credit programs: the KIB
(general investment loans) and KEB (general working capital loans). SSE par-
ticipation was minimal due to the 25% minimum equity required by the schemes.
Hence the KIB/KEB facilities have benefitted mainly medium and large scale
enterprises in urban areas. The Government introduced the KIK/KMKP program in
December 1973 to finance productive SSE activities; the main objectives were
employment and growth of SSEs, and an important motivating force for the
program was social equity--smaller enterprises also were to benefit from
burgeoning oil revenues. No minimum equity participation was required for
SSEs and simple loan application procedures were introduced. Eligibility
criteria were based on an enterprise's net worth (not to exceed Rp 20 million
under SEDP I or Rp 40 million under SEDP II) to ensure that only SSEs would
participate in the program. The characteristics of major lending schemes in
Indonesia are shown in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 shows deposit and lending
interest rates.



- 4-
III. OBJECTIVES OF THE LOANS
3.1       The World Bank's objectives in the support of SEDP I and II were to
expand and improve the quality of the KIK/KMfY,P program through:
';a) strengthening the program's management and supervision by BI's Head Office
and regional branches; (b) improving loan administration by the handling banks
through the provision of training and technical assistance to improve their
systems and procedures; and (c) supplementing BI's rediscount resources for
KIK lending. In brief, the Bank's involvement was designed to secure the
benefits of the program at lower (and, therefore, acceptable) cost. Given the
policy stance of GOI and the complexities involved, issues relating to
interest rates and the regulatory environment were not tackled under SEDP I
and II, but were left to policy dialogue through economic and sector work and
then were raised in subsequent operations, including SEDP III.
3.2       Program Quality Improvement.  The technical assistance provided
under SEDP was to train bank officials in:
(a)  project appraisal, loan appraisal, determination of loan size, pro-
ject's repayment capacity, monitoring and supervision systems, and
procedures for restructuring unprofitable projects;
(b) identification of potential projects within a certain subsector,
specific criteria of credit-worchiness, eligibility, project promo-
tion and implementation, and procedures to overcome institutional,
environmental and licensing hindrances;
(c) identifying and tapping of existing technical advisory services; and
(d) management training in planning, organizing, staffing, directing,
reporting, budgeting, and interpretation of data and other
information (such as collection rates, arrears rates, and
collectibility).
3.3       Studies.  SEDP I provided specifically for studies of:
(a) HBs' administration and financing costs;
(b) the program's credit insurance system; and
(c) the development of a system for measuring the economic impact of the
program.
A specific objective of SEDP II was to review the functional coordination of
financial and non-financial assistance to SSEs. (The results of these studies
are discussed in Section V below.)
3.4       Increase Lending Volume and Generate Employment.  Under SEDP I and
II, GOI intended to expand the KIK/KMKP program to channel resources to pro-
ductive SSE investment, initially in three provinces (SEDP I) and ultimately
to all 27 of Indonesia's provinces (SEDP II). The credit component of the
World Bank loans was to supplement BI's rediscount resources. The credit



-5-
component of SEDP I was expected to generate a total of 18,000 jobs at
approximately US$4,000 investment per job generated, while SEDP II was
forecast to produce 140,000 new jobs at the same investment cost per job.
3.5       These objectives were achieved under the projects.  However, the
rapid expansion of lending under SEDP II was achieved at the cost of
increasingly inefficient loan appraisal, monitoring and collection, and the
cost of job creation increasingly fell on GOI as low collection rates and very
high insurance claims by the handling banks, led to increasing subsidies to
the program (again see Section V).
IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE KIK/KMKP PROGRAM
4.1       Following its inception in December 1973, the KIK/KMKP program be-
came the main official channel {or institutional term lending to SSEs de-
livered through an extensive banking network. More than 1,100 branches of
both the state-owned and private banks, including regional development banks,
are now involved in administering this program. In spite of its short-
comings--subsidized interest rates, loan recovery problems and high insurance
claims--the program provided needed funds totalling some Rp 2.5 trillion to
more than two million borrowers during the 10 years between 1974 and 1984.
Characteristics of the KTK/KMKP Program
Coverage
4.2       The delivery network of the KIK/KMKP program under SEDP I consisted
of 600 branches of the five state banks and the regional develcpment banks
located in two provinces of Java (East Java, Central Java) and one province of
Sumatra (West Sumatra). Under SEDP II, the coverage was extended to 13 of
Indonesia's 27 provinces.
Loan Features, Rediscounting and Interest Rates
4.3       All productive activities in agriculture, industry, trade, transport
and services were eligible for financing under KIK/KMKP except for some satu-
rated subsectors. The initial subsector targets were: trade 27%, industry
23%, transport 23%, agriculture 23% and others 4%. At end-1985, accumulated
approvals of KIK showed a sector distribution of trade 34%, industry 13%,
transport 23%, agriculture 13% and others 17%, which had some resemblance to
the original distribution. KMKP accumulative approvals are trade 71X,
industry 9%, transport 1%, agriculture 6% and others 13%, indicating that the
vast majority of KMKP (short term) lending went to trade.
4.4       Subloan Terms and Rediscounting.  Originally, the KIK loan maximum
repayment terms was 5 years, including 2 years of grace, but later repayment
was extended to 10 years, including 4 years of grace, to allow for the financ-
ing of longer-term assets. In practice, however, the average actual repayment
period for KIK was only 3 years. KMKP loans under SEDP I and II were for 3
years with payment of interest only until maturity, at which time the borrower
could 'rollover' the loan for another 3 years. Under SEDP I, the handling



banks were required to contribute 20X of their own funds for a KIK loan and
25Z for a KMKP loan.  BI financed the balance--80% in the case of KIK (with
481 from BI's own funds and 32% from IDA funds) and 75% for KMKP -- on a
rediscounting basis at 3% interest. Under SEDP II, BI continued to rediscount
80% of KIK and 75% of KMKP at 3% interest, but relent the IBRD loan proceeds
to the HBs for the remaining 20% of KIK at 9.6%.  Thus under SEDP II, BI refi-
nanced 100% of KIK loans at an average interest rate of 4.32%. The interest
rate to the final borrower under SEDP I for KIK was 10.5% and for KMKP was
12%. Later, (June 1983) the final borrower interest rate was raised to 12%
for both KIK and KMKP.
4.5       Insurance Coverage.  Both KIK and KMKP loans are insured against
risk of repayment default by the state-owned insurance company, P.T.
ASKRINDO.  Insurance coverage was automatic and for a loan of up to five years
maturity the fee was 3% up front, of which the HB paid 1.5% and BI 1.5%.
Loans with a term over five years carried a one-time 5% fee, of which the HB
paid one third and BI the balance. ASKRINDO insurance covered 75% of the
original loan value.
4.6       Training Programs and Facilities.  Under SEDP I, training of HB
staff and officers (500 loan officers, 200 credit department heads and
200 branch managers) was delegated to LPPI (the Indonesian Banking Development
Institute) which offered a wide range of courses. Under SEDP II, when the
need for qualified training reached 5,000 loan officers due to the rapid ex-
pansion of the program, LPPI passed on some of its training functions to HBs
that had in-house training capability. LPPI also initiated a six-week class-
room training program to counterpart candidates and a nine-month corres-
pondence course for loan officers.
4.7       Organizational Set-Up.  With the inception of SEDP, BI developed two
major organizational units to facilitate the achievement of the program's
objectives:
(a)  The CPMU or the Central Project Management Unit was located at the
BI Head Office. Under SEDP I, the CPMU's main responsibilities were
to administer and monitor the KIK loans and the technical assistance
extended in the three provinces with SEDP coverage. Under SEDP II,
the CPMU responsibilities were expanded to cover the nationwide KIK
lending scheme and the 13 Regional Project Management Units (RPMUs).
(b) The RPMUs, which were originally called PPMUs (provincial project
management units) under SEDP I, had the following functions:
(i) providing on-the-job training to HB staff (counterparts);
(ii) developing and assessing potential project profiles for the
handling banks; and
(iii)  promoting the adoption by the HBs  4 appropriate banking
techniques for the KIK/KMKP progras.



4.8       Technical Assistance Arrangements.  Recognizing the constraints on
the SSE sector and the need to strengthen agricultural and industrial ex-
tension services, an elaborate system (the RPMU system) was developed by BI to
supplement and coordinate technical assistance to SSEs and to the HBs. BI
obtained cooperation from foreign governments for the provision of nonfinan-
cial assistance. Beside the Bsnk-funded TA, expertise was obtained from donor
countries/agencies, including West Germany (GTZ), Australia (AIDAB), the
Netherlands and the EEC. Each RPMU was typically staffed by a four person
consultant team consisting of a Development Banker/Financial Analyst, a
Development Economist, a Small Busineas/Marketing Specialist and an
Agricultural Specialist. Each team had at least one or two expatriate
consultants. The number of RPMUs was gradually increased from three in SEDP I
to 13 by the end of SEDP II.
V. EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT
5.1       Organization and Management.  The KIK/KMKP program was administered
by BI and implemented by the HBs. BIs administration was at two levels: at
the central level, the Credit department was responsible for overall admini-
stration and monitoring; and at the provincial or regional level, BI branches
performed minor administrative functions. In the beginning of SEDP (1978),
central management (CPMU) was able adequately to supervise the project compo-
nents, which comprised only LPPI and three provincial level branches in
Central Java, West Sumatra and East Java. In 1980, when SEDP II began, the
number of RPMUs rose gradually to 13 and severe management problems were
experienced, including:
(a) misinterpretation of the RPMU consultants' TORs;
(b) deviations from the original objectives of SEDP by the RPMUs and
HBs;
(c) the lack of timely decision-making at the CPMU level in response to
HB and RPMU problems; and
(d)  loss of quality control in RPMU consultant selection.
The Bank supervision missions of May and AuZgust 1981 pointed to the need for a
separate small credit department within BI to coordinate policies and consoli-
date the KIK/KMKP program and, by late 1981, the KIK/KMKP unit was installed
as a division of BI's Cooperative and Small Credit Department (CSCD).
Supervision and adm.nistration of the project components by BI at the central
level consisted of:
(a) issuance of BI circulars to the HBs and operational guidelines to
the RPMUs;
(b) review and approval of RPMU annual work plans; and
(c) supervision visits, at least once per year to each RPMU.



-8 -
Project administration and supervision has been unsuccessful principally
because BI lacked sufficient qualified staff to fulfill the above functions.
Staff assigned to supervision was inadequately trained and insufficient
resources (budget) have been provided.
5.2       At the UB level, during SEDP I only BRI had a separate KIK/KMKP
section. Gradually, however, during SEDP II every state bank and the RDBs
established a separate KIK/KMKP section at their branches. However, the HBs
did not generally assign adequate manpower to KIK/KMKP as the program
expanded. BI studies indicate that the ratio of loans per loan officer
increased from approximately 25 to one under SEDP I to upwards of 70 to one
under SEDP II, resulting in a predictable deterioration in portfolio quality
(para. 5.4). BRI, with the highest arrears of any HB, provided the extreme
example, with a ratio of 150 to one under SEDP I increasing to 275 to one
under SEDP II. The HBs claim that inadequate spreads precluded them from
increasing staff in direct relation to the program's expansion. An inevitable
conclusion is that the program grew too rapidly, with inadequate attention to
the staffing requirements for implementat.on, administration and supervision.
5.3       Management Information System.  The management information system
that has developed over the years is still inadequate. The large number of
loan applications, rejections and approvals, and the problems of moving and
processing data by differing means (manual, semi-mechanical and electronic) by
over 1,200 branches of the HBs have resulted in a system that, at best, gives
only general indications of the status of the program. In particular, data on
rescheduling, write offs, and cancellations are missing in many years, and
large unsupported adjustments are needed to arrive at the difference between
monthly opening and closing portfolio balances. Arrears and collection ratios
are similarly plagued with inconsistent data. Efforts are continuing by BI to
improve the system by installing automated, on-line processing both at the
branch and head office level of the HBs. In recent years (1984 and 1985)
portfolio data accuracy has improved and fewer adjusting entries are needed to
reconcile balances. Under section 2.06 and 2.07 of the Project Agreement for
SEDP II, BI was to develop an improved system for monitoring KIK/KMKP lending
operations as well as a medium-term planning system for the program, and,
although the MIS is still inaccurate and untimely, it does represent a marked
improvement over SEDP I.
5.4       Portfolio Performance.  Annual disbursements of KIK loans increased
at a rapid rate (see Table 4) from Rp 20.3 billion during 1978 to Rp 53.1
billion in 1979 and to Rp 176.4 billion in 1981 due to the expansion of the
program from the original three provinces to 13 provinces under SEDP II.
Annual disbursements after the expansion in 1978-81 experienced a decline in
1982 to Rp 115.0 and subsequently leveled off at approximately Rp 73 billion
during 1983 to 1985. Repayments also increased rapidly during 1978 - 1981,
peaking at Rp 100.8 billion by 1983 and then declining to Rp 79.6 billion in
1985. By December 1985, total cumulative KIK approvals (from 1974) totalled
Rp 1,032 billion and consisted of 265,000 loans. In contrast, KMKP cumulative
approvals at the same time totalled Rp 2,763 billion and consisted of over 2.0
million loans. The combined KIK/KMKP outstanding portfolio balance as of
December 31, 1985 (Rp 1,214 billion) represented 6% of the total institutional
credit in Indonesia.



5.5       Over the years, KIK approvals (Table 5) have shown a definite trend
toward the trade sector (average of 42% of total for 1982-85 versus only 28%
for 1974-79) with the shares of agriculture and transport sectors declining.
One reason for the relative increase in trade approvals was that HBs found the
justification for lending in trade easier to document compared with other
sectors, especially agriculture, which required close analysis of cropping
patterns, etc.
5.6       The poor repayment record and resultant high arrears have been among
the program's most persistent problems. As seen in Table 4, the arrears per-
centage at the start of the program (1978) was in the vicinity of 20Z; in
1984-85, it had risen to a very unsatisfactory 60%. Among the reasons given
for the poor repayment record are:
(a) KIK/KMKP had acquired the image of a Government program where
repayment was not really required.
(b) the spread to the HBs was insufficient to permit close loan
supervision and collection efforts;
(c) the generous ASKRINDO coverage (75-80% of a loan) made it too easy
for the HBs to cease collection efforts and seek claims under their
insurance; and
(d) the central supervision of the program (including supervision of the
SEDP projects by the Bank) was inadequatr, meaning that remedial
measures were not introduced in time and, when they were, they were
enforced ineffectively.
5.7       In fact, Bank supervision missions were well aware of the worsening
loan portfolio and stressed the need to strengthen HB collection efforts. But
the studies the Bank asked BI to conduct on the adequacy of the program
interest rates generally under-emphasised losses resulting from the
uncollectible portion of the loans and unpaid interest. As seen in Table 6,
if 30% of all loans were uncollectible (which is not unrealistic when over 50X
of the portfolio is in arrears), the HBs would have to set up a bad debts'
provision equal to 2.5% of the outstanding portfolio, assuming that 75% of a
loan is recoverable through ASKRINDO. Unpaid and uncollected interest is not
insured by ASKRINDO; assuming that only 10% of all interest is never
collected, the HB would show an additional 1.2% loss.
5.8       ASKRINDO Cost.  P.T. ASKRINDO, the   ate-owned insurance company,
which insured 75% of each loan (some early tiK loans were 80% insured) under
the KIK/KHKP program, has sustained significant operating losses as a result
of the program as seen in Table 7. In the first five ye4ars of SEDP,
ASKRINDO's premiums more than covered claims but, star Ang in 1983, claims
more than surpassed premiums received. In 1983-1985, ASKRINDO sustained more
than Rp 118.4 billion in cash losses from the KIK/KMKP program. The claims
paid in 1985 for KIK/KMKP were equal to 8.4% of the outstanding loan portfolio
for the program. Major modifications required to make the insurance scheme
for KIK/KMKP self-financing, include: (a) HBs must carry more of the risk;
and (b) premium rates must be set more realistically.  Under KIK/KMKP, the



- 10 -
premium on a loan with up to five years maturity is only 3Z, paid at the time
the loan is taken out. Loans that mature in five years or more pay a ogle-time
5X premium. BI agreed under SEDP II to submit a review of ASKRINDO's opera-
tions, financial structure, etc. to the Bank for comment, but this review has
not yet been received.
5.9       Technical Assistar-ze and Training.  One of the program's most ambi-
tious undertakings was the provision of technical assistance and training.
The CPMU and the RPMU system along with LPPI received in 1978-85 a total of
376 man years (Tables 8 and 9) of consultant assistance costing approximately
US$22 million (DFC Study, para 5.21). More than half of the consultant ser-
vices for TA and training was funded by IBaD financing under SEDP I. The
balance was financed mostly from bilateral sources.
5.10      Within this elaborate and costly mechanism of rendering TA and
training there were many individual interpretations of how the ultimate
objective of the project i.e. the efficient delivery of credit to SSEs, was to
be achieved. Under those circumstances, the TA and training sufiered greatly
from the lack of adequate centralized management and control. While the
RPMU's main activities centered around the training of BH counterpart
personnel and the production of SPID (Special Project Identification) reports,
each unit was left relatively free to carry out these tasks.
5.11      The major accomplishment of the RPMUs was the training of 819
counterpart staff from the HBs (Table 10). Each counterpart assigned to the
RPMU received one year of training in project appraisal, loan evaluation, and
supervision techniques. Many of the graduates of the counterpart course have
gone on to become branch managers and deputy branch managers in their HBs.
This argues that the training has achieved some success. Based on 10 years of
operating the course and surveys of counterpart graduates (two main modifica-
tions have been suggested:
(a) the present one-year course is too long, it could be shortened to
six months; and
(b) the course emphasis should change from project appraisal and
evaluation to detecting, analyzing and solving problems at the HB
and enterprise level.
In all, the SEDP II goal of training approximately 5,000 HB staff engaged in
KIK/KMKP lending has been more than exceeded with approximately 4,000
attendees at CPMU-LPPI-RPMU sponsored courses and over 1,000 attendees at in-
hous_. classes conducted by BRI.
5.12      The other major activity for the RPMUs produced 1,338 SPID reports
(Table 11), concentrated mainly in agriculture and industry. The SPID report
is basically a feasibility report of a specific economic activity: for
example, the manufacture of roof tiles on a small scale basis. However, many
of the SPID reports re-evaluated the same economic activity that had been the
subject of previous SPIDs in other RPMUs. The extensive re-evaluation of the
same economic activity prompts several observations:



- 11 -
(a) the generation of the SPID report was mainly a training exercise for
counterparts;
(b) each RPMU operated in a closed environment and did not know what the
other RPMUs were doing and/or did not trust the other RPMU's work;
and
(c) market and cost factors were so variable from one RPMU area tu
another that completely new feasibility reports frequently were
justified.
5.13      Somewhat surprisingly, almost 60% of the projects identified in SPID
reports (Table 12) were implemented by SSEs, indicating that the reports did
meet a real need.  In addition, SPID-based loans in 1985 made up approximately
10% of the KIK/KMKP loan portfolio in the regions that the 13 RPMUs handled.
Another activity for the RPMU staff consultants was assisting existing HB
borrowers with their operating problcms. As seen in Table 13, the time
devoted in 1984-85 to this 'rescue' activity was highly variable, ranging from
a low of 10% of total time to a high of 55% (average 26%). Considering the
deteriorating quality of the portfolios of the HBs, more time should have been
spent by the RPMUs in assisting the existing borrowers and less time should
have been spent on SPIDs and Pilot Projects (implementation of SPIDs).
5.14      Economic Impact.  Three economic impact studies were attempted
during SEDP I and II. The first study was conducted in 1979 in the three SEDP
regions at that time: Central Java, West Sumatra and East Java. Each region
was studied separately by a local university. The findings could not be inte-
grated to provide comparable data and the overall effort was unsuccessful.
During SEDP II in 1983, another study was commissioned by BI to the University
of Indonesia under the supervision of the CPMU's Economic Advisor. This study
used a 'with credit' and 'without credit' approach which called for the match-
ing up of control groups with experimental ('with credit') groups. In
retrospect, the required field work was too complicated (29 variables),
utilized an extremely long questionnaire (required 4 hours to complete), and
was accomplished by inexperienced students under minimum supervision. The
results of the second study, which took almost three years to process and
analyza, were at best inconclusive, although it did establish that, under KIK
credit, investment created full-time jobs cost-effectively (paras. 5.16).
5.15      The two earlier studies taught the CPMU some valuable lessons that
lid to a simplification of the procedures for preparing an impact study. With
the assistance of Bank supervision missions, the CPMU in 1986 undertook
another impact study based on a "before and after" evaluation of credit. The
"before" situation is that of an SSE before receiving a loan (either KIK only
or KIK plus KMKP) measured in terms of its assets, labor employed, production
and generation of value added. The 'after' situation is the condition of the
same SSE after two years of utilizing the loan, measured by the same variables
as in the 'before' situation. The field survey covered all 13 SEDP regions
and was conducted by RPMU staff and HB counterparts.
5.16      The results of the third  study indicate that the KIK/KMKP program
as a whole had a positive impact, especially the impact on employment genera-



- 12 -
tion. Under the KIK program it took an average of Rp 3.2 million (US$3,200)
in investment to produce one full time job. Individual sectors are detailed
below:
Investment required to
Sector                        generate one full time job
(Rp million)
Agriculture                                      2.0
Manufacturing                                    1.9
Trade                                            4.6
Transport                                        3.9
Others/service                                   3.5
Average                                        3.2
The overall credit to investment ratio was 0.68 indicating that it took only
Rp 2.4 million of KIK credit to create one full time job. Applying this rough
indicator of the credit's job generation ability to the total KIK disburse-
ments during 1978-84 (over Rp 700 billion), about 300,000 full-time jobs were
created due to KIK.  Output from the jobs generated was low, only Rp 5 million
per full-time job per year. KIK credit was fairly efficient in generating
value added, on average Rp 1,000 generated Rp 2,000 of annual value added.
5.17      Other interesting information concerned:
(a) Borrowers' characteristics: 51% at least had reached high school;
21X had some university training; 23% were women.
(b) Reasons for late payment: 75Z had liquidity problems; 13% had never
received a request for repayment from the HB; 10% had other needs
for the cash; and 2% had unknown reasons.
5.18      SSE Support Services.  Under SEDP II, a total of US$6.0 million
(Part B) of the loan was allocated to MOI to finance: (a) the purchase of
equipment needed for training, demonstration and testing purposes; and (b) a
consultant to the MOI to plan and implement Common Service Centers for SSEs.
The consultant was hired as planned and a total of US$2.0 million in woodwork-
ing and metalworking equipment was acquired for MOI. At loan closing on
December 31, 1985, the Bank had to cancel US$4.0 million of Part B due to
MOI's inability to utilize its portion of the loan. In discussions with
officials of the Directorate General of Small Industries of MOI, they foresaw
no apparent use for the balance of the allocated funds. The appraisal assumed
that rattan processing equipment would make up a sizeable portion of the
demonstration equipment but, on further analysis, MOI found the equipment
unsuitable for Indonesian conditions.

5.19      Project Cost.  During SEDP I and II, various estimates were made
regarding the unrecovered cost of various components in the KIK/KMKP program.
The most recent and most comprehensive estimate was done in early 1987 by
Development Finance Consultants (DFC) in their "Study on Future Role of
RPMUs". Utilizing their data for the interest rate subsidy (difference
between Certificate of Deposit rates and rate charged by BI for liquidity
credit) and their estimate of technical assistance and training costs, the
unrecoverable costs of the KIK/KMKP program exceeded Rp 800 billion during
1978-85 as seen below:

Total Unrecovered KIK/KMKP Costs               839           12.1
5.20      Most of the unrecoverable costs (i.e. interest rate subsidy) of the
program could have been avoided by raising the BI onlending rates to mg7ket
levels. As is being well demonstrated in the ongoing KUPEDES program,t
sometimes the availability of credit rather than its costs determines the
demand. Regarding borrower costs, it is alleged that under KIK/KMKP, the cost
of credit exceeded the minimal interest charge as, in many cases, informal
payments to lower level HB employees were customary to expedite loan
processing. There are no data that substantiate these allegations and hence
no estimates of the overall cost of the alleged payments.
5.21      Auditing.  Under SEDP I, BI and HBs were to send copies of audited
statements to the Bank within nine months of the closing of their fiscal
years. Under SEDP II, in addition to the SEDP I requirement, BI was to
include a quarterly unaudited account of KIK liquidity credits. BI complied
with both requirements, but the audited reports were generally received by the
Bank at least one year after the close of BI's fiscal year. Handling banks
did not generally comply with the submission of their statements. The quar-
terly unaudited reports on KIK disbursements and outstanding loan balances
furnished to the Bank by BI could not be reconciled with BI or HB audited

and the mobilization of local savings.



- 14-
statements, which gave only overall data with usually no detail on KIK/KRKP.
Despite frequent Bank requests to BI for a separate audited accounting of the
KIK/KMKP program, none was ever received.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.1       Although SEDP I and II probably achieved their objectives of chan-
nelling credit to SSEs, the training of HB staff, and the generation of new
jobs, they did so at great expense and inefficiency. Despite its laudable
objectives, the KIK/KMKP program was flawed in design, and its rapid expansion
exposed serious administrative and supervisory weaknesses that the Bank's
participation failed to resolve (see para. 6.3). As a result, the costs of
the program were excessive and the results from technical assistance
disappointing.
6.2       High costs resulted from:
(a)  sub-borrowsr's perceptions that as the objectives of the KIK/KMKP
program were to foster income distribution there was no strong
obligation to repay;
(b)  the HBs took inadequate measures to achieve satisfactory collection
rates and contain arrears (a main contributing factor was the
excessively generous insurance provisions through ASKRINDO, which
discouraged efforts to recover loans and weakened incentives for
rigorous appraisal of project proposals in the face of pressures to
expand the program); and
(c) the interest rates charged to borrowers were too low compared to
market rates.
As well, the HBs felt that the spreads they received from executing the
program were inadequate to justify expending adequate resources to administer
it effectively.
b3       With hindsight, the technical assistance components of the project
appear overambitious; they were unrealistically designed and proved
unmanageable in practice with the resources that participating agencies could
assign. The program was inadequately supervised by BI, mainly because the
supervisory staff was ill-trained and undermanned; resource constraints
prevented adequate levels of staffing. Evidence suggestes that the Bank also
did not supervise the project adequately and was not firm enough in requiring
essential changes in the administration of the projects as the need for them
emerged. Too much reliance seems to have been placed on correcting
shortcomings through new projects (this was a major objective of SEDP III);
the pressu:e to expand the program rapidly meant that mid-stream corrections
were exceedingly difficult to implement.
6.4       The high costs of KIK/KMKP (subsidized intetast rates, inadequate HB
spreads, overly-generous ASKRINDO coverage, and high arrears are now fully
recognized by GOI, but the high political profile of the KIK/KNIP program



- 15 -
H         means that it cannot be terminated abaruptly.  The best strategy for GOI
appears to be a de-emphasis and gradual phasing out of the KIK/KMKP program,
substituting other, financially viable programs where required. The Bank
might play an effective role in helping to develop viable programs, but
KIK/IKMP offers no prospects for further effective participation by the Bank.
6.5       Some more specific lessons that emerge from the Bank's involvement
in the KIK/KMKP program are:
(a)  SSEs appear to be one of the lowest cost methods of generating
employment. Impact studies done at the borrower level in SEDP
indicate that it took only Rp 3,200 in investment to generate one
full-time job.
(b) Government-sponsored loan programs are very difficult to
rehabilitate once they gain reputations that imply that loan
repayment is not fundamental or of primary importance.
(c) To be effective and credible, economic impact studies shouid: (i) be
based on simple, easily determined concepts; (ii) utilize short
(four page maximum) questionnaires; and (iii) be administered by
closely supervised, trained field staff.
(d) Technical assistance, even if well-designed and implemented by
competent professionalq, must receive regular supervision to insure
that the original objectives, scope of work, and quality are
maintained. Distance from the central management unit, poor
communications, and lack of qualified supervisory personnel all
create severe supervisory problems and frequently result in wasteful
duplication of activities (e.g. feasibility studies) at the
decentralized level.

Bank Ioe.a. Comment. on IBRD's Prolect Report.-
SmAll Ent rrige DegveloRment ProAent T And IT (SEDP)
The present paper summarizes the comments of Bank Indonesia (BI)
on IBRD's ProJect Completion Report (PCR) for the Small Enter-
prise Development ProJect I and II from February 8, 1988. BI's
response has been delayed because an authorized copy of the PCR
was received only recently. As meanwhile visits of World Bank
staff familiar with the PCR have provided opportunities for
discussing BI's main comments, this paper can be relatively brief
1). In order not to burden the text with much factual detail,
notes and references are attached to the paper.
1. The PCR: a few general comments
BI appreciates IBRD's efforts to review ex post the design,
implementation and principal outcomes of the two SEDPs in form of
a PCR. The preparation of a PCR (and other forms of project
evaluation as well) requires the selection of information from
availaole sources and the interpretation of that information.
Since not all organizations which were involved in a project are
equally accessible to the analyst, information from some organi-
zations tends to be better represented in the PCR than that from
others. In the process of screening available data and other
information, choices must be made which information from which
accessible source is of relevance to the purposes of a specific
PCR. Although professionally conducted project evaluations strive
for obJectivity, generally it is unavoidable that a considerable
degree of personal judgement enters the selection process.
Besides, selected data and other information often can be
interpreted in more than one way 2).
As a consequence, different organizations involved in the same
proJect may come to different conclusions as to the performance
of that proJect, specifically in their judgement of real or per-
ceived deficiencies in proJect design  and implementation, and in
assigning responsibility for the occurrence of flaws in project
performance. BI's comments attempt, on the basis of the PCR, to
identify concurrence and divergence between the views of BI and
IBRD with respect to the performance of the former SEDP. BI hopes
that these comments will contribute to the ongoing learning pro-
cess in both organizations, in particular as regards the conclu-
sions drawn from experience with institutional lending to enter-
prises of small and medium scale.

2. The PCR for SEDP III: two propositions
BI understands that the World Bank Generally engages outside con-
sultants for the preparation of PCRe and that these consultants
are provided with reports, data and other information available
at the offices of IBRD in Washington. As the consul-tants usually
are not given the opportunity to discuss findings with the orga-
nization(s) responsible for the respective proJects in overseas
countries, the flow of information available to the consultants
is likely to be incomplete. This does not necessarily have to be
much of a problem, if IBRD itself undertakes to amend the consul-
tant's PCR by incorporating the comments from local organizations
involved in the project, before the draft PCR is distributed.
Since PCRs are not only analytical - technical exercises but also
politically relevant project documents, local organizations ought
to be given a chance for commenting prior to IBRD's distribution
of draft PCRs amongst multilateral and bilateral development
agencies.
In view of possible negative consequences resulting from an
untimely distribution, BI suggests that the forthcoming draft of
the PCR for SEDP III be made available to BI for comments before
it is distributed by IBRD to other foreign development agencies.
Given sufficient time for the study of the draft, BI would
respond by providing its own information and review of SEDP III
in writing and/or discuss itsviews with IBRD's Resident Mission
and, when time schedules permit, with visiting World Bank staff
familiar with the draft's content.
There is another reason for BI's interest in providing its own
review of SEDF III to the draft. The PCR could include comments
on the transition from the former SEDP to the NSEDP against the
background of recent and possibly forthcoming reform measures in
the financial sector, and the prospective effects of these poli-
cies on institutional lending to small and medium enterprises.
The last section of the present paper deals with that aspect in
some more detail.
3. The rapid expansion of the KIK/KMKP program until the early
1980s
With  respect  to  the former  rapid  expansion  of the  KIK/KMKP
program, the PCR observes:
"Under the current constrained budget, the KIK/KMKP
program, which gained the reputation in the late
19705 as a program to distribute Indonesia's once
plentiful oil earnings, is no longer appropriate.
However, the program probably cannot be terminated
abruptly due to its high political profile"
(PCR, p. iii).

Annex
Page 4 of 20
BI comments as follows:
- The KIK/KMKP program was introduced by the Government (in early
1974) with the stated intention of providing small businesses
from all economic sectors with access to institutional credit;
prior to the introduction of the pro,fram, the flow of institu-
tional credit to the small business sector was negligible (see
also PCR, p. 3). The availability of credit was considered to
be a necessary condition for a rapid development of the small
business sector which, because of its labor intensive techno-
logy, apparently could provide more employment per unit of
investment for the growing labor force than the modern, capital
intensive sectors of the economy.
- As the level of oil revenues increased in the course of the
second half of the 1970s, the Government decided for reasons of
employment creation and on equity grounds to allocate part of
the oil earnings to economically less favored segments of the
population, among them the pro-prietors of small and very small
firms.  The KIK/KMKP program  as well as  other public programs
were assigned the task to assist the Government in this trans-
fer of resources. During the ensuing socio-economic process
financial institutions felt under pressure to generate an
increasing flow of credit to the KIK/KMKP clientele with the
consequence that appraisal and supervision procedures were less
strictly applied than before.
- At that time, the Government's policy coincided with (and
probably was influenced by) several international developments,
among these the announcement of the President of the World Bank
that in future at least 7 per cent of the Bank's volume of
loans would be allocated to proJects aimed at the development
of the small business sector 3).
The announcement was followed by several events occurring bet-
ween the middle of the 1970s and the early 1980s:
- the volume of World Bank lending and technical assistance to
ongoing and newly created small business projects increased
rapidly in a number of developing countries;
- most of IBRD's support of small business development took
place in the form of special credit schemes for small firms
which were intermediated by the respective local financial
system;
- other multilateral development agencies and many bilateral
agencies, convinced of the potential of small enterprises for
employment creation and development, followed the World
Bank's example and enhanced their support of small business
proJects;



- 41 -
Annex
Page 5 of 20
- World Bank staff as well as the staff from other development
agencies  apparently  were   requested  by  their  respective
organizations to extend  in their search for  viable projects
particular  attention  to  new  schemes  for  small  business
development and, where feasible, to propose increased funding
to ongoing projects of this kind (not unlike the pressures
felt by Indonesian financial institutions to increase lending
to small business at that time);
- The SEDP became part of this mainstream development in
international assistance policy. Evidently, there were no
serious constraints in obtaining funds for the project from
the development community, in both forms, long-term credit
and technical assistance. BI is of the opinion that in
discussing and negotiating foreign assistance for the SEDP it
exercised reserve rather than unrestrained acceptance of
development aid. In preparing the subsequent stages of the
SEDP, for example, BI supported by MOF and BAPPENAS, did not
accept the World Bank's original offers of IBRD loans, but
only agreed on the lower loan amounts as eventually agreed
upon in the respective loan and proJect documents.
4. The design of the KIK/KMKP program
The remarks of the preceding section are not meant to shift
responsibility for the desig;i and implementation of the KIK/KMKP
program from BI to foreign agencies which participated in the
SEDP; in the last instance that responsibility is clearly BI's.
The  remarks  were  primarily  made   to  underline  the  general
concurrence  which   existed  at   that  time   between  BI   and
participating  agencies   with  respect   to  policies   for  the
development of the small business sector. This understanding
included the view that as long as government-regulated interest
rates prevailed, subsidization of financial intermediaries would
be necessary, if the flow of  institutional credit to that sector
were to be commensurate with the sector's potential for economic
development. Until the late 1970s and even the early 19808
criticism of development agencies as to the regulated interest
rate   system  in  Indonesia  (and  other  developing  countries)
remained muted and, when voiced, were not directly aimed at the
interest parameters of the KIK/KMKP program which was qenerallv
considered  to  be   a  reasonably  effective  program  for the
channelling of  credit to  emall firms 4).  The costs  associated
with the program were not a pressing concern, the more 8o as
related benefits appeared to be high. This may also explain that
not until much later serious attempts were made to estimate the
cumulative size of the interest rate subsidy involved in the
program (see section 7).



- 42 -
Page 6 of 20
In view of the fact that the vast majority of developing
countries  maintained   regulated  interest   rate  systems   and
subsidized special credit schemes for small enterprises, such
criticism hardly could have been politically convincing and thus
not likely effective in changing the terms and conditions of the
KIK/KMKP program. As recognised by the PCR. there was a definite
political  commitment  to   the  contirnuation  of  the   program,
essentially on the basis of its original design. The PCR notes
"Given the policy stance of GOI and the complexi-
ties involved, issues relating to interest rates
and the regulatory system were not tackled under
SEDP I and II, but were left to policy dialogue
through economic sector work and they were raised
in subsequent operations, including SEDP III"
(PCR, p. 4)
We belie-. this statement of the PCR is not likely to convince
anyone who is familiar with SEDP I and II, including the members
of the various IBRD appraisal and supervision missions who dealt
with the program. The simple truth is that not only GOI but also
the development agencies participating in the SEDP, including the
World Bank, did not seriously question the widely accepted
rationale for the promotion of small business development through
subsidized special credit schemes.
The following observations of the PCR seem also to be in need of
qualification:
"(d)espite its laudable objectives, the KIK/KMKP
program was flawed in design, and its rapid ex-
pansion exposed serious administrative and super-
vision weaknesses, that the Bank's parti-cipation
failed to resolve. As a result, the costs of the
program were excessive
(PCR. P. 14);
and
"The Bank's participation in SEDP I and II con-
tributed less to improving cost effectiveness of
the  KIK/KMKP   program  than  should   have  been
expected. The deficiencies of the program were
recognized explicitly by successive supervision
missions, but remedial measures, especially for
the complex technical assistance component, were
not pursued with enough determination and careful
supervision."
(PCR, p. ...).
The obvious question to be raised in this context is, exactly
which "remedial measures" with respect to the KIK/KMKP program



- 43 -
Annex
Page 7 of 20
the PCR expects to have been taken by successive IBRD supervision
missions in face of the concurrence between GOI and the World
Bank (and other participating foreign agencies) "not to tackle"
under S8DP I and II issues "relating to interest rates and the
regulatory environment". In BI's opirion there was little chance
to change the terms and conditions of the KIK/KMKP program as
long as that concurrence existed, the more so as the World Bank
continued to offer increases  in its loan funding to  the program
(see section 3).
BI  accepts responsibility  for  "administrative and  supervision
weaknesses" of the program.  However, we also are of  the opinion
that despite such deficiencies there were considerable benefits
associated with the execution of the KIK/KMKP program during SEDP
I  and II,  in fact, more  benefita than acknowledged  by the PCR
(see section 9).
BI adds the following comments on aspects of program design:
- The design of the KIK/RMKP program emerged from numerous BI
internal discussions, the results of the work of a joint team
(from BI, BAPPENAS, MOI and MOM) who travelled extensively
throughout the country (in 1972) to study existing patterns of
institutional lending, as well as from many meetings with the
state banks and technical ministeries. The design which even-
tually was developed essentially contained the same elements
and structure as found in the schemes of other developing
countries: within a system of regulated interest rates, a
special credit program with subsidized interest rates in
combination with a loan guarantee scheme (see section 6) 5).
- World Bank staff was not involved in the preparation of the
original design of the KIK/KMKP program 7). However, IBRD staff
provided considerable  input to  the subsequent  stages of  the
KIK/KMKP program and to the technical assistance components of
the SEDP. The first design and the terms of references for the
consultant  services of the  RPMU-system originated  from World
Bank staff during the early stages of preparing SEDP I. In
subsequent years, IBRD's active participation in the SEDP
through review, advice and criticism particularly noticeable in
the evolution of the SEDP's technical assistance component.
- The departmental responsibility on part of the World Bank for
the SEDP changed three times in the course of project imple-
mentation. Depending on the respective IBRD-department in
charge of the proJect at a given time, specific views, for
instance, as to the regional and sectoral orientation the SEDF
ought to have, entered the discourse on SEDP 6). This led to
confusion on part of BI, the consultants carrying out RPMU
tasks, and participating banks 7).



-44 -
Annex
Page 8 of 20
During SEDP I and II there was disagreement between BI and
IBED primarily in the following areas:
IBRD missions strongly recommended the introduction of a
penalty interest rate on KIK/KMKP loans in arrears to which
BI could not agree, mainly for reasons of avoiding interest
rate discrimination between borrowers belonging to different
firm size categories;
IBRD missions insisted for KIK loans on equipment tenderirg
among at least three suppliers and specified loan disburse-
ment schedules according to investment plans for RIK-pro-
jects.  Although  BI  reluctantly  agreed   to  support  this
suggestion, participating banks and bank clients in practice
did not follow this policy; the request was never implemented
on any larger scale; and
various IBRD missions attempted to forge enhanced
collaboration between technical assistance provided by RPMU
consultancy  to  small  firms  and   that  of  services  made
available to the same target group through projects of
technical ministeries,  in  particular  MOI.  These  attempts
culminated in IBRD's suggestion for SEDP III that BI assumes
responsibility  (on  behalf  of  GOI)  for  supervising   the
execution  of  World  Bank   assistance  to  MOI's  technical
services to small enterprises. BI did not agree to that
proposition and clarified its position with the Government
and the World Bank. As noted by the PCR, subsequent World
Bank efforts to support the Ministry's extension services to
small industries proved to be less than successful
(PCR, p. 12).
5. Portfolio performance under SEDP I and II
In concurrence with the PCR, BI is aware (and at the time of SEDP
II was aware) of the deteriorating portfolio performance of the
KIK/KMKP program; although an arrears percentage of 20 percent
(1978) did not compare unfavorably with that of similar programs
and institutions in other countries, the subsequent development
in portfolio performance was definitely unsatisfactory [see also
PCR, p. 9] 8). Although the arrears were higher than 20 per cent
in 1984/85, BI  is of the opinion  that they must have  been less
than the 60  per cent the  PCR has estimated  for that year   9).
However, considering incompleteness, lack of reliability and
inconsistencies in the  data base,  it seems a  moot question  to
argue which  estimate of the arrears rate is "right" 10); for the
purpose of assessing this aspect of the SEDP it suffices to agree
that the portfolio performance of the program deteriorated during
SEDP II.

In addition to the comments of the two preceding sections, we
argue - with hindsight - that this unfavorable development was
primarily caused by the implementation of the SEDP which empha-
sized the promotion of the small business sector at the expense
of overdue adjustments in the financial sector, particularly with
respect to the banking system. The banking sector responded to
SEDP's credit and technical assistance coniponents by generating a
large volume of small credits, but not by adjusting and improving
its appraisal, supervision, and collection of these loans accor-
dingly. The PCR (and other reports) argue that the spread to
participating banks was insufficient to permit close loan super-
vision and collection efforts [PCR, P. 9; in fact, PCR's margin
analysis of Table 6 concludes that the banks were making losses
under the program] 11).
Few Indonesian bankers would seriously deny that during SEDP I
and II there also was a degree of inefficiency in the banking
system which impeded the necessary  adjustments in the appraisal,
supervision and collection of loans. Another recent report of the
World Bank remarks "(f)inancial data regarding the gross margins
at banks show that typical spreads (consisting of administrative
overheads, loan 108s and other provisions, and gross profit
margins) are approximately 6 - 7 percentage points of the total
cost of loans. Such large spreads depress the volume of finance
in the economy. ... In addition, however, there is substantial
scope   for  reductions  in  bank  intermediation  costs  through
managerial and technical initiatives at the level of individual
institutions" 12).
At the time of SEDP I and II there were essentially three options
to improve the banks' appraisal, supervision and collection of
small loans. At regulated interest rates
- to provide additional financial incentives to the banking
system with the aim to increase profit margins in KIK/KMKP
lending, and assuming that the banks would respond favorably
by increasing their efforts for increasing efficiency;
- to enforce improved bank performa.Lce through central bank
regulatory measures (for example, by establishing minimum
collection rates in small credit lending combined with
sanctions in case these minimum rates were not achieved. or
by requesting the banks to increase training and the number
of staff assigned to small credit lending according to a
prescribed schedule); and
- to enhance and improve technical assistance to participating
banks  under  the   SEDP  and,   possibly,  by   implementing
additional technical assistance projects for the banking
system.

The first option was not acoeptable bece.use it implied (at the
margin) increased  subsidization of  participating banks  coupled
with considerable uncertainty as to the effectiveness of addi-
tional financial incentives. The second option required direct
interference by the central bank in the operations of the banking
system and a continuous  monitoring of the results of  such regu-
latory measures. BI considered sunh interference undesirable and
the monitoring of outcomes, for example of collection rates, very
difficult, given the status of the bank branches' loan recording
system and the experience sofar made with monitoring (see note
11). Besides, in order to be effective, increased efforts of the
banks' in the collection of small (and other) loans needed to be
supplemented by stricter application of the means the legal
system for enforcing the repayment of delinquent loans.
Given the numerous constraints (as mentioned in this and prece-
ding sections) prevailing during SEDP I and II, only the third
option was considered to be both, desirable and feasible, assu-
ming that this would ease at least one important constraint, and
rely for the gradual removal of the others on relaxed regulations
of the interest rate system and on other changes in SEDP's policy
environment. Nevertheless, the implementation of the SEDP's tech-
nical assistance  component  through the  CPMU/RPMU system  might
have achieved more impact on the banks' loan appraisal, super-
vision and collection practices if RPMU consulting services had
concentrated on that part of the assignment rather than on
developing small business activities (which apparently would have
required a different composition of consultancy expertise in the
RPMUs); but who knows, even with the benefit of hindsight?
6. The program's loan guarantee system
The PCR notes
"In the first five years of SEDP, ASKRINDO's premiums
covered claims, but starting in 1983, claims more than
surpassed premiums received" (PCR, p. 9).
The PCR continues with modifications it lists as required for
making the insurance system for KIK/KMKP self-financing (FCB, p.
9). Recently conducted reviews of loan guarantee schemes opera-
ting in a number of countries indicate that none of the existing
schemes (for which sufficient data were made available) are able
to cover claims from the guarantee fees charged, at least not
over longer periods of time 13).
Apparently,  loan  guarantee  schemes  can   be  operated  as  an
insurance proposition by charging the banks with guarantee fees
reflecting the (average) expected risks involved in lending to
small enterprises. Since these risks are comparatively high,
guarantee fees must also be high if the guarantee scheme is to

remain economically viable; alternatively, the fee can be reduced
to the extent that governments are prepared to subsidize guaran-
tee operations. In general, when interest rates are regulated
(that is, they do not fully reflect the risks of lending to small
enterprises), yet lending to these firms is to continue on a
significant scale, maintaining economic viability of the banks
requires subsidization of lending operations, directly extended
to the banks or indirectly via a loan guarantee scheme.
Certainly, more of the risks in lending to small firms (at given
regulated and uniform lending rates) can be shifted to the banks
by increasing the guarantee fee and/or by reducing the guarantee
coverage. Moreover, the guarantee coverage could only be extended
to the uncollateralized  portion of the loan, but  in order to be
effective, this requires the wide-spread application of fore-
closure procedures. During SEDP I and II the whole complex issue
of the loan guarantee scheme was frequently discussed, but no
definite changes were made, primarily because definite increases
in the guarantee fee and/or reductionsheguarantee coverage were
expected  to affect  the  banks' lending  to  the small  business
sector, thus defeating an important goal of Indonesia's develop-
ment policy, the generation of employment (see sections 3 and 4).
Although  the Government's concern  about the pressing employment
problem certainly will  continue, earlier and more  recent finan-
cial sector reforms (from 1983 and October 1988) could provide
the base for adjustments in central bank credit policies, inclu-
ding small credit lending and the associated loan guarantee
scheme.
7. The interest rate subsidy of the KIK/KMKP program during
SEDP I and II
There are three recent sources which explicitly consider the size
of the interestrate subsidy: the DFC/PABESA-Study (1987), IBRD's
Rural Credit Review (1987) and the PCR for SEDP I and II. The
basic data compiled by the first study also serve as the point of
departure for the other two studies 14).
The estimation of the subsidy requires the selection of a measure
for opportunity costs. The choice of an appropriate mea.3ure for
determining opportunity cost can be controversial, in particular
where "uniform market rates" may not be appropriate indicators of
such costs, for example, when institutional lending to small
business mostly occurs through a subsidized program thus impeding
the establishment of "actual market rates" for this type of
13nding.
The DFC/PABESA-study avoids that problem when it compares the
subsidy to the on-lending rates of the KIK/KMKP program rather
than to "market rates". The study acknowledges -;hat this approach
leads to an underestimation of the interest rate subsidy (Annex



- 48-
Annex
Page 12 of 20
13.1, note 1.2, p. 3 of the study). The two IBRD studies use
"market rates" as indicators of  opportunity costs, but differ in
their selection of the market rate. The Rural Sector Review (RSR)
separately considers the subsidy to the banks' cost of funds and
to KIK/KMKP borrowers (for 1986 assumed to have been 18 per
cent). The PCR uses as indicator the Certificate of Deposit
rates. Because of using different interest rates, the two IBRD
studies come to different conclusions about the annual-interest
rate subsidy; for 1986 the RSR obtains a total subsidy of Rp. 153
billion, whereas on the basis of the PCR assumptions the total
subsidy for the same year is about Rp. 115 billion. The diffe-
rence in results (of approximately 25 per cent) of the two IBRD-
studies indicates the (unavoidable) judgement involved in the
selection of an appropriate indicators of opportunity costs. By
selecting different indicators, others (for example BI) could
nave come to lower (or, for that matter, higher) anndal interest
rate subsidies.
Both IBRD approaches mention the existance of borrowing costs to
KIK/KMKP clients, but do not pursue the matter further 15). We
cannot do better, except pointing out that borrowing costs to the
proprietors of small businesses are very high in most developing
countries, sometimes as high or higher than the rates charged by
the banks (see D. Adams and Nehman, 1979).
8. The technical assistance components of SEDF I and II
With respect to SEDP's technical assistance components, the PCR
concludes:
... With hindsight, the technical assistance compo-
nents of the proJect appear over-ambitious; they were
unrealistically designed and proved unmanageable in
practice with the resources that participating agen-
cies could assign. The program was inadequately super-
vised by BI, mainly because the supervisory staff was
ill-trained and undermanned; resource constraints pre-
vented adequate levels of staffing. Evidence suggests
that the Bank also did not supervise the project ade-
quately and was not firm enough in requiring essential
changes in the administration of the project as the
need for them emerged. Too much reliance seems to have
been placed on correcting shortcomings through new
projects (this was a major objective of SEDP III); the
pressure to expand the program rapidly meant that mid-
stream  corrections  were  exceedingly   difficult  to
implement" (PCR, p. 14).
We have quoted this passage of the PCR at length, because the
reiteration of the PCR's summary of alleged deficiencies in the
design and implementation of the technical components facilitates



- 49 -
Annex
Page 13 of 20
a one-by-one account of BI's comments. As we have pointed out
earlier, these observations are derived from field work by others
(presumably from reports from IBRD supervision visits and the
DFC/PABESA-study) with added judgement of the PCR-analyst (see
sections 2 and 3). The following BI comments are intended to
supplement   thie  with   additional  information  and   our  own
interpretation of events:
- BI underlines the PCR's caveat "with hindsight"; all who par-
ticipated in SEDP I and II, IBRD staff and BI personnel alike,
are now in a better position to provide an interpretation of
crucial events and project developments  than they were at  the
time these occurred;
- BI qualifies the PCR statements that the technical assistance
components were "unrealistically designed" by pointing out that
more often than not "... many, perhaps most, constraints remain
hidden in the planning stage, and are only discovered in the
implementation process" (Pressman and Wildavsky, op.cit. p.
180). In this sense all or most proJects are "unrealistically
designed"; the design of SEDP's technical assistance components
is no exception.
- We acknowledge that (as one of such "hidden" constrain'ts) there
were problems in matching the resources provided by participa-
ting  agencies (foreign  as  well as  domestic),   with proJect
requirements, but BI does not agree with the PCRIs contention
that this made the technical assistance components unmanage-
able. Any technical assistance proJect has that problem and
must rely on improving the quality of resources during project
implementation. In particular, we do not agree if this PCR
observation were to imply that more foreign resources should
have been allocated.
- With qualifications we agree that BI-staff was not well-trained
to supervise this specific type of technical assistance; after
all, staff training and experience did involve quite different
subject matters than required by SEDP-technical assistance.
- We would acknowledge some shortcomings in BI's supervision of
these components, if these were specified by the PCR and not
formulated as a general contention. During SEDP I and II the
RPMUs were regularly  visited by  CPMU team  members; at  these
occasions apparent difficulties in project implementation were
identified and  solutions discussed  together with  RPMU teams.
Nevertheless, evidently not all problems could be resolved on
the spot. During the first two phases of the SEDP reports,
letters, telexes and phone connections provided the ordinary
means to continue  distant comz-A-nication  between the CPMU  and
the RPMU-system.

l
- However, as experience with other projects (in,Indonesia and
elsewhere) has shown, it is exceedingly difficult to keep an
extensive regional network of project activities from falte-
ring, and this, despite available communication channels. In
BI's view (and with hindsight) this is less a matter of conti-
nuing confusion on proJect aims (as the DFC/PABESA study
observes), but much more that of integrating consultancy
activities in a well-established BI system in a specific
regional environment. There is little doubt that adJustment
problems between the system and the RPMUs were a major cause of
slack in RPMU-activities (the DFC/PABESA study only fleetingly
mentions this aspect); the (at times) high turnover of consul-
tants at various locations testify to that.
- We do not believe that a more intensive (or more adequate)
IBRD project supervision  could have done  much to improve  the
perfomance of  the project's  technical assistance  components.
Besides, in order to have been effective in achieving lasting,
predominantly  institutional  changes,  the  frequency  in  the
visits of IBRD staff had to be higher and associated with much
more field work in the regions. It appears doubtful whether
that would have suited the respective management of BI and the
World Bank.
9. SEDP I and II: project benefits
The FCR acknowledges that SEDP I and II "... probably achieved
their obJectives of channelling credit to SSEs, the training of
HB  staff,  and the  generation  of new  Jobs  ... (PCR,  p. 14).
However, the PCR adds that "... they did so at great expense and
inefficiency" (PCR, p. 14).
The KIK/KMKP program indeed proved to be successful in the sense
that it provided small firms with access to institutional credit
on a relatively large scale. It has been estimated that KIK/KMKP
lending in 1986/87 accounted for about 20 to 25 per cent of all
borrowing by the small business sector (DFC/PABESA-study, p. 29).
It was also found that under the KIK program on average only
Pp. 3.2 million in investment were required to generate one full-
time Job; by the end of 1984 more than 300.000 of such Jobs were
created by enterprises receiving KIK loans (Impact Study 1986). A
sample study, concluded (albeit on the basis of rather weak data)
that the KIK/KMKP program had a high economic rate of return,
particularly in the manufacturing industry, thus implying that
the program had created considerable net economic benefits
(Impact Studies, 1983 and 1986).
Although we are aware of the general limitations of impact
studies and in particular of the shortcomings of the impact
studies mentioned, there are the quoted indications .that the
economic benefits associated with the KIK/KMKP program exceeded



- 51 -
Annex
Page 15 of 20
its costs; a matter which the PCR appears to give not sufficient
justice    17).  Small  enterprises,  for  example,  have  become
increasingly involved in the production and trade for exports.
Although this may not have been clearly noticeable during SEDP I
and II, it is evident now and constituteB a definite economic
benefit. We do not argue that there is clear evidence that many
small firms receiving KIK/KMKP loans during the former three
SEDPs have progressed into export oriented small industries, yet
there must be a considerable number of former program borrowers
who used these loans and other means to reach that stage.
Although not an eaey exercise, it may be useful if the names of
former KIK/KMKP borrowers would be traced to their present
involvement in production and trade for exports; such an effort
may provide more  insight in the  direct and indirect effects  of
lending to small and (probably by now) medium scale enterprises.
10. The PCR for SEDP III: some prospectives
In Section 2 of this paper we have proposed to include in the PCR
for SEDP III comments on the transition from the former SEDP to
the NSEDP against the background of recent and possibly forth-
coming reform measures, and the prospective effects of these
policies  on  institutional lending  to  small and  medium enter-
prises. More specifically, BI's proposition is that from IBRD's
PCR (III) and BI's comments to that paper a dialogue could
commence on the prospective relationship between recent policy
changes and specific central bank credit policies.
Various reports from IBRD and others on the SEDP have drawn the
conclusion that the government subsidies involved in the program
ought to be removed (at least reduced); instead. market-oriented
interest rates would be the appropriate instrument for allocating
credit, including the allocation of credit to small firms
(somewhat in line with recent projects, such as the SMIEP). In
this context, the following two questions seem important. First,
the Government's deregulation efforts are likely to continue
under  relatively  tight  budget   conditions.  If,  under  these
circumstances, the costs incurred by the Government in KIK/KMKP
lending are to be reduced, which program elements/parameters are
to be adJusted in which way? Second, reductions in government
subsidies to the program will increase the cost of borrowing from
financial institutions to small firms. Is it realistic to assume
that small businesses will be able to borrow at the same interest
rates as larger firms, or will financial institutions more likely
charge higher interest rates, in line with higher risk and
administrative cost (per unit of principal) associated with such
lending, or, another possibility, will institutions charge a
uniform rate but "ration available funds in favor of larger
firms?

For apparent reasons, we are concerned about the effects of risks
in lending to small (and medium) scale enterprises on interest
rates. Several authors have argued that interest rates for small
loans would have to rise to very high levels, if they were to
cover both  risk and  administrative costs  17). For  example, if
banks anticipate a 30 per cent default rate on such loans, the
effective rate of interest would have to rise to about 46 per
cent p.a. for a three year loan, assuming administrative costs
and cost of funds to the banks of together 20 per cent p.a.
It is further argued that financial institutions for political
and other considerations cannot charge effective interest rates
at levels close to 50 percent p.a. Under these circumstances,
banks would rather restrict lending to small firms, that is,
limit access of such enterprises to institutional credit. This
matter  apparently   needs  further  discussion,   in  particular
considering anticipated adjustments in the KIK/KMKP program.
I.D.Little (1988) remarks in this context "(h)igh interest rates
for some borrowers, as well as the lack of access for others
(even some who would have succeeded, and easily paid their
debts), may just as well be signs of a healthy loan market as of
a badly operating one". If confronted with this issue in terms of
a policy decision, the Government - including BI - may well come
to a different conclusion.

Note8 and Reference
1) We are referring to discussions with Mr. Murphy in early
November 1988 and more recently with Mr. Jayaraya (January 1988)
2) A wealth of literature on these and related issues has accumu-
lated since Pressman and Wildavsky published their humorous
account of the hazards experienced with a government funded
employment proJect in Oakland, USA; see J.L. Pressman and A.
Wildavsky: "Implementation"; University of California Press,
1973; second edition, expanded 1979;
3) Among other international development effecting policies for
small business development were that
the less esoteric and more economic arguments of the
small   is   beautiful"   movement   became   increasingly
fashionable and influenced policy decisions in favor of
small business promotion;
a number of studies were published which provided stati-
stics strongly indicating the potential  of small firms for
labor absorption; although the more competent studies also
pointed to comparatively low labor productivity and a lack
of efficiency in many small firms, this generally was con-
sidered to be of less importance when compared to the ad-
vantages these enterprises offered in terms of generating
Job opportunities; the promotion of small firms was (and
often still is) seen as if not a panacea then the most
important policy for dealing with the problem of unem-
ployment of unskilled labor;
studies of special credit programs reported some failures
but also successes; the general opinion was that without
compensating  financial  intermediaries   for  the   higher
administrative cost and risks experienced in lending to
small firms, intermediaries would decline to extend credit
to  the  small business  in  accordance with  that sector's
potential for development and, specifically, for employment
generation; that is, at least as long as government regu-
lated interest rates exist, subsidization of financial
intermediaries is required to ensure an "appropriate" flow
of institutional credit to the small business sector.
4) This observation needs some qualification. Prior to the late
1970s there was an astounding gap between the writings of
authors such as Adams, von Pischke and Gonzales-Vega, on small
credit schemes and the official practice of development agen-
cies supporting these schemes. At that time, the main agency
displaying reservations about the design of the KIK/KMKP
program was US AID which in Indonesia and other countries



Annex
Fage 18 of 20
introduced special credit programs with market-oriented terms
and conditions for low income groups. Beginning with SEDP II
there was discussion and apparent disagreement between BI and
IBRD primarily with respect to the feasibility and desira-
bility of introducing a penalty interest rate on KIK and KMKP
loans in arrears. However, the basic interest rate parameters
of the program were not seriously questioned at that time.
5) BI and evidently the World Bank studied the various
schemes in existence at that time. As pointed out earlier, not
until much later were such schemes criticized on the basis of
their basic design parameters.
6) A few examples may clarify this point. The appraisal of SEDP I
was delayed for more than one year for the primary reason that
the IBRD department in charge of the project at that time was
not agreeable that the SEDP would be designed to serve small
enterprises in all economic sectors, not only in manufacturing
industry (see written communication between BI and IBRD from
that time). Subsequently, another IBRD department designed a
Rural Credit Project to which the implementation of the SEDP
was to be supplementory, but not to interfere or overlap with.
A difficult assignment which led to debate on sectoral and
regional priorities of the SEDP. Another example is that
depending on the IBRD department  responsible for SEDP, diffe-
rent requirements for BI's reporting were requested; sometimes
only in form of a selection of field reports from the RPMU-
sytem (and data on KIK disbursements), at other times, regular
and comprehensive BI reporting.
7) The DFC/PABESA study mentions other causes of confusion and
misunderstanding on part of RPMU consultants with respect to
their specific tasks, but not this aspect.
8) See e.g. the international comparison of data on transaction
costs and loan delinquency of selected credit institutions in
developing countries in K. Anderson Saito and D.P. Villanueva:
"Transition Costs of Credit to the Small-Scale Sector in the
Philippines" in Economic Development and Cultural Change, Vol.
29, No. 3, April 1981, pp. 631.
9) The PCR obtains the 60 per cent for 1984-85 from Table 4. In
that table the estimated arrears rate is strongly dependent on
the "adJusting entries" of the Table which as a "dummy
variable"  balance  the   portfolio  outstanding  between  the
beginning and end of each year. In view of the strong reser-
vations one must have as to the reliability and completeness
of  the   underlying  data  (outstanding,   disbursements  and
collections) this approach is to lead to debatable arrear
rates with hectic changes from one year to another. BI has
provided IBRD with its own estimates on arrears development
which appear more favorable, although admittedly they are also



- 55 -
Annex
Page 19 of 20
based on incomplete and not necessarily more reliable records
on portfolio changes.
10) During SEDP II BI attempted to determine collection rates of
the KIK/KMKP program at the branch level of participating
banks (in Central Java) on the basis of the usual formats for
such exercises. Although careful preparation and much time
went  into   the  efforts,  the  results  were  disappointing.
particularly in terms of the basic data bank branches (with
few exceptions) could provide from their records on KIK
portfolios. Recent findings from the NSEDP-Banking Project
indicate that the recording of KIK/KMKP portfolio at the
branch level is improving.
11) BI, IBRD and others (e.g. the DFC/PABESA study) conducted a
number of margin analyses, similar to the one presented in
Table 6 of the PCR, but with different results. Such analyses
were discussed in detail with participating banks and from
time to time with BAPPENAS.

Development", Washington DC: May 2, 1982; p. 82.
13) Most of these studies were prepared for the World Bank; e.g.

Enterprises", Los Altos, March 15, 1981; Aswin Kongiri

Observations from Experience in Malaysia, Nepal and Thailand;
London, July 1986; J. Levitsky and Ranga N. Prasad: "Credit
Guarantee Schemes for Small and Medium Enterprises", The World
Bank, February 1987.
14) As regards the prog.am's interest rate subsidy, the following
estimates were made:
DFC/PABESA for the period 1978-1985 total of
Rp. 418.1 billion; IBRD's Rural Credit Review for a single
recent year (1986); Rp. 153 billion IBRD's present PCR for
the period 1978-1985 a total of Rp. 575 billion.
15) Borrowing cost are transaction cost (in addition to the
lending rate charged by institutions). They comprise out-of-
pocket outlays by the borrower required to obtain documents,
pay commissions and travel to and from the lender-3 office as
well as the opportunity costs of the borrower's time involved
to  complete   all  required  procedures   (in  this   context
"opportunity  costs" are  subJect to  similar reservations  as
mentioned in the text with respect to the interest rate
subsidy).   If   there  are   delays   in  loan   approval  or
disbursements, the borrower may incur additional transaction
cost associated with a temporary loan from non-institutional
services (see J.R.Ladman, 1984).
