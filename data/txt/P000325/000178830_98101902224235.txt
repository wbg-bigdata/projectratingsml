REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REGIE NATIONALE DES CHEMINS DE FER DU CAMEROtUN
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CANEROON
FOR A
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to R6gie Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Cameroun, with the guarantee
of the United Republic of Cameroon, for the equivalent of US$ 16 million
to help finance a Second Railway project. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including three years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum. Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) would provide
a parallel loan of US$ 5.3 million equivalent to finance the motive power
component of the project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon"
(No. R72-247) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27,
1972. An updating mission visited the country in May/June 1973; its major
findings are reflected in the following paragraphs and Annex I contains
country data. A basic economic mission is planned for FY1975 to coincide
with the preparation of Cameroon's Fourth Development Plan (FY77-81).
Economic Potential
3.        Cameroon's natural resources are varied, although not abundant.
Its range of soils and climatic conditions permits cultivation of a wide
range of crops and provides substantial agricultural potential. These
crops include oil palm and rubber in the south, cocoa and coffee in the
central region, and rice, groundnuts, cotton and other sahelian crops in
the north. The forestry region of the southeast contains large untapped
timber resources, and the north, good potential for livestock.
4.        While the main opportunities for develooment lie in expansion
and diversification of agricultural production, Cameroon also possesses
valuable industrial potential. It consists not only of the production of
import substitutes needed for a growing domestic market, but also of the
processing of local raw materials, particularly agricultural and forestry
products, for export.
5.        Commerce, transport, and transit services are important economic
activities. Cameroon is a large country with three main economic centers
(West, South, and North) separated by large underpopulated areas.
In addition, the country serves as one of the main export routes for
landlocked Chad and, to a lesser extent, the Central African Republic.



- 2 -
An active transport sector is therefore vital to the development of
Cameroon, and considerable investments are needed to build or maintain
adequate port, road, and railroad infrastructure - prerequisites to
promoting agricultural and industrial development and to strengthening
the role of Cameroon as a regional trade center.
Past Performance
6.       During the first decade of independence (1960-1970) the Govern-
ment has made serious efforts to lay the groundwork for accelerated
economic development and to step up the mobilization of financial
resources for this purpose. In spite of internal political difficulties
during the early 1960's and of administrative constraints arising from
Cameroon's top-heavy federal structure, these efforts have been quite
successful. During the 1960's GDP grew in real terms at an average rate
of over six percent a year and owing to prudent financial policies the
Government was able to finance a rising proportion of public investment
from domestic savings.
7.       The sectoral distribution of public investment corresponded
fairly well to the country's development requirements. By far the largest
part of public investment was devoted to lifting the most immediate deve-
lopment constraint, namely the shortcomings of the transport network.
Conscious of the lack of trained manpower at all levels, the Governrnent
also emphasized the expansion and imprDvement of education. Numerous new
schools were opened, school enrollment soared and a beginning was made
with the reform of education. In agriculture, the Government promoted
crop diversification through projects for rubber, oil palm, cotton and
rice and made a beginning with the rehabilitation of existing coffee and
cocoa acreage. In industry, the Government's efforts were limited to
providing financial support for key projects and maintaining a liberal
investment climate which led to an increase in private foreign investment
and quick expansion of manufacturing caracity, particularly in the field
of import substitution.
8.       In the early 1970's economic growth slowed down because of
declining world prices for cocoa and coffee and a decline in foreign
private lnvestment.  In spite of the recession, Government managed to
increase budgetary savings through improved tax collection, better
exPenditure control, and a modest rise in tax rates. Public investment
however rose evJen faster and the result -was a drawdown of treasury
reserves and an increase in external debt* With an estimated debt service
ratio in 1973 of 8 percent, Cameroon's debt problems are still manageable.
The increase in cocoa, coffee and timber prices in 1973 has improved
government finance, balance of payments, and produced a slight recovery in
the reserve position. Current indications suggest however that the rise
in oil prites is likely to lead to gradually increasing external financing
requirements.



- 3-
Prospects and Development Strategy
9.       Prospects for further economic growth remain favorable, provided
the Government can come to grips with several structural oroblems which
have come to the fore in recent years and of which the Government and aid
donors are increasingly aware. (i) In spite of massive investments in
recent years, the basic transport infrastructure is still inadequate to
meet the country's requirements. The Douala port and the Douala-Yaounde
section of the railroad require major improvements and the road system
needs to be adapted to traffic growth and the development of new agricul-
tural and forestry areas. (ii) In agriculture, which will remain the
mainstay of the economy, more determined action should be taken to bring
financial and technical assistance within the reach of the small farmers.
Cameroon's favorable climate and soil would allow output increases in
almost all crops as well as in livestock. The small farmers, who account
for most of the country's agricultural production, however, are still
largely unaware of improved cultivation techniques or not attracted by
prospects of higher or better quality production. They mostly use tradi-
tional, low-yielding production methods. An agricultural survey by the
Bank during April/May 1973 recommended to the Government various specific
measures including applied research, extension services, supplies of inputs
and agricultural credit. On income distribution grounds, the survey
recommends increased attention to development possibilities in "he backward
northern plains and western highlands which have a large, poor population
and reasonably good agricultural and livestock potential. (iii) Even if
rural development efforts become more successful, rapid migration from
the countryside to the cities is bound to continue.   Cameroon's urban
population is expected to rise from 20 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in
1985. The main problem in the cities will be to provide productive employ-
ment, and to plan land use for housing, infrastructure, and social services.
The Government intends to devote increased attention to migration and
urban problems and has asked the Bank for advice. In the industrial
sector, a revision of policies is necessary in order to restore foreign
investors' confidence which in recent years had suffered from slow and
cumbersome procedures.
10.      To resolve these problems, action on two fronts is essential.
First, a strengthening of project preparation and implementation machinery,
and second, a mobilization of adequate domestic and external resources for
a fairly large public investment program.
11.      Considerable progress is being made on the first objective.
In 1972, President Ahidjots policy of national integration culminated in
a successful referendum which abolished the former federated states and
replaced the cumbersome federal structure by a unitary government. Within
the new structure, strong ministries are being established to replace the
weak technical departments in each federated state; and within the new
ministries, the Government is trying to establish planning units for
project and policy formulation.



12.      With respect to investment financing, and taking into account
preliminary revisions necessitated by international Drice changes, an
average yearly public investment spending of US$150 million would be
required to catch up with the backlog of infrastructural investment and
to support the 5 percent real annual GDP growth rate deemed feas-ble by
our last mission.j   External financing of about US$130 million a year
will be required to allow for debt service and some rebuilding of reserves.
Bilateral and other sources outside the Bank Group are expected to
contribute about 70 percent of Cameroon's external aid requirements.
Assuming that the Bank (excluding IDA) would finance.the remaining 30
percent, its share of Cameroon's disbursed external debt would rise to
18 percent by 1979 as against 13 percent at present. Service on Bank
Group debt, however, now around 4 percent of total public debt service,
would not exceed 14 percent by 1979 and total debt service at that date
would amount to 15 percent of projected export earnings.
13.      Cameroon's ability to make effective use of external resources
and the Government's dedication to development are reasons for increased
external support. Although debt service is still low, it is rising
rapidly and will absorb an increasing share of gross public savings; the
higher oil prices will also have a negative impact on savings. Therefore,
Cameroon can make only a modest contribution to the financing of future
public investment. To avoid further rapid buildup of debt service,
lenders, including the Bank Group, should provide part of their assistance
on concessionary terms and also be prepared to finance a high proporticn
of project costs including when necessary a part of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
14.      Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of April    30, 1974 and includes notes on the execution of
orgoing projects. The Bank Groupts commitments in Cameroon now amount to
more than US$140 million and cover eleven projects: four in agriculture,
four in transportation, two in education and one in public utilities.
With the large loan/credit for the Second Highway project in 1973, trans-
portation now renresents the largest share (52 percent) of our past
commitments followed by agriculture (30 percent). Although delays and
setbacks have been occasionally encountered in the execution of the
projects, the Government has consistently shown willingness to collaborate
with the Bank for the determination and application of satisfactory
solutions.
j The impact of the sharp recent changes in the international price
structure has been estimated on a preliminary basis in these calculations.
A full new set of internally consistent projections, taking into account
the latest estimates of future commlodity prices and likely adjustments
of the Cameroonian economy to these new price relationships   is being
undertaken in conjunction with our on-going economic work. Pending
completion of this exercise, the balance of payments and debt projec-
tions in Annex I have not been updated.



15.      The Bank Group's strategy is to support the Government in its
efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to accelerate rural
development, and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's institutions.
16.      In agriculture we have been able to help the Government to
diversify production by financing its oil palm and rubber plantations
in the east and west and rice irrigation in the north. The recently
approved livestock project provides for cattle breeding ranches in the
northwest, center and east, a tsetse fly extermination campaign, animal
slaughtering and meat retailing facilities, and credit to private
livestock holders. A cocoa rehabilitation and planting project, anpraised
in October/November 1973, includes important institution building and
training aspects that would benefit many small holders. An integrated
rural development project in the very populated but underdeveloned north
is under consideration for FY 76.   Besides promoting much needed food-
stuff production, increased Bank Group lending to agriculture will support
the Governmentts efforts to organize itself and focus on rural develooment
in order to correct geographical and economic imbalances in Cameroon's
development.
17.      Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has
devoted the largest portion of public investments to this sector.
The Bank Group, together with bilateral institutions, has substantially
helped Government develop adequate transport facilities. The Second
Highway project of 1973 will help complete the establishment of the basic
trunk road system. Given sharp traffic increases and the backlog of
required investments, massive injections of capital will still be necessary
in the years ahead, particularly for the expansion of the port of Douala
and further improvement of the transport corridor which links it with the
capital, Yaounde. Road investments would mainly be for road maintenance
and feeder roads to provide liaks to local markets and facilitate exploi-
tation of Cameroon's forests, a major area for future development.
In other sectors, we are actively considering a first power generation and
distribution project, a first small-scale industries project, and a third
education project with special emphasis on rural education and training.
18.      Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with other
donors; in six out of eleven projects financing arrangements have been
either joint or parallel.  French assistance would join us in financing
the forthcoming cocoa project and make a parallel loan for the proposed
second railway project.
19.      In all our projects, we will as in the past pay particular
attention to training, technical assistance and other provisions to
strengthen government institutions and improve sector policies. Besides,
through our economic work we will continue to advise the authorities, at
their request, on development questions in general, and subjects suchI as
economic management, problems of urban migration and manpower development
in particular.

PART III - THE TRANSFORT SECTOR
Infrastructure
20.      Despite the requirements imposed by the country's geography at
indeoendence, Cameroon's transport infrastructure was appreciably less
developed than in most other Wiest African countries.  The country's
location on the Gulf of Guinea, at the junction of West and Equatorial
Africa, makes it an important gateway for its landlocked neighbors, Chad,
and to a lesser extent, the Central African Republic (C.A.R.). The
distances between Cameroon's principal agricultural areas and the sea are
great. Given these distances and the country's dependence on exports and
imports, low-cost transoortation i.s a prerequisite to economic growth.
During the last ten years the Government invested largely in transoortation,
to reduce transport costs, open up new areas for development (esoecially
in the remote North), improve transit services for its landlocked neighbors,
and unify the once divided country.
21.      At present the system comprises one major port, about 1,200 km of
railways,23,000 km of roads (of which 1,500 km paved), one navigable water-
way, and five airports (two of which international). The trunk land
transport system radiates from Douala, the main port, industrial and
commercial center, and is being developed along two main axes. The 300-km
Douala-Bafoussam-Foumban route serves the Western Region which is densely
populated and produces cocoa, coffee and bananas. The 1,700-km Trans-
cameroon route, which combines rail and road links, heads east from Douala
to the cocoa producing region around Yaounde, the capital, then north to
the cotton, meat and rice producing northern Cameroon and the Chad border.
This route also carries timber traffic and part of Chad's imports and
exports.
22.      Thus, the network provides access to the vital areas of economic
activity. However, many sections, built decades ago, could no longer cone
with increasing traffic. The first highway project of 1970 included the
improvement of about 300 kms of roads, between Ngaoundere and Garoua and
between Tiko and Victoria. The second highway project (Loan 935, Cr 42Q
of 1973) includes reconstruction of about 500 km of roads in north and
west Cameroon.  Together with other investments from bilateral and
multilateral sources (including the Bank Group's First Highway Project),
they are designed to bring the trunk road sections of the Transcameroon
route to the capacity required by domestic and transit traffic.



-7-
23.      The current capacity constraints on the Transcameroon route
are the railway and the port of Douala.
24.      Considerable additional investments are required on the railway
system. Until recently, the railway in Cameroon was quite small, andS
the furthest penetration from the port of Douala was to Yaounde, a
distance of about 300 km; however, construction has recently been com-
pleted of a 628 km extension to Ngaoundere which is expected to accelerate
development of the northern region of the country. This extension has
been built to high standards of design and engineering, and its cost of
about US$100 million has been financed primarily by bilateral lending
agencies either in the form of grants or of loans on concessionary terms.
While this new construction was advancing, however, the old lines -- in
particular the critical Douala-Yaounde link which was originally constructed
to much lower design standards -- were deteriorating under the impact of
growing traffic volumes. At the same time, additional motive power and
rolling stock were required to meet traffic demands.
25.      The Bank's involvement with the railway system has focussed on
improvements to the Douala-Yaound6 section, and the equipment needed to
maintain and augment the railway's overall carrying capacity. The First
Railway Project (Loan 687-CM, US$5.2 million, 1970) resulted from a
Government request for Bank support of the Third Railway Development Plan
covering the period 1970/71 - 1975/76. This Third Plan also contained
provision for major extensions of the railway system and a complete
realignment of the Douala-Yaounde section.   The Bank reserved its eosition
on these proposals, most of which were not adequately supported by
engineering and economic studies, and in fact stipulated in the ensbu><ngc
Loan Agreement certain restrictions on investments and debt obligat 'ms
which effectively prevented implementation of these plans until furth9'
study and review had been undertaken. The Bank did, however, agree to
assist with items relating to improvement of existing facilities and
services during the first three years of the Plan period. As a result,
the Bank provided financing for rolling stock, reconstruction of the
Japoma bridge near Douala, track renewal on the Douala-Yaound6 section,
and consulting services to review the proposed project to completely
re-align that section. Other project items not financed by the Bank
included reconstruction of the Douala railway station and shunting yard.
and extension of the Training Center, which have been delayed.
26.      Pending preparation of a new Plan, the Government and the rail-
way have requested further Bank assistance to finance urgent needs -through
1976, and these are the subject of the proposed loan.



- 8 -
27.      At the same time, the Government and the National Ports
Authority are preparing with the help of French and German consultants
the expansion of Cameroon's principal port, Douala. In the past Credit
229-CM helped improve log handling and build a berth for industrial
raw materials. Nevertheless, this port is rapidly reaching the limits
of its capacity and with the anticipated increase in traffic, especially
of timber, port expansion becomes urgent. Several bilateral and
rmultilateral donors (including the World Bank Group) have been approached
to finance this expansion and we hope to appraise a project during the
current year.
Organization, Planning and Coordination
28.      The Government's present transport policy aims at:   (i) deve-
loping and improving the Douala port, the Transcameroon route, and the
Douala-Foumban axis, all of which serve export-import traffic; and
(ii) improving road links that specifically contribute to socio-economic
integration of the two former states which now form Cameroon. The
transport investments in the Third Five-Year Plan (1971/72-1975/76) are
designed to achieve these goals, and if completed as olanned (by around
1981), these two major policy objectives would be achieved. The
importance of improving and developing feeder roads, as well as of
strengthening road maintenance, is recognized, and will in future be
the principal focus of attention.
29.      The Ministry of Transport created in 1970 has overall responsi-
bility for the determination of policy, planning, and coordination in
the sector, though the Ministries of Planning and of Piblic Works have
subsidiary planning roles. This responsibility covers transDort agencies
such as Regifercam, the National Ports and Waterways Authority, and
Cameroon Airlines, including review of their investment proposals and
approval of tariffs. In the past, the planning function was relatively
simple since transport needs were readily identifiable; in the future,
more careful planning will be required to evaluate projects and establish
priorities.  ZSee paragraph 33 on the pending coordination problem with
respect to the Douala-Yaounde transport corridor.j Cameroon's caoacity
to achieve such planning needs strengthening, and the Second Highway
Project provides assistance to the Ministry of Transport in setting up a
pe&manent organization.



-9-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Purpose
30.       The project is designed to meet the most urgent equioment and
track needs of Regie Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Cameroun (Regifercam)
through 1976.  Regifercam and the Bank identified and preoared the pro-
posed interim railroad project. The project is based on data supplied by
consultants OCCR j and Sofrerail (France) and the findings of the Bank
Mission which appraised the project in February/March 1973, as updated in
the light of new information provided by Regifercam and Government in
February 1974.  The Appraisal Report, Appraisal of a Second Railway Project
No. 423a-CM dated June 13, 1974 , is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is in Annex III of this
report. Negotiations for a loan were held in Washington in May 19714, with
a Cameroonian delegation headed by Mr. Tchoungui, Cameroon's Ambassador to
the United States.
Description
31.       The project, to be executed during 1974-1977, consists of:
(i) construction of a new Japoma bridge;
(ii) completion of track renewal (42 km) on the Douala-Yaounde
line;
(iii) installation of 50 new turn-outs;
(iv) installation of a radio link on the Douala-Yaounde-
Ngaoundere lines;
(v) purchase of 100 flat-cars, 25 box-cars, 100 freight-car
bogies, a breakdown crane, and spare narts for locomotives
and rolling stock;
(vi) purchase of 4 main-line and 3 shunting locomoti:ves;
(vii) provision of consulting services in the fields of railway
operations, costing, commercial activities and management,
and for a detailed review of the solution to fore-
seeable capacity constraints on the Douala-Yaounde transnort
corridor (road construction vs. railway realignment).
32.       Concurrently with the proposed Second Project, the railway
is planning construction of the new Douala Station and extension of the
Training Center.
/ OCCR: Organization, Control, Conception, Realisation.



- 10 -
33.       The project will provide Regifercam's rolling stock and motive
power requirements to meet freight traffic demand until 1977, particularly
with respect to the movement of expected timber traffic originating east
and north of Yaound6. It will also enhance the line capacity on the critical
Douala-Yaounde section, through track renewal, extended sidings, and better
radiocommunications. These improvements will remove constraints which are
inhibiting traffic growth and causing costly delays in the train operations.
These line improvements will suffice to meet requirements until at least the
end of the decade. In the early 1980ts, however, overall traffic growth may
reintroduce a capacity constraint which could necessitate a major realignment
of the Douala-Yaound6 section at a cost in excess of US$100 million. However,
this railway section is paralleled by a road which, because of its present
condition, is restricted to light (largely short-haul passenger) traffic.
The Government is considering upgrading the road at considerable cost.
Should both the railway and the road be improved, there is likely to be excess
capacity and there is, therefore, a need to examine, in depth, the least-cost
solution to future traffic requirements on the Douala-Yaound6 corridor.
The project provides funds for appropriate studies to supplement those already
undertaken for the railway realignment under the First Railway Project.
34.       The proposed financing of the Japoma bridge is additional to the
provision in the First Railway Project (Loan 687 of 1970). The existing
bridge spans the Dibamba River and carries all rail traffic between Douala
and Yaound6. Its stability is imperiled by damage to its piers and the
sinking and tilting of one of them. Hence there is a risk that it may
collapse and block the'Cameroon's main transport artery. It was envisaged
under the First Project to reconstruct the existing bridge or to construct
a new bridge upstream. Unforeseen subsoil conditions at the upstream site
necessitated lengthy studies. After reviewing a wide range of technical
solutions the Bank and Regifercam concluded that it would be better to
construct a bridge downstream despite higher cost. Bids were received and
confirmed that funds in Loan 687 (about $900,000) would be grossly insuffi-
cient to cover the foreign exchange cost of the new construction, estimated
at $2.2 million; consequently, Regifercam did not commission the work
peniding a second Bank loan.  The new bridge would be financed partly out of
the proposed loan and partly out of funds allocated for this purpose in the
previous loan.
Project Execution
35.       The project will be carried out by the railway, which is competent
to do so. Execution is expected to start in 1974 and to take three years
to complete.
36.       The railway enjoys sufficient autonomy in its day-to-day operations
to permit effective management. The quality of top management, strongly
supported by French technical assistance, is generally satisfactory. However,
there is considerable scope for improvement in administrative and technical
practices. The proposed project provides for consulting services for
operational planning and control, costing, marketing, administrative
organization, management training, corporate planning. Regifercam has
agreed to consult with the Government and the Bank regarding the decisions
it proposes to take in the light of consultants' recommendations (section
4.03 of the Loan Agreement).



- 11 -
37.       The railway's physical assets are generally well maintained.
About 628 km of track, constructed to high technical standards, have been
opened to traffic in recent years.  Older track is maintained in good repair
but at high costs, due to excessive wear of rails and the extremely difficult
terrain crossed.  Training of staff is given continuous attention in antici-
pation of a continuing rapid growth in traffic. Efficiency of operations
has been somewhat low, but should improve following completion of the tr'a`k
renewal program and the delivery of new rolling stock and locomotives. the
consulting services outlined in paragraoh 31(vii) above are, of course, allso
designed to help improve efficiency.
Project Cost and Financing
38.       Total project cost net of duties and taxes amounts to about US$23
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.7 million or 90 percent
(for a breakdown see Annex III). The Bank would make a loan to Regifercarn,
of US$16 million, repayable in 25 years (including a 3 year grace period)5,
of which US$14.6 million, together with US$0.9 million from the first Bank
loan, would meet the foreign exchange requirements of all items except the
locomotives. Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) has aDproved
a loan of US$5-3 million equivalent to cover the costs of locomotive purchase.
Regifercam would provide the remaining local costs of the project, estimated
at US$2.3 million equivalent.   The Bank loan would include US$1.4 million for
interest during the first two years of the project to ease the debt service
burden on the railway prior to receipt of additional revenues generated by
project items.
Regifercam's Financial Position
39.       During the period 1965-68, the railway's financial situation was
satisfactory, with rates of return on net fixed assets in use ranging from
5 percent to 7.3 percent. Subsequently, the position deteriorated, until in
1972 and 1973 the rate of return declined to zero, and the Government was
forced to subsidize the railway. The essential reasons for the deterioration
were: (i) a sharp increase in operating costs (including depreciation)
arising from the opening of the first section (Yaounde-Belabo) of the Trans-
cameroon extension and from inflationary pressures with no compensating
increases in rates and fares; and (ii) a fall-off in the growth of traffic
due to capacity constraints and a deterioration of service quality.
4O.       It is now proposed that the railway will regain a sound financia?
position, mainly by several substantial tariff increases which are designed
to recover lost ground and cope with inflationary pressures. This is in line
with the Government's policy not to subsidize railway traffic on a regular
basis. In execution of this policy, tariff increases were introduced rn
January and April 1974, and tariffs will continue to be raised annua-l>y so
that the railwayts position will gradually improve to a point ie-rel, no later
than 1979/80, the railway will be able to meet all its cash recuirements
including debt service and a reasonable contribution to its investment nrogram
(exclusive of major realignments or extensions).   Regifercan has agreed to
take measures necessary to attain a rate of return of 1 percent in fiscal year
1975, slowly rising to 4 percent by fiscal year 1979.   These rates .Xeould be
reviewed after June 1974 when Reg-fercamts assets have been revalluerd (Loan
Agreement, sections 5.10 and 5.0a).

41.       Regifercam's cash position, although now being eased by Govern-
ment subsidies and bank overdrafts, will remain tight until 1976. The debt/
equity ratio is satisfactory because construction of the Transcameroon
extension, which accounts for about 60 percent of the railw-ay's assets, was
financed mainly by grants.  The Loan Agreement for the proposed rroject
makes adequate provision for limitation of the railway's indebtedness
(Section 5.06).
42.       It is recognized that, in spite of appropriate assurances and
safeguards, the railway's financial situation throughout the project period
is dependent upon the development of foreseen traffic volumes and the
ability of the railway to match rising costs, particularly those resulting
from inflationary pressures, with timely and adequate tariff increases.
To protect the railway's position against the risks involved in traffic
shortfalls or possible time-lags in the implementation of tariff increases,
the Government has agreed to provide subsidies to the railways or to take
other appropriate measures in the event that a cash shortfall sniould
materialize. (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03).
Procurement and Disbursement
43.       All Bank financed items under the project, except the spare diesel
generator to be manufactured by the locomotive supplier, will be orocured
uhrouigh international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
Guideliries for Procurement. Domestic or regional preferences in bid evalu-
ation are not applicable as no local tender has been received for the bridge
construction, and other items are not produced locally. Disbursements from
the Loan account will be made on the basis of: the C.I.F. costs of rails,
sleeoers, fastenings, mechanical track maintenance equipment, turn-outs,
freight cars, bogies, snare parts and equipment for a radio-telecommunication
system; the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance to the Borrower;
and, 75 percent of the total cost of the Japoma Bridge (reoresenting the
estimated foreign expenditure component). Disbursement on freight cars will
be subject to completion of satisfactory arrangements for the financing and
delivery of locomotives. (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1.)
Economic Justification
144.      The proposed railway investments represent the least-cost
solution to meeting transport requirements in the Douala-Yaounde corridor
during the remainder of this decade. The economic case for the several
elements of the project is well justified. For the Japoma Bridge, it was
determined since appraisal of the first project that the economic 1osses
that would result from rupture of the existing bridge would be so great
that construction of a new facility was justified immediately.   Although
cost estimates have increased since then, that conclusion remains firm in
view of continuing traffic increases and the railway's vital role in the
economty.  Completion of the track renewal program is now imperative,



- 13 -
with the m,ain benefits being reduced operating and maintenance costs by
avoidance of operating accidents, and increased line capacity of the
critical Douala-Yaounde section. The economic return on this project
item amounts to 12 percent.  The purchase of additional freight cars and
traction power is necessary to meet anticipated traffic requirements;
the return on this investmant amounts to about 16 percent. The cost of
purchasing bogies for existing freight cars would be 50 percent less than
that of new cars, and this item is justified on the basis of this least-
cost solution.  The investment in purchase of a new crane is expected to
yield an economic return of 24 percent derived from savings in time lost
by frequent operating accidents. The overall economic return on the
project, excluding the Japoma Bridge and the bogies, is 13 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORTTY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between Regie Nationale des Chemins
de Fer du Cameroun and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between
United Republic of Cameroon and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section h (iii), of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       Features of the Loan and the Guarantee Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 36, 40, 41 and 42 of this report.
47.       I am satisfied that the propos,3d loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI"
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490  CAMDEV Project:   US$ 11 million Credit of March
28 1967; Closing Date: June 30, 1972 and
US  7 million Loan to CAMDEV of same date;
Closing Date: December -31, 1Q74.
The original planting program of 11,500 ha has been reduced by
eliminating 1,000 ha of tea. Project implementation is satisfactory but
cash funds have been seriously depleted by cost increases due to general
inflation, lower than expected yields from non-project plantings and
excessive overheads. However, Government agreed to implement economy
measures which, coupled with better management and higher commodity prices,
have already improved the CAMDEV cash position.
Ln. No. 593 and Sp Ln. No. 886 Oil Palm Project: US$ 7.9 million Loan to
Sopame of April 15, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976 and US$ 1.7 million
Supplemental Loan of April 9, 1973: Closing
Date:  June 3Z), 1979.
After successful initial implementation significant cost overruns
occurred and it was found that one of the two oil palm estate sites was
unsatisfactory. A substantial part of the cost overrun was due to the
underestimation of price inflation when the project was first appraised.
Following reappraisal in 1972 the project was modified from 9,000 ha to
8,500 ha but estimated Droduction will remain unchanged as higher yields
are now anticipated. The project is now on schedule and proceeding satis-
factorily.
Ln. No. 604 Water Supply Project; US$ 5 million Loan to SNEC of June 2,
190 ; Closing Date-: June _      1974 (intermediate Closin
Dates:  May 31, 1972; September 30, 1972; December 31, 1972).
This oroject was completed ahead of schedule with substantial
savings which have been approved for investment in further water distribu-
tio' works; however, disbursements have lagged due to the strong working
cap-tal position of the borrower and the closing date has been postponed
thrice in order to allow remaining funds to be disbursed.   However, the
Borrower has not used the remaining balance of ITS$ 218,000.
j   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them.. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 161 First Education Pro ect; US$ 10.5 million Credit of September
23, 1969; Closing Date:   December 31  1975 (oriinal closing
date: June 30, _974L
The Project is 12 months behind schedule, due to delays in (i)
selecting the consultants and the specialists for the technical assistance
programs, (ii) reaching agreement on the schedule of accommodation,
(iii) revising the bidding documents, (iv) starting construction works for
which over-priced initial bids had to be cancelled for 16 project items,
(v) awarding contracts, and (vi) completing the lists of equipment.
The project is now progressing satisfactorily. The closing date has been
extended to December 31, 1975 to permit completion of project. It is
forecast that the Project cost will increase by about US$ 1.5 million,
due to the devaluation of the US dollar and the impact of the oil crisis.
Cr. No. 180, Ln. No. 663 Highway Project; US$ 7 million Credit of March
27 1970; Closing Date: December 31 1974 and
US$ 12 million Loan of same date: Closing Date:
December 31, 1974; (original Closing Date:
December 31 1973).
This project had a slow start due primarily to administrative
delays on the part of the implementing ministries. By December 1971, all
construction and consultants contracts were signed and work was proceeding
satisfactorily. However, duwring the 1973 rainy season, some completed
sections, totalling 60 km, of the Ngaoundere-Garoua road failed.    Work was
resumed in November 1973 after the contractor agreed to repair all failures
at his own expense and the Government to improve the design.
Ln. No. 687 Railw      P    ect; US$ 5.2 million Loan to REGIFERCAM of June 9,
-CDate: June 30                1975; (original Closing Date:
June 30, 1974)-
Project execution has been satisfactory for track renewal work
and delivery of motive power and rolling stock. Unforeseen technical
difficulties, such as extremely bad subsoil conditions, made lengthy
studies necessary before selecting the site and the optimum design of
the new railway bridge at Japoma, near DouaLa. Bids were called at the
completion of studies and results showed that funds of Loan No. 687 would
be insufficient to cover the full construction costs of the new bridge,
supplementary financing has been foreseen under the proposed Second Railway
Project. The closing date has been extended to June 30, 1975 to permit
disbursement on Japoma bridge.

Cr. No. 229 Douala Port Project: US$ 1.5 million Credit of January 14,
1971; Closing Date: June_30, 977    intermediate Closing
Dates:  June 30, 1973:  December 31, 1973).
After considerable delay in starting the project, largely because
of time consuming Government procedures involved, the project proceeded
satisfactorily.  Full credit disbursement is now imminent with only $600Q)
undisbursed.
Cr. No. 302 SENMY Rice Project; US$ 3.7 million Credit of Abril 26 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Started in mid-1972, the project is progressing satisfactorily
and the appraisal construction schedule is expected to be maintained.
Disbursements are slightly ahead of appraisal estimates. Following the 1973
U S dollar devaluation, and provision for some additional works and
increased technical assistance, estimated total project costs have increased
by 20 percent. Government and French aid are providing additional funds.
A further review of project costs will be made when firm costs become
available.
Cr. No. 320 Second Education Project; US$ 9 million Credit of June 28,
L972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Due to delays in selecting the consulting architects, the date of
effectiveness specified in the Credit Agreement, October 2, 1972, has had
to be postponed to February 27, 1973. Due to delays in selecting two sites
for the construction of three Project items, the design period has been
extended by six months; however, no extension of the closing date of June 30,
1979 is expected.
Cr. No. 429, Ln. No. 935 Second Highway Project: uS$ 24 million Credit of
September 26, 1973, Closing Date: December 31,
197h and US$ 24 million Loan of same date; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975.
The loan and credit became effective on December 20, 1973. The
bids have been called and the Government is comparing offers which are
significantly above appraisal estimates due to recent price escalations.
Ln. No. 983 Livestock Project: US$ 116 million Loan of May 14, 1974,
Closing Date: June 30, 1950.
The Government is negotiating a contract for recruiting experts
for SODEPA, the project authority.
