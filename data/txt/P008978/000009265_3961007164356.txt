MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Turkey
Power Systems Operations Assistance Proiect (Loan 2602-TU)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Turkey - Power Systems Operations
Assistance Project (Loan 2602-TU) prepared by the Europe and Central Asia Region. The Borrower
contributed Part II of the PCR.
The project objectives were partially met: reliability,.ailability and efficiency of five
power generating plants were improved; reduction of transmission and distribution losses fell short of
targets; the management and technical capability of the Turkish Electricity Authority, TEK, was not
increased since the corresponding training program was never implemented; and control of the peak
power demand was not achieved because the project did not include any component for demand side
management.
The project implementation had a slow start due to a lack of commitment by TEK which
resulted in a very low level of loan disbursement -- only 17% of the US$140 million loan was disbursed
in four years. Without changing the project objectives and as a remedy to accelerate loan disbursement,
procurement of power transformers and transmission equipment costing about US$42 million originally
included in the loan 3345-TU (TEK Restructuring Project), was financed by the loan. At the same time,
some of the project components were canceled. The Bank loan was closed three years later than
originally planned and US$24.5 million was canceled in December 1993.
The PCR could not establish the final project cost, but estimated that the rate of return
of the TEK investment program is about 6%. The project outcome is rated as marginally unsatisfactory
and its institutional development impact as negligible. Since the Government has now split TEK into
separate generation/transmission and distribution companies, the project sustainability is rated as
uncertain because it will depend on the commercial performance of the new companies.
The PCR contains a satisfactory account of the project implementation and results.
No audit is planned.

POWER SYSTEM OPERATIONS ASSISTANCE PROJECT (LOAN 2602-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Power System
Operations Assistance Project in Turkey, for which Loan 2602-TU in the amount of
US$140.0 million was approved on July 2, 1985. The loan was closed on December
31, 1993, three years behind the original schedule. Total disbursements reached
$115.5 million, with $24.5 million in loan cancellations.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry Trade & Finance Division,
Country Department I of the Europe & Central Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III).  Part II of the PCR was prepared by the Borrower
(Turkish Electricity Authority - TEK).
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the President's Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision
reports; project progress reports; correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

POWER SYSTEM OPERATIONS ASSISTANCE PROJECT {LOAN 2602-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          A loan of US$140 million was made to the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) in 1985 with the objective of improving operational efficiency.
The project was the seventeenth Bank group operation in Turkey's power subsector,
and was a continuation of the Bank's assistance, started in 1952, for developing
the subsector and for increasing utilization of indigenous resources. The loan
was guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
Obiectives
2.          The project had five main objectives: (i) to improve the availability
and efficiency of TEK's power generation facilities; (ii) to improve the
reliability of the transmission and distribution systems; (iii) to improve
availability of transmission and distribution facilities by prompt response
intervention to restore service in case of outages, and by the introduction of
hot-line maintenance and outage prevention techniques; (iv) to reduce power
system losses by the judicious application of reactive power compensating
equipment; and (v) to help control peak power demand by means of peak-shaving
techniquee.
Implementation ExDerience
3.          Project implementation proceeded more slowly than originally planned.
Through the first four years of a five year project, disbursements stood at only
17% of planned disbursements.
4.          After the closing date was already postponed once, it was realized
that a large proportion of the loan would remain unutilized because the
implementation time for items not yet procured would exceed three years. This
was addressed by financing certain components, the most important being the
Tuncbilik power plant rehabilitation, with the TEK Restructuring Loan and by
transferring to this loan specific projects from the TEK Restructuring Loan for
which procurement was more advanced. Final loan disbursements reached $115.5
million by April 30, 1994, after several postponements of the closing date
totalling 3 years. Loan cancellations will total $24.5 million.
5.          There were several reasons for the delay. Frequent changes in TEK's
operational management resulted in lack of continuity and commitment for the
Project Implementation and Performance Monitoring Unit. As was the case with
other loans to TEK, there was pressure on TEK's capital resources to give



iii
priority to new investments over the rehabilitation program financed with this
loan.   Moreover,  slow project implementation was also caused by changes in
project scope and the lack of clear relationship between project objectives and
the investment program to be implemented under the project as well as by the
borrower's lack of commitment towards the realization of project objectives.
6.          TEK and the Government did not display the hoped for commitment to
the institutional aspects of the project.  Apart from a pilot program of O&M
training, the training component was never implemented.
Results
7.          Because of the significant delay in loan disbursements and the
subsequent transfer of procurement packages and work contracts between this loan
and 3345-TU, TEK Restructuring Loan, the project did not follow the original
financing plan. However, special equipment and special vehicles which supported
the objective of improved operational efficiency were acquired. In addition,
needed investments to the transmission network, planned for other Bank
operations, were successfully completed under this loan.
8.          The financial performance of TEK and its ability to function as a
viable economic organization were major concerns. Financial management continued
to be poor, and financial targets were not met.  The major factors affecting
TEK's financial performance were inadequate tariff adjustments, increased
investments in generation plants due to non-realization of BOT schemes, and
accelerating inflation and devaluation of the Turkish Lira against major
currencies.
9.    At project appraisal,  the financial rate of return  (FRR),  for TEK's
investment program as a whole, was estimated at 11.2%.  An analysis of TEK's
overall performance data for the project time frame reveals a more likely rate
of return of 6.2%, considerably less than originally forecast.   It should be
noted that the estimates of the FRR are a measure of the financial return on
TEK's overall investments, and it would be very difficult to obtain separate FRR
estimates attributed to this project alone.
Sustainability
10.         The question of sustainability is difficult to answer mainly because
the Government has now split TEK into separate generation/transmission and
distribution companies with the aim of comnercialization/privatization. Thus,
the original objective of upgrading the efficiency of TEK operations now must be
continued by each of the new subsidiary organizations. During the life of the
project, some improvement was achieved relative to the operational performance
goals.



iv
Findings and Lessons
11.         The Bank should strive to maintain some level of staff continuity
from appraisal into initial supervision. None of the staff that appraised the
project participated in any of the subsequent supervision missions.
12.         The lessons to be learned from this lending operation are that
project implementation and institution building efforts will not be successful
unless the Borrower takes charge and there is a firm and continuing commitment
on the part of both the Borrower and the Government to the agreed goals. The
Bank's role in the implementation phase of projects needs to be re-examined and
more emphasis put on supervision missions to be pro-active and utilize the
various leverages that are at their disposal to ensure that projects are on
schedule and obligations fulfilled appropriately.

2. Backaround
2.01     In every year from 1971 through Project Appraisal in 1985, domestic
electricity supply was insufficient to meet demand, resulting in high costs to
the economy, as imports increased and supply interruptions became more frequent.
During the Five Year Plan of 1985-89, priority was to be given to domestic
sources of energy, especially hydro and lignite, in the country's generation
expansion program.One alternative to the construction of new capital facilities
is to improve the reliability and efficiency of existing facilities.  As the
Power System Operations Assistance Project was being formulated, a key
recommendation emerged, namely, that the GOT should accord the highest priority
to upgrading and improving the efficiency with which existing facilities in the
energy sector are currently utilized.
2.02          The salient feature of the Turkish electricity system is that the
largest load centers are located at considerable distances from the main
indigenous energy resources of hydro and lignite. As a result, TEK has also had
to pay special attention to the development and construction of a high-voltage
transmission grid.   Concurrent with the preparation of this loan was the
preparation of Loan 2586-TU, Fourth TEK Transmission Project.   That project
constituted the fourth phase of development of TEK's 380-kV transmission network
and planned for the construction of 800 km of interconnecting high voltage
transmission lines.
3. Prolect Oblectives and DescriDtion
3.01     As a result of the key recommendation to concentrate on operational
efficiency, the five main project objectives were operational in nature tos (i)
improve the availability and efficiency of TEK's power generation facilities;
(ii) improve the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems; (iii)
improve availability of transmission and distribution facilities by prompt
response intervention to restore service in case of outages, and by the



introduction of hot-line maintenance and outage prevention techniques; (iv)
reduce power system losses by the judicious application of reactive power
compensating equipment; and (v) help control peak power demand by means of peak-
shaving techniques.
3.02     The project was to be implemented over five years from 1986-1990 and
essentially had three major components:
(a) provision of tools and equipment for rehabilitation and spare
parts;
(b) analysis of possible operating efficiencies, feasibility study of
a second combined cycle power plant in Thrace, and operational
training; and
(c) conversion of the 630 MW Anbarli steam power station near Istanbul
from fuel oil to dual fuel firing (fuel oil and natural gas).
3.03     The total project cost was estimated at $162.0 million. Of this amount,
$140.0 million was in foreign exchange, and the proposed Bank loan of $140.0
million would finance the full foreign exchange cost. The local cost equivalent
of $22.0 million was to come from TEK's internal cash generation and the
Government's contribution to TEK.   Cofinancing was not considered feasible
because of the nature of the goods and services to be procured.
4.  Proiect Desian and Oraanization
4.01     Design.  The project was designed around the concept that efficiencies
could be realized  from existing  facilities.    Rehabilitation  projects  are
frequently not received with the same enthusiasm as are new capital works
projects, even though the concept is sound.   In many respects, investing in
rehabilitation and efficiency projects can be more cost-effective than an
investment in new facilities.  The project as designed envisioned that there
would be a marked improvement in operating efficiency. For example, increasing
the power factor at the 35-kV level to 0.95 from its then low level of 0.80 would
release about 300 MW of generation capacity under then existing system condition.
This is significant in a sector where annual demand growth has averaged 9% for
a 20-year period.
4.02     Organization.  As implementing agency for the project, TEK planned to
use its own labor forces for installation and rehabilitation work.   Overall
coordination would rest with the Project Implementation and Performance
Monitoring Unit (PIPMU), the creation of which was a condition of the loan's
effectiveness. This unit would report to TEK's Assistant General Manager for
Operations and would monitor the operational performance of the different
components of TEK's power system according to agreed performance goals.
4.03     The PIPMU would receive technical assistance from ELTEM-TEK, a local
engineering consulting firm and a TEK subsidiary.   The use of ELTEM-TEK was
consistent with the condition of effectiveness specified in Article 7.01 of the



-3-
Loan Agreement, namely, that engineering consultants must be engaged. ELTEM-TEK
was functioning in a similar capacity on other Bank loans in the power sector,
and this arrangement had proved satisfactory to both TEK and the Bank.
4.04     Procurement.  The equipment and materials required for the project were
initially grouped into fourteen contract packages.   The proposed procurement
schedule called for completion of tender documents for ten of the packages by the
end of September 1985 and the contracts to be awarded for these same packages by
end of July 1986.
4.05     Training.  Training was an important project component and critical to
the  goal  of  improving  operational  efficiency.    There  were  to be  three
interrelated training activities: (a) overseas training of experienced engineers
in specific operational and maintenance techniques; (b) on-the-job training of
experienced technicians; and (c) overseas and in-country training of transmission
and distribution maintenance crews in hot-line work. The project provided for
an estimated 100 man-years of overseas training in addition to the hot-line
training for maintenance crews.
5. Project Implementation
5.01     Implementation of the project proceeded more slowly than expected at
appraisal. Through the first four years of the project, disbursements were only
17% of planned disbursements. After three extensions of the loan closing date,
the loan was closed on December 31, 1993, three years behind schedule. Total
disbursements under the loan reached $115.5 million on April 30, 1994, or 83% of
the original commitment. Loan cancellation amounts totalled $24.5 million.
5.02     The PIPMU did not function as originally planned.   Although loan
effectiveness was only delayed one month until the PIPMU was established, TEK was
slow in effectively staffing the unit so that the project was behind schedule
from the beginning. After an initial disbursement of $8.0 million in FY86, there
were no further disbursements until FY88, and only $5.5 million were disbursed
in FY89.
5.03     The procurement plan prepared at Appraisal envisioned that the tender
documents for ten contract packages would be prepared in 1985 and would be
approved by the Bank prior to year-end 1985. In reality, only one package was
sent to the Bank for approval in 1985. There were three substantive exchanges
on the bid documents before the Bank's no objection was given, some 10 months
after the package was initially submitted.  On two occasions TEK delayed its
response to the Bank's comments for three months.   The lengthy process for
approving the first package appears to have been an anomaly, because the average
time for approval of the other major packages was 1-3 months.
5.04     As the schedule slipped, as components such as the Anbarli conversion
were cancelled, and as disbursements lagged, this loan was reviewed in the
overall context of TEK investments rather than as a stand alone operation. As
a result, it was agreed in September 1990 to allocate about $42.0 million of this
loan for other transmission projects. In 1992, it was further agreed to transfer



- 4 -
some $22 million in specific contracts   and the loan agreement was amended
accordingly. Principally, contracts for power transformer equipment, from loan
3345-TU, TEK Restructuring, were transferred to this loan because the procurement
process of these contracts were more advanced than that of the originally planned
investments, and could thus be completed within the final closing date. These
transfers and reallocations can be construed to meet the intent of the loan which
was to improve the reliability of TEK's transmission and distribution network.
5.05     In most Bank projects in Turkey, institutional strengthening or training
is an important component. This project provided for an estimated 100 man-years
of overseas training in addition to the hot-line training for maintenance crews.
With the exception of on-the-job training and a pilot O&M training program at
Seyit6mer, it can be said that the training program was never implemented.
6. Project Results
6.01     Although the loan was closed three years behind schedule, the project
was incomplete in its execution, at least when compared to the original project
plan.   While it is normal for projects to undergo corrective changes during
implementation, this project seemed to lack direction and focus. On the positive
side, the transfer of procurement packages or works components between this loan
and the TEK Restructuring Project resulted in important improvements to TEK's
transmission  network.    Some  of the  studies  and  rehabilitation work were
completed, and specialized vehicles and equipment were procured.
6.02     The institutional objectives of the project were not achieved. Although
some training did occur, the comprehensive training program designed to increase
TEK's technical and managerial capability was never implemented.
6.03     The financial performance of TEK and its ability to function as a viable
economic organization were major concerns. Financial management of the operation
continued to be poor. Although accounts receivable collection was improved, the
progress was really minimal and targets were not met. The target ratio 1.0 for
current assets to current liabilities was not met during the life of the loan.
TEK was unable to produce funds from internal sources equal to 35% of the average
incurred capital expenditures during the life of the loan. Inadequate tariff
adjustments coupled with the accelerating inflation and devaluation of the
Turkish Lira against major currencies placed TEK in financial distress and non-
compliance with financial covenants (1986-91). Consequently, the estimated 6.2%
rate of return on the (1986-91) time-slice of the power system's investment
program of which the project was a part falls short of the 11.2% rate of return
estimated at appraisal.  Further, the audit reports on TEK's accounts, which,
since 1988, have been carried out by a private auditor of international repute
(Price Waterhouse) revealed major flaws in TEK's accounts, and the auditors
declined to issue an opinion on them.
6.04     However, under the TRP (June 13, 1991) it was agreed to maintain net
average tariffs in real terms at US$0.06 per Kwh net of taxes, to be adjusted
periodically (monthly as was the case through December 1993). These modifications
along with other measures such as lower investment, improved financial management



and recapitalization of TEK (all of which had a time lag), not only prevented
TEK's financial collapse but also permitted compliance with the financial
covenants in 1993.
7. Bank Performance
7.01     Even though the Bank supervised the project on a routine basis and
identified problems regularly, supervision by the Bank was benign. It was noted
that the Borrower was not meeting the requirements or covenants related to
project implementation. For example, no quarterly progress reports had yet been
submitted through December 1987.
7.02     Although problems in project implementation and schedule slippage were
regularly identified, no plan was developed to either get the project back on
track or to restructure or cancel the loan.  It was not until 1990 that loan
reallocations were made to other specific components of TEK's overall investment
plan.
7.03     Historically procurement slippage has been a problem on projects in
Turkey.  With the exception of the first contract package that consumed nine
months in the approval process, most contract packages were approved in from one
to three months from the time the bid documents were first submitted for review.
7.04     One deficiency on the part of the Bank was the lack of continuity of
staff from Appraisal to Supervision. None of the staff who appraised the project
participated in any of the supervision missions.  As a result, the understandings
achieved with the Borrower regarding the project concept and implementation plan
were most likely lost, or certainly diminished.
8. Performance of the Borrower and Guarantor
8.01     TEK did not commit the resources to make the PIPMU a well functioning
project implementation unit. PIPMU did have the benefit of its consultant ELTEM-
TEK assisting with project implementation.   However, even with this outside
assistance, quarterly progress reports were not prepared until the third year of
the project.
8.02     TEK and the Government did not display the hoped for commitment to the
institutional aspects of the project. Training, which can have positive long
term impacts on the organization's capabilities, was never implemented.
8.03     The financial condition of TEK and the entire power sector was adversely
affected by electricity tariffs which did not reflect the economic cost of
supply, nor fully cover the financial obligations. As a result, TEK was unable
to meet the agreed financial performance targets until the end of project
implementation.
8.04     Although tariffs are not fully in its direct control, TEK should have
taken greater responsibility for those financial decisions that were within its
purview, namely, implementation of financial action plans to address deficiencies



in accounts receivables and foreign debt service, and auditing of financial
statements.
9. Consulting Services
9.01     The  project  plan  called  for  a  foreign  consultant  to  undertake
feasibility studies for rehabilitation of thermal power plants. A contract was
not signed with the selected consultant, Southern Electric International (SEI),
until May, 1988, three years into the project. In addition to the rehabilitation
studies,  SEI was to provide training.   The services provided by SEI were
satisfactory.
10. Findings and Lessons
10.01    The immediately apparent causes of the problems that beset the project
may be summarized as follows: (i) failure to adhere to the project schedule; (ii)
failure to make decisions that would augment project implementation and schedule;
(iii) lack of commitment on the part of TEK's management to the technical
assistance objectives of the project; (iv) lack of a strategy for the development
and deployment of TEK's human resources, and for overcoming the problem of
freeing TEK's middle managers from their day-to-day tasks to enable them to
devote time to improving the structure and organization of their jobs.
10.02    The more fundamental reasons for these deficiencies, however, must be
sought in TEK's lack of appropriately qualified top and middle managers with the
ability and necessary energy and enthusiasm to define and take charge of the
institutional efforts needed to improve the performance of TEK as a whole and of
its administration and financial management in particular. This in turn may be
attributed to TEK's lack of autonomy in establishing its personnel and financial
strategies and, in particular, in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and
staff on a competitive basis.   It has since been recognized by the Turkish
authorities that these problems cannot be overcome without partial or total
transfer of TEK's activities to one or several corporations functioning
independently from the Government and in accordance with normal commercial
principles within a framework of parameters defined by an independent regulatory
authority.   Reforms in this direction have begun to be undertaken in 1993.
10.03    The lessons to be learned from this lending operation are that project
implementation and institution building efforts will not be successful unless the
borrower takes charge and there is a firm and continuing commitment on the part
of both the borrower and the Government to the agreed goals.   Borrowers and
Governments often give undertakings when the fate of the loan seems to depend on
such undertakings, only to lose interest once the project is underway.
10.04    The Bank would be well advised to consider  loan cancellation or
meaningful loan restructuring when a project experiences the delays and lack of
progress that occurred with the Power System Operations Assistance Project.

POWER SYSTEMS OPERATIONS ASSISTANCE PROJECT (LOAN 2602-TUI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1. General
1.01          Implementation of the project moved more slowly than originally
planned. This was in part due to the fact that the beginning years of project
implementation coincided with the period of successive general and municipal
elections and the associated massive turnovers which were experienced in the
management and staff of all governmental agencies as well as within TEK. These
frequent changes had a major impact on the approval and implementation of the
project packages and were the main factors causing delays. Additionally, the
heavy burden of changing economic conditions also prevented TEK from acting as
an independent entity to make its own decisions for investments and recruitment
and even for utilization of internally generated funds.
1.02          Lack of staff continuity within TEK and the Bank itself hampered
efficient coordination of project implementation.    Creation of the Project
Implementation and Performance Monitoring Unit (PIPMU) and the World Bank project
group in 1991 improved and accelerated the coordination and implementation of the
project.
2. Bank's Performance
2.01          During project appraisal errors were introduced in planning of
project packages, and this can be considered as one of the reasons for
implementation delays from a technical point of view. For example, some project
packages, specifically ripple control equipment and modification of the
electrostatic filters at thermal power plants (TPP), were not well defined and
were not economic to implement given the actual state of the energy system and
demand structure of the country.
2.02          TEK emphasizes that there is a need for a better understanding of
the issues and problems prior to and during appraisal so that precise
determination of the project package can be made.
3.  Pro-ect Results
3.01          Although there were substantial changes in the project packages,
the initial main objectives of the project, namely, the improvement and
availability and efficiency of TEK's power generation and the reliability of the
transmission and distribution systems, were not lost.

4. Financial Performance
4.01          The proposed targets for financial performance progressively became
the main philosophy of the TEK Restructuring Project (LN. 3345-TU)even though the
agreed upon financial covenants could not be met until 1993.   However, the
corporate planning introduced under that project has enabled TEK to fulfill its
covenanted obligations.
5. Procurement
5.01          Delays in the procurement packages were caused by the preparation
of the bidding documents which extended beyond the deadlines initially
established.   This was mainly due to (a) the broad range of equipment to be
procured, and (b) the unavoidable and cumbersome bidding procedures which all
public enterprises have to follow. TEK emphasizes that training of TEK staff by
the Bank in regard to procurement procedures at certain intervals will prevent
the delays in the bidding procedures and accelerate project implementation.
6. Consultant services
6.01          ELTEM-TEK performance was satisfactory and its assistance was
valuable in its capacity as consultant in preparing bidding documents and
quarterly progress reports.  TEK wishes to express its desire to continue to
employ ELTEM-TEK as consultant for future World Bank projects.
7. Rehabilitation and Training
7.01          The rehabilitation of Tuncbilek TPP project package was transferred
to the TEK Restructuring Project (LN.3345-TU), and this work still continues.
7.02          Rehabilitation of thermal power plants and relevant training task
was satisfactorily completed by SEI.
7.03          Conversion of Anbarli TPP fuel system to double fuel system was
cancelled because it was found incompatible with TEK's energy production system
within the supply-demand structure of Turkey's economy. Therefore, Anbarli TPP
steam pipes package was eliminated from Loan 2602-TU.
7.04          Computer controlled material management system was established in
Seyitomer TPP. After the procurement of computers for other TPP's using internal
resources, the personnel of very plant have been trained in material management
system concepts. Every power plant now applies a material management system to
control its own stock.
7.05          A preventive maintenance software program was provided as an
accessory to vibration analyzers for Yatagan, Tuncbilik, Soma, and Seyitomer
TPP's, and personnel were trained in the use of the software program. A more
detailed preventive maintenance program is being implemented in the scope of the
OMIP project.
7.06          Mechanical  maintenance,  electric  maintenance  and measurement
control training notes prepared for Seyitomer TPP are applicable for other plants
and using those notes as training infrastructure was prepared by the Training
Department.



- 9 -
7.07           Class notes and training schedules were prepared and implemented
for operation procedures and operation of Seyitomer TPP.  Personnel of other
plants have been trained in procedure preparation, and class notes are available.
Afterwards, every power plant prepared its own procedures under the coordination
of the Training Department.
7.08          Also,  TEK personnel have received training  for each special
equipment procured within the context of the loan.

C. Operational Impact
(a)      Power Plants
At Appraisal, a set of performance monitoring guidelines were agreed to.
However, during project implementation TEK decided to change its monitoring
procedure following ACI standards. As a result, five power plants were selected
for monitoring within the context of rehabilitation under the loan.

* Note: The Tuncbilik power plant rehabilitation is to be financed under Loan No. 3345-TU instead of Loan
No. 2602-TU. Since the contract was signed in 1993, the performance monitoring estimates are only
preliminary.
