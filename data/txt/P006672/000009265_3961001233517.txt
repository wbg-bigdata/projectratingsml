MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CE ELE
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND HOSPITAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$27 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years, including 4
years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate and charges.  The
Government of Chile (0OCH) would be the Borrower and the Ministry of Health
(NOR) would be the executing agency.
2.        Backaround.  The promotion of social justice with macroeconomic
stability and growth is the centerpiece of the Chilean Government's
development agenda. President Aylwin assumed office in early 1990 with a
platform focussed on poverty alleviation without undermining the economic
growth momentum. The Government has maintained economic policies consistent
with an open, market economy, promoting the private sector as the main engine
of growth. Productive activities are diversifying rapidly, as Chile reduces
its earlier dependence on natural resource extraction, increases the
international competitiveness of its exports, and develops its service sector.
Within the strictly guarded constraints of a balanced fiscal budget, the
public sector has started to improve the quality and efficiency of key social
programs as a means to assure access of the less privileged to select basic
needs, particularly health and education services.
3.        Chile's social development over the last three decades has been
impressive.  While Chile's GNP per capita of US$2,130 in 1990 places it among
lower-middle-income countries, its social indicators are comparable to those
in developed countries. Average life expectancy at birth is 72 years, the
infant mortality rate is 17/1,000, and lese than 1 percent of children under
six suffer from moderate or severe malnutrition. This situation reflects
several decades of strong commitment to social welfare by successive
governments of widely disparate political philosophies. Sustained public
investments in maternal and child health care and food supplementation
programs, basic education and potable water and sanitation have played a major
role in health improvements. In the 1980., Chile introduced sector reforms
that aimed to redefine the role of the state, decentralize primary health care
responsibilities to the municipalities, promote privatization, and target
health and nutrition expenditures to low-income groups. Despite these
efforts, serious imbalances and resource use inefficiencies continue to
constrain health sector productivity, efficiency, and service quality.
4.        The Chilean health system has been slow in responding to a changing
epidemiological profile characterized by a prevalence of chronic diveases and
injuries associated with an aging population. This emerging demand for more
complex care will further strain the sector's scarce resources. Moreover,
problems exist with health services quality and resource use efficiency.
Major problems include the lack of complementarity between the distinct levels
of care; low internal efficiency in service delivery, particularly within the
public hospital network; distortions in pricing and in the pattern of health
services utilization resulting from the mode of financing health services; and



limitations in the institutional and manpower capability of the MOB and its
autonomous agencies. Moreover, numerous municipalities lack the
administrative iad financial capacity to provide adequate primary care.
Overall, relatively scarce public resources for the sector need to be
complemented by a stronger private sector participation, if basic health
service needs of the undarserved population and emerging health needs of an
aging population are to be met.
5.        Imbalances in health facility investments also existed in the past
decade. Sector investments, supported by foreign-financed projects, were
mainly channelled to the expansion and updating of the primary health care
network. Thete investments emphasized the establishment of physic&l
infrastructure without matching efforts to improve the technical capacity of
health facilities. Ongoing sector projects are expected to meet the estimated
primary health care investment requirements for the next five years.
Meanwhile, maintainance expenditures and new investments in the public
hospital network practically came to a halt in the 1980's. The consequent
physical plant deterioration and equipment obsolescence particulary of
secondary care facilities have resulted in their inefficient use, inadequate
backup for primary care, and dependence on emergency care at the tertiary
level hospitals. The severely deteriorated public hospital facilities,
aggravated by the 1985 earthquake and the 1988 flood, now pose health and
safety hazards and result in inadequate care.
6.        To overcome the above problems, the Government is striving to
define a package of critical reform measures with the assistance initially of
a Bank Project Preparation Facil_ty (PPH) Advance of US$750,000. A major
objective is to achieve a balance in the public health care delivery system,
continuing its traditional focus on maternal and child health care while
responding more effectively to the changing adult health needs. Cognizant of
serious fiscal constraints, however, the Government is resolved to increase
the efficiency in the use of existing resources; provide incentives for cost-
savings; delegate most decisions on resource allocation to local levels; and
stimulate the increased participation of the private sector in the financing
and delivery of health services.
7.        The systemwide reforms are expected to increase efficiency and
technical capacity in health facilities at all levels cf the system to resolve
health problems. Promotion of primary health care would continue to be a high
priority supported by facility investments financed principally by the Inter-
American Development Bank (para. 5). These activities would be complemented
by investments to improve the deteriorated infrastructure of secondary- and
tertiary-care facilities. Some of these rehabilitation needs are urgent and
small-scale, and thus could be addressed while the Government is elaborating
critical reforms. Hence, the Government has vi;iuested lmmediate assistance
from the Bank for the most critical hospital rehabilitation needs in
Metropolitan Santiago, in parallel with technical assistance for the on-going
development of vital sector reforms and the definition of the overall
investment requirements for eight Health Service Areas in the country.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank would support the
Government's objective to develop a responsive and efficient health sector.



The Bank's msajor role, apart from provision of investment financing per jse,
would be to encourage the Government to forge ahead with its goal to analyze,
pilot test, and subsequently fully implement critical policy and institutional
changes, which are also germane to health sector development in many other
middle-income and developed countries. The reforms sought in the Bank
operations would seek to improve the efficiency and quality of se.vices from
the primary to the tertiary care level. The reforms could also serve as a
framework for the involvement of other donors in the sector.
9.        The proposed project (TAHRP), the Bank's first lending operation in
Chile's health sector, is in line with the overall country assistance strategy
to alleviate poverty within a tightly-managed fiscal policy. It also
constitutes the first stage in the Bank's assistance for the sector. Through
this opsration, the Bank would support the develoomen%. of critical policy
reforms while assisting the Government to attend to the Immediate hospital
rehabilitation needs in Metropolitan Santiago. Subsequently, the Bank plans to
support a follow-up policy-based irvestment operatica (a possible Health
Sector Reform Project, HSRP) which could assist in the imulementation of
policy and institutional reforms and finance investment requirements for the
mt:dernization of health services delivery in Metropolitan Santiago,
Antofagasta and Llanchipal. In essence, a portion of the TAHRP would finance
the preparation phase of the HSRP, expanding the PPF (para. 6) which is
currently financing the initial phase of the policy and institutional reform
studies.
10.       The proje4t's support for the most urgent rehabilitation needs of
the public hospital system in Metropolitan Santiago would help strengthen:
(a) the delivery of secondary and tertiary care services and, thus, their
complementary role to primary care services; and (b) the responsiveness of the
health care system to the changing needs of the Chilean population. The
Bank2s assistance to public hospitals in Metropolitan Santiago would benefit
largely the indigent and low-income population as these are the major clients
of the public hospital system. In addition, these hospitals cater to low-
income patients referred from other regions of the country. The improvement
of public hospital facilities and services would be accompanied by planned
improvements in cost recovery (a study being financed under the Technical
Assistance component) to be agreed between the Bank and the Government. Thus,
the project would help minimize the risk of derailment of the preparation and
subsequent pilot testing of complex sector reforms by assisting the Government
to respond promptly to the mounting pressure to upgrade the most glaring
hospital problems in the populous marginal areas of Metropolitan Santiago.
Other donor3 (primarily the IDB) are also involved in similar hospital
rehabilitation operations in other regions of tne country.
11.       Proiset Objectives.  Primary project objectives are:  (a) to assist
the Government in developing and launching critical policy and institutional
reforms aimed at Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of service
delivery, financing, health labor market incentives, strategic planning and
management, and procurement and quality assurance of pharmaceuticals and food
supplements; (b) to help improve the quality of hospital services in
Metropolitan Santiago by ijitiatig the rehabilitation and upgrading of
selected facilities and equipment; and (c) to facilitate the decentralization



- 4 -
of decision-making and resource manaSgement by delegating to the Health Service
Areat (HSAs) and hospital managers/staff the needs analysis, as well as the
execution of hospital reha',ilitation subprojects under their respective
jurisdictions. Thus, this first health project will address a modest slice of
the hospital rehabilitation investment needs in parallel with the elaboration
and pilot-testing of critical sector reform., as well as the definition of the
overall health facility investment requ'rements for Metropolitan Santiago,
Antofagasta, and Llanchipal to be proposed for subsequent HSRP financing.
12.       Project Description.  The project would support the above
objectives by financing the following components:  (a) Technical Assistance
(about 14 percent of total project costs), which would consist of: (i) about
12 policy/institutional reform and infrastructure investment studies, covering
diagnostic and implementation design stagest and (ii) pilot testing of key
reforms (the Pilot Implementation Program), as well as the start-up phase of
the information system, training, and information dissemination workshops.
The technical assistance component is the centerpiece cf the proposed
operation, since the studies, pilot tests, and start-up operations address the
tore of the sector's major efficiency problems; (b) Hospital Rehabilitation
Proaram (about 80 percent of total project cost), which would finance urgent
small-scale rehabilitation needs at 17 hospitals for both Type 1 (high
complexity, including all specialties, with catchment area of over 500,000)
and Type 2 (intermediate-level technology offering most medical and surgical
specialties, with catchment area of over 100,000) in six HSAs in low-income
areas of Metropolitan Santiago. Financing of the hospital rehabilitation
subpr,jects would be allocated using a demand-driven mechanism: subprojects
would be proposed by the hospitals through their respective HSAs. These would
be reviewed and approved by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in conjunction
with the Ministry of Planning using selection criteria agreed with the Bank.
The HSAs would implement the subprojects; the PCU would be responsible for the
periodic monitoring and review of implementation progress. The delegation of
the needs analysis and execution of the hospital subprojects to the HSAs would
serve as inservice training for resource allocation decisions at the local
level; (c) Protect Administration (abcut 6 percent of total project cost),
which would support the PCU's coordination of project implementation,
provision of technical assistance to HSA staff, and continuation of the
preparation of a proposed follow-up operation.
13.       The project would be implemented over a four year period.  The
total project cost is estimated at US$45.3 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$15.6 million (34.4 percent of the total cost). The
Bank loan of US$27.0 million would finance about 70 percent of total project
cost net of taxes and duties. The Government of Japan, through the Japanese
Grant Pacility, would contribute about US$700 thousand. Retroactive financing
of up to US$2.7 million (10 percent of the loan) would be granted for
expenditures incurred after July 15, 1991. A breakdown of project costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.

14.       Implementation Arranaements.  The Borrower would be GOCH.  MOB
would be responsible for overall implementation. Six USAs in Mecropolitan
Santiago would implement the hospital rehabilitation subprojeats. The
preparation of the reform studies and the pilot testing of some
recommendations would be coordinated by the PCU.
15.       Agreed Actions.  The Government furnished the Bank a copy of
(a) Ministerial Resolution No. 1366 dated October 29, 1991 which adopted the
ecommendations of the Study on the Reorientation of the Health Care System to
serve as a framework for future investmentri in the sector; (b) Ministerial
Resolution Nos. 2087 and 1317 dated December 31, 1990 P-i August 29, 1991,
respectively, creating the PCU and naming a Project Coo._inator;
(c) a first-phase Training Plan of the MOH, HSA and hospital directors and
staff; (d) a final draft of the PCU Operation Manual and the NSA
Implementation Manual detailing the technical norms and the administrative,
budgetary, procurement, and disbursement procedures HSAs will follow; (e) a
draft of the Subsidiary Agreement between the MOB and the HSAs and the
specific subproject agreement to be signed between the MOR and the BSA for
each subproject; and (f) detailed project auditing procedures.
16.       Atreements were reached that the Government would, among others:
(a) complete the specific studies, review with the Bank the corresponding
recommendations, and carry out as appropriate the measures agreed with the
Bank by the dates in the Action Plan; (b) S,bmlt a specific list of
investments eligible for financing under the loan for the Pilot Implementation
Program no later than June 15, 1992; (c) carry out an Action Plan Status
Review by July 30, 1992; (d) apply the selection criteria for the hospital
rehabilitation subprojects as agreed with the Bank; and (e) carry out a Mid-
term Review by June 30, 1993 to evaluate, among others, the implementation
progress of the rehabilitation works, the required changes, if any, in the
selection criteria, and the absorption, as appropriate, of some of the PCU
functions by the MOH. For Loan effestiveness, the Bank would require that:
(a) the Japanese Grant Agreement be signed by the Government and the Bank, or
an alternative arrangement satisfactory to the Bank would have been made by
the Government to finance the appropriate project components; and (b) the PCU
Operational Manual and the lSA Implementation Manual be adopted by the
Government. The signing of an umbrella Subsidiary Agreement and a speeific
subproject agreement between the MOB and the USA, with terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement for each
subproject.
17.       Benefits and Risks.  The project has started to generate benefits
even at the preparation stage. It has helped the Government adopt some maior
policy guidelines as well as stimulated public debate on the emerging
recommendations of some of the above mentioned studies. The elaboration of
reforms, coupled with the initial investments for the most pressing hospital
rehabilitation needs, would initiate the process of achieving increased
efficiency of resource use in the public sector, improving quality at all
levels of care, enhancing the ability to resand to new health challenges, and
increasing equity of access to health care services through a better
definition and fulfillment of the respective roles of the public and private
sector in health care financing and delivery.



- 6 -
18.       The major risks includes  (a) the complexity of most reforms,
especially in health financing; (b) the long-term horizon of the sector
reforms, most of which would be fully im.'lemented either near the end of the
current government's tenure or during the next administration; and (c) lack of
project implementation experience, especially of the HSAs and hospital
managers. These risks would be minimized by the: (a) Dank's direct
involvement and close supervision of the elaboration of the proposed reforms;
(b) pilot testing the critical recommendations to ensure a feasible design;
(c) ample public discussions of the proposed reforms to ensure broad
consensus; (d) Mid-term Project Review to evaluAte overall implementation
progress and completion of the Action Plan; and (e) technical assistance and
supervision that will be provided by the PCU to the HSA., as well as the
training under the project. Also, the project design has considered the
lessons learned in Bank- and other donor-financed health projects, emphasizing
a phased approach and built-in flexibility to carry out complex reforms and to
meet the medium-term investment requirements of the health sector.
19.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed lcan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
